Ah, shit! Here we go again.
Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. You've been at Book Siding this evening, but I've been watching Opening Night Live, the Geoff Keighley thing. Have you seen any of the reveals or trailers that came out of it?
There are a few highlights in there.
I started watching the first 20 minutes of it while I wolfed down a Schwartz Brothers burger, and basically it just felt like Endless Call of Duty. And now I'm recording this podcast. Endless Call of Duty followed by Souls, like who could have guessed?
I was trying to think of my own personal highlights that came out of it. There was that game Unbeatable looks pretty fun, which is a PlayStack published game, I believe, that got a release date. There was a Batman game that's basically like the best of all the different Batman games, but with what looks like Arkham Combat in it.
Yeah, that was the last thing I saw actually and thought that looked okay. Had a joke about Bane stepping on a Lego brick.
Yeah, Bane played by Matt Berry.
Oh, was it?
So that was good, yeah. I thought Resi looked the same pretty much as it did in June. Onimusha looking really good, looking forward to that.
Some of my colleagues have played Capcom's line up and their coverage will be live by the time this episode is live. They were saying that across Resi, Pragmata and Onimusha, the line up just absolutely slaps.
So, Capcom just on a hot streak. There was also Dawn of War 4, which I know is very important to you as a huge orc knobs guy. I know that's a big thing for you.
So, all they really got to do is make Dawn of War 1 again with nicer graphics and add some of the new factions and units they've put into 40k over the years. I think it will go down really well. But somehow Relic managed not to do that itself, but now it's in the hands of someone else.
This is the RTS chapter, Matthew. Absolutely not.
But Relic, have they uncoupled from Sega? Is that what's happened?
Yes. What happened with them is similar to what happened with Amplitude, where they got bought and then they were working together for a long time. And then I think maybe they just had a game, a piece that went bust, that didn't do as well as they wanted it to.
Like Company Heroes 3, it's broken away and they've remastered Dawn of War 1, which people seem to be buying in droves, so good for them. But I cannot make this appealing to you, Matthew, it's Dawn of War.
I thought I'd ask you a question that you could answer, thus showing your knowledge on this particular topic. I can ask Tick, Objective Complete.
I feel like I saw about nine trailers for World of Tanks in that live stream. It might just be like the games are all very similar, but I swear there was one bit where he said, Wargaming, you know them for tanks, planes and something else, but you've never seen them do this and then it was more tanks. I must be hallucinating.
I must have been watching this live stream for too long. Nonetheless, that's my highlight of ONL Matthew, the tank hallucinations. And now we come back to the podcast, which this week is all about Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
This is the second in a sort of a regular series we've been doing, building up to the release of GTA 6, where we're going to play most of the Grand Theft Auto series, not all of it probably. We already did GTA 3 with Steve Burns back in 2021, and the original Definitive Edition came out in a form that people didn't seem to like. I don't really mind it that much.
But they've since given the entire trilogy a big old facelift and they're in pretty good shape as we discussed on the Vice City episode that we did for patreon.com/backpagepod a few months back. This episode though, entirely self-contained, all about San Andreas. We'll follow the structure of that episode a little bit, got some of the same stuff to discuss.
But a more expansive game and a really interesting game to get into. Me and Matthew, we both finished this game in the past week.
I've got to say, I'm enjoying this project, Matthew, despite the games being monstrously long. Are you enjoying the idea of building this little canon of BackpagePod episodes, a bit like we have with Metal Gear, where we have the definitive episode of each game? Do you feel good about that?
Yeah, I think so. There's not many series which are big enough or just sort of wedged in the imagination of gamers enough that it's necessarily worth doing them all in this detail. Imagine being…
The Canaan Rinse guys do this every week. That's just crazy. I just can't imagine it anyway.
I'd run out of observations.
We can do like three or four of these a year.
Yeah, we have to do lots of bullshit in between basically to empty out the bucket of nonsense and then we can go back to do one of these in pristine condition.
But yeah, yeah, a good project. As I've said several times, I just can't really play games these days unless I've got like a reason to, you know, unless there's kind of, you know, a gun to my head, which is just an offshoot of covering games all these years. I've just connected them with work and deadlines.
So actually forcing myself to just came through GTA San Andreas is probably the only way I was ever gonna get through that game again. I say again, finished it for the first time actually. So same.
Yeah. And also I feel like when we do cover GTA 6, which is going to be the story of next year, whether you like it or not, I don't know. I feel like having all this fresh knowledge will make for a really great informed stretch of coverage, you would hope.
Yeah.
Because playing these games, Vice City and now San Andreas has revealed to me how little I actually remember of things and how much things are colored by time and age, I guess. So yes, a good project.
Yeah, absolutely. And we've got GTA 4 to come probably early next year or at the very end of this year, one of those two.
Yeah, I'm dreading that one.
I think that will take probably about as much time as this one did, to be honest. But you don't have all of the quality of life niceties. I think they do have actual checkpoints in that one, though.
So it's not quite as... It's not like this version of San Andreas, as we'll discuss. They put some checkpoints into it to make it easier to play these days.
And GTA 4, I think, was the first time they did checkpoints properly for that game. So that will help a little bit.
I thought the thing in GTA 4 was if you really did a mission, you might get some alternate dialogue while you did the long drive over.
There might be a bit of that, but I mean…
I swear that was a thing. So it wasn't like you don't have to do a drive again. You have to do it again, but, you know, frickin…
I can't think of a single character. Dwayne?
Brucie. Yeah, Dwayne's also a character. Playboy X.
Yeah, I've played through the opening stretch of GTA 4 in… Basically when we got the… When I got the Xbox Series X a few years ago, because it's one of the nicest games to run on there.
Yeah, it's almost feels like a generational leap. It's so spectacular looking with the frame rate boost and increased resolution. But yeah, there's…
I don't think I finished it since 2009, which is when I played through… I played through PS3 in 2008, then 360 in 2009 for some reason. The reason was that nothing better to do, but…
I was lonely.
I agree. I think it's going to lead up to some really good GTA 6 episodes from us next year. And I obviously I can't wait for that.
But yeah, so San Andreas, I mean, I think the key context to set with this game is just to underline what a monster it was in terms of features, scale and ambition compared to all other PlayStation 2 games. Comes out in 2004, end of 2004, and it's a true one of one. It's a game you can only make when you've had monstrous success behind you.
It's a step up. Games can never really offer people again. And it's a step up that GTA can never really offer people again.
It's going from one city to three cities with countryside in between, being able to fly around the map in new types of vehicles, a jetpack, RPG elements, loads of different...
You love the jetpack.
I do love the jetpack. All kinds of stuff they just couldn't do before. But there's a lot more to San Andreas, a lot more to separate San Andreas, I think, from Vice City and 3 than I realized.
Going back to it, we'll discuss that. But San Andreas is extraordinary. It rewrites the course of popular games forever.
It's so massive. I think it sells something like five million more than Vice City did. And it sets expectations about what GTA is, that arguably put GTA 4 in its shadow, as we'll discuss when we get to that episode.
I obviously love GTA 4, but this game is like the... I think it's sort of like if you could... If you told a teenager to decide the ideal GTA game, a lot of what's in this...
You know, circa 2002 after playing Vice City. A lot of what's in this, I think, is what they come up with. It's a real everything kind of game.
So lots to talk about. Matthew, what do you remember about San Andreas before it came along? Do you remember much about the hype cycle?
Because I didn't follow up the build up to this one as closely as Vice City.
Obviously a story that was being told, you know, in PlayStation magazines, which I wasn't really reading. So if you were a loyal Nintendo guy, you know, you knew the game was coming. I'm not going to say I didn't know it was coming, but I wasn't following it as much.
I was at university when this came out, and those were just strange years for not placing games at the heart of my personality and like friendship groups. You know, I was very much a film guy, and I felt like my interest in this and research into San Andreas, like just reading anything I could read about it online, for example, it was quite like a private enthusiasm. Like I don't feel like I could have turned to any of my close friends and been like, you know, apparently there's a Bigfoot and they would have given a shit.
So yeah, it was just kind of like I knew this absolute monster was coming. It was definitely triggering, you know, all these sort of disbelief, I guess, in the brain at the size they were pitching. And I don't think the size necessarily like came into kind of perfect kind of clarity until quite late on.
You know, there were lots of sort of rumours about, oh, it's going to be this, it's going to be that. And then actually it's kind of like everything that was rumoured kind of all at once is the general vibe. But yeah, I mean, you know, I'd probably liken it definitely to, you know, before I played it, like reading the reviews when like hype was at its most exciting, getting that same thing that I got from reading like Shenmue reviews in Games Master and thinking, oh, they've done it.
You know, they've built the whole world. Like you can drive out the city and there's a forest? What?
You know, like I just couldn't believe it. I thought that that's what I wanted to see was like what's between the cities. My God, these most mad men, they've built the whole world.
And that was incredibly exciting, but just an excitement I couldn't share with anyone. Just sort of quietly sort of vibrating with excitement.
Yeah, this is the exact period that I tuned out Games as well and didn't have the same look. I wasn't reading OPM at the time anymore. I had sort of, for whatever reason, in 2004, I just got a bit more into sort of my TV watching.
And maybe I was still submerged in watching Buffy stuff around this time. There's a bit of that to it. And that kind of whole universe of cultish teen shows, that was sort of my preoccupation for a while that, oh, I'm forgetting the one massive thing, comic books.
Comic books became a huge thing for me in late 2004, when this game came along. That was when I first read Batman Year One. And so I was tuned into all of that stuff instead of this.
So I was reading Watchmen instead of playing San Andreas. And I think part of that for me is I felt like I missed out because my parents wouldn't get me Vice City. I felt like I'd missed out on that a little bit.
It no longer felt like it was my thing quite as much, I guess, which I realize is ridiculous. It is interesting to read the build up to it from some of the materials at the time, though. There's a good Game Informer reveal piece from the time, very kind of like classic flat pack preview from Game Informer.
But how's that thing where there's a certain point where Rockstar becomes this monolith that never speaks to anyone, or does one interview in a blue moon. And here you've got quite a lot of Dan Howser just out there talking about the game, sort of almost straight away in this cover feature, which I believe did blow the doors off the game to a large extent. This was in the era of the Game Informer cover feature being how you reached everyone.
San Andreas is not a city, it's a state. Probably the most interesting thing you need to think about for a second is that we're not setting the game in a version of Los Angeles or San Francisco or Las Vegas, but in all three and with the countryside in between. And then after that, the writers are like, let that sink in for a minute because that is what the leap is.
It's like, however big I think anyone would have guessed San Andreas would be, I doubt many people would have expected it to be three cities and for those cities to be comparable in scale to Liberty City in Gta 3 or Vice City in Gta Vice City. I think it's just kind of monumental as a leap up. And even though I still, for whatever reason, psychologically don't feel like each individual city is as big as either of those two cities from those games, they're close enough.
It felt like a real place at the time in this really impressive way.
I quite enjoyed reading that article. It's interesting to say about them locking down because there's just so much like swagger, there's so much kind of cockiness in it. And as a voice, they definitely, when they don't say anything, they've got this mysterious allure to them.
And back then, there's, like, it's amazing and it's an achievement you can be cocky about. But like, there is a slight obnoxiousness to the tone. You know, there's a lot of like, a lot of bleeps out swears because obviously Game Informer doesn't write swear words at the time, you know, I guess ever.
But it feels like, you know, the interviewees know that. So they're really kind of like, you know, everything's, oh, yeah, and it's going to blow your fucking mind and you haven't seen nothing fucking yet. And all this kind of stuff.
And you're like, oh, man, it's, I don't know, pat that in.
Well, it's just funny because Gta 4, its marketing was so pompous compared to this. But in a way that I think was earned by how good the game was. But it was very much like, you know, that first trailer with Niko Bellic was, life is complicated.
I've killed people, smuggled people. And it's very much like, we're making a Scorsese movie here. Whereas, yeah, you're right.
Like, Howser said some interesting stuff in this. Like, there's a bit where they talk about famous voice actors in, you know, in the series. And, because there's some mention, I saw elsewhere, of Dan Howser, I think, couldn't get Ray Liotta's other roles out of his head when having Tommy Versetti in the game.
So, I think they didn't want to cast a famous person for the lead character in this game. But, in doing so, takes a shot at one of the NAF Bond games from the time. So, we've done some really interesting stuff, but I'll be honest with you, I don't want to talk about it, because it's actually annoying, Howser commented.
We started doing that stuff, and now other people are selling games on the back of the fact they've got Heidi Klum or someone in the game, which I find ridiculous. We're not going to put a famous voice in just because it's a famous voice. We're going to get someone who sounds wicked for the character.
And if they're not famous, it doesn't bother us at all. Because I don't even think that is the talent. I think the talent is the people who make the games.
The guys at Rockstar North are the stars of this thing. We've never sold a game on the back of the fact that this or that person is in it. And yet you would never, ever catch Rockstar saying anything like that after this point, I would say, like that's it's basically I think after this, it feels like did like someone come in with a new strategy because yeah, like that is completely gone.
And it's yeah, the monolith kind of replaces it until really Red Dead Redemption 2 comes out. Then I think they start letting people talk about their work on social media and things like that. But yeah, for a long time, Rockstar was this unknowable, you know, does not talk about its own games or comment on other people's games or comment on culture.
And you know, you maybe get one Dan Hauser interview per game that releases. It's very, so different, you know, so.
Yeah, there's a little bit of exaggeration, sort of Peter Molyneux style in there. The bit that jumped out to me and I'm like, unless I've just missed this whole portion of the game, he's talking about like the Los Venturas, which is like Las Vegas. And he says, oh, you run a casino that you bought and built.
And I was like, do you? Is that true? I don't think that's true.
And not even if you like squint at the missions, can you pretend to own a casino?
No, no, it's sort of like as close as you get is you, yeah, you go to two casinos and then-
You go to a casino. When I go to a place, I don't imagine that I own it. I don't own the Sainsbury's in Bath, but I have been to a lot.
You've reviewed it on Google, but you don't own it.
No, I don't own it. No, I've owned them in a review, but that's very different.
It made me wonder if maybe that, because this game was made in two years, right? Were they still cutting features right up until the end? Oh, yeah.
Or maybe a feature like that is something which can be made or removed in like a week. So, why not say it?
Yeah, back then, maybe. I also just pictured Rockstar PR fuming as they read Last Ventura with two Rs.
Oh, yeah. That jumped out at me as well.
I would have expected a phone call or an email about that. Yeah. So, that's funny as well.
That's funny as well. Really interesting, funny screenshots in there as well. There's one of fat CJ in front of the doughnut shop, where you just see the juvenile Rockstar elements in there.
But yeah, actually a really interesting artifact, that feature. Properly from the days when a feature would blow a game wide open in that very particular way. According to the Wall Street Journal at the time, this game had a budget of under $10 million.
I mean, imagine such a thing. Gta 4 reportedly cost more than 10 times that. So I mean, yeah, just a different world really.
So Matthew, when did you discover San Andreas? And what was your experience with it? How close did you get to finishing it?
I can tell you exactly where I got to, which in my head was quite far along, but actually isn't far along at all. I don't think I got much beyond San Fierro, to be honest, and I attached a lot of that to the incredible difficulty of the Zero Missions, which are optional, which I now realise are optional. But at the time, whether I just didn't understand the game or I missed something or I hadn't triggered something, like that's all I remember having to do was the Zero Missions, and I couldn't do them.
This for people who haven't played the game are three optional missions where you help a guy who owns a remote controlled car shop and all his missions are about warring with a rival store, and I'd say they're like three of the most notorious difficulty spikes on PS2 in a row. Definitely. Well, we can get into the individual missions later, but if I did get further than that, that was so traumatizing.
That's really all I remember from the game. I remember being in Los Santos, escaping, it all going wrong there, escaping to the countryside, making it to another city where a guy who ran a toy shop became a huge progress blocker, and that is like, I'm pretty sure that is the Gta San Andreas story for me, because so much of this, I was like, I don't remember this. Like, if I've played this, my brain really has gone, so I can just assume I hadn't played it.
Yeah. Did you click at the time that it was to buy us some Arrested Development playing Zero? Did that, did you make that connection?
It would have been the same time that I was obsessed with Arrested Development, but I don't think so. In that, again, I noticed it this time around. This time around, there was a lot of like, oh, that's so and so.
And yeah, I don't know. I think I was playing it quite casually. Again, it was at university.
I hadn't got a lot of money, you know, you don't when you're a student. And so it was a bit of a risky purchase, but I definitely wanted it. And yeah, I just remember the anger of it.
And that's in my head is like, I just remember the whole thing is like a notorious motherfucker. And like really nothing more than that.
Yeah. And do you know what? My experience with it is not dissimilar.
I did get to Las Venturas when I originally played it. Well, there's two phases of this. I bought it on PS2 in about mid 2005.
I wasn't 18 yet, but the old VESA Electron on Amazon trick works just fine. And take that John Law, fuck you, BBFC.
So I played it, and honestly, I didn't quite have the patience for the very early stages of it. And I immediately looked up, what is the cheat to spawn in a military jet? So I want to fly one of those across this map.
Did that, and I would say didn't seriously play the game again for quite a while until I got to Imagine. And when Gta 4 was announced, the week that I started at Imagine in March 2007. And so after that, on the PS3 that I bought from Darren Jones that broke after a year, Darren Jones, the editor of RetroGamer, no Darren, I don't blame you for it.
I'm not taking you to court or anything if you're listening to this.
And if it is a court, it will be Games Court, so you'll be fine.
Yeah. And I played through to Last Venturis, the mission where the mafia guy is strapped to the front of the car. But I remember, I gave up on the zero missions because I worked out, unlike you, that they were optional.
And I did, but I did destroy a PS3 controller after failing that turret one. I will own up to that. A pricey tantrum that was.
But it was so comically infuriating that finishing the mission in its very balked form in this playthrough felt like a bit of catharsis. And then I think that's when the PS3 broke and it took my save with it. And so I was never ever going to replicate that progress again unless we got to the point where they brought the PS2 Gtas to modern formats, which has obviously happened now.
So it was sort of lost forever. But I was making such glacial progress with it. I remember being stuck on Catalina's race mission in the middle of the countryside for quite a while.
Oh, I love that one. It's like, you were award for doing it. You now have to do it again, but backwards.
Yeah. So I remember being like genuinely amazed by what they had accomplished, because you couldn't not be. Playing this again now, actually, got me thinking about how games will just never again be able to impress people with these leaps in the way that they were.
That will no longer be something in gaming's pocket to show you something visually that you've never seen before.
Didn't you just throw loads of bombs at giant fruit in Donkey Kong Bonanza?
Well, and I did pick up bits of beef mince and chuck those.
A high five to Crystal Eel?
Yeah, that's true.
Sounds like a way of euphemism, isn't it?
Yeah, I heard that fucking elephant song over and over again. It's wedged in my brain. I got PTSD from that.
That's something I never thought would happen to me in video games, and it has, but yeah, so I just, oh man, I kind of feel bad for kids who will never be able to experience this kind of leap where you go from Vice City like, oh wow, I can see the city from the sky, which I couldn't do in Gta 3 unless I got a fucking dodo plane, to not only can I see this from the sky, I can speed across the map and the map is basically like a state, like Dan Howser said, like it's almost like going across a country or something, and like, oh man, it was intoxicating to see those leaps each time. It was so particular to that era of 3D gaming, because the visual fidelity of the game obviously is what it is. I do think the game's got a beautiful art style, that kind of cartoonish, sort of slight defamation to the characters that make it fit that world, so it's not totally realistic, but they're not, but at the same time, like you can see there's a stylized process to all the different color choices, like how the weather looks and across different times of the day, what Los Santos looks like versus San Fierro, et cetera.
It feels like you never get the same blue light that you get in San Fierro, in Los Santos. It feels like you're always getting that smoggy kind of like, you know, baking heat of LA, and San Fierro just feels a bit different. Every decision like that, just super impressive.
So, yeah, at the time, I was like, I was impressed by it, but yeah, got completely stalled. And I think it was just a lot of it was down to difficulty. And now having got to the end of this, I wonder if I ever would have finished the PS2 version, even if I had limitless time, because there are so many roadblocks to get there, especially back in the with the PS2 version of this game, with its lack of checkpoints and lack of maybe little tweaks the developers have made to make it less of a motherfucker over time.
Yeah, 100%. I just can't imagine if you go back to, if you look on Reddit at like people talking about difficult missions in this game, it's so funny to see like the people who've clearly played the modern version and the people who played the original version, because their lists of like the 10 hardest missions are completely different. And all the people who've only played Definitive Edition are like scoffing at the old timers.
As if like, what are you talking about? Like, all you have to do is drive across a city and like pick up one crate. And you're like, yeah, you have no fucking idea.
Because if you move that crate wrong on PS2, it actually killed you in real life. So like, and there's always little stories like that. It's like, oh, yeah, we see when we did that mission on PS2, there was a glitch which meant the plane's fuel drained at double speed.
So actually, you don't have the fuel it gives you in the definitive edition. You have half that. That's why it's a motherfucker.
And like, I was getting these little flashbacks to, oh, right, that's why I couldn't do any of this game. Like, I wasn't just incompetent. Like some of it was just stacked against you.
It was. I sort of like observed two things about the difficulty in retrospect playing this, which was any time you had to make a card do something specific, you're in trouble. You're in trouble with this game.
And I also felt like the side content at the time, the stuff that was optional, was a bit less of a steady hand on it, a bit less like it had gone through the same amount of testing and just a bit more like the zero missions are what I'm talking about here, really. But like just that they were, I just don't think that if they were tested properly, that they would have shipped in that state. Like if it had been tested for like a long period of time, if you'd put it through today's way that QA is done, you know, QA is I think like a lengthier, much more intensive and probably expensive process now.
You just wouldn't get, those zero missions were just horrible dog shit. Like no one, even people who are like masterful at this game, no one can say they were good, surely, in their original form.
They're so much harder than anything else and the rewards you get for them, which is if you complete all of them, they're his shop, very slowly accrues money that you can individually pick up. Like it's such a stinker of a reward because there are other things. So it's like, once you've done this mission, you can always get a jet back or this particular amazing vehicle will always be available at this location.
But here is like, you can drive three laps of the entire world and it will have earned you 50 bucks. And you're like, well this obviously stinks. And was a terrible time investment and business investment for me.
Yeah, it's just funny how hard it was. But yeah, like it feels like some real surgery has gone on with the Definitive Edition. Okay, so more about the game at its core, Matthew.
So what did you make of the 90 setting at the time? Because I remember thinking the 90s was a bit soon in 2004. Like I couldn't totally grasp the points of reference of why they did it.
But with age, you learn a bit more, obviously you learn a bit more about Rodney King, police corruption, gang culture, NWA, hip hop, conspiracy culture, like X-Files type stuff that was big in the 90s. So when conspiracy theories were a bit more innocent and a bit less the nightmare world we live in now. California and pop culture as well being so different to Miami and New York, like I say, music is a big part of that, but you got Hollywood as well.
It sort of made sense over time, even though I sort of thought an Altamont or Zodiac Killer 60s California might have been fun, but I guess you couldn't have any rocket jets or jet packs if you did that. So what did you make of the night, you're saying?
Yeah, I'd actually agree with what you just said in terms of I don't think I necessarily had the pop culture diet or just understanding of the world to get all those references. At the time I felt it was a little more vague compared to Vice City, which was so clearly mimicking Miami Vice in its palette and presentation. It had a much more caricatured decade to play with, and it sort of almost felt like you couldn't then paradiva 90s.
I'm not sure if you can paradiva 90s now, or if I've ever seen it done amazingly well. I think it's quite a hard decade for people to like capture the essence of on film. But like, yeah, all that stuff there, you said, is definitely there and playing it now, you know, 20 years on when I, you know, do know like films and music and just American history, I guess a bit better, you're like, oh yeah, this is actually way more sophisticated.
Like I thought this was a bit of a whiff when I first played it, in terms of like setting and nailing a time. And actually, like, yeah, I mean, the LA of it all is, you know, very specifically observed. You know, until I read it in these notes, it hadn't even kind of cottoned on to the fact that all the conspiracy and alien stuff was happening, yeah, like in tandem with like X-Files obsession.
And I think I think that's actually like pretty astute in terms of what was going on in pop culture at the time. I just maybe didn't have the sort of clearance or sort of hindsight to to appreciate it at the time. You don't want to say anything in this game is too serious because as we'll get to it's like a really stupid game.
But like there definitely is like a new kind of crime emerging in San Andreas, which is quite interesting. Like it's not just the mob and like comedy international drug dealers, which it's kind of been up and doing like the Gta until this point has been quite traditional villains. Like it's something a bit more insidious like, you know, the insidious powers that kind of govern everyone's lives, like the police and government agency and just sort of manipulators behind the scene.
And that I definitely didn't get the first time around. I actually thought it was again, around all the bullshit. There was some, there was some quite smart stuff in this one.
Yeah, it is quite sophisticated in some ways. I think the way that the game uses Officer Tenpenny as a sort of like symbol of like street level oppression, like from the system. And then why you've got like Mike Torino as the sort of government level of this sort of thing.
And I think that while it's easy to be like, Vice City just is the 80s. It is the 80s in quite a superficial way really. It is Scarface, it is Miami Vice, it is those radio stations.
And those are like, definitely hit you over the head with what this decade is. Like you say, there's such a concentrated idea of what the identity of that decade is. And it suits it so well.
But yeah, there's definitely more going on here. Just from the sort of things they draw from. I think the attempt to not just satirize pop culture, but to satirize the real world in some ways.
And to comment on the real world. Because like you say, if you have, it says quite a lot without really being explicit about it to the very end of the game, I would say. It's still very silly of course, but yes.
It is interesting as well in the Los Venturis act that, again, in the lightest way possible, it's, you know, it's by bringing back some characters from previous GTAs, it's like, not reckoning with a, you know, a tone as such, but like, there's a passing of time and some of those characters have changed, they're not just there for you to kind of point at in the Leo meme style, you know, I think there is, there is something, like, particularly that portion of the game seems to be about, like, something moving on or a transition happening, and for those characters to come back and be there for it, you know, feels like there's something narratively interesting in that, but I get, there's quite a bit in this game that it doesn't necessarily, like, land or see through, but it got me thinking about it anyway.
Yeah, yeah, I think we'll, um, let's definitely talk about some of that stuff, because I think the way they use existing Gta characters is interesting as well. So yeah, we'll definitely come back to that. So what holds up well about this game now, Matthew?
Lots of stuff. I mean, I guess I should say, just at the top line, I actually had a fucking brilliant time playing this.
You too.
I really, really enjoyed it. Way more than my city. That is, because it is much easier, thanks to the kindness of Definitive Edition, but again, we'll get to that.
But yeah, I just had a good time. One thing that definitely jumps out, I mean, this was part of that appeal back in the day as well, is just there's so much stuff in this game that it does begin to sort of trend towards the kind of world or life simulation, you know, a little more than it was before. And in a way that like Rockstar have definitely kind of followed through this sort of, you know, light RPG elements are in the mix, but also just the sheer number of side activities and side avenues that are a bit more thought out in terms of like, you know, pursuing different kind of careers, you know, lots of different vehicles you get in trigger, you know, being a policeman, being a fire engine driver or whatever.
But, you know, you can also be like a truck hauler and, you know, a valet and a train driver or just a house robber. And all that stuff I found quite interesting. It's like, oh, this is a little bit more going on like in between the missions to kind of fill your time.
The other big thing that really jumped out was, I just think there's a real attention to detail in this where a lot of the stuff they've added, they actually really land in terms of like mechanics or how things feel like there's lots of interesting vehicles that handle quite differently. Every time I got a bike in this game, I was thinking this is actually like a pretty good bike, the way that you have to hammer the button to pedal it and you don't really have a brake and the momentum of it, the sound of it as well, it's so quiet compared to a car but the sound of the wheel going really fast and when you glide around a corner and you put your leg out, I was like, oh it's actually, that feels quite nice. I had a much better time driving in this than I did the previous games.
I just thought there was a lot more going on and it was quite exciting to feel with the different cars. Those were definitely things I thought, oh yeah, that attention to detail really comes through. I've got quite a few points here, so I'm happy to alternate.
Well, I agree with a lot of that. I think I've also had a really good time with it. I've got a couple of headaches around gating progress that I think definitely hold the game back still and would have driven me nuts if I ever got to those bits back on the PS2.
Please, I didn't have to go through it then, like I go through it now with all of the Definitive Edition bells and whistles. Yeah, I think I really agree with you about the, it's the idea of promising to be the game that's got the jet pack, that's got the life sim mechanics, that's got the military jets, that's got an Area 51 riff, and then delivering on every single one of those. Like for all of those mechanics to get their own big moment.
There was a moment at the very end of this game, in the last stretch of missions, where for the first time in the game, I boarded a hovercraft, which, and I was like, how the fuck does this game still have new mechanics about, you know, what would have been on PS2 about 50 hours into the experience? Super impressive. Yeah, there's just moments in this where you feel they completely deliver on the ambition of what they set out to make, and you can absolutely see why this was just such a phenomenon, that people were utterly blown away by it, that it was the best-selling one.
It was like, I just don't think people could quite believe it, that it was doing all these things, and yeah, that's mega impressive. I also think that this game has quite a... And I'll flip back to you after this, Matthew.
This game has... It's definitely one step closer to the types of multi-part cinematic missions that Gta 4 attempts, and that Gta 5 arguably perfects that very particular formula of rock star mission. This takes quite a big step towards that.
It has missions at times that surprised me how sophisticated they were in terms of the different parts to them. Whereas Vice City was very much the Gta 3 school, for the most part, very much the Gta 3 school of do this thing, the thing is done, the mission is complete. And that kind of arcadey roots to it.
Yeah, so that's another thing that jumped out. There's a few missions where I was like, oh wow, this mission also does this, it also does that, it has a story component here. Yeah, but back to you, Matthew.
Yeah, no, I agree with that. They're nice little sort of rolling arcs. And yeah, but you often think, find yourself doing things you're like, I can't believe just 10 minutes ago I was creeping around a hotel and now we're in this mad car chase or whatever.
Like this is quite exciting. Yeah, I really, really love the map. I think the change in atmosphere that happens as you move around it between the different cities gives it these quite kind of clear acts.
I actually think that's a trick that they do a few times. Like obviously all their games use like geography to progress the story in terms of you getting to go to new bits of the map. But I don't know if they ever really nailed that sensation again until like maybe Red Dead Redemption 2 which has like a you know because they're Dutch's gang are getting like driven out of regions because the crimes they've done are just too heinous and so they're pushed to a new part of the map and then they're dealing with new characters.
And you know from a you know a gameplay structure perspective it's just a quite good trick to force you to deal with new people every 10 hours and have a change of location a change of tone. But I actually really like the little arcs and stories and collections of characters that exist in the three cities. I guess with like two shorter acts in the kind of countryside as well between those.
Like I think I was just in a hurry to see things when I played this back in the day and didn't necessarily like savour what each part of the map was doing and you know as you said earlier they would like the weather. There is a very different flavour. It isn't just one big generic map.
You know being in San Fierro when it's like incredibly foggy and there's all these taxis slowly travelling up this hill. You know it's very different to just the you know anything goes out in the sunbaked desert where there are a couple casinos and like all kinds of heinous shit happening like just in the desert outside. Yeah it's like it's very elegantly done.
Considering how much time and effort they now put into like narrative arcs and pacing and getting that shape in those games by refining them, there's almost something like slightly accidental about this one but it works.
Yeah for sure. I do think that there's a big step up in storytelling that occurs with this as well. Even if you think that the…
it's still like fairly superficial, like the cutscenes are short, there's a lot of tough hangs in the cast still and we'll definitely talk about those and lots of juvenile nonsense for sure. But there is an attempt to build an ensemble of characters and like you say and then to also to have your character go on this odyssey and then to have your character come back home and then pick up where the story started basically. And that is definitely a step towards what Gta 4 is.
You can see them sincerely trying to give you a good story. They are trying to make you invest in this character. Not just in a way that I think you do with Tommy Vercetti, which is, hey isn't this guy cool?
Isn't Rayleigh Otter cool? And isn't it cool that he wears this shirt? Isn't it cool that he is friends with Lance Vance?
And there is definitely some good moments in that story but it never felt anywhere near as thought out as this does. Like on that Vice City episode I called out the sudden betrayal of Lance Vance as being a real like shrug of a moment in the game because it just felt like it came out of nowhere. I feel like that's probably the scar of that game being made in a year and you know them getting the extra year here.
They just it just feels so much more thought out as a story you know. Yeah, I think the Sim stuff holds up quite well. I do think it's funny that I managed to turn CJ into a thumb in my playthrough because I made him both fat and muscular which is kind of me to be honest.
So I appreciate being able to leave that touch on the game.
Because of the haircut and like his incredibly muscular build and like the leather jacket I gave him. My CJ really looked like Blade Era Wesley Snipes.
Nice, that's good.
And that was like my little roleplay. I was just imagining him like that the whole game which was quite fun.
Yeah, I did also when I got to the very final section back in Los Santos. I did also, did you also change it back into his Grove Street green uniform?
You know what, I did contemplate that, but I was also in the I kind of want to get this game done phase of it. And I thought, can I even spare the time to go to a clothes shop or go to my safe house and load into the wardrobe room, that wardrobe room, bad hang loading wise.
Yeah, it's a fucking nightmare.
Because every time you change any item of clothing, he has to go into a smaller room and then emerge in it. And then when you're like, yeah, that's what I want, he then has to go back into the smaller room. You're like, just walk out, man.
You're wearing what you want to wear. What else is happening in that fucking dressing room? It's got like some weird, like, I don't know, like body issue or something.
Like, what is it about? Is it a never nude-liked vibe? Is that what's going on in there?
It's just the PS2 era not respecting your time, Matthew.
Yeah, it's probably that.
It's probably a technical restriction. But yeah, so like all of that, I definitely felt like when I put on the green outfit again, I was like, this is sort of like Captain America putting his World War II uniform on again. It has that sort of like, I was invested enough at least to ponder that.
And then I think, like we said, like we said, the 90s setting, I mean, I think the further away you get from the 90s, and the more you learn about pop culture, or like, you know, world history from that time, or like, particularly the history of California, I think it, as a period piece, it shines in this very particular way. So those are kind of all my pluses, Matthew, anymore. Or should we move on to the things that hold up less well?
That's a lot of it. I mean, yeah, a little shout out for just having a better variety, not just the length and the phases of the missions, but you've got a few more moves to play with. You know, like there is a usable stealth system, for example, should they want to put that in a mission.
And just having one of those to break up the endless shootouts in warehouses is quite nice. So, yeah, just, I don't know, it just felt like they were playing with a lot more and using it in a more interesting way.
Yeah, especially because it doesn't, I don't think in most cases it fails you even if you mess up the stealth bits, it just turns into another shootout basically. Yeah, so, yeah, the funniest thing though is when you, there's clearly a technical restriction where the buildings where CJ has to do stealth missions, he does a little breathing sound to it, and you can later buy one of the buildings that has a stealth mission, and when you run through the corridors, he starts doing the stealth breathing noise in his own house, which is, that's very funny, that's a restriction at the time.
It's funny because it's one of the more expensive buildings as well, and it just feels like he's nervous to be in it, like it's too expensive, too rich for his blood, and he's just like, oh god, I better not break a thing in my own house.
Yeah. Yeah, so that's super funny. I definitely have more to say on more positive things to say about CJ, but we'll come back to discussing him in more detail.
Things that hold up less well, Matthew, and there's definitely not a small list of this stuff. What have you got for this?
I'd say the top thing is totally very strange and inconsistent to basically start a game as boys in the hood and have quite a subtle introduction to like small time crime in a single neighborhood in Los Santos and then to go to the places it does. I feel like they're constantly torn between like the maximalist action they can now handle and all the credible explosive toys they want to make and throw at you. This like proper sort of blockbuster spectacular, but also wanting to tell a more mature, authentic story.
This is like a constant tug of war basically from San Andreas onwards with them and like I think by the time you reach Red Dead Redemption 2 you've actually really nailed it. Like the character work and the missions that happen all make sense, but here like there are lots of moments, like there are certain characters who just feel like they're in a different game. Like your relationship with Sweet, your brother, which is a very, he is very much like the voice of authenticity and like Grove Street for life and, you know, don't forget your roots and the stuff you go off and do and the stuff that you sometimes go off and do even though you're still interacting with him is so is so dumb but like this I think the point that sums up this best for me is actually its final mission in the game where you know you have this quite like you know we got to stop this this scourge you know this city's going to hell like you really got to step up and prove that you're about this family and you're like yeah okay this is this is actually like the perfect end to this character arc and then you leave the house and the objective is something like you've got to go and destroy Big Smoke's Crack Palace.
I was like right like we exist in a world where someone can have this very heartfelt conversation but there is also a Crack Palace and that really and that made me hell with laughter I was like god bless you San Andreas don't change I don't hate that about the game but I was like this is very silly that this keeps happening.
I actually really like that push and pull right it's so PS2 era that they do this like it's so it's just before critics like tragically learn what ludonarrative dissonance means like I mean imagine that that term existed when this game came out and then people start stroking their chins and battering this game to death with it I mean I really embrace the fact that it's like we're taking this comic book approach to we're taking Boys in the Hood as our base and you know maybe menace to society and then we're turning it into this wild kind of like comic book style adventure well with tons of characters where loads of random bullshit happens and then there is this funny bit where CJ comes back at the end is reunited with Sweet and it's basically like I've accumulated generational wealth like I own part of a casino and Sweet's not interested he's like but what about like the 16 by 16 block that surrounds our very poor house it's like is he's not interested in the fact that like you can have a better life he just wants to have the life he's got right there and meanwhile yeah like yeah I've just got I got Mike Torino so I could keep this jet that I stole from an aircraft carrier like that if he had a proper conversation about all the things that you've been up to it was it would seem so preposterous but his brothers is not interested yeah I it is funny that that contrast but that yeah it's I think it really stands out because that the first the first and last act are so much more kind of connected like the through line of sweet you know having high expectations for you and then being disappointed when you return at the end because you've been having this wild like fucking jetpack adventure you know for like two months without him he's been like rotting in prison and he comes out and he's just like oh you're such a letdown like that character arc is is so rock-solid you know the idea of like coming back to the things established in the first act and you actually tie up a lot of story lines that are introduced in that first act but that really is hugely sophisticated compared to Vice City yeah yeah it's just all the unevenness in the middle so yeah i mean i have plenty of other weaknesses to chuck in yeah like you like i mean shooting it's still that thing of like is this auto aim gonna completely fuck me because i want to aim at the person directly in front of me right but the auto aim lock on does not want to do that and so i'm shooting the civilian who's running past over here instead of the guy who's got a gun in my face like the stuff that was always weak about PS2 GTAs that never really got good it got better in San Andreas than it was in Vice City in 3 but it's still not really good it's doable and you can get enough guns and level up enough guns that you can sort of bypass the combat to some extent which is sort of part of the weird power sort of curve of this game.
Do you like the leveling up of individual disciplines?
I do actually because I think they made some smart choices like the Definitive Edition I believe this may have changed as of like the mobile version a few years ago but like the you only have to go to the gym a few times to get mega muscly in this and my memory of it on PS2 was that it was a much more incremental thing you had to do it quite regularly and then I think they were just like nah fuck it we'll just slam this meter right up and then that'll be that'll work a lot better. Yeah so I don't mind it, how do you feel about it?
Again like only going on definitive edition I quite like the balance of like work you put into what you get out and I felt like it was all tuned that by the end of the game you're pretty high level in everything just by doing the core stuff the game asks of you and you do feel more competent now that might be an absolute like placebo like you may just be imagining that the cars are handling slightly better and that the guns are aiming a bit faster but it's it sold me on the idea that he was he was slightly better for sure certainly it's swimming like at the start you can go under water for like two seconds but by the end of the game I was just like you know it was practically a merman it was great.
I do like as well that certain progression curves in that system that sort of show how far you are into the game like how your maximum health is always climbing up depending on the amount of hours you've played. I like the idea of just things accumulating with experience you know like I'm good with this gun because I use this gun so many times is a is a cool notion then the idea you can sort of aim and move and shoot while you're using it is you know meaningful upgrades. There's definitely times where you're like oh fuck this I actually did hate the swimming thing a little bit I whacked on two episodes if you must remember this to get through that Matthew the episodes on Ice White Shot if you're curious after I watched that film again and I was just there listening to all these 90s critics except horny Roger Ebert hating on that film and while getting CJ to swim up and down like in the San Fierro harbour thinking I mean I wouldn't tolerate this from most games these days but it's really one of the only times they make you do that.
Yeah I think also that if we're talking about weaknesses the gating that occurs two times in this game there's one where you have to get a code from someone who works in a casino for a string of heist missions in the last Venturus bit of the game that is there is a way to speed that up but I think we'll come back to that that situation Matthew and but getting that code is a thing that slows you down from progressing the story and another one is when you get to the very end of the game you basically have to take back a load of territories in Los Santos for the Grove Street gang and engage with the gang wars mechanic in this game which is fucking rancid is I would say my least favourite thing about this game replaying it for sure but just kind of similar to what GTA Online's basic mission types are really where endless guys will just run at you from different directions spawn in and your only real recourse is to stand back like a very tall man being attacked by a very small person hand on head while they run at you windmilling like that's your only way to basically like survive in the combat get a very long range weapon and fuck them up.
It's so rough when you've just come out of doing you know at that point you will have done like 99 missions where something you know relatively interesting happens every mission to go here's just a load of flavourless mush for probably you know at least a couple of hours maybe a lot more if you suck at it. I mean that's a really tough sell. I'm amazed no one like played that once and went ah this feels weird following the rest of the game you know.
Yeah or like I'm surprised people didn't mark the game down based on this because it did sour me a little bit on the game towards the end.
Who genuinely reached this when they reviewed it?
Yeah it seems very unlikely doesn't it? It's like probably had to get it done in three days and send it to press. Yeah that's I mean I don't think so no.
I think that Play Magazine the one I worked on gave it 99% San Andreas which is quite funny I guess like you did you did just have to play this if you had a PS2.
Yeah I'd hold it down to the head and say what happens after the Zero Missions just tell me one thing that happens after the Zero Missions and then I'll accept your review.
That's funny. So yeah that doesn't hold up so well the idea of like gating bits of progress.
A couple of other ones in gating was the having to buy the airstrip for 80 grand.
I had 80 grand do you see?
Oh I didn't cos I'd bought a load of fucking houses in the middle of nowhere just cos I thought oh that would be cool. Like the fantasy of a property empire you know I was like yeah great and then it was like I don't actually know why I didn't just reload my save thinking about it cos it was like 10 minutes before and then I committed to quite an arduous two or three hours of like am I going to have to make this from the fucking RC shop cos that thing is just not outputting at the speed I need it to.
Yeah absolutely I mean yeah for sure there are like other I love the idea of you building a property empire than like scrambling wondering how the fuck am I going to get the money for this airstrip that's an experience I just didn't have you know.
Yeah well I eventually learned that you get 10 grand for every race you complete from like the generic races and a lot of them as long as you're sort of slow and steady you can just sort of survive your way into first place. And so yeah I was printing money at that point but it took me several hours to come to that realization.
Other thing that holds up less well that there's just tonal bits of it that are like very of their time and also very of you know like early noughties but like Gta specifically immature humor.
We'll come to this but you know just as a starting point I was like we get it jokes about hillbillies fucking animals like I understand like this is this was hilarious once but but yeah there's a lot more to talk about that front which we'll come back to yeah anything else to talk about for the weakness aside Matthew I know I reiterate what I said about if you've got to make a car do something specific in this game it's generally like not ideal yeah that's that's really tough whatever the fucking pit manoeuvre is or oh fuck that yeah the fucking driving school in general and it's just like these screen instructions just like I'll just slightly nudge the back end of the car that's how you do it and you're like oh my man I'm doing that and this fucking car is exploding like I don't know what what a pit manoeuvre is I've even done that in the driving school and I don't know what it is driving from one side of San Fierro to the other without taking car damage in that driving school that's definitely held up less well yeah but yeah yeah I'd say as a bigger point you know aside from the tonally consistencies I always find in Gta there is a point where the plot loses me a little bit in terms of like who I'm actually friends with and who's working with who because you tend to they really like the trope of like befriending the person you want to kill by doing some like favors for them and because of that you end up getting quite close to people and you sort of forget that they're actually antagonists in the long run and there are definitely moments when I don't really know what's going on here like the Mike Torino character I find quite confusing in this like an interesting character but in terms of like he you know he's introduced as as much of an antagonist as anyone else but by the end becomes like almost your sort of weird protector and I feel like I missed a few steps but I would I would you know leverage that a lot of Rockstar Games you know four and five included I think there are bits on like ah there's just so much story here passed it out in in small portions that I yeah I I can lose the thread on certain bits.
I'll tell you a big plot weakness with this game right is early on in Los Santos when you get to the end of the first Los Santos section you CJ and his brother Sweet are betrayed by their friends Ryder and Smoke yeah and Ryder sort of reappears with no dialogue about halfway through the story and you kill him and I don't the mission where you kill him is pretty good I think but the clearly Ryder and Smoke should just be a pair because when you encounter Smoke again right at the end of the game it's a bit like well him and Ryder should just be together this this last mission should be CJ killing both of them but it never gives you much closure on that I like the idea of it being like two friends who turn on the brothers just to basically get power and money and and it should be like there should be this feeling of retribution for both of them but it just feels very half-formed as a just because I really love that betrayal in the story I don't see that coming at all really because yeah they do talk so much about you know the sort of Grove Street for Life and the sort of culture of that and then you realize that it's it's very superficial when people when the people who are at the top of that don't really believe in it and attempted away by money and power like that's a good moment that really lands in is a good reason to get CJ out of the city I think but yeah right that they just sort of like they either forgot about him or he just gets killed off very abruptly is very strange when that mission comes along you're you're suddenly you're doing one thing and then you're like alright we're killing this guy now are we all right fair enough like it it doesn't feel like a moment at all it's good mission though for sure yeah okay so yeah I think I did want just talk about the definitive edition a tiny bit more Matthew so I think this is the only one they went in an added mid mission checkpoints to right which I think makes sense because as we discussed like Vice City didn't really have many extended missions on three definitely didn't either so it sort of made sense that they had them less their checkpoints I think just loaded you literally as the mission started but here there's a few more involved ones which I think is a good touch but in general I think like Vice City I found this a pretty phenomenal way to experience this game now and even if it doesn't have the exact colour palette of how you remember it on PS2 it's close enough that I think it will it feels authentic what do you think?
Yeah and it moves really smoothly you know if you can play at 60 frames on you know if your console happens to support that I don't think it does on like Switch for example it's just fun seeing seeing this world at the best it can be you know it's not as cutting edge as as later GTAs but you know when like all the riots are kicking off at the end and loads of people are running around and cars are exploding you know you you want to see that in in smooth-o-vision for the for the proper excitement uh the checkpoints that they're what radically transform this game because in effect it becomes as easy to play as like GTA 5 or Red Dead Redemption 2 which are both pretty smooth like if you die more than twice on a mission something's gone horribly wrong with like you know Rockstar's 100 million dollar focus testing process and here it almost feels a bit like that you're still wrestling with shooting controls like you say that just wouldn't cut it in modern day Rockstar game I don't think but you're open to having a second go because it isn't just dying that the the the big big big problem with these old GTA games is like death is so punishing in terms of like taking away your weapons and it resets you to basically nothing and then it's so expensive to arm yourself up and when you don't die ever in a in a game or you make it through these missions with these checkpoints you accumulate this huge arsenal and you do ask yourself is this how this game is actually meant to be played like are you meant to accumulate you know basically a hundred grand worth of weapons to bring into every mission which then you know becomes a virtuous cycle doesn't it that the next mission becomes easier because you've picked up two thousand bullets in the last one but if you die it's back to like you and a pistol and this mission is not balanced for that you know so that's that yeah I really can't like overstate how much smoother those checkpoints make it it sounds like the dumbest thing but you're like this is like a game transformed to me yeah it's like it's checkpoints and also auto-saving at the end of a mission so you just have everything that you just left with before you go back into the open world like it just just really smart touches and yeah like they've definitely fucked with a whole bunch of stuff the the zero missions that were like a comically difficult spike in the game are now like they're a bit of a piece of piss I think I don't think I didn't fail a single one of them which is you could just see that they'd massively tweaked some of the bars behind the scenes to make them simpler because they were probably just so complained about so much which was wise and yeah that they're pretty things I mean that's the thing like the I feel like these this edition of the game still has a bad reputation because it was just so poorly received when it came out but since that big patch they did last year oh it looks it just looks so good it just yeah it's really like exactly what minus the the music tracks they've taken away due to licensing issues it's really like it's got the stuff for sure I saw those horrible screenshots of no fog you could see the entire map clear as day and it was mega cursed like it looked like you put the game in debug mode or something and turned off a load of settings it was that was bad but no they've I think this has been treated with some love so definite recommend from me on the Definitive Edition of these games.
Sweets character model I don't know if this is true in the first game he looks like he's permanently smelling the worst fart imaginable he looks about also about 65 whereas CJ is clearly like 20 or something really scrunched up nose graphic which seems a lot more obvious in this Definitive Edition than it did originally yeah there's definitely a few oddball looking characters in this where you wonder was that the original visual style or did something go wrong in the process used to bring these up to date yeah there's like there's like one sort of like a drug addict character you see at the very end of the game who's like I think head is like 1.5 times the size the other characters you're a bit like something's not quite right about the style of this guy is that just to make him look really emaciated because he's like a crack addict I think so but didn't it jump out to you how stylistically different he looks to yeah I mean that's like that bit's so weird because that's like a scene out of the wire and yeah that's what I'm talking about the tonal difference so you're like well you can do this but then see also again this character bear he looks like this because of the aforementioned crack balance yeah oh that's funny let's take a quick break there Matthew and I think we can just pause for a little bit of music and then we'll come back and discuss this game in more detail we've got way more still to talk about so yes we'll come back in a second.
Welcome back to the podcast. I did want to go through the settings one by one, Matthew. We talked about Los Santos a bit there.
There's a homecoming for CJ, his family, his brother, Sweet, and his sister, Kendall, and their mom and past, which is why he came back. The sort of re-rise of grocery as a gang, as a concern, introduces the gang warfare mechanic. If you put time into it here, I imagine that felt like a colossal waste when you had to come back later on and do a load more of it.
I mean, thank God I didn't bother, to be honest, because I don't like that bit of the game.
It literally goes away for the second and third acts, right? You can't do the gang war until we end.
Yeah, once you're out of Los Santos, that's it, it gets switched off. So bit of a relief, it introduces some other mechanics, like the fact you can have girlfriends in the game, for example. I don't think there are that many of them in the game, but there's Denise in the first section of the game.
Terrible dates I took Denise on. Just every single time, round the corner to the bar, because it was the shortest drive, every time, bar, bar, bar.
I kept getting... So I never went on a date with Denise, and then I left Los Santos, and when I came back, she suddenly started calling me all the time, and I hung up on her, and I was just like, I can't talk right now, I'm in the middle of a gang war basically, and I've got to get 35% of this city back, so I can finish this fucking game, like stop calling me Denise basically. And then yeah, you get introduced to Officer Tenpenny, played by Samuel L.
Jackson, and Officer Pulaski, who is played by Chris Penn, the late Chris Penn. Amazing antagonists, but they are like dirty cops, corrupt, but also just, I would say like a little bit ahead of the curve, I think on the commentary on law enforcement in the US that maybe occurs now. Quite interesting, even though, you know, obviously it's still through that Gta pop culture lens.
And yeah, so Los Santos, Matthew. I think it's a really great little sort of, it's nowhere near the size of LA, but it's got enough landmarks that you're like, yeah, this is, this feels enough like the place, Santa Monica Pier, close enough. It's, this is also the one though, that feels the most overshadowed by the HD sort of games, like the Gta 5's rendition of LA is so much grander than that.
But what do you think, going back to it?
Yeah, I like it. I mean, it has the role of the kind of classic, you know, first act stretch of any Gta where it's introducing like all the elements and it's quite kind of sort of small fry what you're doing. But even amongst that, it still throws in some quite like mad curveballs, like even at this early stage of the game where it's probably like the most effective at telling this story of, you know, quite an authentic family in this in this area.
You know, it has some ludicrous chase scenes where you're gunning down like tens of pursuers, basically turret sections. But, you know, I'm quite fond of those missions, you know, because they're quite easy. Turret sections in this game, I find.
And I remember that from playing it originally like, oh, just here's a here's a cool thing which is going to happen without much sort of hardship. And that's always a good payoff in this game. I like that it takes you from quite small time stuff around your neighbourhood, like all the way up into the sort of Hollywood Hills, and you're breaking into like the rapper's house, you know, that all happens in like the first five hours.
If you didn't know better, and obviously you come into this game knowing that there is a huge map, it kind of does a whole Gta arc in one map in terms of getting you from like small stuff to crazy big stuff, and then kind of boots you out and you're like, oh, okay, now we're in slightly un-uncharted territory. So I think it's quite effective in that way.
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I agree with all of that. It does quite a lot with the space, different types of set pieces and stuff like that.
Do you think this is the portion of the game where the more mundane life scene feels a bit more relevant? I don't know if that's just because you're starting out or it's because it's tutorializing it, but this is definitely the bit I did like the most going to the gym and then eating some food and then buying some clothes and having a haircut and all that kind of stuff.
Yeah, definitely. I wore the outfit I bought in Los Santos for most of the game. And then I thought, then I got to the end of San Fier and thought, I guess I should buy a suit now because I'm a bit wealthier.
And then I just, but I had the same haircut. So everyone knew that I was in touch with where I came from, Matthew.
I had a green top and green trousers, which were very home base coded. It's like Grove Street for life or alternatively associated with home base. That's what I'd say if I saw the ballers.
I'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, home, I'm actually home base. I'm not Grove Street.
That actually says home base for life. That spray paint on the wall, not Grove Street for life.
Oh, no, it's the B&Q boys in the black and orange. Get them.
B&Q boys with a Z. Yeah, so I definitely agree with that. The license stuff definitely takes a back seat.
And like I say, I think they've messed with some dials. So the weightlifting stuff, you only have to do a few times and then you can get mega muscly and that's sort of all you need to really do to engage with it. Every now and then, though, the game will throughout the, you're just in the middle of a mission and you go, oh, you're not eating for a while and now you're going to like lose all your body fat in like really, really quickly while you're in the middle of fucking area 69 gunning down army guys.
That's what happened to me. And then I basically jet packed out of the secret military base and went directly to a burger restaurant, which is what I would do in real life as well, Matthew. So again, a good role play experience.
OK, so after that you go to the countryside and later San Fierro, the game's rendition of San Francisco. Countryside bit Matthew feels like a real flex to me of we're going to do some stuff here that you've never seen in the GTA before. So you can steal this combine harvester, run a bunch of dudes off.
You can go ride a motorcycle up these mountains and these hills and the pace of it just feels different to anything they've done before. I really like that about it. How do you find the Countryside bit?
Yeah, I love the Countryside bit. This is the thing I wanted to see the most when I was playing it. I just wanted to see how they'd done a natural space compared to an urban space.
Going back there now, there's bits of it which are quite cool. It's quite hilly and curvy and there's lots of interesting sight lines as you crest hills and things. There are some quite weird bits.
The first mission you do in the Countryside, which is killing a guy in a cabin, is in this quite nightmarish forest where the trees are huge.
It doesn't feel like you've left the city, it just feels like you've stepped into a film set or something. It feels very odd, that area. Did you note that?
I think there's a slightly odd vibe to the Countryside generally. They want it to feel like hostile territory, I think. But I didn't pick up on anything I would say was spooky.
I had a feeling that they were trying to nod to Redwoods, which are famously huge, but they're so big, and maybe in the stark light of this Definitive Edition, where everything's a bit sharper, it just seemed quite odd. It looked like something out of a Suda 51 game. That kind of vibe of like, oh, because the only assets I could see was CJ, these giant trees on the floor.
So yeah, that was quite nightmarish. But otherwise, I really like the countryside. It's quite a nice change of pace.
Yeah. We'll get some of our favorite missions in a bit, but a couple of them are here.
Yeah, this has got the narrative distinction of you, the only time I think it's ever happened of encountering a protagonist from another Gta game in a mission. So, you have CJ encounter Claude, who doesn't say anything from Gta 3, as he always did, he never said anything, who is caught up with Catalina, who is the primary antagonist of Gta 3, and quite an unhinged presence throughout this game. It's funny because even though there's a little dashing of Gta fan service in Vice City, you get a little bit of Donald Love in that game, there's loads more of it in this game.
In some ways, it feels like a bit of a tribute to what Rockstar, I think, had built across those three Gta games. And I just like the idea of that's the guy you were. He's right there in the background.
He's saying nothing. That's just a nice touch, I think. So I think that's still very effective.
I do also like the fact that you start getting K-Rose as the main radio station in the countryside. So you realize they've thought about different radio stations that can suit different locations. And that's really just quite, I think that's quite a clever thing for the countryside, because you hear all these country songs and you're like, oh yeah, I can feel a sense of geography communicated in the music as well as the map itself.
So San Fierro, yeah, you get there about probably at the end of the first act of the game, really. It's sort of like, well, I guess the end of the first act is Los Santos. And then there's sort of this bridge bit in between in the countryside.
And then San Fierro, you get this little garage and then you start getting in with a cartels alliance of drug distribution.
Yeah, it's kind of like a consortium of local hoodlums who, you sort of, you arrive there and you team up with this local triad, Cudwusi, and then through him you discover basically the people who have enabled Big Smoke to start running his drugs operation, which has led to your expulsion from Los Santos. So I actually thought this is the stretch of the game, which has like the cleanest, like narrative coherence in terms of you turn up, it introduces like these are the bastards who are responsible for everything going south in Los Santos, you're going to kind of pick them off one by one, mainly a pimp called Gizzy B and T Bone Mendez, who's this like incredibly grumpy sidekick to Mike Torino, who like I said is introduced as one of this like consortium, but who seems to kind of get a pass as the game goes on. So, what's up with that?
Yeah. So I guess the other key context is that when you leave Los Santos, sweet gets put in prison and you thanks to your sister Kendall's boyfriend, Caesar, who is with another gang in Los Santos and becomes your sort of de facto best buddy over the course of the game, he sort of like warns you that a smoke and rider betrayed you, so you leave the city. So, Caesar is kind of caught up in a lot of your adventures in this portion of the game as well.
Like I think he's the one who helps get that little garage, that's your main base for a big chunk of it. He's got a bunch of like car theft missions that you get up to if you complete the driving school stuff, Matthew, and unlock that. Did you do those missions at the end?
I did that and I bought wang cars. Oh, yep.
Very good. I wonder what sort of pun they were going for with that title. Very smart writing.
This section, it amps up the type of activities that you're doing. The types of missions become a bit more high concept in it. It breaks form from what you were doing in Los Santos a little bit more, like the swimming mechanics come into it.
You have some cool set pieces with boats. I think there's a bit of air stuff in this. There's you taking on aircraft in this section as well.
I think they use the stealth mechanics a little bit more as well. Then they bring in the idea of you buying property and businesses a tiny bit more. There's not much business in this game, but like you mentioned, there's zero stuff here.
That's quite undercooked as a mechanic. There are like three, three or four businesses I think you get that earn you money if you've completed everything there. Like a hangover from Vice City, I guess.
Yeah, for sure. It definitely feels underdeveloped. Either they didn't want to do as much of it because that was Vice City's big thing or whatever.
After that, you have the desert and Las Venturas.
Desert's where you team up with Mike Torino. So, over the course of San Fierro, you off the other two members of the gang. You think you've killed Mike Torino and then he emerges as this sort of government agent pulling all the strings and enlists you in, I would say, like quite an aerial stretch of the game.
This is where you buy an airstrip and you learn how to fly, well hopefully you learn how to fly planes and helicopters and get to use that. You also get to drive around in a big old monster truck. It's quite a big chunk of the map which I think they use, like you burn through it because you're in these quite fast big flashy vehicles.
So it doesn't necessarily feel like you do a huge amount there, but you definitely get up to some quite like explosive adventures, which then takes you in to Los Venturos, unless you have more desert thoughts.
Well, I do think it's really interesting that, so I do like that this game's version of the Gta 3 and Vice City, the bridges are opened up so you can go to these different places, experiences like big chunks of the map uncovering. I think as exciting as that ever gets in this game is when you go from the bridges in San Viero finally open up because you see their version of the Golden Gate Bridge and you know there's more world off in the distance. Obviously, we played the Gta this game before on PS2 but that's still quite exciting I think when those bridges open up and it's got that funny little Marin County town in the very north.
They never really use. That's just there. I don't know if they either didn't have missions for it or they just wanted the extra detail of well this bridge out of San Francisco has to go somewhere.
Watch Dogs is a bit like this as well though. There's a bit of Marin County in that but it's not massive, the Watch Dogs 2 map. Basically, they should have done their own version of Skywalker Ranch is what I'm saying Matthew, because that's where that is.
But then, yeah, the desert I think is very exciting because of the aircraft stuff, like you say, and also the fact that it's got its own slightly weird feel out there like this abandoned film set. Area 69 is comically located between the Airstrip and Las Venturas, so you'll inevitably end up flying over it by accident and getting shot at with like missiles from the ground, which is quite funny. But yeah, and then I think it tries to do a little bit of desert buggy stuff here too, which is sort of like not really that different from any other driving mechanics in the game, but they try to vary it up.
I think they bring Tenpenny back into the story a little bit here as well. Like it gets you to steal some kind of dossier around this point, and so you get the feeling there's a, I feel like Tenpenny is less of a presence in San Fierro that is switched off a little bit, and then he just sort of comes back into the story at this point.
Yeah, it's quite odd. I mean, you know, not to get too into the weeds with it, that, you know, given that he is this like, almost like beat cop in Los Santos, but somehow he is over this entire state, you know, like he isn't very, you don't get the impression he's like hugely, well, he's not his officer. He's not like hugely high up in the organization, but he's just sort of everywhere being like a bit of a pain in the ass.
Yeah.
Yeah, he definitely comes in. Doesn't he make you assassinate some people on a... There's a couple of nightmarish missions where you're basically like up on this big rock, one where you're shooting down helicopters and one where you're trying to assassinate an FBI agent.
Yeah, and then there's a journalist one as well, right? Where you have to kill, yeah, that's right. And so, yeah, those are a bit like, what I like about those missions is you never really get the context of why you're doing them.
You just know that Tenpenny's is one of those guys who the game makes clear he's got something on everyone, and but that his own house of cards is like going to collapse any moment if X person is not killed. And again, I think part of what makes him a great villain is that CJ is just caught up in the machinery of that constantly. Yeah, so you just basically whatever he needs, CJ is just brought in to resolve.
Yeah, it is interesting, like you say, how they sort of reconfigure Mike Torino from being one of these bastard villains to being like the man behind the curtain a little bit. You know, the kind of guy who's making, who's playing off government agencies against each other, but he's working for the government. Part of me wondered if that was because they really like James Wood's performance in this, and I think he is very good in this problematic character in real life these days, James Wood's.
But, you know, no question he's an amazing voice talent as...
For sure. And his overall arc in this of like villain to slightly shadowy puppet master, you know, while I did find that confusing, I guess the actual payoff, which is like fundamentally, he does kind of come good for you and get sweet out of prison.
It's great.
Yeah, that does work. Maybe I've been a bit harsh in my judgment of Mike Torino, who is a horrible piece of shit.
He is. He does that after you, you know, steal a military aircraft from an aircraft carrier for him. So you've done a lot for him at that point, but it's nice that the game is like, here's one person who your relationship with him is done, and he actually repaid the favor.
I don't think you really get that elsewhere in the PS2 Gta, so I did like that, change of pace to it. So yeah, Las Venturas, at this point, I think if Caesar's like your main pal in it, then I would say Woozi is your other main pal in it. A lot of comedy that comes from the fact that he's basically a blind gangster who acts like he can do stuff that you need vision to really do.
The cut scene's definitely going heavy on that.
I'll say.
But I would say quite a good hang, Woozi.
I think he's genuinely one of the greatest GTA hangings of all time.
I agree with you, I agree with you.
I was testing the water, I think he is. He's honourable, he's nice, he's not too obnoxious in person. Yes, he is mostly there for there to be lots of blind gags.
But all the work you do with him is very upfront about, and he never backstabs you, and he's your mate until the end, and he never says anything horrible. He's quite chill, he plays video games. He's great.
Yeah. He sends his army with you to go back into Los Santos. He's like, yep, here are my dudes.
They're going to help you out as you drop onto this mansion and take it over in your effort to take back Los Santos. Like, he's... Yeah, Woozi is your palatial.
He's in so much of this story, actually, that I think that you could sense the designers falling in love with him as well a little bit, because, yeah, there's a big old heist arc that's attached to Woozi, but then loads and loads of story missions across multiple locations. So, yeah, a lot of Woozi in this game. And then you get, at this point as well, you also get tied up in the Mafia.
They reintroduce Salvatore Leona. He's the first big boss you work for in Gta 3, who later betrays you, tries to kill you with a car bomb, and so you kill him. And I think the game interestingly sticks two fingers up at him.
You do a couple of jobs for him, and then CJ's a bit like, fuck you to him on the phone, which is quite interesting, because I think that's maybe what you're talking about, about how the classic gangster archetypes of Gta 3 clash with the slightly more human character they're going for with CJ. It's quite interesting to see those two worlds collide a little bit. Anything more to add on Last Ventura, Matthew?
Also introduced the characters back from Vice City. Oh, Ken Rosenberg. And, oh, not Mike Pence.
What's his name? Trent Paul.
Kent Paul?
Yeah.
Kent Paul, is it?
Yeah. Trent Paul. And a new character.
I don't think the other character is in Vice City, right?
Oh, God. I mean, the other character. I mean.
Oh, God. I mean, I guess, like, so Kent Paul is accompanied by, I would say, the worst character in any of these games. A bloke who goes around chronically masturbating.
Yes.
And while Kent Paul is going, oh, don't do that, mate, the whole time. And it's just got me thinking about why it's, like, so much of the worst stuff in the PS2, Gta is caught up in, like, British characters. Because I just don't really...
Macca, that's it. That's his fucking name. Macca, who is played by Sean Rider from the Happy Mondays.
Oh my god, it's so, like...
This bit where he masturbates whilst saying Margaret Thatcher's name over and over again.
Yeah, it's a rough time, I would say. But yeah, that's the other weird thing, though, is they're kind of like this little comedy trio they drop back in from Vice City, and they're not massively consequential. And they sort of get on the wrong side of Salvatore, and then all of them are sort of ejected from the story, and then it's back to the San Andreas plot.
But it's quite a good little aside, because you sort of, again, I think them humanising CJ, you sort of do something to let them all get away unharmed from Salvatore. There's a lot of doing good deeds, lots of other horrible stuff that CJ's doing, but lots of doing favours for pals of this, where you wonder, do they have a bit too much affection for their characters, maybe?
Maybe, but I prefer that mode for them, because they're normally so nihilistic about everything. Every character is fucking evil and foul and weak, and it just like, it grinds you down over the time. And actually in this one, like your core group of like you, Woozi, Caesar and Kendall, your sister and sweet, like at the core of the game, it is about like, you know, family found or otherwise, which is a bit like enough and a bit of a cliche, but I guess it's like the Gta version of that.
And it works pretty well. Like at the end of the game when everyone, they're talking about like, basically all the good hangs are left to living. And you're like, this is okay.
I'm not all right with this, you know?
It's like, it's like the Gta version of saving everyone in the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. Where it's like, you get a happy ending and all your pals are there. Like it's got...
And so that is the final section of the game really. It's Los Santos, you're back in Los Santos. There's only a few missions really.
Like I say, your brother not interested in the generational wealth or pals that you've acquired. Still got very much of you focused on on Grove Street and the people in your life. And yeah, so, I mean, yeah, quite a journey they take you on.
And I would say until I got to those bits that are gated, Matthew, I thought, oh man, this was what, despite all of the difficulty spikes that we didn't have to endure this time, what a fucking journey that is for like a PS2 game to do all that. You know, pretty unbelievable. Okay, any missions properly?
Wow, you were impressed this time, Matthew, or even just some of you quite liked.
So I can say at the start of the game, I quite like the missions which turn into like turret sections just because I do like the flashy, bombastic sort of blockbuster mode Rockstar occasionally bring out. Like there's that one where I think you save sweet from like a meeting, it's called something like meeting of the families or something. And you save them from a motel and then you end up driving a car and like the police jumping onto the bonnet of the car, your machine gunning them off.
There's a bit where a policeman jumps on the bonnet of the car and you drive under a low flying helicopter and it's rotor blades chop the policeman up. And then you jump through like a big, it's some kind of like visual site gag, like you're you know coming out of a woman's butt or something, you know, it's like, it's like a classic stupid end to quite a cool cinematic mission. I like that.
I also like that there's quite a similar mission early on where I think you're chasing like Russian bikers or shooting Russian bikers and you go down to the storm drains and there's like a huge juggernaut and it's like proper Terminator 2 stuff.
Yeah, it's the most explicit reference to another movie I think there is in this game, to a movie in this game. It's called Just Business, that mission. And yeah, got a back of the bike turret section.
And it was one of the first times where I thought this is quite a big upgrade over Vice City, you know.
I think now, one of the biggest criticisms aimed at the GTA games is like how scripted the missions are. And that everything is a set piece where if you drive outside of a line, you get punished. And you know, here, they're only kind of experimenting with that for the first time.
And a lot of the missions do follow that rule, but it becomes, you know, the only thing they ever do. But it's still, I like, I like that within reason, you know, I quite like, you know, when it's time that you drive through just the perfect gap in the traffic and everything. That's cool.
I like it.
You can see why they fell in love with that mission style, because when you execute it perfectly, it is much better than the Vice City, go here, kill these guys, or steal this thing, mission over approach. So I can see why.
While people pretend it's a fucking immersive sim. Yeah. Oh, you can park the car here and it makes the car crash.
You're like, oh yeah, watch out, I better throw away Deus Ex and just play Vice City for the rest of my life.
I'm glad that whoever's pumped those takes out into the world are deep into my mute list, and I've never had to encounter that. Sounds like the worst take in the universe. So I was going to chuck in from here Matthew, that I do quite like the extreme nature of the mission where the foreman of the construction site who's a bit rude to your sister.
So you, in a porter potty, you like ram him using like a digger into a hole and then fill it with cement, killing the guy. Just incredibly extreme overreaction, but like very PS2, Gta in a way I quite enjoyed. Do you want to throw in another one here?
Well, sticking with using a giant piece of overpowered equipment, I do like stealing the combine harvester and then using it to basically mow down all the people who don't want you stealing the combine harvester and all the gore spraying out of the whatever the fucking seed hole is on the side.
Yeah, that's really good. That's just such a different sort of like pace to the other missions in the game really. And a vehicle you'll never really drive again in the game because you have no reason to.
Perfectly executed for like 30 seconds.
Yeah, for the one gag that it's got, it really delivers, I think.
So that level is called Body Harvest, which I think is probably a nod to the N64 game made by DMA before they were Rockstar.
Oh yeah. Pier 69 where you raid that pier and then the meeting and kill Ryder. That mission is pretty effective because that feels, even though the Ryder bit doesn't deliver, it does.
That's definitely a part of San Francisco I know super well. Everyone who goes to San Francisco goes there. It's one of the things I think most people would recognize if they've been to that city.
It's like the pier where all of the shops are and you see the seals loafing about in the sun. They're not in this game, obviously, but there's an even better version of it in Watch Dogs 2, as you might expect. I quite like that mission, Matthew.
Then I think I have to just call out, obviously, the vertical bird where you steal the jet off the aircraft carrier for Torino. I'm jumping ahead here if you have more.
That's interesting. I've got vertical bird in my did not like mission list.
Okay. Interesting. I guess we could talk about that.
What do you like about it?
Well, I think that it's just that at that point, what you're saying about the contrast of all the things that Rockstar want to do with the character of CJ and how the origins of that character make no sense. It's just how perplexed he is by the idea that he has to go on to an aircraft carrier and steal a military jet for this guy. Then I think that it's just the fact that I didn't die during the mission, but you just take it and then you blow up a bunch of stuff, then you're done.
But the feeling of speed going across that map in that plane for the first time is still thrilling, I think. I like that, but what do you not like about it?
I just found it really hard to control. I did die. That's one of the few missions I died on quite a few times because of crashing the jet or not really understanding the relationship between flight and hover mode.
Hover mode doesn't really work.
Hover mode becomes like a weird helicopter. That's what threw me. I mean, truly frustration missions are actually few and far between because of the checkpointing in this, but that is one that I was a little bit like, oh, I kind of hope hoping I have to do this again.
I actually, it's not like particularly shouty, but I quite like the run of missions in the first set of countryside outside San Fierro with Catalina robbing like small establishments.
Yeah, got a very hell or high water feel about that, you know.
They have and that's the thing. It's a different kind of setting. It's a different kind of like rural crime.
They're all quite interesting. I like that you can sort of do them in any order. Not that that has any bearing on it at all.
But like I like the idea of we just got to over the course of these missions, you got to knock off four places and let's see what happens in each one. Like one of them is just like chasing guys down on little buggies and like, well, Catalina assassinate them. The through line is Catalina is this like maniac.
She's like your girlfriend for this portion of the game, but she's also just horrible to you. She's like really psychotic, but like brilliantly written, like motormouth, just horrible, horrible person. And I actually, I just love the variety of stuff.
I feel like they had a lot of fun of like for these four missions, this person's going to be like in your ear the whole time giving you grief. And then she's going to keep calling you throughout the game, continuing that run. A good executed bit of like mission design and character work at the same time.
Yeah, because you don't get, you get very little of her in Gta 3 really, but you just know that she turns on Claude like right at the very start of the game. And but yeah, I like that. I like that he sort of like, she's sort of like the tornado of a woman who came into his life, ruined his life, but he's quite, he's quite besotted with her.
He's quite infatuated with her. I like that as well.
Yeah, that is good. Because he's quite chill and nice with people. There's a version of that where if he's too aggressively antagonistic with her, it's quite an unpleasant relationship.
But he's more like, oh no, just trying to kind of diffuse this person who's just quite full on. Where like, there are other protagonists you put in that relationship from other GTA games and it's just like one of the nastiest hours of game you're going to play.
Yeah, her and Trevor, not a good combo I don't think. Yeah, I agree with that. I think all the other ones I've got are pretty obvious for missions, Matthew.
So, I've got the mission, I think the mission where you kill Officer Pulaski in the desert is really effective because it's so satisfying to finally feel like, you get a bit of this with Ryder but it's a bit oddly executed like we said, but with Pulaski it's like, you know that Tempeni is going to turn on you, we're out here burying a body of a police officer in the desert, you know you're going to be next but you still won't side with CJ so you have to die and it's about time you die and when he dies, you're like, fucking yes, put this guy in the ground like it's, you finally get some revenge, tens of hours into the game and I really like that about it. The mission where you ride a motorbike onto the plane, there was a bit doing this Matthew where I mean, first of all, I was very thankful for the checkpointing, I would not like to have done this on the PS2 because you could instantly go from the motorbike as the plane takes off, just going straight down the runway onto there. But it was a bit where I was like, on that plane, once I got on there and it had taken off, where I equipped my samurai sword and was slicing up the heads of these FBI guys and then planted this bomb where I was like, this game is fucking wild.
This started as a pastiche of boys in the hood and now we're doing this. I do love that sort of tonal variance about it, just what they can do with it gameplay wise. So that's a fun one.
You got any more Matthew?
Similar to that, I quite like the one where you have to assassinate the hitmen in the plane before they land by flying up. And then you don't parachute on but you fly close enough to the plane to get into it and then you have a little gunfight and then you suddenly have like a massive plane to control, like a Boeing for the first time basically, and you have to land that at the airport. This game does a lot of something outrageous happens in the air and you either get to land a cool plane afterwards or you get a very nice parachute descent over a pretty landscape.
Yeah, so good. And it really just delivers on all those extra features, I think.
I also really liked, and at this level would be a total motherfucker without checkpoints and there's a version of this game where it's like the worst mission in the game, but I actually really liked the Las Venturas Casino Heist.
Yeah, me too. It's like, you know, we talked about this with the Vice City Heist, but it's like a larval stage of what they would do in Three Leaf Clover and Gta 5.
Yeah, it's good. I like that you parachute from the hotel over to a police helipad, so you can steal a police helicopter to escape. That's the final little thing because you're not entirely aware of the plan.
It's a bit of the plan unfolds as you're doing it. It's like, now get to the roof and you're like, oh shit, what's happening over here? It's like, now get that parachute, now go over there and you're like, oh my God, I can't believe this is the plan.
Yeah, that's fun. But I did it all in one go without dying, so that massively colors my reading of it.
Yeah, I like that too. I like the Woozies there and Woozies still trying to do non-blind guy stuff, which again makes it funny. It did make me think about how amazingly the heists in Gta 5 are executed because the music is part of it and the missions are just silent in this, obviously.
And that's very different, whereas the particular heist music that plays in bits of those Gta 5 heists is just so incredible that it really adds to them. But I agree, the actual mission structure is, again, it's way more complex than anything you do in Vice City. Vice City's version of this was much worse, much more of a punch in the dick doing that one.
That took way more attempts to finish that one. I think I have to call out the novelty of going to Liberty City for one mission. It's a very basic mission, though, but it's the idea of flying to another Gta world for one bit.
But it's like a Gta interior, and I thought it was fine, because I knew it was coming. I knew that that's a thing it did, but in my head, I thought, I'm going to drive around a bit of Liberty City, and it's definitely not that. Where like modern Rockstar, if they took that swing, they'd make sure they did that.
Oh, wouldn't that be an absolute sledgehammer of a moment in Gta 6, if they were like, okay, we got to knock it, we got to go up the coast to Liberty City, and pull off one job, you know, and then you drive through fucking Star Junction, raid a bank, then come back. Like I just, it's too much of a lift to do, but imagine they did something like that, what the impact of it would be. It'd be the greatest thing of all time.
Yeah, they might, I don't know. They've taken a swing. I don't know if you are aware of it, but there is a, there's quite a big geographic swing in Red Dead Redemption 2, for example.
I do know about that.
Yeah, which is quite well, you know, it's only like an hour of the game, but you're like, this feels like pretty expensive for what it is, you know?
Yeah, yeah, so I'd love to see them do that because it's not a great mission, but just the novelty of it was like, oh, shit, this is Tony Cipriani's restaurant that I'm in. I'm the only one who sat there thinking that. And then I think the Area 69 ending with you taking the jetpack and then just getting the fuck out of there, I mean, amazing stuff really.
Like, again, we've added this feature to the game, and it really delivers, and the moment we introduce it to you, we'll feel absolutely phenomenal. Ah, so good. So, a lot of mine were quite obvious ones, Matthew, but in general, I thought the mission design was pretty good in this, and I just had a lot of momentum to it, and it was pretty frictionless.
The number of missions I got stuck on was really fewer than five, really. So yeah, which is definitely better than Vice City. Anything more to add, Matthew, or should we move on?
No, that's pretty much my faves.
Yeah, okay. Did you have any massively shit difficulty spikes in this?
Chasing and shooting down Mike Torino's helicopter with a rocket launcher? I just couldn't do it.
Yeah, there was like three attempts at one for me, three, I think.
I don't know if it's invincible at times, if there was something going on with it, because I felt like I did every trick in the book to get ahead of that thing. And for some reason it just wasn't going down. That was quite stressful and annoying.
One that gave me quite a bit of grief is when you have to steal four police bikes and drive them onto the pickup truck in Los Venturas. Mainly because it's one of those. What I think of as quite a Gta 3 mission, where it's like there are four things in four different corners of the map.
You've got 10 minutes to do it. And the puzzle is there's a correct order to it that lets you do this. And you have to figure it out by doing it over and over again.
But also one of the bikes you're trying to steal is being ridden and getting the actual policeman off it without like destroying the bike and instantly ending the mission makes it quite hard. And so it's too much of a gamble to leave that bike late into the mission. You want to get it out of the way first, but that makes the rest of it quite hard.
I just, I just, I could have done without it. I only died like two or three times, but it was just like 10 minutes of doing it again. You know?
Yeah. I think it, yeah. Maybe only a couple more times I had to do that one, but I definitely remember thinking, oh, that sucks.
The fact that that truck's always moving and they're not realizing till the end of the mission that one of the bikes is moving all along and that it's now in a completely different place to where the, oh, yeah, absolutely, that rubbish.
Also, even though I think it's optional, I do think the driving school is pure ass.
Rubbish.
Because it's asking you to do techniques that you never do elsewhere in the game. It's basically pretending for a second that the game's driver when it isn't.
Yeah, yeah, it's a bit like that.
Even watching videos of how to do some of the maneuvers, I was like, I don't get this at all. Like, I don't even know what's going on with those controls. Even if you filmed your fingers doing it, I don't know if I'd be able to mimic what's going on here.
But like I say, that is an optional strand, I think.
Yeah, I mean, it's telling that the what's it maneuver doesn't make a fucking return in GTA 4, isn't it?
And like, the barrel roll, that's a pain in the ass.
Yeah, oh yeah, that is annoying.
Because when do you ever need to do that? If you're doing anything with twisting in this game, you've basically fucked, like you're, if your car is not flat on the ground, you know, you are failing a mission. So the idea that you encourage it by going around trying to do barrel rolls, I just don't, I don't buy it.
Yeah, for sure. I throw in here that the train bit in Los Santos are still a pain in the ass. I think I failed that the most in the game still.
Probably about eight times I failed that. Yeah, there's a very particular place they want you to get to when you're doing it. But I just kept fucking up.
And yeah, it's an infamous difficulty spike in the original version of the game, but I still fucked it up a few times. But that was really it. The only other bit I really hated was the very final mission.
We have to put on night vision goggles and put out fires. Genuinely the most boring thing. You can add to a final mission.
That's rubbish.
Fighting a semi-invincible big smoke in a darkened room with predator vision. That is so far from boys in the hood.
Yeah, it is. Also, I would say that there's never been a good tailing mission in history, and I thought that recently while playing Mind's Eye for the first and only time, but definitely thought that again playing this. They're never good.
And The Spook-O-Meter, which has big magazine box out energy, is like just seeing that bar go up and down as like the car turns the corner, but geographically it's a tiny bit closer to you and just being like, oh, these fucking, these were so shit, weren't they? If I ever see one of those in an open world game now, I would absolutely mark it down to an 8 at most is all it could ever get. Like it's, they're rubbish.
The Spook-O-Meter has reminded me of like a screenshot I took of the game, because again, it got almost as big a laugh as the Crack Palace bit was when I realized it had a bespoke piece of UI health bar just for a hoe. It just said hoe, health bar.
Yeah, I put that on Blue Sky as well. I was like, I said that I chuckled at every sincere attempt I made to talk about the storytelling of Gta and like the world design and every sincere article I've written about Gta because there's a hoe health bar in this game. I mean, it just completely undermines it.
So funny.
Yeah, that's very dumb. Oh, actually, I just remembered a little mission I do like, even though it's really dumb, is chasing OG Locke in the Hovercraft and Go Kart. It's a suitably silly end for a comic side character who has a little arc through the game.
It's like the idea of this weird triathlon that occurs. But yeah, don't you also like, didn't you steal the rhyme book for him from Mad Dog, then at the end you'll get to get back to him?
Yeah, that's the whole joke, because he's like, he took my rhymes and my whole life went to shit, and you're like, whoops, I did that.
Yeah, I was in this building about 30 hours ago.
I shot all your friends with a science pistol, including your friend who was slagging off driver. Do you remember that?
Yeah, there's still some bad bits in it, but yeah, the Zero Missions are certainly not difficulty spikes anymore. They feel like they're by the most surgery. They're not good.
None of them are good. They're all rubbish. But yeah, again, they're not quite as hateful.
The nightmare with the Zero Missions in the original game is David Cross's repeating sound bites. Like the idea of hearing those, because that's what really gets you, is because you're like, when you hear a certain sound bite trigger, you're like, oh, I know I'm a minute into this now.
They're not toys. They're just smaller. That kind of line.
Yeah. Which is, I really like David Cross. But yeah, side note, I really like the cutscenes in the heist strand because that janitor bloke is there for a load of them.
It's his janitor closet. Oh yeah. He just weighs in on the conversation sometimes about, he just weighs in on the heist.
I quite like that. Or like Zero turns up at a certain point as well. I thought that was quite endearing as well.
Again, I think you can see them falling in love with their own characters a little bit in these bits. Okay, so I think that probably wraps up the difficulty spikes, Matthew. So I think like, this is a bit of a weird question, but the world overall and the scale of it, how do you like it compared to Gta 5's map?
Because they are the only two Gta maps you can really compare in that way. Like it's, they're both trying to achieve something similar, but there are also obviously some key differences, one city versus three, and the level of detail is obviously exponentially increased. What do you, but there's something about this map, I found playing it, what do you think?
I think I was surprised by how much I still enjoyed this map, given that I have played in much more realistic worlds that they've since built, was my general takeaway from it. It's that I was constantly thinking, a lot of this feels quite sort of dead, like there's no animals or anything like that, you know, compared to what they would do in later games. But that said, for a thing which was like a first go at this 20 years ago, like the variety of the maps, the tone of the different cities, like I said earlier, like the way they use them, and you know, I think there's just the right amount of missions in each place to see most things, get a feel for it and then move on.
I think it, yeah, a lot of it feels really well judged. And like I say, in a way that I think they will now dedicate, you know, years and years and years to trying to get that right, where here they did it all in a couple of years. It's pretty amazing.
It has no right to still be as good as it is. It's my start.
So CJ is a protagonist, Matthew. We talked about it a bit there. He's like very reasonable in places.
This character, I think, has a lot of cult appeal even now, like the, you know, oh shit, here we go again, sort of meme, but also just the way he gets modded into Breath of the Wild. Whenever modding's turned on for a game, CJ ends up in there. And I think people do have quite a strong connection to this character.
We're reading the Game Informer piece. I think Dan Howser puts a lot of this down to you feel more invested because you get to role play more with CJ than you did with Tommy Vercetti or the GT3 guy. And I think that that's a big part of it.
And I think him being a nice guy is a big part of it as well. Do you think that is ultimately the key that you believe his stamp on him, but he's also pretty reasonable?
That's the magic cocktail for me. Definitely like the sense of ownership in terms of like how his body ended up looking and his hair and his clothes. That reminded me of role playing my Arthur Morgan in a certain way in Red Dead Redemption 2.
You know, it ticks up the same box definitely. I think like Tommy Vercetti, just because some bigger things happened to him that kind of defined his place in that world in terms of like being this big crime kingpin. And like CJ is like everyone's gopher, but he's still fundamentally quite an unimportant person like all the way through it, which I think lets you project a little bit more.
You know, like if he did own a casino and have to run a casino as promised in that interview, it would be, you might have a different read of that character by the end. Yeah, I like him. He's a good dude.
And actually, like my goodwill towards the other characters, like so much of that is down to like him being quite affectionate with them and not too confrontational or angry. You know, all their other protagonists is so cross all the time and shouting at everyone. And he's just like, just sort of goes with the flow.
Yeah, you can see why Niko Bellic being so self-serious and having such a tragic background is like such a bummer compared to this, you know. It doesn't give you any of the joy that this does. It just gives you either a dead girlfriend or a dead cousin.
Cousin, a dead cousin, a dead cousin. But yeah, it's funny, CJ, because he's very passive. Like he kind of has to be because he's given jobs to do all the time.
I think we should talk about famous voice actors a bit here, Matthew, as side characters, because they did this in Vice City. But here, I mean, Samuel Jackson is incredible in this. I would almost say this is one of his defining roles, because the most, I think the highest number of people would have encountered it.
And it's like, it's like one of the, I think it's one of the great sort of like villain performances in a game. Not a massively deep character, but what he represents the spot on. And I think that the key thing about that actor, he tries exactly as hard no matter what the project is.
That's what's great about Samuel L. Jackson. Do you think the side characters in this, do you think the use of voice actors in this matches that quality generally, Matthew?
Yeah, because I think even where they've used some other famous names, they've used some like interesting people who I couldn't necessarily place until the end. It kind of reminded me a bit of like, it's like the difference between like Pixar and Dreamworks. Like when Pixar use famous people, they don't put their names on the posters, it's just their, here's the license.
But when Dreamworks does it, it's like Martin Scorsese is a fucking shark in Fishtail. And you're like, oh, yuck. And it's that, they aren't just that, if you compare us to like true crime, I think they were quite shouty about who everyone was.
And this is like, we've just cast good actors. Some of them are hugely famous admittedly. But yeah, they're great voices.
They're all of a like, right register. Like they all fit in the world together. You know, and given that voice acting wasn't quite as far along back then as it is now.
That in itself is like a huge feat. That it all just sounds like they came from the same place. Yeah, everyone in it's pretty good.
I mean, even the fucking wanking man is like, you know, the voice acting isn't terrible. It's just the characters are quite rank.
Yeah, he is rough. Like I say, James Woods is like a definite highlight of this. Like he's so good.
And I think the fact as well that they, you know, like Casino, the Scorsese film is obviously one of the things that the last Ventura section riffs on. Like it's having someone from actual Casino in the game is really impressive. Or having like a character we've not mentioned.
So I don't think he's that notable.
The Truth is played by Peter Fonda, who I think is the antagonist of The Limey. Is that right? I believe that's right, Matthew.
But anyway, lots of famous people.
Is he Easy Rider back in the day? Or is that the other Fonda? I'm bad with the La Fondas.
Yes, he was, yes.
Yeah, so I guess sort of tapping into that. Yeah, I mean, I don't know the actor who plays Woozy, but great voice, just very nice isn't he? The Cataliana voice actress, brilliant, hounding you over the phone and ringing you up to tell you what a great lover Claude is.
It's a good bit, but it only works because she absolutely delivers it.
Yeah, that's right. Young Melee is the CJ voice actor, by the way. But yeah, quite a lot of famous faces in here, and then people who would go on and be famous.
Think The Game is one of the voice actors in this too. Yeah, just quite a lot of authenticity they're drawing upon. I mean, I think one of the key things that Rockstar, one of Rockstar's key collaborators is DJ Poo, who used to be one of Ice Closed.
No, I wasn't laughing at DJ Poo. What I was laughing at is in the credits, when it's got the three scriptwriters, and it's like two white guys and DJ Poo. And you're like, I just would have loved to have been in that writing room, where they're like, over to you, Poo, for this bit.
This is a line I feel you should write.
Over to you, Poo, for this bit. Yeah, it's like, Dan Hauser, James Worrall and DJ Poo.
Because you just couldn't even be like, let me lay this line down. What do you think of this? It's just awkward for obvious reasons, because it's quite, you know, yeah, I'd say it's quite true to like, Boys in the Hood and other, you know, John Singleton stuff.
I think now that would definitely be interrogated a bit more.
It would be, but I think they took it really seriously. Yeah. And I think, because when you read about the amount of like research they did, photos they took, like textures they got from the environment, like they were, I think he also even says that we didn't want it to be like, I think too Toy Town-y, I think is the term he uses.
And so, yeah, I think it's, again, I think it's a good thing this was released before the age of that level of scrutiny, because I don't think it is like, the ways in which it's overtly offensive, I would say are not based on race in this game, they're more based on like other bits of the game, I would say that's where it seems more like people, obviously there are people going to have different perspectives on this, there might be some disagreement, but you don't see a lot of like criticism for, you don't see people grabbing bits of this game and being like, oh, I'm not sure this holds up so well 20 years later. They should be doing that with the Macca sequences in this game, but not, I would say, the Grove Street, Los Santos stuff, which it just feels authentic. It just feels like there's some reality behind it, and I guess that's probably, that is what I think how's the credits DJ Poo with providing.
Over to you, Poo, for this bit.
This is where it turns out DJ Poo wrote all the Macca stuff, and we're like, huh, there you go.
Over to you, Poo, for this bit.
I'm glad that's tickled you.
That's killed me there. That's so good. Over to you, Poo, for this.
Oh, that's so good.
But I think isn't it also... All right.
Sorry, sorry.
I'm done. Isn't it also through DJ Poo that they reach out to voice actors to play like the central Grove Street family? I'm pretty sure they found like CJ's actor, who is a young rapper at the time himself, like through the music world.
So there is like this sort of authentic in and then like a genuine attempt to like bring different voices into the mix. And it pays off, like the Grove Street group, you know, when they aren't in Terminator 2 all of a sudden, are having like quite a quite a sort of sincere believable time.
Yeah, it's when you read about the things, the other things they did to like make it feel authentic is they, they worked with LA based photographer and a clothing designer, who worked with like Cypress Hill, for example, and some of his photos helped to inform the look of the game and just get a feel for like California street culture without it being, yeah, not just really, yeah, like theme parking, which I think would have gone down quite badly. Can we talk about the ways in which this is maybe dated or quite cringe? The dating mechanic feels like it was designed by a teenage boy.
There was a bit where I took, this is probably where we should talk about Millie actually. There's a bit where I took Millie, the croupier, out on a date, and then I'm sure you got this too, and then like it says, oh, one of CJ's other girlfriends has turned up, and you don't see her face, but she shows up in what looks like a 1940s gangster car, and it's so like cartoonish and preposterous. I was like, this is like so naff as a romance mechanic.
You just pick a restaurant or bar to go to with your date, and then if your other girlfriend turns up, there's a chase sequence as you escape her by vehicle, and then you build up a meter until you shag, and then that's it. That's the entire mechanic basically. So that's one bit.
British characters, like I say, super cursed in these games.
Yeah, I guess that the thing specifically with the Millie character is she's like a mission blocker in that to continue with the casino heist, you have to steal a key card off her, and to get the key card, you have to basically sort of win her affections, which involves like obviously a lot of toing and froing, going out on dates, dealing with your other girlfriend like you say, dealing with like the time reset it takes like between dates, it's a bit hazy, and like the hours, mini works seem a bit vague, like when she is and isn't home is like doesn't seem hugely set in stone to me. And so if you do what I did, which is look it up online, loads of people like go on one date, and if you murder her on the date, you can just take the key card. And it's like a huge dilemma, particularly when you're against the clock trying to finish a game for a podcast like this, of like, what do I do?
Do I like go through this dating game, the kind of romance gang war at the end of the game? Or do I do this like quite morally reprehensible act just to see some more content? What did you do?
Right, so, let me establish that...
Oh, I wonder. I wonder where this is going.
So, what I will say about Millie is that, so you tail her in another boring mission to like a sex shop and you go and buy a gimp suit and she buys something.
Some dominatrix gear.
Yeah, exactly. And then you go back to hers and then I guess, I guess it's kind of like there's like a murkiness here where it's basically implied CJ is pretending to be someone else and there's a sexual encounter, but I'm not going to get into any of that. But then after that, she is aware who CJ is and you go on dates, etc.
And I will say that like, I think if I spent one year dating someone like Millie, it would have fixed me before I say that I did kill Millie only because it felt horrible. Because I weirdly felt like they do go to some effort to establish that she has some kind of inner life. And the game never really shows its hand and tells you that if you kill her, you'll get the card.
You have to read about this online to really learn it. And so, but there's a very grisly phone call where CJ calls Woozi afterwards and is like, shit got fucked up on a date or something. And you're like, oh God.
Like I feel like this is so not what this guy would do. And I've done it because like you say, that bar was going up too slowly. I had to get through this mission for this episode.
Cut to Woozi answering the call on a banana or something.
Oh dear. And now you're doing their work for them, Matthew. And so I killed Millie.
Did you kill Millie, Matthew?
I didn't know.
Oh, I am a worse person than you. I deserve to lose the Metacritic game.
Yeah. Well, I found out that you can accelerate the romance process with her if you turn up to the date in the gimp suit.
Oh, fuck's sake.
So I kept getting into the gimp suit and then driving around. She was never there. There's nothing worse than driving around someone's house in a gimp suit and then not in.
It's a real like, oh, this is embarrassing. Took them out a walk of shame home as it squeaks in your butt cheeks.
I'll come back at midday tomorrow and check again.
Oh, blast. I'm two hours early. This is a man fully encased in leather, but still wearing a pair of sunglasses on the outside because that's how my CJ rolls.
Yeah, I didn't want to kill Millie. I didn't feel good about it.
You only have to do two gimp visits and then she gives you the card.
Yeah, but if you do it sans gimp, it's at least four.
That's a big question. It's like when they're doing awesome games done quick, is it 100% gimp run or 100% sans gimp?
Oh dear. Sorry about that, Millie. I was a big fan of Millie actually.
I was sad to kill her. That was one of the worst things I've done in the game in recent times for sure. Okay.
I think it's also just homophobic. The OG Loic stuff is pretty homophobic. I'm not saying that's not true to the 90s because I think it was.
But again, it's a way in which the game feels maybe more dated than some other parts of the game.
I'd also say go to any blockbuster comedy released at that time and see the horrible, horrible shit. The Hangover, that was big at the same time. That's a fucking ghastly film.
That's got some real dubious stuff in it.
That's like five years later and they're still doing it.
Is that five years? What am I?
Yes, 09.
What am I thinking of? I went to see bawdy comedies at the cinema.
Old School maybe?
Yeah, maybe.
That's 03 I think.
But you know, it was the early noughties.
Yeah, it's just one of those ways in which we're like, if you didn't have this, I think this game would be slightly easier to defend. Like I say, the British characters are so cursed. Like, oh God, Macca.
Macca turns up right at the end as well. I was like, why is Macca in grocery? Like, why is he here?
I thought there's one bit where you send him, Ken and Kent off in a taxi to fuck off. Then they came back and I was like, why are you here again? I don't want you guys here.
Yeah, the last thing Macca says is, I'm getting breast implants, basically implying that he's going to be turned on by himself as he cranks it.
Maybe it's progressive, I don't know.
What are you saying? I'm king shaming Macca. I mean, is that what this is?
That's what this book does is go to. I didn't judge as you were driving around Las Venturas in a gimp suit, did I? I was waiting for Millie to come home from a shift at the casino.
Not doing it as our next door neighbours turn up. Just waiting for Millie, yes.
So we could go for a steak. Yeah, so, I mean, just mega cursed. Macca, definitely the hall of fame of Bad Hangs and Gta, I would say.
Okay, so I would say pretty much the last thing we're going to discuss here, Matthew, before we wrap up is the music in the game, which we've not really touched on much yet. So, how do you feel about the music in this? And what's your favourite station in the game?
Like I said, I think at the time, didn't necessarily appreciate maybe like how strong the music in this game is because I had quite fixed views on like, I was at university, I really like this, this and this and I don't like anything out of it. And one of those very irritating people, just a, you know, a late teenager, I guess. And playing it now, I don't know if my taste in music is just a lot more eclectic, but I enjoyed a lot more of this.
I actually like that the variety of the channels, like none of them are trying to like, like nail or like parody the era. They're actually quite, they feel like quite authentic radio stations that could exist at the time. And because of that, I just had a more natural relationship with the music in this game.
Like, my relationship with the music in this game is like listening to the real radio in the car now, where I hear songs I haven't heard before, you hear something enough that you're like, oh, actually, I do like that. And so, yeah, a rambling way of saying, I liked a lot of the stations here. I'm mostly Kdust, which is just the dad channel, but I quite like Radio X, K-Rose, the country music.
I like some of the stuff with like the older sort of soul funk music on it. I'm not massively into any of the sort of the actual like hip hop channels, or like the more contemporary stuff like in that way.
Yeah.
So it's mostly like throwback stuff, which is quite true to how I, what I listen to in the car now.
So it's funny because I think I might have made a throwaway remark that the radio stations aren't as big a part of the experience of San Andreas as they are in Vice City. And I think that is true to some extent because like we said, they're such a big part of the 80s identity of that game that if you took, I think it would have a more devastating effect on Vice City to take the music out of the game than it would on this game. Just because I think this manages to convey a lot more, the setting by its nature of having three different cities and the bits in between just feels more vivid.
But I definitely feel like I've got a deeper relationship with the music in this game after playing this again. I really like K-Dus as well. I think I've definitely got a newfound appreciation for some of the music that comes up on there.
It's definitely a station my dad will listen to. I think that it does a really good job of checking what the 90s boxes were. Like the Radio X is very much like the Gen X sort of rock sound, grunge sound that was taking over at that time.
That's really spot on. So too is like the presence of NWA or Ice Cube or Dr. Dre on Radio Los Santos. I'm a bit 50-50 on whether that stuff really lands with me, but I do.
I think there's some great hip hop in this for sure. And it really, again, enhances the setting. And I completely skipped the Talk Radio this time.
Didn't even bother. I think the GT3 is as funny as I ever got. And then it's never really quite hit against me, unfortunately.
But yeah, I do think that the music is a key part of it. And yeah, I agree that, yeah, some amazing tracks in this, but that's going to be my next question, Matthew, which is what are your five favourite songs in the game? Going back to it now and explain your choices.
Oh, they're such dad picks. Given like how exciting and varied the soundtrack is, this is just, it's also mid my picks. I really like Slow Ride by Fog Hat.
It was used in Dazed and Confused, so obviously a 70s track, but that came out in 1993, so I wondered if it was a nod to that. Just a great cruising song. I basically like the songs that accompany me on long drives when I haven't got much to think about and I can just enjoy a song, but yeah, like a literal song about taking a nice slow ride, take it easy.
I really like that song. Should I do all five of mine now? Yeah, go for it.
I like Barracuda by Heart, Galloping Guitar, da-dum-da-da-dum-da-da-dum-da-dum-da-dum. That just always makes me want to drive like a little bit faster than I'm comfortable driving in this game, but I like the music which has like quite a good rhythm to it. I find that those work best for me with the driving because they just make me think, oh yeah, I've kind of got, you know, this is sort of setting the pace in some way.
So that's a winner. I really liked, I didn't really know this song before, Hold The Line by Toto.
Oh, that's one of mine. Fucking love Hold The Line by Toto. It's so good.
Yeah, I always think it's about to turn into one of the tracks from Rhythm Heaven, because it's got, it's like swing. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's, that's like a song which I don't think I like registered with me the first time I heard it, but I listened to this radio station so much that I just developed a real appreciation for it over the course of the game. Like by the end I was always like humming it and thinking, oh great, it's that song.
Like that's the song which reflected what it is to actually like fall in love with a song on the radio in real life.
Yeah, I think it makes a good point. Love isn't always on time, Matthew. It turns up exactly when it wishes to.
Like you trying to pick up Millie in your gimp suit.
Yeah, I've got to hold the line in my gimp suit. That's important. I like A Horse with No Name by America.
Yeah, amazing.
I thought that was a Neil Young song the whole time I was listening to it. So I was like, oh, that's cool. Then I looked it up and was like, oh, isn't him, just a bloke, he sounds like him.
Do you remember this in Breaking Bad, the song?
Oh, no.
Yeah, I think there's an episode called Caballero Sin Nombre, and it's like a Spanish version of this. I think that's right. I'm probably getting that wrong, the word there for horse.
But yeah, so that kind of I kind of knew, but that's a perfect like desert, driving through the desert song.
Yeah, that's a good, that's a, I mean, because it's literally about a horse, so, you know, you could, well, it's not literally about a horse. I think it's about drugs. It could happen in like a modern Red Dead area.
That they are. That's very cool. There's loads of sort of sort of funky 70 things that I like that play on various like bounce and playback station.
I find it quite hard to sort of boil them down. I quite like, I don't know, is it, I guess it's the original Tainted Love by Gloria Jones before it was covered.
It's called The Rolocoaster of Love, which is a song from the American classic. It's a song from the American classic. It's a song from the American classic, which you just hear and you're like, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, that's just a great bit of, like I say, it has that kind of rhythm I really like.
I also really like Love Rolocoaster by Ohio Players, Even if it wasn't on my desired radio station, I d- I just listen to it anyway because it's quite cool. The Low Rider, I like that one as well.
Yeah. Yeah, loads of songs. But those are, yeah, definitely Slow Ride, but mainly because of the Dazed and Confused connection.
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, well, I think there's some great choices there, Matthew. And yeah, of my list, yeah, Hold the Lime is definitely in there.
I would say of the ones that have been sliced out, the one that I remember being in the PS2 one, that was a very key part of this game's identity, was Rage Against the Machines, Killing in the Name. Because when you hear that back, you're like, oh, that is so like a Radio X, like it's perfect for Radio X. So that was one that kind of came to mind.
It's like, oh, it's a shame that was gone. I would say Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode. Of course.
And I'm on the record about Depeche Mode.
That's the thing, whenever that came on, I just think, oh, that's the one Sam likes.
It's just so good. It's just funny that it just... Because I don't think there's any talking beforehand.
You just hear him go, reach out and touch, faith that it just kind of goes. And you're like, oh, man, what a banger this is. Great album, Violator.
Great album if you're 17 and sad, like I was in 2004. Ain't nothing but a G-thing, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, Matthew. A Samuel Roberts Imagine classic.
I listen to this loads. This is also from the Chronic album that I really got into during COVID, Matthew, you might remember. That happened, a weird thing that happened to me, but pretty amazing album.
There's two tracks from the Chronic.
Feels a bit too close to listen to something called Chronic during COVID.
I feel like I'm a bit out of my depth talking about hip-hop to be honest.
I didn't even dare. Years ago, I ventured that I enjoyed a Kanye West song and I got so much shit from my family about it, that I basically swore off an entire genre of music.
That seems like an overreaction. I would never profess to be an expert, or anything like that, but I don't know. I think this is pretty mainstream stuff.
The Chronic is a hugely respected album. Dr. Dre is amazing at his, the way he uses samples, and that is what's incredible on the album. It's just bits of music you've heard before, but the way they use, it's just a lot of innovation behind those tracks, and as well as the lyrical content being so shocking for the moment, but seems pretty pedestrian now, because we've had three decades of this, we had the noughties where this stuff became hugely mainstream, but I would never dare say to my mum and dad, hey mum, hey dad, I've been listening to The Chronic, and now I'm going to explain to you why, why I think Lil Ghetto Boy is such a good track.
I'd never do anything like that, so I understand Matthew. We do live in Bath after all, you know, it's not exactly Compton down here, you know, it's very different vibes, very different vibes.
Straight out of Whidcombe.
Eminence Front by The Who, that's got big driving over the horizon, seeing a city in the distance, like epic, Gta sort of track feel. And it was A Good Day by Ice Cube, which is a fun track. And I think that the song is basically about all the good things that happened to Ice Cube in one day.
That's basically what the story of the song is. And that's, those are my tracks Matthew.
Good tracks, between us, we've not embarrassed ourselves there.
No, now the more comical category. You can add 5 90s tracks to a San Andreas Classics FM radio station in GTA 6 that are not in this game Matthew. What do you go with?
So these are a bit too sincere to be like a laugh riot, but you know, let's see what happens. I was trying to, so I actually struggle with early noughties because I wasn't listening to like loads of me. You know, I was like a kid and it was just like whatever was playing in the car.
But I do have certain things which I associate with that time. I thought a bit of REM for early 90s, shiny, happy people probably. That's something my dad listened to in the car.
Just take me back, quite sit there. I mean, it's not very like in keeping with the game. You know, I don't think you want to be like listening to that while you do drive bys or whatever.
That's got a psychotic energy to it. But yeah, that's quite a good track. I thought a track for driving around late at night.
Chris Isaac, Wicked Game, which I really like that song. Obviously popularized in, I think it's late 80s, but popularized in 1990 when it was in Wild at Heart. It's got big David Lynch energy.
That song is slightly weird, sort of a nocturnal animal kind of song. I could see like driving around slightly ghosty, weird rendering of the countryside with that. This one's rank, but it's like this cheesy, but I quite like it.
It must have been Loved by Roxette, which was obviously in Pretty Woman. That's why I associated with the early 90s. This sounds quite early 90s to me.
Just like the synthy things. Also, like, just big bounc- This game doesn't have a lot of big bouncy pop that I particularly like, because it's a bit more sort of R&B inflected.
But that's because I've, you know, like I say, I've got incredibly middle mid-tastes, and that would definitely bring that in there. What's Up for Non Blondes? I like that song, that's a banger.
Yep, that's good. These are pretty good cuts.
I could see that blasting out while you like police chase after you. That's got a good like, fuck it, we're just going to go and do a load of crimes energy. Yeah, that's a good song.
And last of all, I was just trying to think of things that reminded me of San Francisco, and purely because it's on the soundtrack, so I married an axe murderer, an early 90s classic. There she goes by Velaz. Oh yeah, that's a pretty good choice.
It doesn't fit in any of the radio stations in this game, as it is, but it's quite jolly. I can hum along to that. I could see CJ humming, there she goes, when he's in his idle animation.
Yeah, I think those are good choices. I think you're right. If you try and plug them into existing radio stations, it becomes more challenging.
So I've got a few like, I've got two like that. So I think the one thing missing from Radio X is Pearl Jam. So I'd go with Alive by Pearl Jam.
My guess is I just couldn't get them for it, because they are like one of the, them and Nirvana feel like the main two who should be on Radio X. And then I'll go with, this is less Radio X, but a kind of fun novelty song for the time. Do you know No Rain by Blind Melon, Matthew?
I mean, I might do, but I just might not know it by that name.
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain. I love to, did you know that song? No, okay.
It's not twigging. It sounds nice.
A radio station with just you singing like that, I'd be tuning into that all day long.
I think that would have more of a lynching quality to be honest.
It's just you slightly singing in the background.
Occasionally, that little guy from Twin Peaks talking backwards in between, that would be the radio station. I think a lot of people will know that song though. It's a very quite famous music video with a girl dressed as a bumblebee.
This is a little bit more late 90s, but Rosa Parks by Outkast, an amazing track. I would definitely have that on a... Oh, that's the wrong coast, actually.
I fucked it. It would have to be a Liberty City. It's more like Georgia, so it doesn't work at all.
But anyway, a good 90s track.
Can you have the DJ make a joke about that?
Well, I've got some like cordier ones. I've got like... I was thinking for the dance, I think it's SFUR, I think is the dance radio in this, Missing by Everything But The Girl, the Todd Terry mix of that.
That's a banger, Matthew. And then I would go Let Me Be Your Fantasy by Baby D, another good 90s club track. And then finally, on the very corny front, Torn by Natalie and Brie.
Oh yeah. Just to... Now I'm talking your language.
Indeed. So, my very last question to you, Matthew, is to wrap up. Is this definitively better or worse than Vice City?
I thought way better.
Way better. I agree. I had a good time doing this.
Yeah. And we've definitely... I'm deniered about that in the part...
There's definitely been some jostling in between those two in like drafts and whatever, but I will never again try and get Vice City over San Andreas. That is a castle promise.
Yeah. I'm just pleased you had a good time with this because I feel like I've been 60 percent of the push for the Gta episodes. And so anytime I've trapped you into basically finishing a 30-hour game from 20 years ago, I'm a bit like, is this too much of a test of the podcast relationship?
And I'm pleased you followed me down this path. I think it's been a good time so far. I think Gta 4 will probably be agonizing in some ways, but entertaining in others.
So yeah.
Isn't it weird that Bully also ends with a mass riot?
Yeah. I think that's because I think Gta 3 has a bit that does that as well. Like there's like a gang war between the mafia and the triads and that.
And so I think they just love turning on the pedestrians go crazy mechanics basically. Yeah. So they probably just had that behaviour in there but anyway yeah.
San Andreas. Matthew deems it better than Vice City and I agree. That's the podcast.
Thank you so much for listening. This would end up being longer than I thought it would be but I feel like we've done the we've done San Andreas justice.
I think so. It's a big game. It requires a big podcast.
It does. So it's not like we gated parts of the podcast behind a code that you had to get by either dating a woman or murdering her in cold blood.
I mean that's literally what we do with Patreon.
Okay, so yes, if you'd like to listen to the Vice City version of this episode, like I say patreon.com/backpagepod, we will do Gta 4 in the main feed at some point in the next few months as well. But yes, this is good fun. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W Roberts on both. And like I say, patreon.com/backpagepod, if you like what we do and want to support us and the podcast, the backpagepod on social media, I am Samuel W Roberts. We have a four-person mega draft for you next week with a couple of amazing twists.
I think you are going to love that episode. It's going to be an absolute treat. So look forward to that.
Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Bye.
