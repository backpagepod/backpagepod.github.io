Hello and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we're time warping back to 2001. Something that was more challenging than I thought it'd be when we first suggested it. I thought I remembered things from this year, then it turned out I hadn't.
So-
Is this as big a time jump as Back to the Future?
Let's think, that's what, like from the 80s to the 50s? Maybe.
No.
No, wait, no, it's not quite that far. Wouldn't that be like, was that like 30 years? Or something like that?
I don't remember, but again-
Yeah, I guess parents are like in their 50s.
So, you know, I certainly look about, you know, 50 years old after my career in print media and the pandemic and my diet. So, you know, that's, you know, it's accumulated.
What I don't really understand is that I look like, in 2001, I look like Marty McFly's dweeby dad. So very uncool. But now I look like old Biff.
What's up with that? Which version of old Biff? The deferential one at the end.
Like pitiful old Biff.
I don't know if I see old Biff in you really. But yeah, I looked it up and it's 30 years. It's 1985 back to 55.
So yeah, not quite that far. Also, I'm not sure we can do best games of 1991. I think we might struggle with that one.
So if we don't mind the list being like three games long, because it'll end up being that inevitably. Picking fucking Minesweeper. I'm sure Minesweeper is not a 91 game, but I see it the furthest back my brain could go in the moment.
I did something yesterday I was going to talk about, but I can't remember what it is. So let's move on to this episode, Matthew. So yeah, absolutely good content.
So that can't be any worse than my earring observation, which I now incredibly regret.
Oh, no, that was such a minor thing, but like, yeah, sorry, because I feel like I put the boot in with the listeners. So Matthew mentioned that someone had an outgoing personality because they wore an earring. And yeah, later tried to kind of walk it back.
Well, the only reason I bring it up is because he's changed. It used to be a small square stud, but today it's like a big black ring. It's even more outgoing stud.
To be honest, if I'm telling the absolute truth, I probably agree with you. I probably would think the same thing as you, but I wouldn't vocalize it. That's the difference.
I would think that's probably slightly embarrassing if I say that or dad-like, and I will simply repeal it and say nothing. So that's the difference between you and me, I guess.
I should have just moved on. I don't know why I'm drawing all this attention to it again.
No, no idea really.
So it clearly makes me uneasy.
So people know that we do these different game of the year type episodes. We do like top 10 lists, alternating top 10 lists. We have done the years 2006 to 2016.
So we've covered like a massive range of time. And I put them all in a big Spotify playlist, actually. It's something like ridiculous, like 34 hours of audio.
There's just so much stuff in there. It can't all be good. It's got to be a lot of shite in there as well, Matthew.
But I had always wanted to go back a bit further to some of these early noughties years and talk about that period. Because I think that's where a lot of like our taste that informed this show really shape up. And I think it was also partly inspired.
I've been chain listening to the draft episodes of The Big Picture Matthew and did think, oh yeah, there are some like, you know, you do get slightly different types of anecdotes or observations when you go further back. And I knew we could like summon a list of 10 for this one. So that's kind of why I thought we would do this.
We did 2006. That was the furthest back we've been. But this is the first year we've done where we weren't working in games media.
So there's none of that element to it. Normally when we do these episodes, we tell magazine stories or whatever other ill-fated jobs we ended up in afterwards. But this time we don't have that.
So is it going to work, Matthew? Do you think there's enough meat on the bones for this episode?
Yes, hopefully. One thing I would say is that outside of reading NGC N64, I can't remember when N64 became NGC, but outside of reading that Nintendo magazine and maybe Games Master, I wasn't super engaged with much conversation around games. Reading through your plan and seeing your recap of the year, like in terms of conferences, so much of what was going on, I just had no idea.
This is the prime era where my very unpopular Xbox take was born, that no one was interested in Xbox, because I wasn't interested in Xbox, I knew nothing about it. So I will own up to very, very patchy knowledge outside of a very specific thing I was interested in at the time.
Yeah, it's an interesting one, because I've done a lot of research on this one, because I don't remember what happened at the different E3 conferences for this time, because E3 was something you exclusively experienced through magazines in new sections and previews basically. So there's not actually as much material to draw upon. For example, you can't even watch the Xbox conference from this year.
There are snapshots of it that are in the Xbox documentary they did in 2021, which is a really good documentary and that does give you quite an honest insight as to what was going on. But for the Sony and Nintendo ones, someone had done a grainy VHS recording of the different conferences, which is super handy for research. But like you, I didn't know any of this stuff really.
This year, the key thing for me, Matthew, why I wanted to choose this year is that this does represent the era that I properly click back into games after like a short hiatus. I feel like there is a pop culture phenomenon that happened in 1999-2000 called Pokemon. That occurs.
I feel like for that year or so, year and a half, what I was really doing was playing Pokemon into the Pokemon trading card game, and then also watching the anime, and then at the same time, watching The Simpsons as well. That's pretty much all I did. Then I went to school and did school things.
That was pretty much what I was up to. But at the end of this year, this is where I would say my modern, this is my journey to becoming a games journalist starts this year. I would say where this is where I become in-depth obsessed with games.
There was a handover between my gaming tastes as a boy, my gaming tastes as a teenager that occurs here.
As a man.
I didn't want to say man because I was most certainly not a man at the time, trust me. I was a very embarrassing boy doing a paper round. That's what's significant to me.
I do remember firsthand, some of the things that went on this year. I actually don't remember the NGC thing either. I do remember that buying the first issue of NGC, they had the Orange VHS on it, but I feel like that might have been 02 because the GameCube launch came a little bit later here, didn't it?
I feel like they probably wouldn't have rebadged the magazine then changed it. We could easily look this up and find out.
I would say we're reviewing the import stuff though.
That's a very good point actually. Then I think that was in the issue that they did. I'm just going to look it up actually when that magazine changed.
There is a solution to this.
Yeah. October 2001, so it was this year that I bought that issue. Purple cover, Mario Sunshine on the cover, and weirdly the second biggest hit is Crazy Taxi.
That's an interesting choice. Then there's a bit of Zelda in there as well. Some of the key Nintendo stuff had already occurred, and I would say the GameCube was starting to solidify at the end of the year.
I can see why they did that flip there. Do you remember your relationship with games at this time?
This year in particular is quite an interesting one. Definitely going into 2002, because while 2002, GameCube comes out and I'm absolutely obsessed with that. I would say that in my social life, 2001 marks going from secondary school to college, and when I went to college, my little traditional friendship group broke up a little bit, just because one of the guys went to a different college to us.
People reinvented themselves at college, and a lot of people reinvented themselves as not being into dweeby shit that I was into. So I feel like it suddenly became a bit of a solitary hobby for me, and I never found a new video game crowd, probably properly until I started working on NGamer in 2006. I was never like, actually, I tell a lie.
I had university friends who played a lot of multiplayer and were into games. But college for me is like games became quite private. Just because no one wanted to talk to me about fucking Mario Sunshine, or the GameCube because it looks like a silly children's box.
This was like everyone leaves secondary school and they're like, right, I'm going to college and no one knows how fucking lame I was at secondary school. So now I can be like cool and attractive to girls. I just kept being interested in point and click games.
Obviously, I'm a tiny bit younger than you. This year I was in year eight and nine basically, like the start of the year eight and then end of the year nine. So my friends of mine were into games, but I do remember that college moment in like 2004 where people, every lunchtime I used to go and play football on the field.
It was good for my mental health and when I stopped doing it, I became a right angry bastard. Basically, like I am now. Like I completely bypassed that by playing football every lunchtime.
It completely sorted me out mental health wise. Then at college, people were like-
Your super villain kryptonite is playing football. That turns you not into super villain.
Basically, but all the same kids I knew who liked football more than me or were better at football than me. They were like, yeah, we're just going to sit in the common room now, and we're just going to hang out, and we're just going to do that. We're not going to ever play football at lunchtimes.
They didn't have interest as far as I know. They just wanted to go work in Morrison's at the weekend and save up for a trip to fucking Iron App or some bullshit. You might argue that I was the grumpy Gus in that instance who was not fun, and was dragging everyone else down.
You may be accurate there, but certainly it felt different in this year for me. I definitely felt like I was on the same page as people when it came to interest. You're right, there was a switch that flicks, and then people suddenly aren't on your wavelength anymore.
It's a weird one, right?
Yeah. When I was at secondary school, we were going to my friend Craig's house at lunchtime, because we were prefects, and if you're a prefect, I think actually no year 11s could leave the school grounds. He lived around the corner.
We'd go there and we'd play like three games of Perfect Dark at lunchtime, every lunchtime. That was our school experience was so defined by games and being obsessed by games. So to go from that to suddenly college, where the people you suddenly spent with time with were spending time with other people, and we're really getting into music or whatever.
I know other things, other things that were perceived a bit more grown up or legitimate. Yeah, games felt slightly cursed for sure.
But that also means this year up until the end of secondary school, the first half of this year was still the period where I was only really playing one or two games a year, endlessly in multiplayer. The first half this year, I played Perfect Dark. That is pretty much all I played with my friends.
And I leave that style of gaming behind definitely from college forwards. I suddenly had a Saturday job and was buying games for myself. I was beginning to consume more stuff and have more access to things.
That definitely picks up more with when the GameCube comes out. But that's definitely a sort of shift within my playing and buying habits.
Yeah, this is the year I get a PlayStation 2. That's why it's basically the beginning of this new era of games for me. It was the first time my parents ever let me have a games console.
They never bought one. That's not true, actually. I had a Mega Drive.
But the Mega Drive, I got really late. I never had a console that was concurrent with the times, new games being released for it. And also, as much as there were some games I really liked in the Mega Drive, I really just found there were like three or four.
I just played over and over again, then about eight I just ignored because they were just rubbish. That was my relation with that. And then you kind of reach this age where, like you say, maybe you're not getting that many games, but you have a bit more power over the games that you are getting.
Yeah.
So that changes things a little bit. And yeah, that starts here. This is a major year for me because of the PS2.
There was like a point where someone told me what Grand Theft Auto 3 was, and then I just had to fucking get a PS2. That was this year. I used to cycle to school, this little mate called Donald, and he had a brother called Douglas, which is the name of two trains and Thomas the Tank Engine.
I always found that confusing. And basically, he told me about 3D Grand Theft Auto, and I would ask about it basically on the cycle to school every single day, and he would tell me about something new that his brother did in this game. And I was like, I have to fucking get a PS2.
And I think I even went to my parents and was like, okay, you never let me get a PS1 or an N64 because you said that all the best games were on PC, so you don't need to buy that as well. But now there are things that I need to play on this. And I think they actually understood, and that's how I ended up with one basically.
What a lovely little image you've painted there of you two exchanging GTA 3 stories on the back of bikes. I like that a lot. That's very sweet.
I was very bad at riding a bike. I'm very uncoordinated. And the idea, I think even talking to someone would have like distracted me from the act of staying on the bike.
So that story just, that seems wild to me.
Yeah, actually like it sounds like if you were to do a Stranger Things style story set in 2001, you would add that kind of detail to make it seem plausible. You know what I mean? Like two kids talking about GTA 3 on the cycle to school.
Some detail to like de-romanticize it a bit. For ages, I had this problem with my bike as a teenager, where the brakes would just squeak over and over again. So every like five seconds, it would be like, and it was horrible.
And you would see like, you know, as you're passing other kids, everyone just looking at me like, what the fuck is that bike doing kind of thing? So that like maybe drags it down a little bit. I think even Donald was slightly embarrassed that my broken bike was, I just was, I left it that way for about a year.
My dad could never fix it. He would like adjust the brakes and go, oh, that's it, it's sorted now. And then I get on it and do the same thing.
I was like, it's not sorted dad. And that was basically like, that was the reality behind the bike situation.
Your friend bellowing Gta 3 tripping over the sound of squeaks. And then you get to the second island.
Yeah, so like a key, I think that happened to be the middle of this year was we moved house across town basically. I lived, grew up in Gosport in Hampshire, which is Tory heartland. I think it had the highest fucking Brexit vote in some area, like very close to like the highest, like Brexit split, so really cursed that.
We moved across town from like a semi detached house. There's quite nice detached house because my mom used to work in a factory then she trained up to be a teacher. My dad was always a firefighter.
And they just basically like climbed the ladder a tiny bit and went from, I would say like, you know, sort of like upper working class to lower middle class, I would say. So that's the sort of thing that happens this year. And then moving is like, I don't know, a bit of a, it sort of changes my friendship group because the people you have access to are a bit different.
That's how me and that Donald guy become friends. There's another kid called Ryan around the corner who used to hang out with. There was this little bench that these, some ruffian teenagers had scrawled like Mike, Dave and Bob into the bench or something.
And we will see, also we sit in the same positions. I think I was Mike, I was just sat on the right. And then those two would take their other positions.
We would sit and looking at this chain link fence with a no ball game sign, with a football, kicking the football against the fence and the sign over and over again for basically three years. And that starts this year. So that sounds really tedious, but these are the sort of things that seem significant to you in retrospect.
Do you know what I mean? When you try and remember times like that. Can you remember anything like that?
Like details of your life, you know?
Yeah, we moved to us. I grew up in a small town outside Winchester called Allsford. It's quite nice, very sort of middle class sound place.
And we moved to a house my stepdad built, built a house for the family in this village called Bishop Sutton just outside. So we went there and I had, there was one pub in the village called The Ship. And so I had a Saturday job there washing up.
I think that started before 2001, but I used to go and wash up in this pub and I absolutely hated it because I'm very queasy around leftover food. I don't like sauces and I've got lots of food hang ups. I don't like glistening things.
The idea of having just a succession of plates with ketchup smears and leftover gravy. And it's just all this nightmare stuff or baked beans. I really hate baked beans to the degree I don't even want to touch the beans.
So having to like wash up that kind of stuff with this very like angry Scottish guy called Stuart who ran the pub and was just like everything you think chefs are in terms of like raging and swearing even though it's this like quite small pub kitchen. I don't know if he could come from like, you know, a bigger kitchen or a more kind of professional background. And my main two things from washing up in the pub, they always they used to call me the Marigold man because I wore a pair of yellow Marigold rubber gloves.
So that always stuck. And there was a guy, there was another guy, an older guy who was like a kitchen assistant called Lauren. And he had two claims to fame.
One was he told me a story that he blew up the science block at the school that I currently go to, which I know isn't true, because that just isn't the thing that ever happened. He said he blew it up using the gas taps, which is horseshit. And his other claim to fame was that he had every single volume of Now That's What I Call Music.
What a combo. He would talk about this, like, it was like his big kind of icebreaker or kind of like introduction to things. It'd be like, oh, you know, you won't, you'll never guess what I've got.
And he'd be like, I have no idea. And he'd be like, well, you know, I'll give you a clue. It's like music related.
And you'd be like, I don't know, like a fucking Beatles autograph or something important from history. And it would inevitably be, no, I have now I have every volume of now that's what I call music, which at the point at this point in time, I think there are probably only like 30. So as a boss, that's like, I've got 30% or it's really not an achievement.
Not compared to blowing up a science block, I'll be honest.
Yeah, which didn't, but compared to something that didn't happen, I hope that, you know, he's established himself as a mad fantasist and like maybe he didn't have now that's why I call music. Maybe he was peddling two lies and was hoping the bigger lie would kind of, you know, warm you up to the lesser one. But yeah, that was that was a lot of my evenings listening to a man talk about now that's what I call music.
If any song came on the radio that was on one of those tapes, that would trigger like a, oh, you know what this is on? And he'd be like, I don't know. Now that's what I call music, volume five and it would be like, no, eight.
So I had that conversation a lot. My life is quite hell, hellish.
Did it pay at least enough for you to like buy in 64 games or whatever you're doing with your money?
Yeah, yeah. Because this year I switched from that to home base. I can't remember exactly when that happened or when certain games came out.
But home base was like a big step up. But yeah, like they used to pay me in little brown envelopes. You know, I used to get them the money in cash and coins in a little brown envelope.
Brown because it was stained with brown sauce from the plates, Matthew.
The final test. The final fuck you. But yeah, like when you start buying games, like that's quite a big, you know, it seems really dumb to say like, that's quite a big moment in a gamer's life.
But suddenly going, I have saved up 40 quid and can buy a PC game. And I really want to make sure that's a good game or, you know, you just become so much more aware of stuff where previously I wouldn't even think about, you know, like if you only get a game Christmas and birthday or whatever, like it's almost not worth the bother of kind of thinking about what you might have. Because you're like, well, I'm going to have this and, you know, like, obviously, Perfect Dark is the thing I want, you know, that's the that's the obvious winner.
But now you're like, you're in the realms where you can like afford to make mistakes. You may be finally in the realm where you can afford to buy a seven out of 10 game instead of a nine out of 10 game, take a punt on it and see what happens.
Amazing. Yeah, yeah, like that sort of like kind of happened for me this year, because I got a paper round for the first time. So I was suddenly like accumulating, I was paid like £5.30 a week for like five shifts.
It wasn't actually that that hard to do. Like I, at one point, I think it went down to like eight papers a day and I could do it in 20 minutes. And it was just felt like a free £5 basically, by just by taking a pound a shift.
Yeah, it's like, it's pretty seems pretty poor in retrospect, I guess.
But yeah, 20 minutes though, pound for 20 minutes. That's not bad.
Yeah, I like basically you had to work your way up the like one stop pecking order because when I first started doing it, the shift I got was like 38 papers. And it took me so long to do it on a Saturday. Like I remember having a panic attack about how the hell am I going to do this every single night down for the rest of my life, basically.
That's what it felt like at the time. But then like quickly boys would like leave, you know, they go work in the actual one stop and put the uniform on and everything. So easier shifts would would open up and the new kid would be doomed with your old one basically.
And that was kind of like how it worked. So, yeah, I think I just like, you know, warmed my way up. Also, the thing you know that you would also do is you would send Christmas cards when you're a paperboy because someone gave me a tip off like an older paperboy said an old hand said, if you send them Christmas cards, they'll give you like a tip.
And I made some I think I made 100 quid from doing that. Yeah, it was I was massive. Like having that was huge.
So I basically sat on that money until I got my PS2 and that's how I end up buying like the memory card and the games and stuff.
So yeah, my big side hustle was at home base. If you if you did, if you were on trolley duty, you can keep any excess pounds you collected.
Oh, nice.
Well, I don't know if you were technically allowed to keep them, but everyone did keep them.
Right.
Because sometimes I don't know what state of mind you've got to be where you put a pound in a trolley, you get to your car and you're like, I cannot be fucked to walk across the car park and get my pound back. I'm just going to leave it here. But for Old Castle with this special trolley skeleton key, which I had, you could go around and boop.
That key was incredibly powerful because I never did this for obvious reasons. But when you're in a store and you just see all these trolleys everywhere, you're like, I could just walk around popping pounds out of all these trolleys that are in use. That would be instant fired if you did.
But it's a powerful drug, the trolley key.
Yeah. I try the other stray memories. I had a rivalry with another paperboy.
That was like something else that happened, who I ended up being pals with. But I remember at one point him chasing me. He was like this kid called Mark.
And I can't remember what he was upset about. But he just like rode after me and would start screaming at me. And I can't remember why.
And this is a kind of like petty small town nonsense I would sort of find myself in. The weird thing about this period as well is I have a best friend who like was a bit embarrassed about being my best friend. That was strange.
I was in school. I was in them because we used to be separated by like language classes. That's how they structured it.
You're basically like you were we were like Spanish group two or something. We had like eight boys in our class and 22 girls. It's quite quite different sort of gender split.
And so I ended up being pals with this kid from this quite this quite popular kid. But we had like loads in common like we both watched obviously The Simpsons every night. But we watched we're both obsessed with SMTV as well, which for our non UK listeners is like basically like a kids variety show.
I suppose I suppose like it's probably best compared to something like Saturday Night Live or something but made for kids.
It was basically like and on Saturday mornings instead of evenings.
Yeah, exactly. And it's basically just a bunch of skits. And then they'd show like kids programs like Pokemon in between and Sabrina the Teenage Witch stuff like that.
So it was like they were they were slightly anarchic. The hosts were quite, you know, quite fun and and Dec, they were quite like, you know, basically it was just.
Cat Deely.
Yeah, exactly. They were just cat Deely erasure there. Sorry about that.
But yeah, but yeah, like basically the humor was was sort of set at adult level, but all the teenagers watching really clicked with it. So I think it's like quite fondly remembered even all these years later.
So we had a game they used to play where they had to rhyme the animal name.
Wonky Donkey.
That's gold.
That was pretty good. Chums is pretty good. Their Friends parody.
The best one, though, was Dec Says, where Dec would give out life advice, but it would flash back to his tragic childhood where he had like a his voice hadn't broke. And that was that was the one we used to really dig. So, yeah, we used to talk about that stuff constantly.
But when he was around his more popular pals, he was definitely like distancing himself from me. And it made things like a little bit odd where we would like hang out again and have loads in common and stuff. And I was like, OK, that's weird.
I'm embarrassing for someone.
That's yeah, that was that's what it felt like going to college. Because you go to college in Winchester. Now, obviously, Winchester, by most people's standards, is like the most lightweight place in the world.
Like very, very soft boys from Winchester. But like in our minds, you know, we were coming from this little village secondary school, going to a place and everyone, you know, everyone else in the same year as us, so the lower six people, they seemed so much more grown up and like, you know, world, not world wise. What's the phrase?
Worldly, is that the right term?
Worldly, maybe, is that it? Yeah. Like, you know, they were just, they all seemed to have like really fucking lived.
We all felt incredibly shouted and some people just took to that and blended it really well and were able to sort of fake it till they make it. But I was always quite sort of stubborn and sort of determined never ever to change, which is a terrible, terrible trait of mine. So you end up just sort of glomming on to like a few other kind of similar minded freaks.
Well, you can see why games media ends up becoming very significant to you and me, right? Because you finally get to meet the like minded people you never met when you were a teenager, right?
Yeah, yeah. I don't want to throw everyone under the bus. I had loads of really nice friends, but I think part of it as well was that my home base shift was Friday night, which was obviously the night most people started going out in Winchester after college and getting into sort of slightly more adult nightlife, I guess, where I went to home base, gleefully collected pounds from trolleys and then walked home to the bus station.
I'd buy a huge bar of chocolate in Blockbuster Video next to the bus station and then go home and just eat loads of fucking chocolate.
Play Paper Mario and have no one to discuss it with, basically.
But that's like literally my... I thought I was living the dream. Like, you know, the other part of this, which for people who don't know, homemade, you know, foreign listeners or people who, you know, younger people who don't remember the old home base uniforms, were green trousers and green tops, you were just a big green thing.
And walking down and just having all the people out on Friday night bellowing shit at you because you were dressed all in green, like I was such a target for them because I'm quite tall and like gangly and weird looking. And like I say, very Marty McFly's dad. Imagine a big green Marty McFly's dad.
Like if you were looking for someone to pick on on a Friday night, you'd definitely pick on me. But as long as I could get to Blockbuster, get into the safety of Blockbuster, get my chocolate, maybe peruse the ex rental video games and then get on the bus. You know, that was that was good times.
I also had a my pride and joy was I had a mini fridge.
Right. That's a very 2001 thing to own very much.
I thought it was the most grown up thing in the world because you were like, I finally have like my own food. It's liberated from the family fridge. I have stuff which belongs just to me.
And I used to fill it with two finger Kit Kats. I used to get multi packs of two finger Kit Kats and cartons of apple juice. And it was just drinking tiny portions of apple juice and tiny portions of Kit Kats thinking like I'd fucking made it.
I remember this as the year that my mum threw out my inflatable armchair. That was a thing that people had from the 90s. My mum was like, it's too disgusting.
It just has to not be in the house anymore. And then bought me an actual armchair from some charity shop. I sat in that.
Yeah, that was like must have things. Mini fridge, inflatable armchair, lava lamp.
Lava lamp, of course. Yeah, that's really funny. Well, what a picture that paints.
So, having no one to talk to about a fucking Paper Mario, Matthew, that must have been tough.
One of my college friends, though, started dating this older guy and it was great because through her, I could get her old boyfriend to start buying me 18 rated games.
Nice.
This was a year later, but I definitely remember cashing in on that to get Soldier of Fortune 2. I'm thinking like, this is absolutely amazing. This has happened.
One of my other friends had a crush on this other friend. This older boyfriend being on the scene was always a point of contention. I was very, out of solidarity, very anti-older boyfriend until he started buying me violent video games.
I'd give him my 30 quid and he'd go into game and buy them for me and then it was like, this guy's all right, so a lot of like beer dramatic.
Gets you a beer and says, a little thing for the fridge, Matthew, just sends you on your way.
Yeah, it's funny, it was quite a rich time for like weird gaming happenings.
Yeah, yeah, it was a little bit. Do you have any like mag memories from this year? Because I remember like being on the way, I used to just stand in the one stop where I did my paper round, and I would just read all the games mags that weren't in packaging.
And I like had a feeling I was going to get a PS2 after my mum started vaguely asking for clues about games in a really like not very subtle way. She was like, my students were talking to the teacher, my students are talking about this game called SSX Tricky, what do you know about that? And I was like, I think it's like a snowboarding game.
And then she asked me about like James Bond, and I was like, Oh, yeah, I don't think this one's very good, because it's not GoldenEye, and it's like things like that, they still end up buying the Agent Under Fire, by the way, that was tough. But yeah, I remember like buying my first copy of official PlayStation 2 magazine, obviously I've been reading games mags before this, I was still reading PC Gamer every now and then at this point. But I remember getting this and like it came with a demo disc that was in this big old DVD case, that was exciting.
It was like a DVD, it was packed with stuff. I think I had like eight demos on it, I had like SmackDown, which I obviously didn't care about, and Silent Hill 2, and Wipeout Fusion, Dark Cloud, all these different games. I was just like, wow, what are these?
And then the cover was Dante from Devil May Cry. And it was like that was the big review of that issue. And so that felt fundamental to me.
I felt like, you know, era defining in a lot of ways. But what about you, Matthew? Do you remember much from this time?
Yeah, I mean, individual issues of like, you know, GameCube surfacing and being really excited, just, you know, drinking in all these screenshots of games, you know, Mario Sunshine, Smash Brothers thinking, you know, these things just look absolutely amazing. I think I had that same video you had, which had, you know, footage of like GameCube games like Rogue Leader and looking at it and, you know, we've spoken before about seeing footage of that for the first time being like, this is the best graphics a game has ever had. There has never been lighting like this in a video game as you saw clips of the Death Star.
So like, GameCube was, it seemed so far away. I mean, it was only like six months later that came out in the UK, but, you know, that was like a lifetime for you back then, because, you know, time moves slow when you're younger, obviously, that's how it works. So that was, that was like, you know, death and, but, you know, the magazines gave me just enough, you know, like, you know, to kind of keep that dream alive.
I definitely remember my brother getting Official PlayStation 2, I can't remember if he maybe got his PlayStation 2 for Christmas that year. But after that, getting, yeah, Official PlayStation 2 magazine with the demo discs and that being, you know, really, really exciting as well. Oh, no, it must have been the year later.
Anyway, whatever. Yeah, you know, mags were like, they were your access to games, you know, that's, that's all we had, although actually the, I remember at college computer rooms having like pretty amazing internet where you could finally watch like early videos of games starting to appear in places. You know, I have very distinct memories of watching, not gaming related, but like probably, you know, a year later or two years later, whenever it was, watching like the Matrix Revolutions trailer and, you know, on the college PC and just watching that on an endless loop and kind of beginning to kind of consume online pop culture a bit.
So that was, that was exciting, but.
Yeah, like I completely agree. I mean, actually, the one thing I remember from this year is I remember like going into the temporary internet files and dragging like the GameCube trailer sort of videos for like Smash Bros, Melee and Star Fox and something else off of there to watch like in my own time without using the 56K modem, I guess. So I remember doing that too.
And yeah, like the that that video on NGC was super significant. Like I watched that loads. So yeah, I was really pumped for for those games.
So that was definitely part of it. Actually, weirdly, the issue I remember like blowing things open a bit was I had a copy of Games Master that had Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 on the cover, and that I think that was like, I think that basically like the intersection of everything that was about to happen in games, like the launch of the GameCube, the launch of the Xbox, that and then the PS2 being this huge dominant thing just made that moment seem super exciting. I just remember this suddenly flipped to being like the number one thing I was invested in games, you know, and it had been that way on and off.
But this was the this was the point where basically I would never turn back from games, and they would come to like basically, you know, basically be the main interest and, you know, driving force of my life to some some degree.
Yeah, I think I was maybe more of a film guy to my peers, because that's definitely I know I was always into films and, you know, my friends who are into games are also into films, but particularly at college, the people I made friends with, it was mostly through a sort of shared love of film. You know, I did film studies, and some of my closer friends, you know, came out of that class, you know, going to the city, you know, being in Winchester, where there was a cinema, or having like days where we only had like a half day so you could then go to Baton Stoke and watch a couple of films or whatever. You know, along with the freedom to buy games, you suddenly had the freedom to just get yourself to places, and, you know, just more time on your hands to just sort of enjoy, you know, you were kind of trusted to run your own life a bit more, which you weren't in secondary school, I never was, I wasn't, I didn't feel that way, so, you know, being able to like go out of my way to watch whatever, whatever was out that year.
Yeah, like, that was one of the questions I was going to ask, actually, is, pop culture-wise, I think this is a very significant year, because you have Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings kick off this year, obviously, at the time, I was mega invested in Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings wasn't really on my radar, I sort of saw some fusty old books that my aunt had, and like wasn't bothered about it, but then, by the end of the year, it flipped, and I thought the Harry Potter film was a bit lame when I first saw it, I think it's actually pretty good in retrospect, the first one, it's kind of like, you know, like a classic kiddie film, it's actually not too badly done, if we're through the prism of nostalgia, but Lord of the Rings was obviously like a heavy hitter, and then just sort of changed everything, but, to be honest, though, the sort of like a key event that happened to me was watching Tim Burton's terrible Planet of the Apes film this year, and thinking I've never seen a more beautiful woman than Estella Warren, but that was a huge moment, that was a massive moment for me in 2001, Matthew, but, What about you and pop culture? Do you remember anything from this year?
Yeah. I had actually forgotten that this is when Lord of the Rings kicked off, but that was just absolutely amazing. Like a top five all-time cinema experience.
Just couldn't believe what they'd done with it. I remember being really excited for AI, because I always have been a big Spielberg head, and the idea of Spielberg incubate, that seemed really exciting. That's all wrapped up with like, there's a lot of weird post-911 stuff.
My key memory of AI was going to see it, and they're being signed everywhere in the cinema going, just to warn you, in AI, the future is depicted and shows the demolished Twin Towers. The first trigger warning I ever saw was for AI, where it was just like, watch out, you may find this shocking, but the towers aren't here in this world too. So that was a weird thing.
A direct cinematic memory tied in with that was on September 11th itself, we went to see Moulin Rouge, which is like the most unreal, bizarre thing. In hindsight, a very strange thing to see on September 11th. I don't think it had really sunk in like what had happened, or we'd booked tickets, so we were like, yeah, we better go, and you don't want to waste this ticket.
Then you go and see it and it's just, I love Moulin Rouge, I think it's absolutely amazing film. I think it's like my favorite Baz Luhrmann film by quite a distance, and just going and seeing something that's just so mad, and alive, and different, and weird, and all this strangeness in there, and then coming out into just that event, consuming everything for a month afterwards, that seemed super jarring and weird. That was quite an odd tie.
It was like the first majorly, or maybe Princess Diana dying, but in their lifetimes, where we were grown up enough to understand it or compute, that was odd. To have this thing, we were like, oh, well, this is going to go on to define everything from now on. And we went to see fucking Ewan McGregor being auto-tuned through the sound of music.
All I remember is how quiet the streets were. That's all I remember. And I remember a kid going past me and telling me what happened, because it sort of happened about school wrapping up time, and going back three o'clock our time, I guess, because I'm morning in America.
So I remember just being on the TV in the corner of the kitchen and my dad watching it. I don't remember him saying anything, but it just seemed so surreal and shocking. Yeah, but I didn't see Moulin Rouge that day, I'll be honest.
That's good.
So it's a weird one because pop culture-wise, it's not really related to it, but 24 kicks off this year, and that's one of the key, one of the signature post-911 series, isn't it? But that's not why it existed, but it came to shape that show in a lot of ways. So that was a key moment.
I think Alias started this year as well, Matthew.
I came to Alias later, though, in box set form, a couple of years after, maybe when Series 2 had just come out on box set.
Yeah, exactly the same for me. So that wasn't a present-day thing. But yeah, that aside, I think Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were the major things from this year.
I don't really remember anything else.
I think I'd maybe fallen out of love with Buffy by now.
Oh, right, yeah, because it's the end of Season 5, I guess, where she dies, right? So that would have been this year, I think.
So this is the thing. It all gets into like bleak, sad Buffy. Where I was slightly more frivolous, throw away early Buffy.
Pre-mum death.
I think you are right about that. At the time, I would have argued against that, but yeah. I've said it before on the podcast, but the essence of that show was the high school years.
It was really fucking good when it was in high school. And it was kind of fun when it was at college, but high school was like, yeah, that was tip top. They really got good at that.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Don't remember a lot else apart from that. A few dramas, watching that, I was binging that, that was one of my shows, I guess.
Malcolm in the Middle, the BBC2 teatime sort of block was solid, Matthew Simpson's Fresh Prince, Malcolm in the Middle, and then Top of the Box 2 or Star Trek, preferably Top of the Box 2 with me. But yeah, that was kind of like what I did every single night for about five years.
So, yeah, I don't think this year had like a particularly classic kind of, you know, there's always a film which sort of defines your kind of teen generation or like your kind of teen comedy that everyone's into, you know, like your American Pie or your Road Trip or your whatever. I don't know that 2001 added anything like particularly crucial to the canon.
I don't think so. Is this like old school year maybe? No, maybe a bit later, actually.
No, that's a bit later. I just looked up comedy, 2001 comedies and it's like quite a big year for rom-coms or it's like rom-coms are like, you know, you've got a lot of like wedding planners and serendipity. Kate and Leopold with Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman.
Oh, fucking hell. I remember having a trailer for that on like some DVD I had and it would play before every single time you'd watch it and I was like, oh, man, what a fucking curse that is to give people American Pie 2. That was this year.
That was kind of just a sort of like good hang film. I don't think anything that significant really happened in it. If I recall, Matthew, he just like he just tried to get laid.
That's basically it.
Yeah, I thought it was a bit, I thought it was a bit naff. Yeah, you know, I was above, I was above, I was above American Pie.
I think, yeah, yeah, I think like Fellowship was the film that defined the year. I think AI is the underrated masterpiece from this year. I only saw that for the first time this year.
And that film fucking is fucking amazing, that film. It's so, so good. So I'm a big fan.
Then Spider-Man would be the film next year that would be the big film. So I think it was Fellowship this year, pretty much. But yeah, so Donnie Darko.
Oh, yeah, it's a good point, actually. That was definitely that got bigger later when that song was like Christmas number one. That felt like that was when that really took off.
I had this CD that came free with Total Film, which was like music of the movies or something. It had like 10 tracks from different key soundtracks that year. And it had that song way before it became number one in the charts.
I remember listening to that like endlessly on my computer. I was about to share a very nerdy anecdote.
Why not?
I don't know why this just popped into my head. I used to listen to this CD endlessly on a loop. And I think it is in Mad World, that particular track rather than one of the other tracks on the CD.
But there was a particular bit in that song, which really sounded like my stepdad shouting my name from downstairs. And every time it played, I'd be like, oh, God, who's that? Who wants me downstairs?
And I'd go down and be like, never be like, no, no one. No one shouted for you. Like, there's just a bit of one of those songs that sounded like someone going, Matt!
Is it because he's like the way he goes, Mad World? It's like the year towards the end. Because I think it's sort of like the mix, it means that like it becomes, there's a little bit of like, I don't know, voice modulation going on.
So maybe that's where it happened.
There was something in that CD that sounded like someone bellowing at me.
I've not heard that song for years. I've not seen Donnie Darko for years, but that was, what a fucking great film that was. Should they let Richard Kelly out of movie jail?
Matthew, what do you think he belongs there? The Box.
That film he made about The Box is the worst film I've ever seen. Absolutely fuck him. For that and that awful LA one.
Southern Tales.
Okay. Oh, what the... The Worst Crime, No Forgiveness.
That's a double Bill Stinker-oony right there. That is tough.
World of Tenenbaums, 2001.
Oh, yeah. Well, there you go. Another really sort of significant film.
Oh, that was great. I made my mum take me to see that. And that was great.
Such a good film. I didn't understand a lot of the jokes in it, I don't think. A lot of the weird references that Wes Anderson puts into a lot of these things, but I remember thinking when it played Hey Jude at the start was really cool.
That was my sophisticated take.
That was like, I think a lot of people's first contact with his style was with this film as well. So yeah, like pop culture, I think pop culture is pretty good this year. And that does extend to games as well.
I think that the slightly weird thing about this episode, Matthew, and we talked about this off air, but do you think it's a problem for us that a lot of the era defining 2001 games that our US listeners will be thinking about don't reach Europe until 2002 and therefore they avoid being on our list and they maybe hit the output of the episode a little bit? How much of a factor do you think that is in this episode?
Yeah, I think that's definitely a factor. If anything, it lets some other games breathe, they don't get trampled on. But yeah, it reflects the experience.
I mean, it's a little bit bogus because a lot of my picks are things that I discovered quite a bit later rather than necessarily at the time. I think if this was an honest top 10 of what I actually played in 2001, it was half a year of Perfect Dark, like I said, and then half a year of just being excited about GameCube and not really buying a huge amount of other stuff. And N64 felt like it was really winding down.
So there wasn't a lot of that. It's just something people have to deal with.
Yeah, what it does mean is that 2002 will be a banger episode, so it will work out in the long run, basically. So yeah, it should be OK. OK, so Matthew, any more reflections before we move on?
I have enjoyed this. We've talked for 50 minutes about nonsense.
I feel like I've painted a suitably depressing picture of my 16 year old self.
Yeah, I just imagine a man called Stuart going, Matthew, there's still some ketchup on this fucking plate and then just like that is actually like giving me crazy flashbacks.
It was like he used to shout service in a service, but kind of I'm not going to do it. I apologize to any Scottish listeners.
I kind of want to just like cut in loads of clips of fucking Gary Jules going mad world in here just to see if it kind of freaks you out. You know, just listening back to it. Oh, my stepdad's calling me.
Oh, that's funny. Yeah, this has been fun, though. I hope our listeners have enjoyed that weird sort of like chip them and relate.
You probably understand a lot more about us from hearing that, to be honest, like, you know, our various personalities you're trapped with every Friday when you listen to this podcast. Okay, so major events and games in 2001. This is such a significant year.
You have the launch of the GameCube and the Xbox in North America and obviously in Japan as well for the GameCube. I don't know, the Xbox, I think, launches in 2002 in Japan, I think. And obviously those consoles wouldn't launch here.
You have the launch of the GBA, so, you know, very significant, you know, like the first sort of advance in Nintendo's handheld technology in more than 10 years, I think. It was a massive, massive way. And obviously there's a Game Boy Color in between, but that felt very much like a stop gap despite producing some really significant games.
GBA, so obviously this was the one that didn't have a backlight, so you couldn't fucking see what was going on on the screen. Matthew, did you have any GBA-based experiences this year?
No, no, I didn't get into GBA stuff until like super late, I mean, I think the first one I owned was probably the Micro, so super, super late. I had to like save my money and throw it in with GameCube, I didn't have enough money to have both.
That's fair. My friend Donald had a GBA and he had original Mario Advance, which is rubbish, because it was the Mario no one cares about. I think it's just a go in and out of pipes Mario, I don't think anything significant can happen to it.
Wasn't it that and Super Mario Bros 2?
Oh, okay, so it wasn't… So that's a really weird game, isn't it? That one?
Yeah, that's the one which isn't quite a Mario with all the throwing turnips.
Oh yeah, that came up on some episode we did, didn't it? Like, I remember you talking about that moment. But yeah, he had that and he had the Robot Wars game, and I played the absolute shit out of that Robot Wars game.
It wasn't very good. It must have been made for about £500. It was like very basic sprites, top down, and then the Robot Wars is a huge thing to me as a teenager.
I'm sure it was to you as well, Matthew.
Just like, you know, yeah, basically like who's your favourite house robot?
I guess it would be Matilda. I mean, Matilda is a classic answer, right? Obviously, it was a big HypnoDisc head.
I think a lot of us were.
I like the idea of HypnoDisc just because of the, you know, the big chainsaw looks really exciting. HypnoDisc looked like the one that could probably fuck up a human the most. Like, you just drive that thing into its ankles.
Yeah, I had this. I had this. Again, this is just popped into my head.
I used to have this quite extended schtick about how I would rob a bank with the Robot Wars robot. And I would say that to a lot of people.
Amazing. So have you got any more information to share on how that would work?
No, just that I would, like, as I said, driving the HypnoDisc into people's ankles, I was like, oh yeah, that, you know, it's kind of coming back to me. That's something I said 20 years ago. Yeah.
So killer lock casing the joint, you know, John, it was important to have, like, you know, good, good.
I mean, back then, we weren't calling them takes, but it was good to have takes.
I do also remember the sad day when that, like, I think it was like a one that had like a big claw on it, fucked up HypnoDisc, HypnoDisc basically, if it didn't work straight away and tear the other robots apart, it was basically fucked. Like it was like just a big spinning thing and there was nothing else it could do. So if you could flip it over, it was completely fucked basically.
So the problem with Robot Wars is someone worked out quite early on that the optimal robot was just something that flipped things over, was just like that wedge.
Yeah, basically. Yeah. So it would basically just be wedge every series would win.
Was that Roadkill?
Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
But I think that was one of the contests. That's like the one that won. And then everyone was like, well, to win, you just build a wedge and then get under a robot and then it's fucked every single time.
So Hypno just can't do anything if it's on its back.
Yeah, I remember my opinion of that show changing so much. As I remember the first time watching it and when they would do those little post-match interviews, I remember thinking of these fucking dweebs. That's the lamest thing I've ever seen.
But there was something very, very compelling about it. Let's face it, it was quite exciting. This GBA game was a proper five out of 10.
It only really captured a tiny bit of the fun. It did have Hypno discs in it, if I recall though. So you know, that was good.
But that actually did also mean that I don't think it reached Europe this year, but it might have done. But the biggest thing I wanted to play on Game Boy Advance was Doom. I just wanted to see Doom running on a GBA.
Because when they talked about porting that, I was like, I can't even imagine what it's like having a first-person shooter in your hands. That was like the first time that happened, where it was that thing of, I can't believe an experience, I think of like as a PC modern gaming experience has been put onto a handheld. So when he got Doom, and we couldn't fucking see it because as discussed, there's no backlight on the GBA, the original GBA, it did seem like a huge moment.
It was really exciting, even though they took some of the gore out and stuff. Doom was weirdly a big game for me at this point, but…
There was also that X vs. SEVA first person shooter, which I think was meant to be quite good.
Yeah, you had that as well. That was like a bit more dry. It was sort of like very sort of like white levels and just shooting identical dudes in it.
But it was the same thing of like, oh, it's very impressive just to see this thing running on here. Same thing applied to Mario Kart Super Circuit, even though it wasn't like the best version of that game. It was still impressive to look at, but that was I think that was the next year.
So yeah, GBA could could hold its own. You had the end of Sega in the hardware market this year as well. This is the last year of new Dreamcast games, I believe.
So it does sort of run out for the Dreamcast.
Yeah, exactly. Obviously not something that we give loads of love. There is a game in my list that is a technically a Dreamcast game though.
So that will hopefully, you know, give a little tip of the hat there to us.
I would have put I would have poured out a little carton of apple juice.
That fridge. Oh, dear. That's such a funny, funny image.
You just go back with your big bar of chocolate and sitting next to your fridge thinking about how people won't talk to you about fucking Perfect Dark anymore and what a tragedy that is. It actually does make me sad because it's very relatable. Okay, what else happens this year?
You have the creation of many new series. You have like the launch of Burnout this year. You have like Halo, obviously.
There's like basically countless series like Devil May Cry as mentioned that just start this year or have really significant entries this year. Some of which are still going today and some of which still define games today. So a massively important year and like the list of games when you include those like games that launch in the US and Japan this year, it really is a banner year of just amazing stuff popping off.
So yeah, really significant. Have got a little summary Matthew of the E3 conferences here. So I did fire through them.
First up earlier in the year at CES, The Rock and Bill Gates unveiled the Xbox to the world. So that was like actually quite charming in retrospect, like a bit of like NAF stage sort of like, you know, back and forth going on there. It's sort of when The Rock was slightly more endearing, I would say, and not like this sort of like, I don't know, Instagram figure I'm not quite sure about who's in terrible movies, like back to back.
But yeah, he was in The Mummy Returns this year, Matthew. So it's a huge moment for The Rock. But so yeah, so you have Sega throw their weight behind the Xbox with the Dreamcast on its way out.
So they unveil Panzer Dragoon, Gun Valkyrie, which is terrible, was going to come to the platform and Jet Set Radio Future as well. So really getting behind the Xbox and Sony's E3 conference. Really weird one, literally some PowerPoint slides with white text on black backgrounds.
It was quite strange to watch this back. This is obviously long before this stuff was shown to the world. So it really was meant to be like a business conference for journalists and shareholders, I guess.
So you got like info about the PS2 selling three times faster than the PS1. Apparently, they got flak for not making PS2s fast enough. They had to defend themselves against that.
They're obsessed with online stuff. With this online, it's become a bit of an arms race in this period of like E3s. But honestly, the online dream seems so unexciting to me in 2001.
And it seems so unexciting now looking back, like the way consoles try to sell online was really boring. There's so calm, they did get that going in 2002, mostly in North America, I think. But who gives a shit?
Like it just wasn't. It wasn't a going concern for me anyway. They announced a DVD remote.
That was one of the big announcements to the show on the hardware side. Jesus Christ. Gran Turismo 3 was their big game coming up in July.
They had trailers for GT3. Jak and Daxter was announced. They had Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin from Naughty Dog on stage who would leave before the original Uncharted came out.
Then they showed a live demo of the game talking about how it compares to animated films and stuff. It seems quite hokey and retrospect. There is a slide on exclusive titles from third-party publishers.
One slide just has Final Fantasy X, Devil May Cry, MGS2, Virtua Fighter 4, Legacy of Kane, Soul Reaver 2. Like, fucking hell. However you feel about maybe two out of five of those games, three of those are enormous.
Do you have any thoughts on that, Matthew?
Yeah. I mean, yeah, you just forget, when we were talking to, like, Dan Dawkins and Andy Kelly about covering games in the PS2 area and just having, like, Masterpiece, off of Masterpiece, just a merge. Yeah.
I mean, wild. It makes me, you know, it's exciting, but at the same time it also makes me, like, super jealous that we weren't, like, there to cover it, you know, to be working in games media at that time must have just been, I mean, that's just ludicrous, isn't it?
Pre-internet. That would be so much fun, wouldn't it, to just go play that stuff, come back, you know, put all your asset CDs in, like, a suitcase and then write about it when you get back. Like, sounds so much better than trying to fucking write previews in your hotel room at E3, you know.
So yeah. Yeah, so like, that's pretty cool. They have, then they show Madden, who gives a shit.
Then they have Final Fantasy X and Spirits Within are both shown. They have a trailer for both combined. Then they have like Sakaguchi and like a sort of video presentation.
And he looked really young and I didn't realize he was 38 when he was in this. So he was like basically the head of Square. And like, you know, it's like three years older than me.
That's how old I am now. And how many worlds conquering JRPG series have I invented?
And they were on the 10th one, Matthew. And like, all of them were bangers. Just ridiculous, really.
Yeah, I don't think I've ever been involved in anything that people liked. I just like to spudge the spirits within, though.
That is true. That is true. But let's not rule it out.
This podcast could go south, you know. There's draft episodes to come that could add to that list. Shinji Mikami comes on stage in sunglasses indoors to present Devil May Cry.
It's very on-brand. That's good. The trailer is almost impossible to see in this video presentation.
Just sort of like brown, occasional gothic architecture, a little bit of white hair. You don't see much in there. Then Kanami come on stage.
You've got Silent Hill 2 gameplay. It just looks incredible. Then Metal Gear Solid 2, which gets the biggest response from the crowd.
The crowd don't respond to much, but they know who Kazuma is. They get excited when he comes on stage. They applaud him.
They fucking love the trailer, which is nine minutes long, incredibly obnoxious, the longest thing in the presentation by far, but everyone watches it, everyone has a good time. It's a real legendary trailer among Metal Gear fans, this one. Finally, the PS2 network adapter, who cares?
It ends with a Socom demo snooze. So that's Sony, Matthew, but PS2 here, just pretty fucking dominant. Did the PS2 loom large at all to you as someone who was playing games at the time?
Were you aware of it or were you just really firmly in your Nintendo bubble?
Yeah, I mean, my brother getting one whenever it was, I can't remember which Christmas it was that he could get one, but being able to sample quite a lot of stuff through that. Again, on the magazine front, I absolutely loved listening to the PSM2 DVDs with commentaries. I can't remember if they were doing those as early as this, but listening to then unknown to me, but the voice of Dan Dawkins talking a lot about SSS Tricky and things like that.
That's just a real kind of instant time travel back to that period for me of listening to a DVD of five guys who all seem to be cool to Dan talking about PS2 games I'd never played, but trusting that they knew what they were talking about and knowing what I know now about how podcasts and how these DVDs were made. It's probably just a load of people winging it in a room trying to be funny with each other, but there were at least two people called Dan on that commentary. There was Dan Dawkins and there was Dan Griffith.
So it was Dan D and Dan G. A lot of them had voices which sounded very similar.
Well yeah, it's funny because that's triggered a memory for me as well, obviously the PS2's other strain to its bow was it was a DVD player. And so when I bought my PS2 and got my PS2 for Christmas, one of the first things I went out and bought was The Matrix for £19.99 from WA. Smith, Matthew.
So that was my first DVD. And I still have that DVD actually, so it stayed with me all this time.
That's good. It had some good good features on it, good hidden features as well.
Yeah, it was that like big edition they did with like two or two discs or three discs or something.
Yeah, just some stuff where you could click on like things outside the menu and make things happen.
Yeah, it was pretty cool. This was back in the day when they used to put loads of effort into it and where magazines would actually have pages dedicated to reviewing the films because they knew that was a relevant part of your diet. Also, they probably had advertisers they had to please, so that's probably why it wasn't there.
Yeah, so that's Sony. Sony is very dominant. Obviously, Sega has already wiped off the map at this point, and it would also dominate the generation to come, but two major consoles were weighing in the wings.
You had Microsoft here. Unfortunately, their conference is not up to watch, as I say, but some of it was covered on that anniversary documentary. They couldn't turn the fucking thing on when they were on stage.
It would not switch on. That's been preserved in the doc, thankfully. I think it is in there, but it's pretty mortifying to hear about this.
There's quite a lot written about this as well by Xbox staff from the time. The games included Halo, which they said made a bad first impression, but it looked pretty decent to me. It was the mission.
I think it's the Silent Cartographer where they land on that island, and then there's a big battle. It seemed like it was in pretty good shape to me, and yeah, so that was there. Yeah, that's kind of the perfect demo level really for Halo.
Munch's Odyssey, which looks very cursed in retrospect, I'll be honest. They wheeled out Lorne Manning, an extremely handsome man, and Dead or Alive 3, the...
An extremely handsome man who makes games about extremely ugly heroes.
Yeah, but he is so strikingly handsome. I think Dan talked about him, didn't he? It's just like, wow, what a good looking guy.
Dead or Alive 3, where they wheeled out Itagaki, and I played that recently, and it is not very good. Me and Jay Bayliss played that when we went to NQ64, and we went straight to Soul Calibur 2 afterwards. Soul Calibur 2 is like night and day, like the visuals, how it plays, I mean, it's like DUD in retrospect, Dead or Alive, but that's just me.
And Nascar Heat, who cares, there's been an online focus in there, but it's like that larval boring early console era of online that makes you think, who gives a fuck? That's kind of what I felt about at the time, I was just in the single player kind of mindset. They reveal a vague Spielberg partnership to tie in with AI that never comes to anything, which is classic Spielberg games bullshit, right?
That's kind of what he does, comes along every now and then. Makes me... Boom blocks.
Yeah, but everything else. I mean, yeah, a Medal of Honor, technically as well, fair enough, but then they revealed that House of the Dead 3 was coming to Xbox, why? What was the point of putting a light gun shooter on Xbox?
I think it was one of the only ones on there. And Crazy Taxi 3. So Sega were massively behind the Xbox.
So that's that Matthew, that's that console that you don't care about.
You didn't care about it.
So I'll go through this Matthew, but I would like your commentary here because Nintendo is obviously your area. So GameCube was actually unveiled a year earlier at a press conference in August 2000. And back in 99, they actually revealed that they were working on it.
It was known as the Dolphin for a long time. I remember reading in N64 and other mags, it had been called Dolphin, a lot of speculation about it for a long time. They have a water on stage, this is the most like, I would say, conferencing of the different conferences.
They have this big, the Nintendo Difference marketing slogan, which doesn't feel like it really went anywhere, I don't really remember it that well. But what I did remember when I saw this conference, I realized I'd seen this footage many times. Miyamoto comes on stage with the GameCube and the Wavebird controller, the wireless controller and he says, Let me introduce you to our new baby.
Like all babies, it's small and it will make a lot of noise. Do you remember that moment or is it just me who remembers that?
No, I don't remember that. He's talking specifically about the Wavebird.
No, he's talking about the GameCube in general.
Oh well, I thought he was talking about the Wavebird.
No, for some reason, I remember this because I remembered the exact intonation of how he said baby and I was like, oh yeah, for weirdly this is wedged into my memory from something. I don't know why. But yeah, then we kick off with a...
That is a really weird way to describe the GameCube. It's small and it will make a lot of noise. I guess as in it will make a big splash rather than like it's...
it worse.
Yeah, it will make a lot of noise coming out of your TV when you plug it in basically.
Like all babies, it's small, it will make a lot of noise and it's got a convenient handle and everyone's like, eh?
And it's purple, like all babies. The games, I think the games are pretty good. To be honest, the crowd is quite sleepy after a lot of this.
I don't think they make a lot... it's quite boring for about 30 minutes. Wata's keynote speech is very dull, even compared to some of the other ones that were in this really three.
Then you get to like the amazing Smash Bros. Melee trailer, which alternates between CG bits to characters and ends with some gameplay. It looks fucking so good.
You can hear the crowd losing their minds. It's quite good, actually, because it's been recorded on a handycam. You can hear some like massive like a Nintendo fans, like American fans, like commenting on what's going on and getting excited about it.
That's quite nice when you're listening, you're watching back. I guess you can understand in the moment how exciting it seemed, you know?
Well, I mean, a huge, if you compare it to like Smash Brothers on the N64, like the leak was incredible. Like what they did. It was, I can remember looking at it and thinking, wow, because we played so much Smash Brothers on the N64 and, you know, we're just so used to it that you were like, oh, I sort of see that it's the same game, but, you know, the gameplay looks like, you know, it looks like CG, you know, one of these dumb things you'd say in a magazine.
Well, the thing is, like, I don't think they'd revealed any gameplay before this conference of how things played. So people didn't know what that generational leap looked like. So they were experiencing it in real time in this recording.
And so you can hear them go, wow, when they see, like, you know, just each character being introduced in their different animations in the battle screen and stuff like that, and, you know, F-Zero track with the cars race past and stuff like that. So it's pretty cool. They're pretty cool to see that.
And the games just look amazing as well. They're just Nintendo's version of this generation was visually very impressive, you know. So Luigi's Mansion next.
Luigi's Mansion obviously had, like, the absolutely beautiful kind of, like, lighting and shadow effects. You know, just a really nice looking game. They did some magic on the GameCube to get it, you know, to get it playing that well.
It does not look as nice on the 3DS, unfortunately. There's quite a long section explaining how the Wave Bird works. That's quite quaint, you know, because obviously we know how wireless controllers work now.
They also show off the tiny GameCube discs. They boast about how much storage capacity is on them, even though it's like a quarter of what the PS2 had. That was kind of bizarre.
And then they boast about their copy, like, it's like copy protected, so you can't pirate it or whatever, and it's like years later where you can basically run all GameCube games on your Steam deck. I'm like, yep, that really stood the test of time, that one. Then they show off Eternal Dark.
Now, actually, Eternal Dark is quite a strange game to have at the center of a Nintendo conference, but Matthew, it feels like they were fighting that perception that they were a kids company, you know, and they needed adult games. Do you think there was a bit of that with Eternal Darkness?
Yeah, I don't know if they were, like... I don't really know the story behind Eternal Darkness, so I'll own up to that in terms of, like, where it comes from. You know, obviously, I know, like, Miyamoto's involvement, and it's really funny to see all these patents with his name and Dennis Dyke's name on it.
You know, you're like, eh? You know, it's like Miyamoto's painted insanity system. I feel like that is very odd, that sort of father of, you know, Pikmin also comes up with this stuff.
Yeah, it just felt... I don't know, I had to have a time, it didn't jump out as, like, oh yeah, this is, this is, like, the antidote to something. It just felt, like, natural, like, this is where games were at, this is what made sense.
You know, it's that kind of slightly more, like Wes said when he was on the episode, that kind of, sort of, more kind of attitude-y kind of era. And so games with a bit more of a harder edge, you know, just seemed like the thing to do.
Yeah, that's, that's absolutely right. And then it kind of goes into Metroid Prime from there, which feels like along similar lines because they very much frame it as this kind of, like, almost like aliens looking thing, you know, there's like a big monster and the Samus standing on top of the ship and just, you know, it's quite intense. It's not really gameplay, but it just, you know, it sets the, sets the tone quite nicely for what they would make.
So that's exciting to people. And then you get to lovely old Star Fox Adventures where someone from Rare comes on the camera wearing a perfect dark shirt and you're watching that you're there thinking, no, this is going to be over so soon. You're going to be gone under the, under the control of Microsoft, obviously.
Shit Canned game Raven Blade was also there. That was a doomed Retro Studios project, hack and slash thing. Donkey Kong Racing.
I know that I know that turned into something Matthew, I don't really remember that game.
Was that Jet, that Jet Barrel Racing or whatever it is?
Maybe something like that. I think I think it ended up being quite a long way down the line that came out.
Yeah, I mean, there was the bad Wii one. Was it that?
Oh, maybe. Was that maybe a port of it? I can't remember anyway, but yeah, it certainly took a while to come out.
So yeah, there was that. Pikmin. There's quite a lot of Pikmin in this presentation, actually.
The Crown seems to love that. Just like the oddness of it and then the character of it and how it looks, people just seem to really dig it. So, you know, Pikmin, I think one of those series, I feel like people were maybe slightly sniffy at the time about what it was.
And all these years later, it's kind of like a bit of a giant killer now on Switch, you know, Pikmin 4, thanks to fucking Ochie. You know, like Ochie is basically like the Trojan horse to get people, well, Trojan dog to get people more invested in Pikmin. So good for them.
Then there's a montage at the end. Rogue Leader turns up in that and everyone in the room goes, oh, they just cannot believe by watching like a B-Wing fly over a Star Destroyer, you can hear people just like, oh, my God. And then seeing them, X-Wing going down the Death Star trench and people just really fucking loving it.
So that gets the biggest reaction of the whole show, I would say, just seeing some rad Star War stuff. Cameo Elements of Power would have to wait a whole generation for that one to emerge on Xbox 360, of course. And Zelda is just a repeat of the Spaceworld demo from the year before, which was, people might remember, is the more realistic Link and Ganondorf fighting each other, which would create headaches for Nintendo for years to come.
So showing that again seems like a bad call, actually, because in August of that year, they would reveal Mario Sunshine. There's like a nice sort of tech demo of it, of Mario running across buildings and doing flood gun related stuff. And then there's the Wind Waker visual reveal as well, which, of course, went down quite badly.
Well, as I said, history has not been kind to that take, but that was felt like the consensus at the time was that they made this kiddie game and people were expecting something that looked like that Spaceworld demo. And that's enough talking from me, Matthew. Any more stray thoughts on that stuff?
Just that it was a great time. So exciting. I actually like, given the strength of that lineup and how good things like Rogue Leader looked, it's mad to me that GameCube wasn't humongous out the gate.
It looked really next-gen. I think they very cleverly made a lot of games which had made good use of next-gen effects, a lot of lighting, a lot of stuff which was definitely beyond the 3D era. So Luigi's Mansion disguises some kind of basic level stuff with just an amazing, slathering of effects on the top and Rogue Leader on top.
I think that's why in my head they looked as good as anything. Rogue Leader looked like the best game in the world, I thought, at the time. But this is the power of it compared to the PS2 or compared to the Xbox.
But you're like, who cares? Look at the evidence. These things are stunning.
Yeah. It's certainly stronger than the Microsoft lineup. The Microsoft lineup has got basically like two or three things you might be really interested in here.
It's just because they lost the third-party game so much. Sony just got so good at that. If Sony had to basically do what Nintendo did and build everything based on what they were creating in-house, they would have had limited success.
They had Gran Turismo, Jack and Daxter, but every other game that was at that conference was not their game. That's how they sold it on other people's games. Nintendo couldn't do that.
What happens with Rare is so strange. They just make a run of the most beloved games. Everything they make, people think is great from this era, and people are really into it.
To just, they're not really that important to us. They're making these things people aren't really into. Whatever happened there, one of the great mysteries.
I think they've found their groove again now, like 20 years later. Sea of Thieves is such a good fit for their sensibilities, and they've done really smart stuff with it, but a very un-long, strange wilderness for them, basically from here onwards.
Yeah, I'm sure this, I think it was on the cover of RetroGamer recently, they'd had a rare celebration. I don't know if it covers this, but yeah, it just ends that hot streak, and they're not really a going concern, this generation in the same way, despite being definitely number two to Nintendo on N64, but by miles, they were just hugely significant. So yeah, it happened.
That just felt like a Microsoft money bag statement of intent. It was like, look what we can do, basically look what we can take. That's what it felt like at the time, but you do want to do a retrospect.
Ultimately, like you say, the studio is now I'm guessing, it just seems like a very different studio. Obviously, it's going to be, they'll have some veterans, I'm sure, but obviously, things move on, time moves on. I'm sure the values are very similar.
I've been there twice and it seems like a rad place to work and people there seem really cool and really tuned into the history of the studio. That definitely runs through their veins, but yeah, it is odd, just very, very, very strange. Star Fox Adventures is kind of like a bit of a bummer game to go out on, isn't it?
It's sort of like Zelda-like that was retrofit their old, their existing N64 game into this new GameCube game that had Fox McCloud, quite strange, really.
Yeah, it was so crap stuff, Star Fox Adventures. Really, it's just an absolute duffer. And people refuse to accept that.
I think they do now, but at the time, you know, outrage when NGC, I mean, I think NGC were like generous when they gave it whatever it was, 78 or something. Right.
Oh, that was a massive, that was a massive shit storm, wasn't it?
Well, they gave, yeah, they gave, they famously gave out the sticker, which you could stick over the score to give it the score you want.
So, yeah, yeah. But that was the thing, because like for them to do that, because they had, didn't they have amazing rare access that basically the even the official mag couldn't get because they had like an in with rare basically.
So, yeah, they were just like, I don't know if this is because rare were considered a bit more grown up. And so being sort of allied to the slightly older feeling, unofficial Nintendo mag. But yeah, that relationship, I mean, in the N64 era, I don't I don't think there's ever really been anything quite like it, you know, at any other between another magazine and another studio.
No, I said off the top of his head.
Just when you'd like open a magazine and find like 40 screenshots of Perfect Dark in there and or whatever, like it's just, you know, really like nothing else. So, yeah, yeah. So I can't help but watch all this and think this is quite rad, even with the like duff presentation of some of the some of the conferences, like the actual stuff they show, the makeup of games more generally, the breakdown by genre.
This feels like a pretty fucking amazing time in games. And, you know, I don't want to say better than now. It's different to now.
There's like things that we have now that, you know, you didn't have back then. But also like no one's trying to pitch you live service hell, you know, like it's just it just feels like a very different a different time and exciting in a lot of ways. Like all everything is at the center here.
It feels like it should be at the center. You know, I'm not sort of like groaning at any of it, but from maybe NASCAR, Heat and Madden. But that's just because I don't like sports.
But yeah, some of the early teething troubles of of online not quite taking off on console and people asking us to be excited for Socom, you know. Yeah, I'm sure that's the closest equivalent. But it's no way near the same as it is now with your force fed so much stuff you don't want.
Yeah, like movers and all kinds of stuff. We like who's this for or whatever. Do I pick on movers too much on this podcast?
No, I just think it's funny that neither of us like it. You know, it's like this massive, massive thing. I imagine one of our listeners enjoys a MOBA.
If you are a listener who enjoys a MOBA, do reach out.
Yeah, we just outright refuse to engage, unfortunately.
We'll give you a section on the podcast called So and So's MOBA Corner, where you can give us 50 words on a MOBA that we'll read out every week.
Great stuff. I'll look forward to that being our least popular segment ever on this podcast. Matthew, that was a really fun section.
I really enjoyed going through that stuff. That was a nice little travel down memory lane. So should we take a little break, come back with our top 10 list?
Let's do it.
That's really good, it's fucking warm night, isn't it?
What is going on?
It's fucking October. Yeah, ridiculous. Welcome back to the podcast.
So, this is where we do our top 10s. Me and Matthew are going to alternate. We're going to count down from 10 down to one.
If both people have the same game on the list, then we'll talk about it whenever we get to its highest position relative to either list. Fucking hell, I always struggle to explain that bit, Matthew. You know what a fucking top 10 is, let's get on with it.
So, Matthew, do you want to go first, you're number 10?
Yeah, I'm going to kick off with Castlevania Circle of the Moon. Is this on your list?
No, it's not.
Yes, this is the first Castlevania on Game by Advance famously accursed with the bad backlight, as you said, or the lack of backlight. There's lots of smarmy people who are like, what's your problem? Dracula's Castle too dark for you.
Which is like, you know, hilarious, but also kind of annoying if you're into this. I came to this much later, I must admit, like the Game Boy Advance ones I kind of visited after really liking the DS one, Dawn of Sorrow. Circle of the Moon is kind of an interesting one in that Igarashi doesn't work on it.
So it's kind of a clone of Symphony of the Night, but with not a lot of sort of, no one there to actually like, look after it. It's why the other two are held to be much better. Harmony of Dissonance is the first one Igarashi comes back to and starts kind of weaving his magic on.
But as, you know, slightly wonky impressions of Symphony of the Night go, Circle of the Moon, still very solid, you know, a beautiful thing. I love the look of these 2D castles, these little worlds, the little sprites, the little monsters, a lot of the kind of iconic building blocks are there. This one has like an interesting card system where you collect a kind of like a sort of power card and then like an effect card and then you match them up and you get a new spell or ability or stat boost and there are 10 of each card so, you know, you basically have a hundred different combinations.
So the idea is that as you collect these things you're experimenting and a lot of the Castlevanias have this hook of you are like collecting weapons or taking the souls of enemies or you are learning new stuff along the way, you know, on top of their kind of core cast exploration action. They have these, you know, this experimental streak. This one, you know, it's as fun as any other.
I guess the cards are maybe like a little abstract. It's not something they go back to. I think everything in this game has been kind of struck from the Castlevania record by Igarashi.
He's like, I didn't work on it. So it's not a canon Castlevania, which is why like the hero Nathan Graves never, never really comes back or is heard of again in any substantial way. But, you know, Castlevania on Game by Advance, if there wasn't interest and excitement around this game, we, you know, we probably wouldn't have got the other two and then we probably wouldn't have got all the good DS ones.
So, you know, we owe it something.
Yeah, definitely. So, you know, it's a really strong lineage. Is this a launch game for the GBA, Matthew?
I think it is over here. Yes, I think it was. And then, yeah, like you say, they're huge.
It feels like the golden era of Castlevania games at this point in its lifespan is all happening on handheld, right? Like it's not really happening on home consoles. So I think that makes sense.
Was there some discussion when they did the GBA collection that maybe these games, like, were built for a console with no backlight and that that was part of the visual style of it? Like it was built for the limitations of the GBA in some way? I feel like I saw that discourse, but...
Oh, interesting. I don't know if I saw that. I mean, I have the advanced collection and think it looks great.
I would much rather play them in that format than in any other format.
Yeah, under a lamp tilted sideways. Yeah, not the one.
I mean, this is, I should say, as a side note to this, generally an amazing Konami period. This is like, for a long time, you know, now you would be like, Konami are one of the big players and people would kind of laugh at it. They've got such a bad reputation because of various decisions that have been made over the years.
But like, I remember at this time, often thinking like, Capcom or Konami, they felt like they were kind of making games of a piece. Maybe that's just like a bit crude because there was like Resident Evil and Silent Hill and I was comparing those two, but Konami felt like a huge, huge, like very relevant thing to me at this time.
Feels like they're halfway through some kind of revival, but hasn't... We don't quite know how it's going to work out yet, but you know.
They've got a long way to go.
They have, and even if they get there, it's not going to feel like it did at this point, where like, I don't know, they put out the weirdo strategy game Ring of Red, for example, this year, I think on PS2. They're never going to make anything like that again, you know. It's all going to be HD versions of stuff you've played, or new versions of old games, that sort of thing.
So, yeah, I agree. I mean, like, you know, the prominence they have in that PS2 conference says everything, really. Like, it's, you know, it's MGS2 is basically, apart from Socom, is like the one more thing of that conference.
So, yeah, imagine following up MGS2 with Socom. That's tough. Um, okay, Matthew, my number 10.
Ready to be shocked by a weirdo entry of mine? My number 10 is Pro Evolution Soccer. So if there was a time where I gave a shit about football, it was from about the late 90s to around 2002 or 2003.
I can't remember. Um, and so I was like, me and my friend Donald were mega, mega into football games. We were like big into ISS.
And then this comes along. It's the first PS2 Pro Evolution. It has some like ridiculous American name, like Major League Soccer, All Stars 2001 or some bullshit like that.
But over here, it was known as the first Pro Evolution Soccer, the winning 11 series in Japan. And it was such a massive visual upgrade. And the thing about Provo is it had a very like, is very sort of reserved visually.
It wasn't like you bought it for the license or anything like that because it didn't have the license for a lot of the teams. There was a lot of like, you know, fake players and missing things and stuff like that. It was, it wasn't authentic when it came to like the, you know, the sort of like accoutrement of football, but it was authentic when it came to how football actually plays and like you would have these very tense sort of like two nil encounters, but it would be exciting because the AI is really good and like the nothing like random, no random bullshit happens.
You can't score from the halfway line, things like that, or award strategy and how you play that sort of thing. But had this massive visual upgrade with this amazing like replay sort of like feature where you can sort of like move the 3D camera around and look at it from different camera angles. It's the most excited I've ever been by a football game was at this moment and just seeing it on PS2.
I had to turn my fucking PS2 upside down because it was a blue disc. So to get it to even run, I had to like actually turn the hardware upside down. Ridiculous.
But I think that was quite a common thing with early PS2 games. And yeah, I was just into football enough for this to be a big deal. I played loads of this in multiplayer.
So Matthew, I know you don't give a shit about this.
And it's like I know these games are massive. You know, my time in the future, they were still dominating lunchtimes. And I've never really understood, you know, because I don't play these games myself.
Like, I don't think I will ever fully get the whole kind of FIFA PES mentality difference. Though I appreciate. Would you say PES?
Is PES more like the Gran Turismo football?
Yeah, I guess so. It's sort of like it's not it's not arcadey, really.
It's like restraining kind of gets it on a spiritual level.
Yeah, well, it just the way that it plays just doesn't feel like random bullshit is happening. It feels like it plays like a game of football would. It just that it's authentic on that level, whereas FIFA just kind of felt like, oh, they got like Edgar Davids, right?
And you can work with it in from the halfway line. And in PES, every goal felt hard earned and like corners had to be good. And you just had to like play, yeah, like say strategically.
And it just, yeah, weird. I think the reason that FIFA's ate their lunch is I think that PES stopped being that and it started being frustrating to people. But FIFA also had all the fucking money bags, like license stuff, you know?
So how much of its inclusion in this has been influenced by that David Beckham documentary making you feel nostalgic for this era of football?
No, not much, to be honest, because honestly, we were massively into ISS. We played the N64 one, which was pretty good, and then we played the PS1 one. And just to go from these fucking vibrating, vibrating like Fabrizio Ravinelli sort of fucking polygonal models in PS1 to the footballers don't look exactly like the footballers, but they look more like real people.
That was just a major difference. It was also just like how odd and sort of like Japanese it was, like the menus were just so sort of like low rent, and it just felt unspectacular and off-brand. That was kind of what was charming about Pez as well, is it just felt like it just was, it didn't even have a real footballer on the cover.
It's just some random like stock image of a football dude, like a football player.
A football dude, 2001.
So yeah, I was speaking to, honestly, I was more tuned in to my own team at this point. I'm a fan of Portsmouth and they were sort of like always flitting between, I think they like got good this season. I think this is the season they had a player called Prozineczki, who was like a really good midfielder and they might have like, this might have been the best season in ages or something like that.
And so I was quite into it on that sort of like club level. So yeah, it's not quite tied to that. I can see why you might think that.
This is like, there's two football games on PS2 that are really significant to me. There's this one and another one I'll say for another year, Matthew.
It's that red card.
I got quite into This Is Football 2003 as well. That was quite fun. But anyway, we don't have to keep going on about it.
This is not your bag. It's all good. So what's your number nine?
My number nine is Uplink, the PC hacking simulator.
Oh, great pick.
Like introversion. Probably the introversion thing I've liked the most, or at least the one which has sort of spoken to me the most. It's like, I think I picked this in one of the PC drafts, maybe as a wild card.
It came in almost like a jet black box with like nothing on it. It felt quite like illicit and weird when you bought it in the shop. It kind of sold itself on you are genuinely kind of in this hacking world.
You have got a piece of hacking software. And even though it does like tutorialise it and have a narrative of sorts, like the thing it trades on is trying to feel super authentic to what you would perceive to be an authentic hacking experience. Obviously, hacking is incredibly complicated.
I do not understand it one bit. This is more the kind of hacking as films show it. You do a lot of things that you saw people do in like hackers or swordfish, you know, there's a lot of like he's pinging between the different nodes and all this kind of stuff.
And you're like, yeah, this sounds this sounds about right. A lot of this game is about sort of methodical processes of using applications to crack quite a stripped back minimalist computer interface. You don't like program anything as such, but it's definitely not like Arcadia.
Like I say, it looks it looks quite like legit and believable. A lot of it's about like buying money to buy programs or applications that you can run that kind of take the pressure off certain bits of hacking like password cracking or like a voice analysis thing which lets you kind of use a sort of synthesize a bit of voice to crack a password. There's lots of stuff about like CPU usage, which I think is it's like it's almost like you know how you do power management in like a Star Wars simulator, like the ship stuff, like where are you going to put the power to like the engines or the ships or whatever?
Your favorite game, TIE FIRE, right?
Yeah, exactly. It has a little bit of that or the amazing spaceships in Starfield where like, you know, the more CPU you put behind a certain application, you can speed up certain parts of the process. So like, if you're trying to kind of make something to defend yourself, you might put that in, you know, or you might put the energy into the thing, which is actually doing the kind of direct cracking and all this kind of stuff.
And really, it felt like the puzzle of the game was kind of like working out what it all did and just learning to kind of parse it and learning kind of life hacks that you could you could almost solve certain problems or you could work out little processes that would always serve you well. And you could use to kind of shave certain time off in times quite key when there are people like chasing you down. And it actually like I was thinking about this today in hindsight, I wonder if it has like, there's almost a through line to like Sanbarlo's games in that, you know, it's a believable computer interface.
It's designed to look like something you've just booted up on a PC, but also that the key to like beating the game is just knowledge. It's just knowing a certain fact or knowing a certain process or knowing that, you know, if you hack this place, you can get into this place through that and things like that. And, you know, the game is about like learning it and it's all there for you to discover from like minute one, the chances of you doing that are quite unlikely.
So a really like distinct thing, you know, I can understand why this might not be everyone's bag. You know, I was never very good at it and it isn't like, like visually spectacular or anything, but certainly to see someone trying something quite experimental, you know, at a time where, you know, quote, indie games, you know, no way near the same kind of scene that you have now. Something like this existing and kind of breaking through enough into the mainstream that ended up on my PC anyway, seems, you know, quite significant.
Yeah, I think I read a feature in PC Gamer or Edge about how this was like one of the original indie games in some ways. Like it was just kind of like an upstart, but you could go, you know, you could buy this on the shelf next to everything else. And it was, it was a significant moment because they're a small studio.
I think they still are, right? Like they're not like, I think it's just a few dudes. I don't think it's like a massive, massive studio.
They went on to do Prison Architect, right?
Yeah, that's right. But then they offloaded that. And I think they're on something called like The Last Starship or something like that at the moment.
I think like, yeah.
Is that a thing that they physically built with all the money they made from prisons and things? They started Prison Architect and now they're in space and that sounds legit.
Still my introversion memory is when I met one of them at Rez and they called me Graham by accident because he was the old editor of PC Gamer. That was quite embarrassing. But yeah, for me, not for him, you know, because I'm not called Graham.
That's why.
I'm pretty sure on the recent My Perfect Console where they interviewed Kieran Gillan, he talked about, like, I basically invented introversion by talking about their game first and bringing them into the mainstream. Like he took in quite a bold move, like a lot of responsibility for their success.
All right, then.
Okay.
Fair enough.
I'm in the same way that I made Little King's story.
You made Hotel Dusk. Okay, interesting. Yeah, I've played this very briefly, but it is like, it still remains a really cool idea for a game.
You know what I mean? Like you see it written down, you're like, oh, that's actually rad. That's a great idea for a video game.
So yeah.
You could see someone making this now exactly the same way and people like not batting an eyelid like it just it's timeless because it is so sort of minimalist and the you know, this set of it goes for so perfectly captures like the computer interface and there's nothing to kind of go, oh, this is from 2001. Really.
Okay, gotcha. Interesting. I sort of, yeah, I do have this in my Steam library.
I've got all of introversions games for some reason. So I think I've put them all up over the years. So yeah, okay, cool, Matthew.
Good pick. Nice bit of variety to the list. A bit of your PC experience at the time coming in there.
My number nine is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Is this on your list?
It isn't.
Really? Okay, I thought this would be, I thought this would be because I think we talked about this before, but.
Yeah, I mean, you know, Pro Skater 4 is like my big into it.
Right. Fair enough. Yeah, I mean, I remember, I mean, I feel like this is maybe the most well regarded one or at least one of the certainly a big peak for the series because, yeah, like, well, for a few reasons, one, obviously, like it looked looked amazing compared to compared to one and two, which were PS1 games.
They sort of like brought things along in that sense. They also added like some kind of rudimentary online. I don't think it ever happened here, but the key thing that that happened here was the the revert they added to it, which basically allowed you to do endless sort of tricks so you could just basically string along combos forever, basically.
And it was kind of like a game changer for how these how you enjoy this game just added like this amazing amazing skill ceiling to it and so much variety. And they also just also just like the I feel like the visual upgrade just couldn't be underestimated and this series was just so, so hot at the time. And it was maybe arguably like the best selection of levels in there as well.
And the way that I think that this series just managed to develop was just through keeping those keeping those kind of like skills exciting like you didn't need to do more at this point to keep you hooked. And when they got to get to later in this generation, they do obviously struggle a little bit to figure out exactly where to take it and then the maps get too big and then they add like other features to it. And like, you know, history has shown that keeping it pure is basically what people want.
So yeah, I think it was I think I just it was just really exciting at the time. Like I don't have loads more to say about it other than that. It was like a great formula perfected for PS2.
And obviously, like, you know, in the UK, well, if you're in the US and you got to play this on the other formats as well, I think eventually you did. There was weirdly a version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 they did for the original Xbox. I don't know what the deal was there, but I think it's like called 2X or something.
Not sure what that was all about. But yeah, on PS2, this just this series was so dominant. This is such a huge moment.
I remember this is getting like monster scores from everywhere and it was just everyone I knew was just massively into it was the ultimate like play it for two minutes, have a great time kind of game, perfect kind of casual game, basically casual game, easy to enjoy massive skill ceiling, just as a reason that people still love these games all this year, all these years later, you know, so yeah, like just like a really joyful culture around it.
You know, like the personality seemed really fun, like the goofy, you know, whenever I see memes of like the character select screen with people kind of like ambling on the spot, you know, that one where people do the kind of like select your skater, there's a particular like animation they have for or like you hear a bit of music that was in one of these games. And even though, you know, this is not my music scene at all, because it isn't either Randy Newman or the Divine Comedy. You know, I hear these tracks and it does whisk me back and makes me think, oh yeah, this takes me back to my pretend skateboarding days.
Yeah, you had like the likes of like AFI and Ramones on here and obviously your favorite band Body Jara on here, Matthew. I know you're a huge fan of those.
It's just lots of songs with people going, oi, oi, oi, oi.
You're thinking Crazy Taxi. That's Crazy Taxi you're thinking of, I think. That's basically the offspring song in Crazy Taxi.
But yeah, it is a little bit like that. Yeah, they were just huge music, like culturally, probably in terms of games, like they were the most significant in terms of music, as well as games, kind of combined, basically. They had a kind of like a call factor that most games at the time just didn't.
They just extended beyond, beyond dweebs like you and me, Matthew. So yeah, I wish they would remaster this game in four, but it sounds like they're not going to do that now, Activision, which is a real bummer. So maybe, maybe Xbox will when they take over, Matthew, who knows?
So yeah, maybe.
What's your number eight?
My number eight is Black and White on the PC.
Oh, I was hoping you'd talk about this one. Matthew Castle classic.
Yeah, it is a classic. It's something I really wanted because I really bought into Peter Molyneux's pitch of like, you know, it's going to be this you're going to have this huge AI creature. It's a God game, basically, where you're a hand that manipulates the world.
But you also have a giant animal creature who kind of represents your presence on Earth, who you train to do stuff. You know, if you play the game properly, you can like train the monster to sort of like automate things like collecting crops or feeding the people. And it's a game that's fundamentally about like accruing belief in yourself by doing kind things for people so that you can get miracles or wonders, I think they might have been called, which were powers which you could then use against like rival civilizations.
So it's kind of like a light 4X game in that it's about taking over a map and getting rid of other nations by kind of building up belief in yourself. But with this, you know, the pitch was this amazing AI creature at the heart of it that was going to like learn in real time and like what it saw you do and how it saw you behave would change like its moral alignment. And, you know, a lot of ideas which kind of circle Mollinue, you know, he's into playing God, he's into morality, he's into consequences to that morality.
You know, a lot of these things are in fables still. Like, I don't know if I ever fully clicked with it, like the version of this game that I built up in my head, like this couldn't possibly be that game. But I remember like messing around in it for ages, never getting that far in the campaign, but feeling like I'd had a pretty amazing time, like just observing the creature.
I was really obsessed with the creature element of it. And, you know, you could sort of if it did something good, you try and sort of stroke its head to teach it, yes, good creature, do more of that. And if it was bad, you'd give it a slap and it would bruise horribly.
It was like a, I think you could get like a big monkey and a big cow. And I just remember like slapping this cow and these horrible like welts being on its face. I remember like beating up my creature in this game because, you know, that's what you do when you're a horrible teenager.
And I remember like my mum telling me off one time, being like, you know, that's horrible. Like if you keep doing that, you're not gonna be allowed to play this anymore. So that's just, that just can't be the purpose of the game.
It's like thumping a cow in the face.
You're like, you're like, shut up, mum. You got an apple juice out of your fridge, you know.
Like, I'm a tough guy. I'm gonna be up on this cow and eat a tiny cake, get a drink, a tiny apple juice. And it's like, hmm, maybe this is why no one wanted to be my friend.
I really, that's my memory of Black and White, is like tormenting and sometimes being nice to this animal, basically getting frustrated at... You could stroke it when maybe in its head it was already loading up the next action. So you'd actually be teaching it to do something else.
And I was convinced that like, I'd see like, you know, my creature pick up some wheat and put it in a fucking barn and be like, good creature. But when I stroked its head, in its head, it was actually thinking, I'm going to take shits everywhere. So I was being like, yes, shit everywhere, creature, shit my creature.
And it was just shit in all the food and all the food would become like poisonous because of these giant turds everywhere. Like, it was just, it was very, very hard to get good results out of that game. Maybe my brain wasn't just sophisticated for it.
Listeners of this podcast know like, I'm not a strategy guy at all. And this probably like leans more into that. But the promise of like, being a mischievous god hand going around causing havoc, you know, that was a good sell.
So.
Not the Capcom version of god hand, like the actual god's hand.
Oh, no, very, no, I have the hand of god.
Yeah. Yeah, like, I've only ever played this in like, very briefly, and it's a real tragedy. It's not on like GOG.
Like this would be such a great artifact to like pick up for six quid and give a spin, right? I mean, yeah, it's a shame that it and its sequel, because it was a sequel as well, they're just kind of like lost there. You can play the fucking saboteur on GOG, but not this.
Like, what's all that about?
That's sickening.
It is a little bit, yeah.
Your hand would become more evil looking the more evil you were. Like, it would become all like red and like the fingernails would grow. And I don't know what a good hand looks like.
I was a pretty neutral hand. I was a sort of a fence sitting sort of centrist type even back then, so.
Apart from the one time you beat the shit out of a cow and your mum told you off, basically. That bovine related disaster aside. Okay, that's really funny, Matthew.
I very much enjoyed hearing about that. Yeah, they got to excavate that at some point. Weirdly, I had a science teacher who tried to bond with me over black and white, but hadn't played it.
So I was just like, I've not played this game. This is unfortunate. If you'd asked me about Red Alert 2, I'd be like, yeah.
Yuri's floating tank, it's got to fuck those guys up. Like, you know, but he was steady was like, yeah, I'm just like, you know, getting this, this sort of like big dog thing to sort of do stuff or whatever. And I was like, okay, fair enough.
Okay, cool.
What's your next one?
Number eight, Pokemon Gold and Silver, Matthew.
It ain't on my list.
Shocker. So, Pokemon Fever was over in the UK by the time this got here, really. So when it, the year before at my school, in fact, it might have been towards the beginning of 2001 or the end of 2000.
Everyone had Pokemon cards. Pokemon was that huge. It was absolutely everywhere.
And then this game, which came along in the US the year earlier, took fucking ages to get to Europe for whatever reason. I think like something like two years it took to get from Japan to Europe. Like, it was a massive wait.
And in that time, I had become obsessed with Pokemon. I started playing it, like an emulated version of it before it launched in the UK, because it sort of like tendrils, it's sort of like grown out from the US. And I was like, I have to fucking play this game.
I got massively into it, like I said earlier, I watched the anime, got Pokemon Blue, Pokemon Yellow, I was really digging it. And for years, I was reading information about this game, like some apocryphal information, some real information about, they've had like Pokemon breeding, it's like a whole new world you can explore, different gym leaders, they got new sort of like, sort of elemental types, like Dark and Steel, and all of these strange new Pokemon and stuff like that. It was like, I would say that learning about Pokemon Gold and Silver through like magazines and like forums, and also old kind of like GeoCities sort of websites, was probably more fun than playing the game itself.
Like, because you built up an obsession with this one world and these 151 Pokemon that you knew, and then for the first time there was gonna be like, all this other new stuff. Now when this happens, people still lose their shit about like a fucking kettle that's got eyes or whatever. People are like, yeah!
I gotta say, it's a very different experience when you can't read about that stuff online, you can't just watch a live stream. You learn about it through basically like unofficial Nintendo magazines, and you're just trying to get little bits of information and piece it together. That was actually a really fun way to learn about this game.
I even played like a ROM of the Japanese original. I got to like the second gym before I was just completely fucked and didn't know what I was doing. But that's how into it I was.
When it came along, it was very impressive. Like it was, I thought the big thing a lot of people talk about now is the fact that you had both worlds in it once you completely cleared the first world Johto, you could go back to Kanto, the world from the original Pokemon games. It was really good.
I won't lie, the Pokemon effect had dimmed on me at this point. I just wasn't quite as into it as I was. But it was also really nice to see one of these games on my Game Boy Color screen looking really nice.
Like these ones were actually made for Game Boy Color. The originals weren't, they were just original Game Boy games. It was a really nice facelift.
It was just exciting to see this whole kind of like fiction expand. In that moment, it just seemed like such a huge deal. And so now, when I'm just sort of like, so Pokemon's is not really my thing.
But it's funny how at the time it felt like, oh, these games have come along, they're clearly a much better version of what we already had. But also, it feels like this thing is about to end, and then it hasn't ended. It's somehow evergreen Pokemon.
But I remember at the time, and I found some articles about this, there's mainstream media saying Pokemon fever is over or whatever. Certainly for me, I played these games, I liked them a lot, but then got my PS2 and that just as mentioned, that's like the switch, that's the turn. That's where things just change permanently for me and my gamer tastes.
I think that's the experience you're probably meant to have. Yeah. It's creepy and unhealthy when people drag Pokemon into their adult life.
I also just hit this moment where maybe it's going from 11 or 12 to 13, where I was like, this suddenly doesn't mean the same thing to me anymore.
When I'm a bit snooty about how childish I find it, that isn't to say that isn't beautifully targeted at children and younger people of that right age. It's about as good a thing aimed at a 10-year-old or a 12-year-old or whatever. It's so well-judged.
It's your introduction to the Japanese RPG, right? It's huge, as we talked about in the episode with Jay. It also just felt insurmountably large as well, like having 250 Pokemon or whatever it was, it might have been 251.
Then there were these birds to catch, these legendary birds that are on the front cover of the games, obviously. Then there were also these legendary dogs who were just running around the world. There's this big red Gyarados in the middle of a lake.
It had more going on, I don't want to say lore-wise, but it just felt like there was a lot going on in this game. Whereas when you'd exhausted all of the content of Pokemon, blue and red, and there was nothing left for them to show you, it was quite intoxicating to suddenly have this whole new world in your hands. I hope I can at least capture a little bit of that in my description there, Matthew.
It was cool. But there is now a gulf, I would say, between this game and the next game in terms of how much I like the games on my list. Keep that in mind as we go ahead.
But what's your number 7, Matthew?
My number 7 is Silent Hill 2.
Higher on my list. Yeah.
We can talk about why it's lower when we get to it.
Okay. Interesting. Yeah.
It's like Matthew just hates dead wife tropes basically. Even at 17, he's like, fuck this.
I've got a couple of picks on my list, which I think are going to be much higher on yours. It isn't me being contrary, it's like trying to reflect more probably on where I sit on things now and some things have been replaced or I had certain weird experiences with certain things. I just want to set.
I think my next one you're going to be like, boo, that's too low.
I got a feeling it's going to be my number one, your next one. Let's find out. Okay.
We'll get to my number seven instead. This ain't going to be on your list. Onomusha Warlords is my number seven, Matthew.
I did see it when I was going through the list of 2001 games, I thought, oh, is that one Sam likes or not?
No, I do like this one. The sequels are better, but this was cool. This was Capcom basically applying the Resident Evil formula to a period Japanese setting and then adding loads of weird monster stuff to it, like monster demon lore.
It was a pretty cool idea. You had these real historical figures and then, yeah, there's basically this Nobunaga, your arch-villain in the game makes this basically demonic pact and controls this mighty power and leaves lots of weird demonic crust all over a load of old Japanese buildings and then-
Don't say demonic crust on the podcast again.
I'm not selling it well. They didn't have demonic crust in the manual or anything like that. That's my term, very much so.
So you have the fixed camera perspective of Rezi, but with melee combat. The funny thing is actually having just played a whole bunch of Rezi Code Veronica X, which will not be on my list, I'm afraid. I didn't quite like it enough to put on here.
But the controls in this are much better than in the original Rezi. Yes, they have the same slightly tanky controls, but they do move things along a little bit. It's actually quite a viable, decent melee combat system.
It's quite short, it's about six hours long, but it takes you to, I think, a mix of historical stuff and fantastical borderline horror stuff work really well. It's like some good creepy vibes to this, and you get the sense that you're coming into this world in decay. It very much feels like the sort of thing that Sekiro would tap into, just the idea of humanity has done something wrong here, and now they're paying the price for it.
That's the vibes of everywhere you go in Onimusha. Some really comically bad voice acting, but really good mix of Rezi-style puzzles, not quite as scary, so I appreciated that at the time. It just looked really nice, a really nice looking early PS2 game.
This game basically comes along just before the avalanche of Christmas stuff comes along and sort of blows it away a little bit, including one game I'll talk about in a little bit. But it was pretty cool for the time, and I think people have kept this series in their hearts as an important Capcom thing that happened in the PS2 era, Matthew. So, do you ever play this one?
No, I think this is the one I have played, but not to any extent that it sort of sticks with me. But I love your enthusiasm for Amnesia. It is one of the reasons we do this podcast, I think.
It's from you talking about the second game at a pub and thinking, oh, this chat could probably be a podcast.
Oh, yeah. Well, the second one just moves things along so much in terms of audio and storytelling, and it's such a more ambitious game. But yeah, they definitely got all of the basics right here.
So, let's get to number six, Matthew.
My number six, Gta 3.
Higher on my list.
Higher on your list. You are going to, like, given what's my number, like, five, that's, it's going to seem slightly obscene.
I can't wait now. I feel like I've been talking loads now because I've had, like, basically several on the trot, but don't worry, Matthew, you'll get your moment when we come back to these games. Okay.
My number six is where I've cheated slightly. I've picked Shenmue 2, which launched in Europe on Dreamcast in 2001. I did not play it until I got an Xbox in 2003 and I played the Xbox port they brought to that platform.
However, I did want to put it in here because I actually thought that Dreamcast had a fairly good, sort of like, you know, like, sort of like outro. They had a few kind of cool games along the way, like Rez and Headhunter, which I was kind of fond of at the time. Sonic Adventure 2, not my kind of thing, but people seem to like it.
This, though, really is like the latter days of masterpiece on Dreamcast. And I do think that Shenmue was much better experience in the moment than it would be to experience now. So, you know, it's basically a kind of like life sim combined with an RPG, combined with a fighting game.
I suppose that's basically how you describe it. It's kind of its own unique combination of things.
So it's like boring Yakuza.
So you play Ryo Hazuki, who is basically like this young man who is seeking revenge on Landy, who killed his father. That happened in the previous game. And this game comes to Hong Kong, looking for information on where to find him, basically.
And I think this... It's hard to explain why this is so appealing, but there's a kind of existential sadness to inhabiting this character's life in Hong Kong, where he basically just knocks around looking for information, getting entangled in people's lives, looking through their drawers, taking on part-time jobs to earn a bit of money, like winning these capsule toys. And just like this downbeat sad life that you live in this game, and it can just stretch on indefinitely.
It has a day-night cycle. You can just keep playing it and playing it and playing it. I think if you get to the end of summer and you've not gone to try and find Landy in the fucking forest at the end of whatever happens, the end of Shenmue 2, then the game is like, I think it has a bad ending.
They were like, what the fuck were you doing this whole time while you're just sat in an arcade playing OutRun and Space Harrier? Which is again a massive part of the appeal of these games. They put Sega arcade games in here.
Obviously, now Yakuza is probably more synonymous with this because they've gone much deeper into the Sega catalog and done some really cool stuff with it. But yeah, so this was like, I played this without having played the original. There was a DVD that came with, that gave you the fucking cutscenes from the original.
I sat through that DVD, I had way too much time on my hands in the noughties. So I felt like at least I knew what was going on. And I did, it is quite appealing.
There are so few actual fights in Shimei, that's the thing. You think you would find a reason to give you a fight every day. It wouldn't.
It would give you a reason to do like fucking lifting crates every day or running like the little lucky hit gambling game every day. But it would like never really, I feel like there's like maybe fewer than 20 fights in this game. And it's like for a game that's built using...
That's how many fights you'd have in real life, you know.
That is true over like a summer period.
Yeah, like how many fights have you had genuinely in your life? Have you had any fights?
Yeah, like four probably.
Four fights?
I mean, not as an adult, but all around this time, you know, like 2001 time. Like I got punched in the face a few times.
Did you throw a hit back? Do you make it an exchange of blow? I'd say someone coming up to you and punching you in the face isn't a fight.
You've got me there. That takes it down to two, okay?
Well, you've had two legit fights. I've never had a fight.
Yeah, okay, fine. But yeah, I think that's the funny thing in this game. It is punctuated by these big moments where you go into a building, you get to the top of the roof and then land, he takes off in a helicopter and you're like, oh, fuck, I didn't get revenge.
And I kind of like the idea that Ryo is this doomed figure who will basically never get revenge. And he's always doomed to just be on the trail of this guy who killed his father and that's his life. Well, living this quite small life in these like random places with all these strange people.
At the same time, you do also have to bring up the weird Shenmue of it all, which is to say fucking bizarre looking NPCs, he'll be like, hello. And like the dialogue will be like that. And they'd be like, no, I don't know where Landy is or whatever.
You want to go to the golden quarter. And you're like, where the fuck did they find these voice actors? Some of the worst voice acting you've ever heard.
I think it transpired that they basically just had to find English speakers in Japan where they recorded it. I think that's why the voice acting is so odd.
It's so mad given like what you know about the making of this game and how particular Yu Suzuki was about it. To like biff it in such a major way in its localization seems absurd. You know, like the eye for detail and accuracy and then to have that on top, it is quite jarring.
It is as well, because I think that like that's the version I played. But my understanding is, I think that there was no English language in the Dreamcast European version. I think they just did Japanese for subtitles, which yeah, exactly, which is much more appealing.
I assume the HD version you can get now is the same. But I will say to experience this at the time feels felt quite special. Like even by the time it arrived on Xbox, it was slightly out of date, I would say.
Like it's almost like a version of an open world game that just didn't turn into anything. You know what I mean? It's like a dead end, an evolutionary dead end.
And like, you know, Gta 3 becomes that instead. So, but it's, it was fascinating. It had so much texture to it.
And it was just like, had detail in all these strange places. And that's kind of what made it great. So, yeah, yeah.
Shout out for them, Matthew. You've got any experience with the series?
Yeah, but really after the fact, you know, something I coveted so much, reading about it in Games Master, cause it just felt like total world simulation. You know, the way they talked about it, made me think it was, you know, a village, every house down to the draw modeled. And it's sort of that.
I mean, that's, it's not quite that. But by the time I did get to it, it maybe seemed more quaint, you know, it's got immaculate vibes always, you know, like I think if you come to it now, it's very easy to understand, like why people have fallen in love with it. And it's very sedate tone.
And like there is a bit of it in Hotel Dusk and the sort of scene games in terms of like, just a really mundane setting and people whose lives are just like really not worthy of being in a video game. You know, they're so unexceptional and that's what makes it feel so special. But it's definitely a game from this period, which you maybe had to be there to a degree and I wasn't.
Yeah, I sort of get why if you were playing this and Phantasy Star Online on a Dreamcast in 2001 or 2000. Well, no, just do that.
Oh, you'd be absolutely awful online now. Is that what you're about to say? Yeah, I can understand that.
Well, what I was gonna say, just to end this on a sincere note and not to dunk on the Sega heads yet again, Matthew, which ends up happening a lot on this podcast, is that it does feel like a summery game of this era of Sega of Japan, right? It's like, it's a whole generation. It feels like a whole generation of game creators going, this is what we think a masterpiece is.
This sums up our sensibilities, our ambition. What we think is important about games is in this. And that's what I think is special about Shenmue.
Like it does represent that moment so well, you know, and that intent. So yeah, there you go, Matthew. But if you do want to dunk on the Sega fans one more time, be my guest.
I've got nothing against them. They've got something against me. It makes me want to kind of like, you know, defend myself aggressively with poorly argued opinions.
Well, let's get to your number five instead, Matthew.
So my number five, and this is a game which, remember, is better than Silent Hill 2 and Gta 3, is Conker's Pad Further.
Yes, yes, let him cook, let him cook.
I mean, this is like, of the things on my list, this is a really genuine 2001, like, obsession of mine. Like, reading about this and all the pop culture, it was parading, you know, it was just built for 16-year-old Matthew, you know, it had parodies of Saving Private Ryan and The Matrix and Alien. These were all things I thought were really, really cool.
So of course I wanted to play it. It's aimed at 15-year-old boys, you know, it is, if you don't know it, Conker, this sort of lovable little squirrel goes on a massive bender, wakes up and his girlfriend's been kidnapped and he basically has to go on an adventure to get her back. And as he kind of potters around this sort of 3D world, he ends up going through lots of different kind of parodies of other films, other games, Terminator's also in there.
It looks like it should be a Banjo and Kuaizumi style collector's on and the fact that it comes from Rare would suggest that it's going to be that. Actually isn't, it's like, there are worlds to explore, but what you do in them is quite fixed and linear. Your progress is very kind of shepherded through it.
It isn't like you're not going back to worlds to kind of clear them out. It's, you've got very sort of set tasks. Interestingly, like on top of like the basic platforming moves, his main move is this context sensitive thing with the A button.
Like whatever, when you stand on these pads, the A button enables him to do all kinds of different actions. And it actually lets each set piece be built around something very different. So if you're fighting a giant opera singing poo, which you famously do in this game, standing on the context pads, lets you throw giant rolls of toilet paper into its gob.
But like there's another level set in hell or there are these fiery demons everywhere. And standing on the pads lets you take a piss and then you start pissing all over these fiery demons. So like every set piece, they can build a mechanic, whatever mechanic they need to make it happen, which I think is actually quite interesting, given that we'd had a lot of these quite stodgy collect-a-thons from Rare to have something which was like a lot lighter on its feet.
If indeed it was very bawdy with it. I thought it was super interesting, like going back to it, I played a bit of it in like Rare Replay or whatever, and it's quite hard going, it's really difficult, it's quite frustrating. But back then, you know, I really wanted, I remember like not having enough money for it, because it was like 60 quid or something ridiculous, and like collecting coins from down the back of the sofas at home and taking them to the bank to turn it into like cash money.
You know, I was that, I was literally scrounging down to the penny to have enough money to buy this obnoxious game. And then when I did got it, I got really stuck on the saving private Ryan level. Like there's a bit you have to run through the beaches on like a D-Day landing type thing.
And it was so hard, I thought I'd never be able to get through it and actually get to the Matrix bit, which is what I actually wanted to play. So quite a frustrating game to be this high up on my list, but I'm not gonna lie, it was a big part of my 2001 life.
It was like hugely exciting. I mean, I played this for the N64 draft we did ages ago. And it does feel like what a hangover feels like.
It feels like when you're playing it, you're like, because it is cursed fundamentally. It does feel like it's a subversion of games that Rare has made, like you say, like the Banjo-Kazooie type of game. Indeed, it started life as something much more sincere in that vein, then they flipped it.
There's a Game Boy Color game that is a Conker game that is much lighter than this and is like a trad, platformery kind of thing. But it seemed really illicit and cool. And especially if it hit you like a teenage, to a teenager, this was like an object of obsession.
You know what I mean? Like you had to see it, you had to, you heard about these moments, like you say, the big poo and the big singing poo, and you're like, I have to see that, you know? And the context-sensitive thing is probably like the most progressive sort of design touch about it, right, like that's, like you say, like it sort of separates it from other rare games.
It's like, it's actually, it's a bit closer to maybe how games would be designed now, you know what I mean? Like it's, like you say, lighter on its feet, it's contextual, it's, yeah, it's a cool idea. So yeah, I do think this is a good suggestion.
And like, yeah, it's also sums up that kind of slightly odd end of the N64 era as well, like this, you kind of got this, you got Paper Mario, which is, you know, hugely significant in retrospect, maybe that'll come up in your list, but you have no idea, but you got that, and then it's like Pokemon Stadium 2, Dr. Mario, and then basically Tony Hawk games and football games, that's kind of it really, wrestling, and it just sort of goes away, the N64, it really just sort of peeters out. So this is kind of the most exciting thing that's happening this year really on this platform. So yeah, I think this is a good pick.
Apparently they had a famous E3 stand for Conker's Bad Fur Day, where they gave out like pints of beer, which I have a vague memory of Kitsy or someone telling me about on NGamer of like, oh, E3 was, this is one way it was different, that you could have a beer tent in the middle of the thing to advertise Conker.
Right, right, yeah. It's sort of like, because it was published by THQ, right? I think Nintendo just declined to have any involvement.
It's cool that this has been salvaged basically, uncensored though, for the rare collection. That's, it's good that you can go out and get this. That's nice it's been presented.
Like if you come to it now and play it, you know, always, this isn't a 38 year old Matthew endorsing this game and saying that everything in it is like top draw and they like it.
It's quite horny in a very naughties way.
Yeah, but it's got this, but there is a real British sort of like seaside, end of the pier kind of element to it. Of like, it's very, it's quite carry on.
But is that good though Matthew? Is that good?
No, but I will say like it is, like there is still something distinctly like rare and British about it, which I think is quite endearing.
Yeah, you had to be there. This seemed cool. Go around a friend's house and play this.
I was like, I can't believe I'm finally gonna see what this fucking game is. Like it's.
Yeah.
Yeah. Good pick Matthew. I like that.
Okay, cool. So my number five is Jack and Daxter, The Precursor Legacy. Did this make your list Matthew?
It didn't. Though I have, you know, I know I dunk on the non Nintendo platformers, but my brother got this for Christmas. I played loads of it.
Technically like very impressive.
Yeah, that's the thing is it had this like continuous world. It was funny hearing the Naughty Dog co-founders at E3 conference going like the team who made Crash 3 have been hard at work on this. And I was there thinking, if Matthew heard this, he'd just crack up, you know, just like the idea of that being a thing that would get you excited.
Yeah, so it was like, basically, I think like the whole deal with Naughty Dog and Insomniac is that they were tied up with Universal at the time. And then basically like, that's why they didn't own Crash Bandicoot or Spyro and ended up being in Activision's hands because it ended up passing to Vivendi and all that kind of stuff. So they were like, okay, well, we're just gonna, you know, sort of like team up with Sony, be acquired by Sony and make this all new platformer series.
Can't remember if they bought them before this, but it was around this time, I believe, that they became part of Sony. So teamed up to make this new universe. You got Jack, a silent protagonist with the bright yellow hair.
There's a very irritating companion, Daxter, who's actually a human who got turned into this weird, like otter and weasel creature combined. They go around. They basically have the Crash Bandicoot spin attack, but you got like a full 3D camera and you're going through like a full 3D world and there's no loading screens between any of the parts.
The island, it was very impressive in that respect. It did look nice for the time. I got so excited about this at the time because I had a demo disc that had this for ages and now I think it was like 2002 I ended up just getting it for like 10 quid or 12 quid from some secondhand shop and finally it did live up to the hype.
I thought like it borrowing this sort of Mario stars thing for all of these power cells that you found around the world did work quite well. You really would explore an area and exhaust it until you kind of moved on and I think that created quite a nice relationship between you and this world. It was like about discovery more than like set pieces I would say, just pretty cool.
Like I think it sort of like, just sort of like slams to a conclusion. Like the overall playing space isn't that big. You'll see it all in probably like, I don't know, six or seven hours or something.
But it was pretty cool. It was like a halfway house between what Crash Bandicoot was and what Nintendo was doing. I did think this was pretty strong at the time.
There was a reason people got excited about this. So yeah, not much more to say Matthew because I think we discussed this one before, but yeah, Jack and Dexter there. Okay, so what's your number four?
My number four is Paper Mario.
Nice, not my list.
Yeah, again, I didn't play this at the time. Like I think I spent all my money on Conker's Bad Fur Day. So coming back to this later, I played this after Thousand Year Door, which is probably a bit unfair on Paper Mario.
It's very much like the first go at something which is Thousand Year Door and then later Paper Mario is obviously sort of build on. But a lot of the magic of it's here, you know, famously they make Mario RPG on the SNES. Things go south between Nintendo and Square and Mario RPG 2 is no longer on the cards.
So Nintendo make their own Mario RPG series, Paper Mario with Intelligent Systems, adding this brilliant 2D effect. So 2D Mario Paper Characters in a 3D world, kind of leaning into the kind of arts and crafts stuff, which now is so commonplace in like, especially Nintendo first party games, they've really milked that, but back then, kind of a bit of a wow factor to it. A lot of its RPG systems are lifted from Mario RPG in terms of like action moves, which are amplified by like playing mini games or hitting timed button cues.
That's all very familiar, but it works. Like it helps turn the kind of repetition of a turn-based combat system into something that you're always actively engaged with. Like I will never sniff at that.
You know, there's a reason it's in, you know, the Yakuza Like A Dragon Say. Like I think it just, it's a little extra bit of something for your brain to kind of connect with, which I like. Like I know I say this all the time about Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, but you know, the pleasure of these games is them taking a world which is quite surface level and superficial, you know.
It's full of iconic things, but we don't really know what any of these things are really about. And it delves into them, you know, what is it like being Mario or Luigi or Peach or Bowser? Like giving them dialogue, letting them like voice opinions and have little lives right down to the enemies.
You know, yes, tick off psychology of a Goomba on your bingo cards.
Hooray, that Simpsons meme, hooray!
Hooray, say the thing, say the thing. Yeah, but it is that. Like that, I think that is a huge part of these games, is it kind of looks at something which is, you know, quite abstract and unknowable and goes, well, what is it like?
Almost like between Mario games, what are all these things like? What does a Koopa do? What does a Koopa think?
And I'm not saying it answers any of those questions in a particularly profound way, but like I think it's a really sort of cute, post-modern twist on a giant license that didn't need to kind of go down that route and investigate these things. And it's certainly what gives them a bit of like narrative spice or definitely the humor of these games is just being able to interact or the fact that Mario partners up with lots of other like enemies in the game or like children and like a young Goomba and a Paracoopa. And you get to work with things, you get to use their powers in battle, you get to use their powers to solve like the platforming puzzling.
Like I don't think any of these games are like any great shakes as like technical like JRPGs. I think they're quite like basic and designed just to be sort of churned through and enjoyed. You know, I don't, you know, I know some people hold Thousand Year Door up to be this like great masterpiece.
I don't think there's that much in it really between a lot of these games. But yeah, Paper Mario like still worth going back to. I think you can play it on Virtual Console now.
Like you could definitely play it on older Virtual Console, which is how I played it on Wii or Wii U. I don't remember. Yes.
Now you can play it on Wii U online subscription, I think. And it's still, you know, I'd say there's enough of a magic there that if you're into these games, you could probably, you know, do worse than going back to them.
And I think you tap into a good point with the fact that, you know, there was this break off point between Square and Nintendo. Like that meant the N64 had no RPGs on it basically. Like it just, it was completely, you know, sort of like barren for that genre.
So the idea that Nintendo were like, well, okay, we'll make in ourselves then. That's, you know, quite, this is a very, this is a series that people love and has really seemed to us to the test of time. I know that Thousand Year Door definitely cast a long shadow, Matthew, but you know, they've kept going and they've kept them at pretty high quality.
So pretty cool that late in the day on the N64, they hatched what their version of a modern RPG looks like. You know, that's pretty neat.
Yeah, and like so much heavy lifting is done here. So you know, while Thousand Year Door, you know, it's definitely more sophisticated in some of the stories it tells, some of the areas it goes to. Like the core of what it is, like mechanically, it's all here, you know, like there's really, there's not much different between this and what follows.
Okay, gotcha. Well, that's a good pick, Matthew. Quite diverging lists apart from the games I rate that you've put low down, but yeah, all good.
I'm not really joking. Okay, my number four then, Devil May Cry. So, this is genuine innovation.
This is like the birth of basically a new genre. Now there's definitely like, you know, there are links back to the likes of Golden Axe or Strider with Devil May Cry hack and slash game, but translated into 3D and done with this much panache, that was what was spectacular about it. So, my understanding is, Matthew, this game, it's key mechanic of you, like, scoop an enemy up into the air with your sword and then you shoot them with handguns and juggle them, came from a glitch, a bug in Onimusha where that would happen, where you would swipe an enemy and they would get stuck in the air, basically just being repeatedly damaged.
So, seeing that they basically turned that into a game series that would become much more popular than Onimusha. So, that's quite fortuitous. You play as Dante, this demon hunter, and it's basically you and this woman wearing a very tiny top, going into a big gothic castle, fighting these weird puppet monsters, these big ghostly Grim Reaper style monsters, massive boss battles.
Comes out of the gate with this really confident visual identity. This character where you're like, okay, this guy is cool. This is a cool character, this dude with white hair and big red jacket.
He's got swords and guns. Gives you a pretty decent armory. This is a very basic version of the Devil May Cry combat paradigm.
3 is the really key one when it comes to moving that forwards and giving you the different sort of like classes basically. Like the kind of like, you know, the trickster class and Royal Guard and stuff like that. Things that would really give you the versatility to keep playing it and playing it.
I would say there aren't like as many reasons to replay this one as there are to some of the later ones. I played the absolute shit out of 3, but 1 was still excellent. And it just, it was kind of everything that, it was just, in 2001, this is just incredibly exciting.
I could see why it was like, why it was a huge deal. It started life as a Resident Evil spinoff and became something else. Devil May Cry Man, it was super, super cool.
Loved it. And like I say, like when I saw it on the cover of OPM, I was like, what is that? I just need to fucking see this, I need to play this.
And ended up being a huge deal to me in my gaming taste, Matthew. So any thoughts on this one?
Yeah, I came to this series quite late, or rather I rented it at the time. We rented Devil May Cry 1 and I just, there was nothing else like it, like you say. And I didn't really know how to deal with it.
I didn't really know what I was meant to make of it. And I'm not saying it had a steep learning curve, but the pleasure of that game, the mastery, it wasn't something that I then appreciated more generally with games as much as I do now, say. So it's like an individual entry that I've had, you know, I've played through it, but you know, I could never make this game look particularly good.
But I'm definitely more familiar with later entries just due to like easier access to them or whatever. Like I really loved Devil May Cry 5. I thought that was absolutely tremendous.
And DMC is obviously good fun, quite different in its own way. But yeah, yeah, a good pick. You know, I would, you know, in a kind of, in a head list rather than a heart list, you know, this is easily one of the games, one of the year's best.
But it just doesn't necessarily have that direct meaning to me.
If you come to the series later as well, like I think the big Gothic Castle setting is cool. That is kind of what is distinctive about this one. But it's odd in some other ways.
Apparently, it was originally, you can tell this how the way the levels break down. It wasn't meant to have levels. It was meant to be like one big continuous adventure.
And then they added levels, which is why all the missions have weird objectives like, open the cathedral door. And that's kind of all you have to do in a mission. And so they can be super short.
And that's because it was meant to be just one big castle you could explore, I think, and then unpick it, you know, Resident Evil style, figure out where you're going. So they added that quite late is my understanding. It also ends with like a 3D on rails shooting element.
Like the final boss is like you're kind of like flying and you're firing orbs at this big thing in the distance. Bayonetta has like bits and pieces like this as well, you know, continue the Kamea thing. But it does mean it ends on a slightly sour taste.
It's not, there's not really a reason to play this one out unless it's like raw curiosity. But definitely in 2001, this was the big deal. It was much sexier and more exciting than Onomusha was.
So even 90 of that at the time is a big Onomusha head. So yeah, what's your number three, Matthew?
My number three is The Legend of Zelda Oracle of Seasons.
Nice. Is ages gonna be your number two?
Well, you'll have to wait and see. But remember what I'm about to say. We shall see.
Yeah, so these are Oracle of Seasons alongside Oracle of Ages to Game Boy Color Zeldas carrying on the lineage of Link's Awakening, you know, in terms of, you know, a lot of the kind of assets seem similar and obviously that kind of top-down feel. Oracle of Seasons is set in the world of Holodrum and hinges around a seasonal power changing rod, the rod of seasons is an easy way of saying it, which lets you change the world to different seasons and different elements of the world change with those seasons. So like in the summer vines grow and you can climb up them in the winter, there are lumps of snow that you might be able to climb over.
So, you know, the world changes in a few ways in the different seasons, which is kind of like the big hook of this game. What I love about this is A, it's just more Link's Awakening, which I think should be celebrated. Like it's, I really love the look of that game and the kind of controls of that game are really, really nice.
It's a really substantial adventure. It's got some great gadgets in it, which is even more miraculous given that there is this other entire game. You know, they made two huge Zelda games.
They were at one point meant to make three huge Zelda games. They were meant to represent the three bits of the Triforce. But, you know, if you are into those games, I feel like it's a Zelda, which even though you can play it quite easily now, I don't know if it's on the Switch online system yet.
I discovered these games on 3DS Virtual Console. It was when I sort of first played them back on O&M. So only quite recently, which is maybe why they sort of stick in my head and seem better.
But a great 2D Zelda game with like this quite fun visual flourish sees the introduction of Fuji Bayashi, the director, who is now Mr. Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. These games that were sort of made in a collaboration with Capcom. I don't know if he was a Capcom guy originally.
I don't quite know if that's how it works or if he was just the Nintendo guy embedded in the Capcom team. But he ends up being a really important figure. Maybe this is just forcing a narrative onto these games.
But I think almost like away from the main entries, he was allowed to have a little bit more fun. Like he introduces new races in these games beyond Zoras and Gorons. This one has like Subrosians who are this sort of race that live in this underworld kingdom called Subrosia, which is all very strange.
It adds new equipment that wasn't in previous games, like the seed shooter and things like that. And you just get the sense of like someone who's been allowed to kind of have a little bit more fun and sort of experiment with it. And I think you can see that in the mainline Zeldas that he's also worked on.
Like he's very interested in puzzle design and fun gadgets and gizmos. And I do think you can see the beginning of that lineage in some quite weird form in the Oracle's games.
Yeah, so, you know, if I could send any games back in time to myself in 2001, it would be these, which I asked for on like two different Christmases and didn't get them. Like I was hugely into Link's Awakening and these were like, you know, like you say, they are almost like ROM hack type games, really. Like they look very similar, they use some assets.
They must have been like budget-wise quite tidy to make, although, you know, they are made for Game Boy Color and, you know, in seasons as well. The way the world changes is very, it actually really makes the most out of that hardware in a way that few games do for the system. So it's a really beautiful looking thing.
These basically, they are available, by the way, Matthew on Switch, I checked. They were in July, they're made available so you can play both of these on Switch, which is really cool. Yeah, so I've played some of Seasons, that's kind of like as far as I've got, but I feel like it's something I will finish before I die because of their connection to Link's Awakening, you know, visually and in terms of the audio and stuff like that.
They're like, they're not asset flip games, but they are, I don't know, their relationship to Link's Awakening means you just have to play them, I think, at some point if you're a fan of that game. So yeah, good stuff, Matthew. So, okay, cool.
Your number three.
My number three is Silent Hill 2. So, Silent Hill, the original, I've played it once and I just got battered by monsters and I didn't know what was going on. And I found it utterly incoherent and I thought, oh fuck, is this just too old for me to enjoy now?
Silent Hill 2 is an immortal survival horror game. It's because it's mechanically quite simple. It's like a mix of light combat, melee combat and also sort of like guns as well, but not that intense.
You can work the difficulty right down and just absorb the vibes if you want to. And I do recommend doing that. I think you miss out on, but you can set a puzzle difficulty, then set a combat difficulty.
So whack the combat difficulty right down and just kind of go through it that way. That's how I played it a few years ago, a 2016 kind of time, emulated it. And the PS2 original is just something amazing about how they do the fog effects in it and the kind of like visual filters and stuff like that, the very grimy way this town looks.
So why is this game just held in such high esteem? It's because it is the mother of all like textured, rich horror storylines. Like it's the North Star.
It's maybe one of the most influential video game storylines ever in terms of its twists, but also what it tries to do in terms of the character psychology.
So, you play a man who comes to Silent Hill looking for his wife who says she wants to meet him there. He looks for her and finds this woman who looks exactly like her instead. And then also lots of fucked up monsters and very weird people who are in this town.
And there is a sense that something is not quite right. I think I've got the setup right there, Matthew. I don't think that gives away.
His wife died three years ago, which is the other key bit of information.
Yes, that is important. I was just making sure because you don't know how she died. That's the thing.
You come into the town not knowing how she died, but he has received this letter that she's waiting for him in Silent Hill at their special place, the place they used to go. You go there looking for her. You don't find her.
You find Maria instead. And then the truth kind of unravels over time where you are facing some of the most fucked up shit you've ever seen in apartment buildings, in a hospital and a variety of other locations. You end up going through the main town area several times as well.
There's a cool spooky bar. The music by Akira Yamaoka is absolutely impeccable. Just some of the most horrible, lichian sounds you'll hear punctuated with really, really nice pop rock kind of music as well.
It really is just, nothing else sounds like it. Really good. But Matthew, why don't you pick up from there?
Because this is always also on your list.
I agree with all that. I think everything you say about it is true. I think the reason I put it low on my list is that I came to this super late and by the time I did play it, I feel like a lot of it had been spoiled for me or like I knew too much about it.
And there's like a wow factor to some of its ideas, some of its imagery, you know, what its whole deal is. That is, you know, if you don't have that, I think it diminishes the story a little bit. Which is why I put it low on my list.
It's not a very sophisticated take. But you know, I am very envious of people who got to play this for the first time. It seems so adult and sophisticated, you know.
If your idea of survival horror is like the mad camp of Resident Evil, you know, what the characters are going through in this game and what's happening to them, what's happened to them in the past and the kind of psychological kind of believability of a lot of its ideas. It's just so much more grown up than Resident Evil. You know, maybe like the actual nuts and bolts of like smacking kind of bollocked faced nurses with lead pipes and sort of solving slightly baffling kind of almost like point and click puzzles, you know, is a little bit of a harder hang now, maybe a tiny bit.
But yeah, I also like, and this is nothing to do with the game, but like sadly there are a lot of bad imitators of this game. And it's, you know, if anything, it reminds you like how special it actually is that, you know, so many other people have tried doing this sort of psychological horror. And it's basically like an, it can be an invitation to like non horror or like the twists are always the same.
It's like people can't, loads of people grew up played for Silent Hill 2 and couldn't really get past it and just endlessly remake it, which isn't the game's fault. I'm not like marking it down for that. It's just an observation of like how important this game is and how easy it is to get this very particular like vibe wrong.
Yeah, I think it's sort of like, it deserves to be appreciated without that wider context. It has nothing to do with the game, I think. Just because imagine this clubbing you over the head at the time with like, oh my God, I can't believe what this is actually doing.
Because it is very, you do know something's wrong when you come to the town, it feels amiss. Like it's scary from the off, it feels wrong. The people there are very strange and spaced out.
It's just very unsettling from the off. And so you know there is a mystery to be unraveled. But I don't think anyone firsthand would guess exactly what is going on and what all of the imagery you encounter it means, you know, but yeah.
But like over the years, just hearing so much about it, like I actively saw out those answers before playing it like an idiot.
Yeah, same.
Because I kept hearing people talk about Pyramid Head and it's like, all right, I just have to like, I just have to watch these bits on YouTube. I just want to know what that is. I want to know what its deal is.
And like that is, I wish I'd been a bit more patient. It's kind of hard to, it is a little bit difficult to play this in its desired form now. Like the version I played was like a patched PC version which they kind of jazzed up to make look more like the PS2.
But I think like it's the right version of it feels locked to PS2 in a way, you know?
It does, yeah. And like, you know, that's why I play it when I go home to see my parents basically, because it's like a CRT TV there and a PS2 plugged in. And you're like, this is how it's meant to be experienced.
Your parents are like, come home and see us in our special place.
It's like, oh wow, where? Bricks have got very misty. I don't remember it being a brick.
I'm going to do it with old fucking oboe head.
That's so fucking dumb.
You hiding in a locker.
That's so unsettling. Don't conflate my dad with pyramid. That's the other thing actually.
It's like, even if you know the twist in this, this is how I experienced it. I did know the twist, right? Because frankly, I worked with Steve Burns and he banged on about this and Jacob's Ladder all the time.
And I didn't mind because he's very articulate. He made it sound very exciting. But it did mean that I just knew inside and out what that twist was.
But I didn't know everything that happened in this game. I didn't know what the pyramid and head encounters were like. When pyramid head turns up and it assaults those weird monster things, it's so fucking unsettling and strange.
Yeah, I don't know. It's just like you're brushing with something truly inhuman and just, and awful. And yeah, I don't know.
Acast, again, this kind of creates existential problems for Silent Hill. They don't know exactly what to do with it. I think 3 is a pretty cool game.
Maybe we'll talk about that in a future episode. But yeah, 2 is just, yeah, this is just, like you say, broken the brains of so many game designers. Do you think there would be that twist in Bioshock Infinite with Booker being Elizabeth's father and he sold her?
Do you think all of that would be in, and Comstock being him as well? Do you think all of that would be in that game if Silent Hill 2 hadn't happened? Because sometimes there's big twists where there's some other psychological element that's buried beneath.
This game is kind of responsible for all of those. That just didn't exist beforehand. I suppose Metal Gear Solid 2 does something similar as well.
There's an identity flip element to that.
Or they feed into it, can't are they?
Yeah, it must have been quite a wild place to work in the early noughties.
Really weird Christmas parties.
I still think you can play this PCSX2, whack this down to 480p. I think you can enjoy this quite nicely on a modern PC still. OK Matthew, what's your number two?
My number two is The Legend of Zelda and The Oracle of Ages.
OK, interesting. What's interesting about this game and distinctive about this game?
It is the better of the two. I mentioned earlier that they kind of align to the Triforce. I don't know if this is like Buncombe or just a promotional line.
So the line was that each of the three games was going to be aligned with a different bit of the Triforce. Power, wisdom and courage. And that would be reflected.
And in this game, Oracle of Ages is allegedly the Triforce of Wisdom. So it's the puzzly one. It's the one which has got the hardest dungeons and the weirdest logic in it.
And I don't know if that's entirely true because the combat in this game is noticeably harder than the combat in Oracle of Seasons, which is meant to be the actiony one. So I don't really buy that. But what I do buy is that this is the one with the better dungeons.
It has a time mechanic, as Oracle of Ages would suggest. There's a lot of going into the past, meddling with stuff to change the future. Obviously, you know, very similar to what was going on with Young Link and Adult Link in Ocarina of Time.
But they explore the idea really fully. They're not just trying to think about 3D space, but 4D space, the idea of changing something in the past, change the future. My read that, again, Fuji Bayashi is really into Zelda puzzles.
A lot of that comes from this game. This is, like, really hardcore. You have to do a lot of creative thinking with weapons.
There's a really good set piece. We go to an island and you're, like, stripped of all your items and you have to recollect them using the order you collect them to unlock the next one. So it's got this, like, slightly experimental streak to it.
I just think it's a much fuller Zelda game than Oracle of Seasons. Am I putting both of these games on this list? Because I could only think of nine games.
Maybe. But that's the list we're getting. If you play one of them, Oracle of Ages is the one, I think.
If you're into the mad sort of spatial dungeon puzzles, which I do enjoy, there's a lot of that.
But the season stuff is visually appealing, Matthew.
Maybe like Seasons is the easier hang and a bit more like, obviously, entertaining on the surface. If anything, it shows that these two games are very distinct entities and should both be enjoyed and can both appear on a top ten list without it being weird.
No, I like that. That sounds like you're fine. No one's questioning that, Matthew.
We're all good. Okay, great. Yeah, great to hear you discuss those games.
That's cool. I can't remember if they made your original Zelda top ten. I think they might have done.
Yeah, Oracle of Ages was like number nine.
Okay, good. All right, so my number two is Max Payne.
Higher on my list.
Oh, I did wonder. I did wonder. That's good.
In fact, I guess we go on to your number one, right? So that would be this game.
Max Payne.
Amazing. Okay, great. So we both had it super high.
It's funny actually watching the sort of like hype around Alan Wake 2. I get the impression that that's a game that's going to be beloved by games journalists and then sell probably like one million copies. So now be like it's its profile and like the obsession with Remedy and their games and the character of their game stretches all the way back to this, this noir infused, matrix infused third person shooter where you basically activate bullet time, jump into rooms and gun dudes down.
But Matthew, why don't you pick it up from there?
Yeah, I mean jumping into rooms in bullet time is like the main event here. It's why I was interested in this, you know, to be a 15 year old in 2001 was to have seen The Matrix, you know, a bit earlier and be absolutely obsessed with it and dreaming of one day a game being as cool as that. This also kind of coincides with having, you know, a PC that was capable of playing games and making them look pretty nice.
This was back when there was still a very big visual gulf, I feel, between the PC versions of things and the console things. Max Payne has just always been a mouse and keyboard game, like the precision of the shooting, you know, Max Payne 3, mate. It kind of unlocked that game playing on PC and for me this is just forever tied to playing on PC.
I mean, reading about it in PC Gamer and just like, like how visually splendid it looked in the screenshots. You know, every screenshot of this game, every still frame looks really exciting because he's flying through the air. He's got that Sam Lake kind of mad face going on.
There's like bullet trails going over him. You can see like particles of tiles breaking off where bullets are hitting them like ricocheting bullets, sort of turning splinters of wood off tables. You know, it was just a sort of fidelity of action that I'd never seen anything quite like it.
And, you know, the slow motion, while definitely a strategic power of like letting you jump into the rooms and kind of clear them out in one go, it also felt designed to just let you look at the thing and go look at how detailed, look at the particle effects, look at everything moving in slow motion. Like it's a really like kind of obvious mechanic when you sort of think about it from a kind of gunplay point of view, but what it unlocks like visually and just how amazing this game looks, it was just really, really special. And, you know, yes, it's all quite short, but it's got so much character to it, like the weird kind of Nordic stuff that they weave into it and like the nightmare sequences and the pulpy VO which, you know, we've obviously sent up on this very podcast with our hilarious Max Payne monologues.
Yeah.
But, you know, it just, it has such a sort of singular tone, it really knows what it is, and if it's a bit cheesy, then so what? You know, it's very rare that you get games with such a clear identity to them.
Yeah. Also, I would argue that this game has not dated because this is a mechanic in this exact form that doesn't really exist anywhere else. I mean, I think there is like El Paso Elsewhere as a game that just came out that has actually directly riffs on this, but, you know, it's like one-to-one mouse and keyboard controls.
It was revolutionary at the time because it felt so good. It was like so many games would do bullet time, but this did it perfectly out of the box, you know? Like, they got it straight away first time, and like, you couldn't really improve on it, and I think that still stands all these years later.
It's the fact that it turns third-person shooting into a puzzle, where it's like you have a finer amount of ammo if we have to reload. You jump into that room, you have a finer amount of bullet time, and it's about using everything efficiently, and if you do so, you string together basically the most badass kind of like third-person shooter set piece you can think of. It's cinematic in that true sense, you know?
So, yeah, yeah. I remember this being a massive PC Gamer game. I remember PC Gamer's enthusiasm for this was so infectious.
It was what made me think, I've got to basically cajole my friend Donald into buying this. I can play on his dad's nice PC. So, that's exactly what I did.
And, yeah, it's fine on consoles, but it belongs on PC in a very specific way. So, yeah, Max Payne, man, so good. And the actual storytelling stuff has chops as well.
It's well-written, it's entertaining, and they're following the trail of blood. It's an iconic bit of video game storytelling. It's pretty much a feat to nail that side of things as well as your cool third-person bullet-time combat.
So, yeah, top stuff, Matthew. That's your number one. So on to my number one, Grand Theft Auto 3.
What a fucking predictable end to this podcast, eh? But you've got two games there that, like, clobber people around their head with something they've never seen before, right? That's something that happens this year.
People hadn't seen survival horror done like Silent Hill. They hadn't seen shooting done like Halo in Combat Evolved, which came out here in 2002, but 2001 in America, and Metal Gear Solid 2 with its weird themes and the twist of having a second protagonist, and, you know, Max Payne with that amazing bullet-time combat, and then Grand Theft Auto 3 with the 3D open-world genre basically being birthed with one game. Like, it's pretty staggering, you know, as a year.
So, Matthew, why don't you talk a bit about this, because you put this lower down your list. I think that's absolutely fine, because, you know...
It's kind of mad, because if I think back to how important this was and how excited I was for it, you know, not having a PS2, having to rent a PS2 to play it, because it was just like, I have to play this. You know, it's just my number one objective for this year is to try this game, because, you know, it's apparently the world. It's just the whole world again.
A bit like Shenmue, it was like one of the promises of video games from that period, that anything that kind of like came close to delivering on that was just so exciting to me. And, you know, I played it just so much for the weekend that we rented it. It was like burning into my head.
I was having dreams about it. Like the interface was like burned inside my eyelids. So whenever I kind of like closed my eyes to sleep, I could just sort of see that game and that world.
You know, very few games have that impact. And, you know, by that strength, like it probably should be like a number one. I just, I feel like it's so clearly like surpassed by other games and they've built on it and they've evolved on it and taken that promise and like run with it.
I do find it quite hard going back, like doing that for, you know, when we went back with like the re-releases. It just didn't quite, you know, it felt quite old and archaic. It was locked away as this quite happy memory.
And, you know, it seems a bit unfair going, well, it doesn't really compare much to Gta 5 now, does it? But, you know, that's mad and what does. But it is slightly diminished for that reason.
But, you know, the promise of getting in a car, driving around the city, you know, just that sense of freedom, the crazy possibilities of it. I mean, if anything, a game that I liked less when it gave me something specific to do and I kind of busted up against it's like, you know, shooting or weird action mechanics. But just the promise of being out and about, you know, like 90% of what Gta would ever be, like arguably is here.
But the 10% of extra, like, polis or evolution is what make the later ones for me.
Yeah, you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with what you said there. Like, I think that's a fair assessment when you look at, like, you know, you're just one year away from Vice City, which kind of gives you that sort of, like, synthetic comic book-y, sort of, like, pop-cultury layer to it.
And hammers. You can hit people with hammers.
And yeah, then obviously, like, San Andreas would do the same thing and then increase the scope vastly. So actually, like, I don't know if we're still doing the pod in a year, Matthew. We should do 20th anniversary San Andreas pod.
That'd be fun. We could play through that remaster, see if they fixed it at all, and talk about that game, because that was quite the thing when it came out. So yeah, the thing is, like, obviously, like, we've covered this, you know, we had that episode where we did the 20th anniversary of Gta 3, and I talked about my connection to it, which is as someone who didn't end up getting Vice City until later, but I had a whole year of just, I had this, an Agent Under Fire, and later I bought Unimusha, but I had nothing else apart from demo discs for ages.
So I just played this over and over again. So I don't think I've ever heard any combination of sounds at the start of a game than the Rockstar logo, going da, da, da, jaoom, jaoom, and then da, da, and then the credits kicking off. I must have heard that hundreds of times.
It still burned into my brain.
You've got the ear version of Screamberg.
Yeah, very much so. But I actually, I think like it's, as I probably said on that podcast, the fact that it has its own identity by not having all this licensed music that they later have to strip out the game and they do new versions of it because they don't want to pay the license fee again. And like it has this very particular identity and weird, urban, modern feel.
Like it just, it feels like, with all these newspapers going around, these very like loud industrial sounds, like just like this kind of like Finchery New York or something, like a bit of Scorsese, bit of Fincher, just I watched a really good video recently that kind of talks about how this is almost like a horror game setting because it's just so bizarre, like the NPCs who fade into view out of nowhere. That's because of the pop-up, but it's also just because like there's something a bit unsettling about it at times. It just, it feels off in this early PS2 kind of way.
I kind of know what they're tapping into. I do sort of get it. But yeah, I really like it.
I think I agree that the mission design is super simple. It's like the most larval form really of what it would become, but you definitely like all of the seeds are planted here. And I was obsessed with it.
So it has to be number one. It was a turning point in the history of video games for sure. Matthew, we did it.
It was a long pod. I thought it was one of our best ones. I thought it was really good.
Did you enjoy that?
Yeah, I thought that was a better list. Yeah, I think as we've got closer to like present day, like we're still too close to some of these things. You know, you need a bit of distance from them.
And, you know, maybe the kind of rawness of the era gets in the way of like, you know, the fun of the times. You know, I only really remember the good bits of 2001 and September 11th.
I just like the idea that you've got like this. You just have a diary from the time, but it just says September 11th, 2001. Saw Moulin Rouge today.
That's all it says there.
Saw Moulin Rouge, drank a little apple juice, had a pretty good time.
Oh, dear, on that problematic note. Not that we're making lights, just to be very clear. Yes.
But yeah, I really enjoyed that. I thought it was good. I think there's material here.
We could definitely do 020304 if you fancy it and see how that goes. It'll probably come around to 02 in the new year, Matthew. But yeah, that was fun.
