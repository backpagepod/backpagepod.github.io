Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. The Nintendo Switch draft results are going in your favour, and I'm here to say for the first time, I think you have the best picks and deserve to win.
Oh!
Yeah, yeah.
Do you mean the first time ever in a draft? Or are you saying this about, like for the first time since we did that draft?
No, for the first time ever, I firmly believe...
For the first time ever?
I firmly agreed that you have the right set. I mean, like...
You genuinely think you deserve to win every other draft?
There's like a few, like the N64 draft, where I was like, well, that's bullshit. Or the PS2 redraft, where I was like, well, that's bullshit, because MGS2 and Fahrenheit are not tip-top PS2 games, if you ask me. But this is the one where I'm like, I see the results.
I'm like, yeah, I get it. When you got Mario Kart and a Zelda, I was like, well done. And then two Marios you got, you know, it was pretty good.
Yeah, I've seen some people saying we should have given Catherine a rough ride for Breath of the Wild as a Wii U port.
Yeah.
But I don't think that would have radically changed things.
No, I think it was lovely having Catherine on the show. I think she let you get those two Mario games and should have stopped you from getting at least one of them by picking that instead of when she picked The Witcher 3, because she blocked me from from any Zeldas, but didn't block you from two Marios. And I think that strategically, I needed her to be there a little bit, you know?
You know, I don't want to talk in a condescending way about it, because we've done a lot of these drafts. There are certain categories where I'm like, even though I suggested we do that category, I thought that is not going to have any bearing on the final result of this. So I just let it go until the end.
And so that's maybe what happened.
Yeah, it's interesting as well, because I think it's what I realize is unique about the Switch compared to a lot of other platforms is that the stuff that will win the draft really does get picked in the first six or seven picks and then everything else kind of won't make a difference either way. One thing I thought was when you picked Mario Kart and I got Smash Bros, I thought, well, I like Smash Bros, but that never wins in a one on one duel with Mario Kart. That's just, let's face it, that's just the case.
Smash Bros hasn't necessarily done it in previous drafts.
Yeah, I agree with that. It's never really been a needle mover in that way, has it? Particularly the soundtracks draft, Matthew.
Outrageous, outrageous behavior. So yeah, I wish you well in your victory there. I think that is well earned.
I just think that it's a powerful combo. You got two, what I think are great Mario games, combined with one of the big Zelda games on the platform, Mario Kart. I think at that point, you had it sewn up really.
So yeah, with no one to stop you from taking Mario's, it was just an assured result. So congratulations.
Thank you. Well, you never know what could happen. Like things tend to go a bit loopy in the middle.
It's true. But I think we kind of needed a bit more of a civil draft, you know, because we're going to do that 360 redraft next month, and that's going to be the return of Dave Scarborough and Ashley Data podcast. You know, that's going to descend into name calling, petty nonsense and all that kind of stuff.
It was a bit more civilized, wasn't it, the Switch draft? So yeah.
Yeah, I think so. It's a civilized console. Like, there's no need to turn into rabid dogs to fight over the Switch library because there's like 50 great picks.
Indeed. So it's all quite relaxed. It's all quite nice.
No one feels too hard done by. Yeah. I know some people wanted it to be spicier and that they wanted us to go into some of the sort of the weirder corners of the Switch library.
But why would you do it? You know, it never wins the draft. It proves that you know the Switch library well or any console library well.
But that doesn't win votes. It just wins you a minute of smug satisfaction in the episode.
Indeed.
And you go, oh, interesting pick, which is code for you fucked it.
Yeah, which is code for I'm not voting for you, Ashley Day, despite your very novel sort of...
I mean, Ash's results in the last draft, he did way better than I thought he was going to do. He made me question my whole draft strategy. I was like, maybe picking bonkers stuff is the key.
Yeah, I think sometimes as well people like a guest and they like to make the guest feel welcome and so vote for them on that basis. So maybe there's a little bit of that. But yeah, I agree with you about niche picks.
I thought between us, we had Ender Lilies, 13 Sentinels and Paranormal Sight. That's a pretty good trio of slightly more left field picks. There could have been more obvious ones.
So I think that's all right, you know? And yeah, yeah, I felt like we were sort of broad as well as sort of deep with the selections in that draft. A lot of good conversation around the Switch.
I was very happy with it as an episode. Even if I was poorly as fuck making it. I had such a bad cold in that episode.
But I was just really just stumbling through it. I could just hear myself when I was editing it the next day when I was also ill being like, well, that's just an ill man hosting a podcast that. But alas.
So this is a What We've Been Playing Episode. We've got a whole bunch of stuff to talk about. It's been a busy couple of months.
So we've got a chunk of things that have accumulated. Assassin's Creed Shadows, Matthew has played loads of that. I've played a bit of that.
No doubt that will be a slightly interesting conversation with a few different takes of the mix based on.
I wonder how it's going to go based on how much we've each played.
So that's coming up. I've played a load of Avowed, which I know is an older game. Matthew has played Pirate Yakuza, which he's put brackets a bit old hat now, so he might keep it short despite only being a two-month-old game.
But that means it's dead to Matthew Castle. I might be on the cover of Retro Gamer at this point. Split Fiction, of course, which has been another wildly successful co-op game from the studio Hazelight in partnership with EA, who publishes nothing else like that game, or like those games, but somehow it's been working out.
Matthew's got a game called Type Help, which I don't know much about. And I've got a game called Threshold to discuss as well, which people might have heard of, that came out last year. So a chunky bunch of stuff, Matthew.
But first of all, I thought we should talk about Silent Hill F and that reveal, because I thought that would look fucking amazing. And my expectations for that game, which we knew was a period setting Silent Hill game, was, you know, we're just a little bit, a little bit cautious. I had a feeling that after a certain point, after the previews, that the Silent Hill 2 remake would be good, but I think we're all just waiting to see how the whole Konami making computer games thing again works out.
But I thought this game set in Japan, with a lot of really interesting imagery, looked like it had the stuff. What did you think?
It was a bit of a pre-rendered, don't really know if any of this is the game, which you know, you always have to sort of take with a pinch of salt. But this sort of setting has worked well for Japanese survival horror games, Fatal Frame, Forbidden Siren. Those are, I'd say, slightly more like niche concerns and maybe the idea of Silent Hill being like a slightly more mainstream version of that's quite exciting.
You know, the sort of historic town, the Japanese inflected sort of J-horror tropes than just the sort of meaty monstrosities of the other Silent Hills. I thought it was super striking. I think the kind of the use of the red flowers instead of the rust is really interesting.
I liked what they showed of the, is it the other world? I can never remember the all-encompassing terms for the two realities. It was like Fog World and the other place.
Yeah, the other world, that's right.
Yeah, and that place looked suitably spooky. It actually looked a little bit like what I kind of wanted from Ghostwire Tokyo a bit more. You know, like the iconography of that, but, you know, ramped up to be a bit scary, but not so different that the schoolgirl protagonist didn't appear to be wielding like a big lead pipe, just to remind you that, yes, this is Sun Hill.
So even though these are very region-specific enemies, you'll still be smashing their faces in with a big old pipe, because that's what the game demands.
It's true. I feel like it helps that the J-Horror tropes, or at least the influences that maybe have shaped some of the tone of the game, haven't really been part of the fabric of pop culture more broadly since the early noughties. So some of this stuff I think will feel fresh again.
And it doesn't also doesn't look like a complete recycling of things I've seen before. It looks like a bit of a mix and match, remix kind of approach to it, which is good. I felt like I was seeing fresh imagery in that game.
I felt like I was seeing things I've not seen in games either for a long time or at all, which is always a good sign. And, you know, actual themes will hopefully be part of the mix. It certainly feels like there's some suggestions of themes from the trailer, which is what you want, because obviously Resident Evil has no themes at all.
Like that's what we pointed out when we played Village. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens, basically. It's like Mr. X is not a theme.
He's a great villain, but he's not a theme, you know? It's just like, look how cool it is when this city is on fire and there's loads of zombies in it. Not a theme.
But Silent Hill, you can always depend on for that.
So the theme is big men are scary.
It's also the theme of this podcast, Matthew. So that's good. But yeah, looking forward to that.
It's rumored to come out in the third quarter of this year, so it might not be too long away. I've got the impression from looking at it that visually it could match those graphics. So it did look a bit pre-rendered trailer, I agree, but it looked to me like it was attainable, you know?
So...
Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, Silent Hill 2 Remake was absolutely gorgeous. I got the faith they can transfer that across.
I also like the chap in the presentation who's writing it, who I can never remember his name, but he wrote the visual novels, the When They Cry series, which are these sort of like hundred hour long mystery occult thrillers. And while I don't want Silent Hill F to be 100 hours long, I think that would suck. The idea of him applying his eye for fucked up scenarios and gnarly twists and great character beats, you know, I'm excited to see the marriage of that writing style with something a bit more kind of propulsive and AAA, I guess.
So it's a good team behind it.
Yeah, for sure. And that also feels like the thing to me in the sense that it's about the good taste behind who they're working with and what the influences are. And you know, it's no code as obviously the other studio that's making a Silent Hill game that we know about.
And so, you know, it's and there's another Konami project in the works from Blooper Team following Silent Hill 2 remake. So it feels like so far a sort of slightly lukewarm Metal Gear Solid port aside feels like it's going pretty well. So, yeah, I've got my fingers crossed for that one, Matthew.
Yeah, it's weird that that's taken quite a long time since they announced it, where Silent Hill seems to be charging ahead. You know, that there's no other sign of the next Metal Gear or a Metal Gear spinoff or something. Like you would think if there was any series you were going to make bets on multiple games in, it would probably be Metal Gear over Silent Hill.
But that doesn't appear to be how it's playing out, which is kind of wild. A complete side note, you know the chap who's heading it up, I think he's called something like Okamoto.
Right.
He's an ex-Nintendo guy.
Oh, right. The name does ring a bell, actually.
Yeah, he worked, I don't think in like a director capacity, but I'm pretty sure he worked on like Luigi's Mansion, like some early GameCube stuff before leaving. Like Nintendo people tend to be lifers. I'm always interested in people who leave Nintendo and what they go on to do.
Like the idea that the ecosystem didn't quite suit them, where everyone else seems happy to stay there for like 50 years or whatever. And the idea that you'd like leave there and go and make fucked up horror games at Konami, I think that's quite funny.
I respect that. That's a good career pivot, if you ask me. I'm getting like a little taste of it with Luigi's Mansion, but thinking I need harder stuff than this.
You know what I mean? I see that was the reason behind the pivot. Last thing I wanted to mention Matthew before we got started on the games was, one of my predictions came true, the Bit Reactor Star Wars Tactical Game that was announced ages ago.
This is an X for Axis people making this, formerly XCOM 2 team basically, making this in conjunction with Respawn. This is being revealed at Star Wars Celebration next month. I think I've got two so far this year.
We should start calling you the Oracle. Move over.
Michael Pachter.
Piers Harding rolls.
Yeah, Piers Harding tubby rolls his back. So that's good. Just wanted to point that out, Matthew.
So we get to our first game of this episode, Assassin's Creed Shadows, which is out by the time you're listening to this. Is that right? Actually, Matthew should be right.
The 20th.
20th, yeah. So that's right. It's out now.
It is a weird game in the sense that it seems to be like the carrying all the baggage of a lot of Ubisoft business stuff that really have nothing to do with the game. So, game set in Japan, the game has been bashed a little bit for being late to the party on a period Japanese setting and it was delayed obviously by months off the back of Star Wars Outlaws not performing that well and yeah, arrives and there's a lot of like weird Ubisoft business stories doing the rounds around this, all rumors, but rumors that their IP is potentially being auctioned off, that they're forming a new studio that's not Ubisoft, but has the Ubisoft IP in conjunction with Tencent, like loads of really weird sort of like what the fuck business stuff. That again, if you're a developer on this game, I feel bad for you because that is not your problem.
That should not be your problem. It's a load of baggage the game does not need because already Ubisoft games get loads of stinging hate from YouTube comments as it is. And there's a load of racist stuff, racist kind of like bastard stuff going on as well with this game.
So I can't remember the last time a blockbuster arrived with this much baggage attached Matthew. I'm guessing you've observed that in the run up to this release.
Yeah, absolutely. Like people seem to have built up this narrative that if it doesn't work, they're absolutely fucked and it needs to sell sort of X million copies to save them from outside interests or whatever. The problem with those narratives is if enough people say them and believe them, that's sort of how stocks and shares work.
It just becomes true because that's the fucked up nature of things. You can will things into being successful or failure just by saying it enough. So yeah, that sucks.
But yeah, definitely the... Interesting you mentioned the kind of late to the party thing because I remember... Well, basically ever since Assassin's Creed 1, when people have rumored the next location of Assassin's Creed, which used to be a thing people were very invested in, when Assassin's Creed was a bit more of an all-encompassing blockbuster mega hit, there'd always be articles and think pieces and theory pieces about, well, does this hint at the next location of Assassin's Creed?
Do you remember that from your magazine days?
Yeah. For whatever reason, it just felt like it was the logical next step.
Japan's always been on the list, so to see them finally come to it, that's exciting. How do we want to tackle this one?
Why don't we talk a bit about the story and the dual protagonist? That might be the best way to tea us off, because there is a lot to get your arms around with it, isn't there?
Yeah. I should say first off that it's obviously part of the lineage of like the modern era of Assassin's Creed that starts with Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, where it's like a big open world RPG, there is like loot systems in it. And one of the things that they've been talking a lot about this game is obviously there are two protagonists, an assassin called Naoe and a samurai called Yasuke.
And the kind of broad pitch has been the samurai melee combat is the kind of melee combat you know from Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. And they've been doing that, building on that and improving on that. And then Naoe is more of a return to the sort of stealth basics.
And so throughout the game, you have a choice of which of these characters do you want to play. Basically which flavour of Assassin's Creed do you want? Is Naoe old fashioned Assassin's Creed and Yasuke is modern Assassin's Creed?
I feel like that's the rough pitch of it.
That's a good way of boiling it down for sure. Definitely the two parts of Assassin's Creed's identity are wrapped up in that. Yeah, so the game then, I mean, you've played a lot more of it than me.
So certainly in the opening hours, you start as Yasuke and then the game flips to Naoe for quite a long period of time.
Yeah.
At least that's when I stopped playing not to get too ahead of myself. Right.
So you didn't get to the reappearance of Yasuke, which is like 10 hours in, I should say.
10 hours?
Yeah, it's a big, well, depending on how much fucking around you're doing, the first that, you know?
Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, I did sort of like note, I did think in my head, how are they going to balance these protagonists? And I would say that it's an interesting choice to have two protagonists, but you could tell at the previous stage that some people have bristled against this, that maybe structurally it means the game doesn't necessarily give them what they want.
But what do you think of how they handle the two protagonists and how they cycle them in and out? How much have you played so far?
But I've played quite a lot. I've played like 20 plus hours of this.
Right, right.
Like I've really kind of gone for it. But I've got an appetite for them. You know, I really, really liked Valhalla.
That was one of my favorites from that year. So I have been looking forward to this. So I'd say the first big thing to note with that duality is actually making you players now for the first ten hours, which I think you could probably do in five if you just came to story missions and didn't go off exploring like I did.
Because you play as her, you almost sort of forget Yaskay a little bit from that tutorial bit you play at the start. And then when he comes back in, it kind of makes you appreciate him a bit more because you're totally calibrated to the stealth and all of a sudden you've got this absolute tank. And it is quite a nice moment.
You know, it's obviously quite a risk to hold him back that long. But the payoff is you are suddenly like, oh, this guy is completely different to her. And he comes in, he absolutely just like churns through people.
Like the kind of, not gimmick with him, but I guess the hook of the character is that while he's got like big, powerful weapons, he isn't very capable at stealth. Crucially, he doesn't have eagle vision. So playing stealth is a lot harder because you can't see enemies through walls and all that kind of stuff.
And also his climbing is a lot slower and limited. There's certain kinds of obstacle or architecture he can't go on because he's so big. Like if you put him on a tightrope, he'll just fall off it and snap it.
Likewise, quite funny, if you do an eagle dive with him from a sink point into a hay bale, he just like belly flops and destroys the hay bale because he's so big and then he crawls out of it going, Oh God, that was terrible. Why did I do that? That's quite funny. But as a result of that, I think they really do a good job of making him feel very tight to the ground, while Nae is very off the air.
If you go to locations you've already explored as Nae, they do seem radically different as him. It may not sound like a huge switch, but from a perspective like being stuck on the ground and having to navigate things by stairways and doorways, that isn't really how you think about Assassin's Creed levels. And I quite like that moment, and it's enough of a differentiator between the two of them that I did find myself switching between them just to sort of sample them.
And there's other things like, you know, when they loot stuff, you sometimes loot stuff for the other character, so it's not just tied to what you're finding. So sometimes you're like, oh, I'll switch it up and see what I just unlocked for the other guy. But really that simple thing of like, oh, I've never really looked at an Assassin's Creed outpost from this angle before, because I've always been up there, kind of darting down and then escaping again.
That works for me really, really well, but it does take a little while to get there.
Can I ask a question on Noway, actually, because something I thought was really interesting in the opening chapters is that, they established that if you play it in stealth, you can take out the lights basically, and then there's a whole visibility system to this game that was not, I don't believe it's ever been an Assassin's Creed before, and I find that really interesting because it's a bit more of a meticulous stealth system, but it's a cool idea, and the bit I played of it, I liked the way it was used, and I was curious what you made of that and how much that helps to differentiate the nowy stuff.
Yeah, but I do like that. Like it feels like it has the most stealth systems of any Assassin's Creed. Whether or not it's like any more successful a stealth game than the previous games, I'm not sure because the problem I've always had with it is that once you're discovered, it's actually quite easy to escape because you just scamper off and parkour up onto the rooftops.
And in the older games, often the guards would climb up and pursue you over the rooftops. And that seems to be something they've just not worked into the AI for like since Origins Forward. And so like, basically, rooftops equals safe.
And having a safety net that guaranteed, it takes the tension out of stealth systems that would otherwise be quite sophisticated. So I didn't really ever like... That is a problem I have with it, you know, like it's not just the lighting thing.
She can also go prone. So she feels quite like, you know, solid snake and phantom pain in terms of like ability set. But if it goes south, you're like, you just sort of shrug it off.
And then the illusion just instantly vanishes that, oh, well, stealth doesn't really matter because in a minute's time, everyone will forget I was here and then I can just carry on. And I don't think until they've got the guts to really punish you for that or to send stuff up onto the roofs with you. I just can't see how it's ever going to fully satisfy us as a pure stealth game.
Yeah, yeah. I noticed that too in what I played. Like, even Assassin's Creed 2, didn't guards chuck things at Ezio when he was climbing on rooftops?
Yeah, people will shoot at you if you can climb, but she's so fast because they've made her basically like the best parkour person ever to show how nimble she is as a ninja. I don't think anyone's ever managed to knock me down from a climb, and I haven't played it on hard difficulty. I think that just changes how fast people spot you, like awareness speeds, rather than suddenly everyone's going to be up on the roofs with you.
But you just get all these big samurai lads sort of stomping around the bottom of the buildings going, Gosh, she's up there! And you're like, yeah, why don't you come up here and make my life a misery? Because the second you get hold of me, I'm absolutely fucked.
She's like a glass cannon, I guess. You know, like two hits and she's dead, where Yasuke can take many hits and has a much bigger pool of health refills to work from. Yeah.
So they have made them feel like individual people. The other slight problem with Naoi, and this runs throughout the game, is when you've got the big assassination missions, so the key story beats, you're hunting down this group of masked people from the start of the game. When you get to them, it's often scripted that it's going to be a melee fight.
Right.
Even if you sneak up on them, until much, much later in the game, you haven't got the upgrades to assassinate them in one go, which means you'll assassinate them for like half their health bar, and then you're in the same arena fight that you would be with Yasuke. And that to me feels like, well, if I've made my way all the way up here without setting off any alarms, why isn't there a variation on this? Or why isn't there a mechanic to reward me?
Because they've made a big thing of like, you can just play as her if you want, which I don't actually think is true based on what I played. You know, like several of the story missions split between them. Like you have to do as bit as her and then a bit as him.
But I often play as her, and often I get up to the top and think, I wish I had done this as fucking Yaskay, because now there's a boss who's going to kick my ass, because she can only take one hit, where he's built to have the fight. That seems to be a flaw to me.
Yeah, that seems quite messy. Also, I've always found Assassin's Creed had a weird relationship with the actual assassination part and how instantaneous that is, how often they let you as a player decide how to do it, and what the result should look like through, like you say, your skill, and trying to line up the perfect stealth assassination versus some other RPG mechanics that are maybe like... I know that even in Valhalla, wasn't there like a true assassination mode versus one that was more committed to the leveling system?
They had a natural skill tree progression that by the end of it, you could basically assassinate anyone in that game if you got close to them. So it was quite clean cut, but you're right, definitely in Odyssey, your assassination damage was tied to your stats. I'd say this is a halfway house.
They do it by health chunks. I don't want to get too into that, but they do it by health chunks and you can upgrade. So like this time I'll definitely take off four health chunks.
But when there's a boss character with 10 health chunks, I'm like, well, there's no upgrades in this game. They're going to kill this guy in one. I think you can turn on instant kills, but that doesn't really feel like it's in the spirit of the balance of the game.
Yeah. So I'm not interested in that.
Oh, that's interesting. Maybe I should have turned that on and I might have had a slightly different experience with it.
I feel like it's a series that's always wrestled with assassination and has never quite worked it out. There's been entries which have been a bit more like Hitman levels, where there are three different opportunities and you get to sort of walk around the environment, work out what you want to do. Assassin's Creed Syndicate did quite a good version of that and there are a couple of them in Valhalla as well.
But this one's back to the guy's in a room, you've got to get up to his room and then kill him. And it's not like there's a narrative that you can use to draw him out or do anything. It's quite like nuts and bolts.
I don't know, do they need to hire a Hitman developer to work on these games? Or just work out what is cool about assassination? Because it isn't fumbling through a melee fight once you've got to the room.
No, I think it's just that weird contradiction at the heart of the series where what they actually want to make is an open world RPG. But the original pitch of Assassin's Creed back in 2007 was we made Hitman across with Prince of Persia. And so the actual how you do it ended up being part of the DNA of the series based on that, even though, like you say, there are so many examples over the years of them not wanting to actually make that game.
And so it becomes a little bit of an albatross design-wise. And when you're trying to break down how these big assassination moments actually work, what they're really selling you is boss fights. They want...
It's not assassinations, it's boss fights. That's what they've actually made. And so, yeah, it's just...
I don't think... If they hired a Hitman developer, they'd have to basically redo from scratch how they make these games and what these games are about, because they're not about assassinations. That's just kind of like a superficial element of them that they've reckoned with in various ways over the years.
Yeah, it's just annoying, because the content of each main story mission, as is often the way in these games, is that there's like three or four feeder missions that set up the target, and they feel like, well, if you do this favour for me, I'll smuggle you into the castle, and if we do this mission here, his number one bodyguard won't be in the room with him, and if we do this mission here, it will distract all his guards and they'll run down to the docks because they're on fire. And you're like, oh, well, we've really set this guy up for like a shankin, like he's absolutely fucked. And yet he turns out to have a mile long health bar.
Why didn't we do something about this beforehand? Why didn't we give him food poisoning or something? Why didn't we anticipate, even with all that other stuff, there's still an incredibly tough motherfucker in the room, and it's the target.
That's kind of stressful to me.
Yeah, so let me tell you a couple of other things I observed playing this, Matthew. So, I thought that the melee combat and counter stuff was the best it's ever been in this series in terms of the pure combat dynamics. Do you agree with that?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
I just thought it was really interesting that they nailed that part. I thought, oh, this Yaskay's parry that you do at the very start of the game and then obviously now it has it too, but like you say, glass cannon, so much more fragile. It actually works as it should.
It's a relatively generous window by the standards of like a Souls-like, but that's not obviously what they've made. It's more of a, everyone can play this kind of narrative, open-world RPG.
It's a Castle-like, isn't it? Castle likes it.
Indeed. I was just quite impressed by that because I've always been a bit up and down on the attempts they've made to move in that Souls-like direction. I've never thought they were like best in class there and I don't think they are here either, but I think they're getting closer to it.
It's certainly just as polished as it needs to be, you know?
And it all feels very nice. I don't know if it's just psychological or whatever. I haven't put all these games side by side, but her parkour felt very smooth to me.
I very rarely ran into that classic Assassin's Creed thing where you're like, I can visibly see her handhold and she's not taking it. What the hell is going on? Whatever extra months they've taken to kind of polish it up, I think it has released in a state where both characters kind of do what you tell them to do, which isn't always true of Assassin's Creed.
So that's quite a big tick. Probably also quite a big fear for Ubisoft because they don't want to get dinged for putting out like another slightly uneven Star Wars Outlaws. So I get that, but I think it has paid off.
Like it's, I mean, it should be the standard we expect from 70 quid AAA games, but it isn't always. I have been, you don't really notice it per se because it's just in the ease of playing, but you come away from it thinking, oh yeah, that's pretty polished and smooth. My problems with it, they're not mistakes.
They're decisions I disagree with.
So should I jump in with a bit of negativity?
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, so first of all, I'm glad you're enjoying it. I don't want any of the developers who worked on this to lose their jobs or have a bad time. So let me just say that before I say.
Here we go. Brace yourselves.
The pacing of the opening hours of this game is dreadful. There's nothing wrong with the individual parts of the game, but you can see them straining to spread apart, like the good levels, the interesting bits of it into with just like filler and waffle and nonsense. And I think the biggest thing that harms this game is that I can't speak for Yasuke.
There's not much story you get from him in the first few hours. You just get that he's basically working for Nobunaga and he helps to clear out the, is it the Eager Village? Yeah.
At the start of the game, it's on fire, kills a load of people. So you get the impression that he's a very accomplished warrior. Then it cuts the Naue staff, who is part of the people who, Yaskay is basically invading, right?
So that's part of the converging story lines of the game. Is that all correct, Matthew?
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay. Then it does what I think are two very elegant tutorials.
One where you're Yaskay and it shows you how to basically do melee combat and parry and things like that. Then it cuts to Naue, you get a similar thing where basically you have to do an entire stealth level, teaching you the light and dark mechanics and sneaking through this level. It's not the end of the world if you get caught, but it's really just a way to teach you how all these different parts work.
All gets up and to that point. Then for some reason, the Naue stuff behaves like none of that happened, and you're doing more of the same tutorials. I think the Naue story is incredibly boring.
It's Assassin's Creed revenge story by numbers, nothing distinctive about it whatsoever.
What about the 10 mask dudes? That's quite cool.
Yeah. At the end of that level I just mentioned, we talked about this before, MGS3 style, all the bosses turn up together, and they're like, here are the bastards you have to fight over the course of this campaign. Very good.
But there's nothing else that's really distinctive I would say about that revenge story. Then it's just loads and loads of boring time with Naue's relatives talking to you at this farm. There are loads to do that.
These extended flashback sections you find with the most tedious objectives near the start of the game. There's the house management stuff, which I don't think is, well, I don't have a real opinion on that because I haven't seen where it's gone. But they're a bit like, here's one of the systems in the game.
You can build up your settlement, place like new buildings here, that sort of thing. But it just feels like moving through Treacle. It's just like, go all the way over here and do this, all the way over here and do this.
And none of that Naue background stuff adds up to anything. Everything you need to know about that character is in that one mission with the light and dark stuff, where you're supposed to kill this guy. And I don't understand why they bog down those hours.
I always thought it was such dreadful pacing that surely someone would be like, hey, have you noticed that the first few hours of our game are just boring as shit? Why has that happened? And so I honestly felt, I found that so objectionable.
I found that such a waste of my time. I was just like, oh God, if this is 60 hours long and there's 10 hours of good stuff in here, that's going to feel like hard work. So I know that that is not a fair and representative opinion of the entire game, but I really, really struggle with those opening hours.
I guess what I'd ask of the back of that is, do you think there's anything fair about that assessment?
The weird thing that they do is that the traditional origin stories for both Yaskai and Naoya are told, yeah, like you say, almost as flashback missions within the main body of the story. I don't know how they force you to play those. So I actually came to those a bit later.
Like I was doing Naoya's, I was exploring the world and just getting on with some of the Assassin's missions, which I think are quite good fun. But then you're right, there's these sort of memory missions where she's back in her home before this started and it's like the tutorials from the start of the game all over again. And it is odd.
I don't really know why they've done that, other than they've done 15 Assassin's Creed games where you learn to be an Assassin at the start. So this time they went, we're an Assassin already, but you'll have flashbacks to when he was. And you're like, why?
Why have you done this? They do the same with Yasuke when he turns up. You get missions which show you how he learned to sword fight.
And you're like, well, I'm quite good at sword fighting, actually. I've been doing it for several hours. This is odd that I've gone back here.
I actually quite like the Yasuke backstory because the whole, you know, him being a slave brought to Japan, it's got a bit of that Shogun energy going on. And it just feels a bit more interesting kind of a mix of characters and politics and geography, I guess. But I can understand how if the first things you stumbled into were these weird delayed tutorials, why you would think, oh, if this game's all going to be like this, it's not for me.
It made me wonder if they originally had those tutorials as actual chapters and then changed their mind and were like, oh, wait, the opening to this game is too boring, but let's do something rad in media res that gets people going. But we'll keep the original content we made because we already built those levels. I just, yeah, so confusing because it even teaches you how to parry and stuff again.
But you know how to parry it. I don't get it. It's really weird.
And yeah, the actual opening tutorials do an absolutely fine job of teaching you. And it's the kind of game where there's so much stuff in it and you're going to spend so long playing it that anything you're slightly uneven on, you pick up as you play. Well, that's how I find learning with these things.
I maybe understand 70% of the game, but after five hours I'm like, okay, I've got it. You know, I know what I can do. That is odd.
It just feels like a narrative flex that doesn't quite pay off.
Yeah, I just, I was maybe like overly reactionary with it. And maybe I should have just avoided those areas instead of going straight into them.
But I feel like between us, you have slightly less patience for the giant time sync games that they really, really have to like earn your time and earn your interest for you to invent. You know, you only do like one or two of these a year, where I tend to do like ten of them. And because, you know, I've got no quality control.
Well, I think I'm just I've got I think Stockholm Syndrome sets in with me like super quick. And I'm like, oh, well, I've done five percent of this game. I may as well do 95 percent.
Well, I think you are quite good at going, no, no, thank you. Well, that is not for me.
Well, I think it's because in general, I felt it feels a tiny bit retrograde from playing Star Wars Outlaws, which pushes the Ubisoft formula forward. And it kind of doesn't really feel like a Ubisoft game in some ways outlaws. Maybe it's not a fair comparison because they were starting afresh and they have a lot of serious baggage here.
But that game is quite exciting from the off. And the open world stuff is mostly optional and doesn't really waste your time. And a lot of it seemed pretty good.
And even if you finish the whole game with all the open world stuff, I don't think there's an egregious amount of it. This game definitely has the moment where it's like, okay, motherfucker, sit down because here's a hundred icons we're going to show you in this menu screen. And I think if you like Assassin's Creed, you expect that at this point.
But I think that was where I felt a little bit like, well, I don't think the game has earned my interest before. Before it's reached this point. But let me count that by adding in a few more positives, right?
It does look amazing. The world is incredible.
Amazing. Yeah. Like one of the best of this generation so far.
Definitely. To the point where I was like, oh, I would actually like to see this running on PC or playing on PS5. But just the way that, you know, basically like the big magic trick is the way that like the wind moves plants and trees around you.
It just looks fucking amazing.
And it's really hilly, so it's just quite interesting landscape. Like there's always stuff above you, which is quite cool.
Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, I mean, to be honest, that is the extent of my criticism.
That's your praise. Good trees. No, I do think, well, 800 people worked on this to give you good trees.
Well, as ever, the animations are amazing. And I did appreciate them putting the light and dark thing in the game, even though I do take your point about if you just go up onto a roof and it kind of shuts down the stealth systems, that seems like a major flaw of it. Yeah, I just wasn't terribly optimistic about it after playing those bits.
And, yeah, I don't know. But what do you think about my criticism of the story not being that interesting? And do you think that, A, am I being fair there?
And B, do you think it gets more interesting as the game goes?
It's very much like there are ten people you have to go and kill, you know, pretty much in an order of your choosing, limited slightly by like your level and the kind of the difficulty level of each region. I would say that none of the story missions, none of the big story assassinations have quite landed for me, for the reason I've said, like, I feel like the big assassination set pieces don't quite land. But I actually, like having spent a hundred plus hours playing Valhalla, I think there's slightly less busy work than there is in Valhalla.
You're gonna find that hard to believe based on what you see on the map. I promise you, there is.
I believe you. Don't worry, I believe you.
And a lot of what is there is there's loads of sub-assassination clusters, I guess you could call them. Like, if you can imagine you've got the central ten in the middle, you then have loads of smaller circles of, like, other evil organizations that different characters ask you to kill. And a lot of those are just people who are, like, out and about.
And, like, I'm not kidding. Like, I, you know, where I'm at at the moment, there's maybe, like, hundreds of people to assassinate in this game, to the point where I was doing one of the big story missions, and I was sneaking up on who I thought was the target, assassinated them, and then realized it was someone I was meant to assassinate from one of these sub-missions. Like, there's so many people to assassinate, they can't find enough locations to put them in, so that one of them was in one of the story missions.
I was like, who the fuck is this guy? Who have I just killed? Because when you kill them, it does this quite cool thing where, like, all the colour drains from the world, and it's just you and them in colour, and all the blood is, like, super red.
It's quite a cool visual effect, and it does it for, like, any of the sub-assassinations, too. And it just, it really made me laugh, that I was like, like, I cannot move for motherfuckers in this game.
That's like when, in the one sort of, like, dock warehouse in Dragon Age 2, where every major event in your life takes place, because there's not enough real estate in the game, except the opposite end of it, where there's so much content, and yet still, there's not enough places to these people. That's amazing.
Yeah, I, yeah, so I do take it. I think for me, like, I really like the Japan setting. I think it's cool that they finally done it.
I think it looks so good, and like, the seasons change, and like, the whole landscape changes with it. So it's always kind of refreshing itself every hour or so. Bit like Forza Horizon 4 in that sense.
Maybe it's dumb just to enjoy something. A basic, easy gameplay loop played out in astonishing graphics, but that has like filled a lot of sofa time for me. I'm not hugely engaged.
Like, I'm not saying it's a masterpiece, but I have found it quite compelling, and I am impressed with the look of the thing. I like that you can play it in the Japanese, you like that the characters speak Japanese, or the Portuguese characters speak Portuguese, which is quite fun. So it's kind of got a bit of that Shogun thing going on as well.
Yeah, so it's not like a full-bodied, like, this is not a masterpiece, but if you like having one of these giant time-waster games to play, what an endorsement. It's certainly like the shiniest one of this generation. I just dig it.
I like the music. I like the trees. Best windblown tree since The Witcher 3.
Well, that I will give it. I look forward to it getting that in the alternative Game of the Year Awards this year, Matthew. My personal feeling is if you are like me, a little bit of an Assassin's Creed skeptic in the sense that you don't compulsively play every game in this series, you don't, you know, maybe you didn't play Valhalla, maybe you've played like one or two of them from the past decade, which would describe me.
I would say play Outlaws instead because it's half the price and it is again very, very shiny. But I do think it's a little bit more stimulating as open world games go. And maybe comparing them is not fair, but I think it will give you a lot of the gameplay loop stuff without feeling quite as familiar.
Is that fair?
I think that's probably fair. I think a lot of people know where they stand with Assassin's Creed.
Yeah.
Yeah. Also, like I haven't finished it, but I get the impression that it's considerably shorter than Valhalla, which was like a hundred hours. If you just wanted to get through the campaign, it was like a big ask.
I feel like I've done like seven of the ten guys. It feels like it's going to be about 40 hours or something, and maybe that factors into it a little bit.
That's not too bad really. I'm pleased to be enjoying it. I did actually think after I sent you those messages on Saturday, am I just being a big fucking baby, which I want to do.
No. You've highlighted one of the weirder things about this game in that it has double tutorials. Yeah.
I'm so sensitive to pacing in blockbuster games, because I just never want my time to feel like it's been taken for granted and anytime a game does that now, I'm just like, I've really, I asked myself serious questions about what am I doing with my life a little bit. And it's why I go out of the way to praise things like Jedi Survivor where it's about 15 to 20 hours for that campaign with a load, whole layers of optional stuff you can go and do. But those will be a great 15 to 20 hours and that's what counts.
So something like Dragon's Dogma 2 where the journey has an amazing destination and it's really worth it, you know? But yeah, I actually appreciate you being such a trooper and getting through these giant games all the time, you know?
Personally for me, the interesting thing this year is going to be putting it up against Ghost of Tsushima 2. People may think this is fucking bonkers. I kind of prefer Shadows to Ghost of Tsushima 1.
I just think the look of the world, its vibe is just a little bit more, I don't know, grounded maybe. But I don't think that's going to be a popular opinion. I'm interested in how the reviewers are going to deal with it having played Tsushima particularly.
I think I am in the minority on that.
It twigs a tiny bit of familiarity, the setting where you're like, I feel like I've been either to this place covered in demon stuff in souls-like games or I've been to a more authentic version of it. Just more generally, it feels like-
Poor Japan, can't get a break.
Well, I don't want to be too reductive with that sort of thing.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah, I just imagine that Valhalla was just one of eight games that were set in British castles or whatever. You know what I mean? I think people get burnt out on it similarly.
But yeah, I don't want to hold it against it that much. More than usual, this felt like a blockbuster game I'd played before despite me being pretty impressed by the polish of it. Ghost of Tsushima also was a PS4 game, right?
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, and so I guess it'll be probably more interesting to see how it compares to this year's sequel, like you say.
Yeah, absolutely. But that is the big test for me.
Yeah, that's fair enough. But I don't think you are alone with that. I don't think everyone is a big Tsushima believer.
I think that's got a load of extraneous content that doesn't add much value to the experience. Like, in some ways, I think the magic of that game is the fact that the combat is the absolute dead middle split between hardcore and anyone can play this in a way that just really hit the spot for both audiences. And I think that is the tightrope walk of that game that it accomplishes.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, no, I definitely get that. It isn't quite as quite a sort of stylish or complicated as Tsushima. It's a little simpler, but...
That's some cool moves, though. Some cool little acrobatic sort of moves that you pull off. Little, basically magic powers, essentially.
Yasko, if you're quippin with a big spear, he does this horrible thing where he, like, cuts each of their arms off in turn. And so they're sort of standing there, just an armless torso. And then he swings it and chops their head off.
Which is quite disturbing. It's such an undignified death to go home to your family in bits like that.
That sounds great. I might reinstall it based on that. So, yeah, something for me to think about.
Brutal!
I was very grateful for the key, but I preferred outlaws. I'm sorry. Sorry Ubisoft.
Yeah, just wasn't quite... Wasn't quite doing it for me, unfortunately.
That's hilarious.
I'm revealing too much about myself there.
You are brute force, Yaskay, while I am subtle, nimble, noway.
Well, look, if the game didn't have double tutorials, we may not be in this position, but it does. Okay, next game then, Matthew. Very, very different.
You have to tell me about this one. Type Help you added to our plan. I'm guessing this is an indie game of some kind.
Yeah, it's one to be quite brief on, just because it's one of these, like the more you know, the more there's a spoil. It is an in-browser itch.io game. It is a sort of a detective reasoning game, an information management game.
So along the lines of Obra Dinn, The Root Trees Are Dead, Her Story, etc. Except about as minimalist as it comes. It's entirely presented as interactive text.
There's no imagery attached to it. And it doesn't really even explain what the central interaction is, or what it is you're looking at, or meant to be passing. You don't really know what the objective is.
You get told that there has been an incident, some bodies found in a house, and what you are interacting with, I'd say, pretty immediately becomes apparent, is audio transcripts of rooms in that house. And the game is to first work out how to navigate this computer system based on what it tells you, which I'd say is almost like the sort of tutorial of the game. And then once you understand the kind of basic rules of how this documenting system is working, to work out what happened in this house, using purely the transcripts of voices to track people around this building, I guess, and how they talk to each other and how they interact.
You begin to glean little bits of information. And it's so stripped back, but it's incredibly pure. There is only the information it presents.
I wouldn't say there's any of the wrinkles that I had with root trees, where you had this search engine you had to kind of master to start finding new information. Here is the information. It couldn't be fairer than that.
And yeah, from that, it just spins out. Well, I haven't finished it, so I've been playing it at lunchtimes and yeah, just really, really enjoying it. Everyone always talks about these games about, you know, I had notepads full of notes for Obra Dinn and I didn't really do a lot of that.
I'm not saying I'm a super genius or anything. I can just hold a certain amount of information in my head. But this is the first time where I've just had to have a spreadsheet to document stuff, to understand what the game is doing.
And yeah, I just love how focused it is. Whether or not it lands it, I'll be able to tell you in, you know, hopefully a few lunchtimes. But yeah, just picture me right now with a big old footlong sub, enjoying people being murdered in a mansion, maybe based on what I hear from these documents.
It's got no sound, no music. It's just text on a screen and it's kind of magic. But he manages, it's a guy, William Roo, I think is his developer's name.
That's right.
What he spins out of it is as enticing as an Obra Dinn or a Root Trees. Yeah, it's a pretty good magic trick, if nothing else.
Yeah, it's got that sign of an itch game taking off where there's over a hundred comments underneath the game itself, right? And have any outlets written about this yet, Matthew? How did you come across it?
I came across it on social media courtesy of Tom Francis was talking about it. He's big into these detective games and Marsh Davies as well. Yeah, how it reached them, I don't know, but it feels like it's percolating through the mega brain indie crowd.
Yep. Okay. Yeah, I know that.
Enough so that it's made to me, idiot outside mega brained indie crowd.
Well, you're the person who I want to hear talk about this, this kind of sub-genre of mystery game. So that's a cool recommendation for people. So yeah, if you just type in a Type Help game into Google, it comes up basically.
So yep, like Matthew, you could be sat at your desk consuming 1200 calories in sandwich form and trying to solve the mystery here. So yeah, it's a cool recommendation. I like that being chucked in there.
Then definitely a nice palette cleanser after all that Assassin's Creed chat.
So yeah, certainly.
Well, I thought I'd talk a bit about Avowed, Matthew, because it's not a game we discussed in much detail on this podcast. I think it was a game that probably you and I were not so sure that we'd enjoy.
Yeah.
Yeah. And so I have stuck with it a bit and played 12 hours of it now.
I said it was like the most seven out of ten ass looking game of all time in the run up to release. And I said that to maybe ten different times on WhatsApp, so just to put it out there. I get it wrong occasionally.
Well, I think some people do think this is a seven out of ten and maybe one of those sevens. And I personally think it's better than that for a few different reasons. I think what's really interesting about this game, which is basically a first person RPG in the mold of something like Skyrim, Oblivion, etc.
or sort of Obsidian Zone games like New Vegas, Outer Worlds, very much that style of open world RPG format. But set in the Pillars of Eternity universe created for those games which were term based RPGs, CRPGs as it were, very much in that more traditional Baldur's Gate style by design, you know, very much acclaimed, but destined to be smaller hits based on the type of games that they were. Although, you know, maybe these days there'd be a bit more of an appetite for something like that.
I don't know. But so they've set basically a slightly more action heavy Skyrim style game in that universe. And it's basically localized to one small setting.
And what is great about this game is I thought I would really bristle at the fictional universe. I wasn't, I'm always a little bit like turned off when I hear certain fantasy terminology that I'm supposed to take seriously. But it really has that light touch of playing something like Mass Effect or something like Fallout, where the dialogue is just very, very human and very fun and very sort of like, oh, this could just be a contemporary set TV show.
It's very much a kind of like well-worn style, very conversational, but it really helps to break down those barriers. It immediately presents you with a companion voice by Garrus from Mass Effect. So, you know, just a massive point in its favor, really just doing some heavy lifting there, I think having that voice actor in the mix.
And then makes a few really good choices. So, I think that I've kind of isolated it down to a few key decisions that they make that really bring this game to life. The main one, I think, is that the way that quests are provided to you as a player promotes this feeling of discovery, even if it's not always true, even if you are sometimes just going up to someone with an exclamation mark and going off to do something for them.
A lot of the time in the open world, you'll stumble across something. A lot of people have pointed this out as like a high point of the game. I think it's also the fact that I've never played an Obsidian game that's got combat that's this good.
So the feeling of melee combat or firing off spells, if you go down more that route, or you can mix and match a little bit, that they've got that part really, really right. If you go back to something like New Vegas now, I think you really, you notice that it's approaching 15 years old. It makes sense that it's not going to be quite as refined as a first-person experience.
Here, I think they got that just right. The other decision I really love is that it's parkour as fuck, this game. There's so much parkour in it.
So much of the game is about, how do I get up there? And then finding your way up there, which involves a series of basically finding the right platforms and making a few leaps of faith, precarious jumps in order to progress. It's not like Mirror's Edge levels of complexity, but it is a bit different and it is very fun.
And so I think it is a cut above the Outer Worlds. What I played of that, I played the entire first area of that and felt like I'd played it before and felt like it was not the most polished version of the kind of thing it was offering. Here, I think it's actually, this is a really good attempt to what feels a bit more of a, not pocket size, but more traditionally sized Skyrim style RPG with a colorful and fun setting and a load of good quests with a few interesting consequences off the back of them.
That's where I'm currently at with it, Matthew. So I know you've played a little bit of this. Where did you land with it?
I'm maybe like a couple of hours into that first area. Enough to kind of go, oh, okay, this is what the game is. I was really worried that the whole setting of it was going to be really confusing because I haven't played a huge amount of Pillars of Eternity.
But the odd person going, hmm, I'm from the Deadfire Archipelago. I'm like, oh, well, okay. Well, I kind of, I've sort of heard of that because I've read some Andy Kelly previews, so that's fine.
That kind of stuff's working for me. I guess I maybe didn't know what the main hook of it all was to kind of pull me in a little bit further, which is maybe why I paused playing it. I haven't stopped it.
I just had other things to do. But am I kind of clamouring around here? Am I meant to be pursuing these missions?
Should I just be off exploring? I couldn't quite lock in to what it wanted me to do. But I definitely agree with you.
It all feels nice. I guess it doesn't really matter if it all feels good. Whatever you do, it's pretty entertaining.
I like that you get to that first town and there's like a giant lighthouse to climb. Just as like a sort of statement of intent for the climbing. Like you can go up there and then jump off it and then probably find something where you jump off it, which is good.
I can't quite put my finger on a why, but there was almost a hint of like what I like about or what I want from like fable in this. In that it isn't a huge complicated systems driven thing. It's just quite a good hang, quite nice writing, exploration with tangible rewards, finite.
There's an end to it, which is actually like a big tick in for. I don't necessarily want the Skyrim, acres and acres and acres of 50 caves that all look the same. I want five caves that have been hand designed.
That's always something I've liked about the fable games. They're an even more simplified version of this. I will definitely carry on playing and try and find a bit more purpose.
Maybe I'm not quite locked into what combat is for me yet. Maybe that's it.
Yeah, I think I did go aggressively down the magic route because people were like, these are the ones, this is the thing that's a little bit of a differentiator in this game, is that they get this part of it really right. I will say I had a little bit of the same thing you did at the start where I was a bit like, well, this feels a little bit formless, I'm not sure how I feel about it. Then I just aggressively threw myself into it and started finding my place with it.
Then I think that actually I thought I was going to go down the magic route more specifically, or solely down that route. Then I started finding weapons that made it too enticing to just stick with that. There's a bit where you just find an ax that's surrounded by ice stuck on this tree log in the middle of a clearing, and you pick it up and you get attacked by loads and loads of guys and then you just have to basically just defeat them.
You've got this cool ax that I basically worked out could be used to solve certain environmental puzzles because when ice touches water in this game, it forms these ice lily pads that you can cross as hard surfaces and then I use that to basically climb up to a bridge to get to this mission objective. I was like, that's really cool that there's this level of interactivity in this or zapping like a body of water with lightning and then just attacking a load of enemies at once. That kind of stuff is really good about it.
I just found the pacing of it really just hit the spot. Maybe this is coming off the back of Assassin's Creed as well, where I felt like my time was just being misused. I don't think this game really misuses your time.
I'm not saying it's anything particularly revolutionary about it, but I think it's sort of resonated because A, it's on Game Pass, so you can play it really easily, which is good. But it's just because there isn't anything exactly like this around at the moment. It hasn't been for a few years.
That is just a Skyrim-like. That does seem to be enough for people. So, yeah, I think it's good.
I totally see why it's taking the spot.
Absolutely. It gives me a lot more hope for Outer Worlds 2. Because the big problem with Outer Worlds 1 was the exploration in its small worlds just felt completely dead.
The combat wasn't at all fun. It had no hit or zing to it. There was no sense of there being anything interesting outside of set mission locations.
So I guess this is a question for you. If this was going to be Obsidian's new thing, like their new sweet spot, would you be happy for them just to continue working in this space and scale?
I think it's more interesting than the Outer Worlds is. It's just that the areas are built in a more interesting way. The mechanics are all just superior.
Climbing helps that you can go up really tall things. That's always fun.
Yeah, this maybe feels like it. I mean, I think they said they rebooted development of it twice. And I think in doing so, maybe they just figured out the exact combination of things that makes the game spot on.
And whereas Outer Worlds felt a little bit of a shabby 360 year RPG, it felt a little bit taped together by comparison. This feels... It looks amazing as well.
Like I've been playing on my new PC and the fan was absolutely going fucking bananas trying to just pull down my PC because it looks so high end. To the point where it was so noisy, I was like, you know what? I've just got to switch to my Xbox and play out of there.
So I did and I was scared of the power.
Well, I think it's just because I had it on for about three or four hours and eventually your PC is like, you got to stop doing this man. So there was a bit of that to it. But I don't know, it's weird because I sort of, a bit like you, I don't always feel like I'm the most in sync with the whole Obsidian deal.
You know, I sort of wasn't really, I played a bit of Grounded and got why people like that, even though it was more of a CFD's headspace when that game came around. I've not played Pentament, but people seem to really like that. I know you enjoyed that as a mystery game.
Feels like more of a side thing. I think that certainly they are getting closer to finding their mold of open world thing that is distinctive from other people's. Like it doesn't feel like you're just playing Skyrim or something like that.
It does feel like their take on it. And the scale is just right, that's the thing. It's just everyone's saying this is a game that you can clear in 40 hours rather than 60 to 80.
And I think that is spot on. I think maybe people are making the mistake of calling this a double A game. And I bet my guess is this game probably costs like close to 100 million to make, is my guess.
Like I don't think those conventional definitions quite make as much sense, I might be wrong. I don't think they made it with like hundreds and hundreds of people. But five year development, studio in California, two reboots.
It's not going to be a cheap game to make. So that side, that side, I think it's, I think it's spot. I think it's a great niche for them.
And it's something where they can succeed where other people aren't necessarily on the same turf. So yeah, that's where it's at Matthew. Yeah, it's good stuff.
So do you want to give us a little bit on Pirate to You Couser Matthew? Which I know you played a bit of as well.
Yeah, I finished that.
You finished it? Bloody hell.
It's quite, it's quite short. It's probably about 15 hours long.
Right.
It's quite short for me, who only plays 100 hour games.
That's just one day for you.
It's only 10% of a proper game, really. Yeah, so this is Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. It is a, I say it's a spin-off game, like canonically it sits after the events of Infinite Wealth, which was like the big mainline 8th Yakuza game.
This follows Goro Majima, ongoing comic protagonist, antagonist, Loki-ish sort of trickster character, as much part of the furniture as Kiryu. In this, he wakes up on a beach in Hawaii, having undergone some amnesiac event, and becomes a pirate and decides to help a little boy. As everyone knows, the thing I don't like in Yakuza games is when a small child is present for too much of the adventure, because I feel like everyone is on eggshells and not being like their coolest gangster self, because they don't want to upset a child.
That's very true of this game, like he said the whole time. Was never particularly into that. But yeah, you get a pirate ship, and it doesn't exist in this modern version of Hawaii, where there are pirates in galleons, and you just kind of have to go with it.
It sort of shrugs that element off. And what's funny about it is that it's so preposterous, but every once in a while a character will come in from back home, as it were, to try and get Majima to come back to Japan and sort out whatever gangster business is brewing back there, which I'm sure we'll find out in Yakuza 9. They really do feel like they've come in from another game, and are just absolutely baffled why he's doing this whole pirate schnick.
And that's quite a good running bit, the idea that everyone knows it's stupid that this game's happening, and that there is really urgent stuff. And I obviously won't spoil it, but there's a character beat right at the very end, almost like a post-credit stinger or whatever, where it just comes crashing back to some of the quite grim reality of what's going on in the mainline games. And you're like, well, this seems like a bit of a bummer after all this pirate stuff.
But anyway, so yeah, what it really means is you get to dress up as a pirate, you've got a new pirate fighting style to go with your more traditional, manageable, stabby, slightly more underhand, violent fighting style. You get a pirate ship where you get to do Assassin's Creed Black Flag Light style play. Like it isn't a proper open world, it's kind of cut into these smaller maps with islands that you can go to.
And within the ocean there, you meet other ships and you have even Arcadia versions of those Assassin's Creed pirate battles. So like everything, it just feels like another game but slightly Arcadia, sort of stuck in Fast Forward. You've got like a power boost, so like flames come out of the back of your ship to make you go faster.
And then you can drift, which I'm pretty sure ships can't do. So it's like incredibly dumb, but it really leans into it. It uses it actually to take you unaware sometime.
Like, you know, every once in a while someone will say something quite profound, or there'll be a little character beat, which actually they really nail like the emotionality of it. And you're suddenly like, oh yeah, these is the same storytellers from the mainline games, but just having a bit of fun. And that's always, that's quite good.
I think the main thing I like about it, it is quite a throwaway game, I will say. I don't feel like you have to play it. Like it's a bit of a seven out of 10 for me, but everything in it, so like the main story and the main sort of side quests, you know, they're kind of recruiting your crew and updating your ship.
It all does feed in to this central thrust of becoming a good pirate and going on this adventure where sometimes these games give you these huge side hustles which, aside from making you money which you then use to beat the main campaign, they sometimes feel a bit detached. Why am I doing this urgent thriller here but I'm also spending hundreds of hours developing my real estate portfolio? These two things feel at odds with one another.
And actually here, the act of climbing the pirate ranks, hiring people for your crew, doing side missions to earn people's trust so that they join your crew, that all just follows in. It's a very coherent game. And that isn't always true of these things.
Like, what has Dundoko Island really got to do with Infinite Wealth? Fuck all. Here, it all makes sense.
You know, and it's, yeah, it's a good, fun time. Moves quite quick. The end sort of sneaks up on you, and you're like, oh, okay, it's kind of over.
I don't think it's quite as successful in its storytelling as the last side story, the man who erased his name, which was like the Kiryu filler.
People really like that one, right?
Yeah. I just think what Kiryu's got going on is just a little bit more urgent. You can't help but feel like, well, this is just dumb.
It's not a waste of time, but it's just like a stupid shaggy dog story. Where you end up is just really has nothing. You don't really achieve anything ground breaking with this character.
You just have a good time chopping people up. It's got a really, really good selection of Sega tracks that you can buy on CD and then play on your ship instead of the shanties. If you just want to tear up the sea listening to the music from Space Harrier, which I definitely do, that's really good.
Or some Persona tracks or whatever. You can create a playlist of great Sega classics.
Persona, that's interesting. They're crossing the streams a bit there though. Because I feel like there's never been Atlas stuff in these games before, unless I'm wrong.
I think it's been coming in in little dribs and drabs. But certainly the fact that you've got an iPod that you can just load up with any tracks to replace the in-game soundtrack. So you can basically build a dream Sega soundtrack to play the whole game to, which I really like.
Maybe that was in Infinite Wealth and I just didn't find it in the fucking hundreds of features that game has. But certainly here, yeah, I've been playing a bit of Fantasy Zone, a bit of Space Harrier, some of the karaoke songs from older Yakuza games. They're in the mix.
That stuff's quite good. It just wants you to have a good time. I just don't think it's hugely substantial.
It's got quite a starry cast, weirdly. Like, do you remember, you know, in Tokyo Vice, the big bad guy in that show.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's like a character in this, so his face and voice.
Oh, he's got a great face, this kind of, this kind of guy.
He has. And whenever they put a famous person like that and you do get to fight them at some point, that is always a little bit exciting, like having a fistfight with someone who is basically the same character that you liked in a TV show. I always enjoy that, kicking the shit out of that guy.
They've got to get the really old Yakuza guy who the main dude is working for into the game because he's got a perfect face for Yakuza if he's not already been in the series.
Oh, that guy. I don't know if he's ever been in one.
He feels like, but he's spot on for it, right? It's just, he's like of the old guard, right, who's being like muscled out by this guy. So yeah, I could see that.
That's cool.
That stuff that I like in all the games I still like in this game. Oh, your sidekick on the ship, the ship's cook is played by a Japanese stand-up comedian who is in that documentary reality TV show I like where the Japanese comedians aren't allowed to laugh.
Right, right.
He's called Ryuji Akiyama and he's just there, like, he's quite a good hang for most of the game, but he has this one side quest where it sort of switches into an hour-long live action romance sim, right, entirely filmed with him as his human self and human actresses.
That sounds fun.
It's really weird. Feels like it was filmed on a camcorder in, like, an afternoon, and you can see the cast laughing at how stupid it all is, and you can see reflections of the camera crew, and they're also laughing at it. Right.
Very budget, very strange, but it made me laugh that they went to this much effort for one side quest in this stupid spin-off game.
I suppose there is an argument that the people who play all these games will appreciate something like this. It's not like anyone is going to skip Infinite Wealth and buy this. I think everyone knows that buying Infinite Wealth is a prerequisite to playing this and arguably like a dragon before that as well, and maybe even the man who raised his name.
That's the level of fandom they have and obviously it's a fan favorite character. It's good to hear at least that it is an enjoyable and coherent, give or take a weird live action section and sort of game aside, you know?
That's...
I don't think... Yeah, that's alright. As a...
you know, they always do... Like you say, there's always... Whether it's a judgment game or, like you say, smaller like a dragon spinoff, it's okay to have something a little bit inconsequential between the big games, really.
Yeah. And it definitely feels like a standalone game. You know, there's enough stuff going on here which is new to it.
And you can definitely see a world where this was like a DLC or something that then they just kept adding to it. And then they obviously committed to making it a standalone game. So they just really, really went for it.
You know, it has, you know, the whole Honolulu map from Infinite Wealth. You go back there and can explore that maybe a little bit too soon for that. I spent so long exploring that place in Infinite Wealth that going back there now, I'm like, oh, I kind of I need to get the fuck out of Hawaii, you know, like I just need to get back to Japan.
Two or three games without Honolulu next. Let's just let's just get it out of our system. Because it's like already old hat to me, that place.
That's funny. Given how many times you spent, how much time you spent in Camerocho, it's funny that you're like, this is enough go arounds this way.
But Honolulu is so big and going from one end to the other is just it takes forever. You end up just paying taxis to fast travel everywhere. Camerocho I'm often like I very rarely fast travel in that place.
It's a two minute walk max. So Camerocho is just original and best for my money.
Well fair play for getting through this Matthew. Even if it doesn't sound like it's going to trouble your top ten for the year.
Maybe like number ten.
A solid to have in your back pocket isn't it? In case you don't get time to play games in like September to October or something. You never know.
So I'm stuck on GTA San Andreas.
Well that's the game I played the most of recently. But actually Avowed I have played more hours of than San Andreas. But I am indeed well on the way to my research for that podcast being complete Matthew.
So just to drive you completely fucking insane. I mean, I've only got fleeting days of doing nothing left now. So my rate of getting through stuff is about to slow right down as the horrors of employment begin again.
I can't just dos off doing nothing for two months. Thank you to the listeners by the way for bankrolling me doing that. The podcast has made that an acceptable thing for me to do.
You are at least getting a couple of good pods out of it. So that's nice at least. Okay, so my next game, I'll discuss this pretty briefly, but I thought I'd talk about Threshold, Matthew.
Do you know this game?
Is it a card game?
No, it's not.
Oh, well, no, Dennis don't.
That's all right. It's, you know how I talked about mouthwashing at the end of last year? And that became a bit of a lightning rod indie game.
A lot of people checked it out. It's got something bonkers, like a hundred thousand reviews on Steam. You know, and a little sort of cottage industry of videos analyzing the themes of the game, which, you know, I said on the Game of the Year podcast, it doesn't need because it's pretty literal.
But, you know, that's media illiteracy and all that stuff going on these days. Whatever. So this game is from the same publisher.
They're called Critical Reflex. They have published three games that were visually similar, but in the same visual style of like that sort of PS1 kind of slash 90s, late 90s PC aesthetic. And while Mouthwashing was a sort of linear narrative horror game, the story was sort of scripted, but it played out in nonlinear fashion, jumping back and forth in this one environment.
This game is a bit different, but has a similar visual style. So the premise is you are going to this valley where there's this train passing, and your job is to keep the train moving at a certain pace. It's like this...
Oh, I have played this.
Oh, you have?
What? In my head, it was called Tickets.
Tickets? For fuck's sake! I was about to describe a game you played and then misidentified as a card game.
Okay, Matthew, so you know the premise of the game.
Tell me about it, because I only played a little bit of it.
Yeah, okay, so when the train slows down and there's this alarm that starts going off and you need to whistle into this sort of big pipe thing, this big drum thing, in order to make the train go faster. But there are a few nasty twists to this. You have low oxygen, so you need to basically be retrieving these horrible little air capsule things.
Your main character breaks with his teeth and then basically does a load of damage to his mouth, which is tracked like Doom Guy Head style, with a little meter in the top left showing your mouth declining as you use more and more of these air capsules. And yeah, the game is basically about maintaining this train's speed until some other weirder stuff happens. It's a bit of a mix of narrative game with a tiny bit of survival game mechanics, because you have to do various things to get the air capsules.
When the train speeds up, you get this ticket machine that prints out a ticket for you.
Thus tickets.
For fuck's sake.
It's all making sense.
You collect this algae stuff from this little stream that's nearby. The stream goes up and down depending on how fast the train is going due to some weird reason they explain. And you're given these boring tasks to do by this mysterious guy called MO.
I assume he's called that in every single playthrough, but I don't know necessarily. At the start of the game, they ask you to put in your nationality, which apparently has some effect on the difficulty of the game, but basically it's about finding a way to keep finding air, keep damaging your mouth as you take these air capsules and keep blowing the whistle to keep the train moving until some other stuff is revealed that maybe changes the course of what's happening. And it's an experimental little indie game by a former Dishonored 2 dev who is now working for Crytek on Hunt Showdown and made this as a side project.
It'll take you about 90 minutes. It's not quite as player bolt out of the blue, amazing, sort of like, wow, what the fuck is this feeling that mouth washing gives you? It's not quite that, but it is, it definitely builds up to a crescendo you will not see coming.
And I think it's well worth the time. And it's not that expensive. I bought it with another game that's in a similar visual style called Arctic Eggs, which I've not played yet, but I understand is a little bit different to this.
But all of these games seem to have some something going on a bit interesting narratively and thematically. And so I dig the overall project and the interesting little publisher Critical Reflex. So I recommend giving this a try when you're seeing a Steam sale.
So Matthew, you played a bit of this. How much of it did you get into?
I did a couple of loops of it just to get a sense of the style and tone of it. I did really like it. I liked how weird it was.
I love the horrible biting on a glass canister to get oxygen. It's incredibly cursed. And I think you can tell from just five minutes that it's going to be quite good shit.
But I can't remember why I stopped playing. I think I then paused it or I stopped playing it and I came back and it hadn't saved or something. So I went, that's annoying.
Oh yeah.
I thought I just have to find like 90 minutes to sit down and play this thing. The classic tickets. Yeah, I think Catherine reviewed this on Eurogame actually last year and recommended it to me.
But I do like these little PS1 graphics, narrative experiments, 90 minutes to three hours long. It's quite an exciting space. And like you said with the Arctic Eggs, if you buy one of these on Steam, you seem to get suggested endless things which look and sound a bit like this and are probably also quite good.
Yeah, this mouthwashing and Arctic Eggs were in a sort of trio bundle basically. And so, owning one part of it, that's why I basically thought it's a no brainer to get the other two bits of this bundle as well. I like their packaging it up that way.
Definitely, I don't think if I hadn't played mouthwashing, I don't think I'd have any curiosity about this. But Jeremy Peel wrote a piece actually where he interviewed the one man dev of this. That was well worth a read.
That's on PC Gamer as well. Yeah, it's interesting. But you won't see the ending coming as well.
I mean, there are multiple endings in this game as well. And the exact permutations of how you achieve those is quite interesting. It might seem obvious, but then, I don't know.
It's not exactly what you think it's going to be when you first start playing it.
Right.
It just succeeds enough at creating enough tension with the blow the whistle, get the air capsule stuff that it keeps you going until you get those questions answered about why exactly you're doing any of this and why any of this. Yeah, it's a cool little thing, for sure. So yeah, tickets available now.
I'd say it reminded me a tiny bit of Severance or something, where people are doing a weird process.
For sure.
And you don't really know why, but there's something quite interesting in being at the heart of that process, and there's something quite soothing about the workflow of getting your ticket, getting your oxygen blowing into the weird tube. Horrific, but also kind of soothing.
Yeah, definitely. That sums it up. Weird kind of work games.
Yeah. Definitely feels like a thing I've encountered more, I guess a little bit in that sort of papers please vein as well.
Yeah.
Yeah, interesting. So yeah, that's a cool thing I've been checking out. But last although Matthew, let's talk about Split Fiction, the latest co-op game from Haze Light Studios, with its very outspoken director, Yosef Farras.
No media training required, just go straight in, torpedoes, big quotes, et cetera, et cetera. I think what's really interesting about the studio is how they have found a niche. No one else has really moved into it since they started doing it, and they've gotten really good at it, which is basically an excuse to bring two people together for a bunch of mini game style interactions, all linked together with an overarching story, which itself is an excuse to take you to some weird and wild places and for some wacky stuff to happen.
But I think each time they've done this, with It Takes Two being the last attempt, the actual gameplay part has gotten better, and they just feel really, really confident with what they're making, and the ambition is stepping up a little bit more each time. I've only played about two and a half hours of this, so there's a way to go, but the premise is basically that there are two authors who go to this weird sort of tech start-up slash publishing house at the start of the game, and get basically dialed into this device that... Their books are going to get published, but they're going to have their ideas...
I can't really even like correctly describe it, because it's a bit... It's just very preposterous, but the idea is that by stepping into this machine, their ideas will be like realized in this amazing fashion. You can basically see their ideas at this big tech company.
I took it that they kind of turned books into like VR experiences.
Right, yes, that is the best way. That is probably what they do say, but maybe I wasn't... I was tuned out at the time.
But what it amounts to is an excuse to jump between the respective works of the two authors. This slightly moody girl who likes sci-fi, and this very bubbly girl... Can you say bubbly these days, or is that considered a little sexist term?
I don't know. More enthusiastic, jolly, okay, more jolly, jollier girl who likes, likes fantasy.
Jolly girl.
Who likes fantasy, etc. And so it kind of oscillates between the two because they end up kind of in the same, in the same bubble and they're not supposed to. And there's a little bit of corporate malfeasance going on in the background, but really it's an excuse to jump into the worlds of their respective stories.
And so in doing so, encounter loads of different gameplay ideas that happen to involve two people doing a load of stuff at the same time. And the pacing of it and the set piece design seems exquisite so far from what I've played, Matthew. They are absolutely firing at all cylinders.
I think the criticism always leveled at these games is that the actual story bit isn't that interesting or particularly sparkling in how it's written, but it's a great container for this sort of co-op experience. How have you found it as someone who's finished it?
I think this is absolutely brilliant. Me and Catherine, we played through It Takes Two when that came out and had a really good time. Same criticism, didn't really like the story framing, didn't like the horny book of love or whatever his name was.
Dr Hakan, a really grim character. This time I found it less egregious, the framing. I've seen some reviewers really ding it for the story and I'm like, ah, when a game has this much interactivity and fun in what you're actually doing, I don't really care.
I'll take any amount of narrative porridge just to get to the meat of the game. Like, 99% of this game is just playing this good ass co-op game. What I love about it is that at its core it's quite a competent forward-moving action platformer.
I keep trying to think what it would be if it wasn't co-op, what game it would be like, and I think the closest I get to is like, there's almost a bit of Naughty Dog in there.
I agree, Uncharted for sure.
Yeah, it's very Uncharted-y, particularly in the platforming and the grapple hooking in this one. But like, so imagine two Uncharted's happening simultaneously, except often there is a extra asymmetrical co-op gimmick. One of you might have a magnetising skill, and the other one will have desperately tries to think of the thing that they had.
Whip things in different directions, right?
Oh, that's it. Yeah, you can whip things. Yeah.
So it's always giving you different pairings of abilities. And so what the characters end up doing and the role that they serve for that piece of the game is very different. It has that 3D Mario thing of like, we're just going to throw loads and loads of ideas at you.
Here's a game with like 150 ideas, except every one of those ideas is a co-op idea, and there has to be something unique that each character does. That's really what blew my mind with this, was just how it kept producing not just pairings of ideas, but pairings of ideas that worked in really interesting ways. It never does anything for more than 5-10 minutes.
All the mechanics are deep enough and smoothly executed enough to hold your attention for 10 minutes and then they move on to the next. It's just really well judged for how long you want to do any given thing. That's the thing that really impresses me, and I think more so than it takes to, which you could say all of this of that too, because it has this bigger story thrust to it in that you are in a big epic sci-fi adventure and a big fancy adventure.
Where you're going feels more traditional kind of gamey territory. You can see a location in the distance and you end up wending your way there using these unique skills and the game is just burning through real estate and ideas. It feels incredibly lavish and expensive in a way that I think you can maybe only pull off because it is split screen.
The visual design isn't to a level where it can probably be scrutinized but in split screen it all looks great and that's kind of what dazzles me really. The volume of stuff you're just churning through and on top of the quest you have these sight stories. It basically lets them go, well here's a level that's a bit like Prince of Persia or here's a level which is set on a space station and you can go to places that the stories wouldn't naturally take you.
And some of those places have whole mechanics, minigames designed that never appear again. I mean there is a, I don't want to spoil it because Sammy hasn't got there yet, there's a surprising EA classic completely cloned for three minutes and you're like, why is this here? Absolutely extravagant and it really does maintain it.
We chewed through this in three days, four or five hours a day and it was just so good.
That is the thing, once you understand that it's that co-op back and forth thing, you are sharing the experience, you'd have different abilities, different complementing abilities a lot of the time, that is the game. Then it feels like this is a very game jam style effort to build all the ideas out, to the point where there are some optional sections, you can basically go into these little portals and play out. They are essentially other stories that the two different authors were exploring.
It might be something really juvenile that came up with in the early days when they were a kid or something like that. Those feel like the sort of offcuts of ideas that didn't quite make sense in the main game, but they thought, well, this would be cool for a five-minute thing. Some of those are great as well.
Again, demonstrate some really interesting design thinking. I think they just don't really talk themselves out of doing anything with this. Like you say, the polish is better than it should be.
You know what I mean? It just feels like it gets...
It often looks a bit unchartered quality in times.
Yeah, and I think considering it's a 45-pound game, I think it's a bit of a steal for just how lavish it feels. And like you say, having that more traditional gamey theme to it, I think it does set it apart from It Takes Two, which is maybe the strangest game theme that's ever been commercially successful. Just this couple who are on the brink of divorce turning into these weird little dolly things, and then you have the whole book of love element.
I mean, that is such a strange sort of wrapping for that game. It's so odd. This is much more conventional, but I would argue that because it flits between the two universes, you never really know what it's going to pull out of the bag next.
And that constant surprise is really exciting.
When we were playing it, we were often slightly scathing of the actual sci-fi and fantasy vision. Like, they're very cliched. Definitely.
It's like a proper cyberpunk city and fairy tale castle dimension with dragons. But the actual ideas in them are so good, you just don't really care. You're so locked in on doing your bit to keep your partner alive.
Or there are little bits which put you in almost competition with each other, or let you kind of fuck each other over with certain mechanics. It's just so confident. And that guy, when he talks about his games at the Game Awards, I'm always like, oh, this guy kind of sucks.
But he absolutely delivers, so he's allowed to talk that way. You know, when he says, I'm going to show you things you've never seen before. That is true.
Like, there are definitely things, like the final hour of this has a visual gimmick. That's unbelievably clever. I have no idea how they're doing that.
You can be like a big hyperactive blowhard if you've got the goods, you know?
Yeah, and fair play. Having played A Way Out, which was such a rough first draft of this, I never ever would have thought that in two games time they would be making games this good. So fair play to them.
And like I say, I mean, why is no one else trying to make anything like this? It's sold like two million copies in like three days or something. I mean, it's for the taking.
People want this couch co-op narrative driven experience. It's like, and no one else is making it. They've got a true USP.
I'm not burning through it because when it's gone, that's it. There will be nothing else like this for like three years, you know?
Yeah, there was a bit of that going on. And it's just like the nuts and bolts of it, you know, platforming and basic puzzling and grapple hooks and guns. And it's the nuts and bolts that make so many games of the past.
It's like, why is no one else like playing with these basic parts in this way? Like he's completely recalibrating, like the most obvious gameplay cliches of all time into something that just feels so dynamic and fresh, you know? And he's obviously adding stuff which, you know, is completely bespoke to this.
But probably half the game is just moving and jumping and, you know, walking around platforms and just making it colourful. HD colourful graphics are unusual enough that they can still really impress.
Yeah, we're not allowed a 10-hour unchartered anymore. We can't have those things. Everything's got to be a six-year, seven-year project, 20-hour-plus, so meticulously realistic, rebooted from scratch because they didn't like how it was going after 18 months.
It's like the opposite of that, where it's like, let's just go for it, let's just do this, let's just do that.
He's making games, Joseph Harris makes games.
Productivity, Matthew's favorite thing about game developers these days. Well, I think it's like, I'm always really intrigued to see what a naughty dog does next and that kind of thing, but it just shows you don't need that level of hyper, hyper-polish for something to be really great and really satisfying, and yeah, you're right, it is made of the different parts of 360 slash PS4 era games. There's something about it that feels a little bit lost of time, but it's ridiculous as that is because these things always sold well and people always like them.
But yeah, fair play to them.
It does also make me think, why have Nintendo never made this kind of co-op game? They're the only people who sell a platform which comes with two controllers. You can definitely play co-op on Switch if you own a Switch.
Why haven't they made a, it must be played in co-op? They must have the stuff. I keep seeing people say that these games are Nintendo-like, and actually they haven't really done much in the co-op space.
They haven't really left their mark on it as they do in so many genres. It's a real odd one to me.
Well, 3D World is probably as close as they've got to that, right? But it doesn't need two people to do any one part of it. So that's the difference, isn't it?
And there's no contrasting abilities.
It's the same skill set, doing the same thing.
Yeah. I think it's a good point. And it does make you wonder, I don't know, what about the Four Swords Adventures?
Does that count?
Yeah.
It's not really the same thing, but you know.
But that's probably the last time that they really did it.
I don't know.
I just want them to come along and make. I think Split Fiction is like a 10 out of 10 card game.
Yeah, I agree. You've got no reason not to play it if this is the kind of thing that you are into. It feels like the first dead cert for the end of the year list, Matthew, doesn't it?
Well, it definitely feels like the 10 out of 10 game that won't be making my list because I'm a contrarian.
Well, because it's a platformer that people like.
Every year there has to be one.
Yeah, that's true.
No, I genuinely like at the moment, like this is the one to beat for me.
Yeah, it's cool. I'm playing another couple of hours on Friday and we're just going to do that, I think, every week or so for the next month or so. So, yeah.
That's nice. How's your co-op partner's gaming ability?
She screams a lot when like things are really kicking off and it's quite funny because she's not as on it as I am, but she's pretty good. She ultimately muscles through with pretty much everything. And I don't feel like I'm always bossing it because sometimes I'm just a bit lazy or it's funny to die or whatever.
And the game is not hyper punishing, right? That's the thing. It's pretty generous with how it brings you back to life, at least where I've got to so far.
It finds ways to make it easier to come back to life quicker, to come back to life. And so, yeah. Yeah, that's good.
We're not two sort of gaming mega brains like you and Catherine necessarily. But yeah.
I am definitely the wheat link.
Well, Catherine's mega brain. I'm not too surprised by that. So, yeah.
But yeah, great stuff. Really enjoying it. And shout out to listener Kurt for getting me a copy of this game.
I do appreciate it. So thank you. Yeah, good guy Kurt.
Okay, Matthew, that's the podcast done. I think that was a pretty nourishing set of takes there. Yeah, that's good.
The one game that's coming out this week we haven't talked about is Atomfall. And that's because we're going to discuss it next week's pod because we're doing an episode all about game set in the UK. So I'm looking forward to that, Matthew, not giving that a try yet.
The embargo for that actually fell slightly after this podcast going live anyway, so it was never going to happen. But nonetheless, look forward to that next week. Should no doubt be some cursed British nonsense in there, the likes of which people seem to enjoy with this podcast.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am MrBuzzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I am Samuel W Roberts on both Letterboxd and Blue Sky. And the podcast is at BackpagePod on Twitter and Blue Sky. If you would like to support us, get two extra podcasts a month, including this month's podcast, which is all about me and Matthew replaying Vice City.
I think that podcast came out very well, Matthew. That is patreon.com backpagepod. Make Matthew suffering through the death row mission.
Worth it, if you can. And we will be doing an episode on the movies of Bong Joon Ho very shortly as well. And that's the podcast.
See you later. Goodbye. Goodbye.
