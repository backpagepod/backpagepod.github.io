Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we have another special guest. So this week our guest is James Mielke, who in his words is a game developer, writer, editor, designer, illustrator, environmentalist, and amateur motorcycle crasher. He's the co-founder and creative director at the studio Tigatron, and the co-founder of BitSummit in Japan.
In this episode, we're mostly gonna ask James about his time at GameSpot, EGM, and 1Up in the 90s and noughties, and touch upon some of the amazing things he's done in his career since then. James, how are you?
I'm good, thank you.
Thank you for having me on your podcast.
No, thank you so much for coming on. I did listen to a podcast you were on a few years ago, just to kind of make sure I wasn't going over too much familiar ground. I think there'll be some crossover, but I've heard some of the stories about your early career and working in the New York City nightlife and things like that.
So yeah, I'll try not to make you repeat all the same stuff in this episode, but really happy to have you on. So thank you so much. But yeah, so what are you up to at the moment?
Anything you can tell us about what's going on where you are?
I'm always working on a lot of things, working on some games, working with limited run games as well, working on some editorial projects that are unannounced. Yeah, between that and raising kids, I have a full plate at all times. So it's always busy, a little bit too busy, but slowly but surely I'll get some of these things off my plate and be able to move forward onto new things.
BitSummit's coming up in July. That should be a very, very hot time of year. I don't know if you've ever been to Japan in July, but it's wicked.
So kind of dreading the heat, but it's always a good time at BitSummit. So excited about that.
Yeah, absolutely. To start with James, I wanted to ask a bit about how you got into video games. What mattered to you growing up?
Was there much of an arcade scene where you grew up, that sort of thing?
Gee, where do I start? Sorry, I never really planned or kind of structured my life around, you know, an eventual career in video games. I guess because I'm old enough that when it happened, there wasn't really a direct path forward.
I've been playing games for as long as they existed. My uncle in Japan would send me things like, you know, Nintendo gaming watches, digital watches from Japan. He sent me like this Mickey Mouse digital watch that had like the Mickey Mouse theme song on it.
And that was just mind blowing at the time in the 80s at my elementary school. So kids would always flock around me just to hear me play the melody of my digital watch. So that was like my early brush with fame.
But it was when I started getting the video games, you know, the handhelds, because when my uncle would send them to me, they wouldn't be out in the States for at least a couple of years before somebody licensed them or picked them up or distributed them in the US. So that was like kind of an early taste of where the industry was heading. And my father, he bought a RadioShack Pong.
I don't know if you've ever seen what a RadioShack Pong looks like, but it looks like an old portable telephone. Remember those big blocky telephones, the early mobile phones, right? It looked like that with a little attachment on the bottom.
And that had Pong on it. But even then, as fascinating as that was, and trust me, it was really cool to be able to play this digital game on your TV. You can get bored of Pong really quickly in the 80s as you can now.
So eventually, I was just like, oh, man. Thank God I've got this Donkey Kong Jr. gaming watch or this other gaming watch because Pong gets old really quickly. But then my neighbor got ColecoVision.
We were always playing Smurfs over at his house, Donkey Kong. I had a really great version of Donkey Kong. Full color, it was great.
And then I got the Atari 2600 and so on and so on. So I've been in gaming from the very start of it and then you asked me about arcades. Yeah, the first time, this was a really mesmerizing moment.
But the first time I saw Space Invaders was when I went to the local small town department store. And when I walked in with my mom, there was a whole bunch of kids standing around this cabin and I was like, what is that? And so I walked over and I saw this like the marquee with like the familiar artwork and a whole bunch of quarters lined up on top of the marquee and you know the sounds of Space Invaders, the little pew pew and the endless march and all that and the sound of when the really bit-crushy, squashed digital sound of whenever your ship would blow up and that was just utterly mesmerizing.
I mean, you know, nothing else like it existed up until that point. So, you know, to see that for the first time was just a revelation, you know. But even then, I never thought like, well, someday I'm going to make these myself, right?
But yeah, I mean, it was enchanting from the from the get-go. And so, you know, through my young life, like when I got my first job, my first part-time job, the first thing I saved up for was an NES. Then once I got into my 20s, the next, well, the next console I bought myself was a TurboGrafx.
And that was the wrong move, at least it was in the States, because there wasn't a lot of software available, at least where I lived. And then the next thing I bought was a Genesis. So that was when I started to have a little bit more disposable income.
But even then, I was only able to buy the occasional cartridge, Street Fighter, you know, Toe Jam and Earl, Sonic came with it for free, I think, you know, or maybe that was Altered Beast, I can't remember. But when I started to take games really, really seriously was when I discovered import gaming. And I was at a game shop in New York City, and I was there looking at all the import games.
And it hadn't occurred to me to start buying import games until I saw a guy next to me buying an import copy of Virtua Fighter 2. When I was looking right at the domestic version of Virtua Fighter 2, I was like, wait a minute, let me get this straight. You just bought the import version when the US version is right here.
He's like, that's right. And I was like, and how much did it cost? He was like, you know, $75, whatever, or $80.
And I was like, but this version is $50. He's like, yep. And so I was trying to get my head around that.
But, you know, once I saw that, oh, you can buy a Japanese Saturn and you have access to all these games that are going to take like another six months to get localized and released in the US or maybe never at all, that's, and I, you know, I was bartending at the time, so I had more cash on hand. So I was like, okay, let me get into this world. And that's pretty much where it took off.
Oh, yeah, that's really interesting. So you are, you know, like a big, you are a big Sega fan or historically, you know, you followed their presence in the hardware, games hardware scene closely until they left the market. Was that a little bit unusual as a player in the US to be kind of Sega aligned?
It seemed like Sega had more of a footprint in Europe than it maybe did in the US. What was the kind of experience like of being a Sega fan in the US?
Yeah, it's interesting. I talk about this fairly frequently with Sega-minded fans that I work with because clearly in the UK and Europe, Sega had a big impact with Mega Drive and if it wasn't Mega Drive, you guys were playing things like Commodore stuff, like PC gaming, correct me if I'm wrong, it was like Commodore, the Amiga, right, and things like that. And I'm always watching Dylan Cuthbert kind of talk about this console or that console on Facebook or something.
I forget, but like, yeah, you've got all those like, those interesting gaming PCs from that era. Yeah, and I guess like North America is probably viewed as more of a Nintendo kind of biased country from the 90s or so, like with NES and then the SNES. It didn't really occur to me that there was, you know, that it was sort of like a underdog thing, at least in New York City.
Maybe it was because I wasn't really surrounded by a lot of other gamers who was mostly just me and my little hobby in my apartment. But it never occurred to me that, you know, Sega was sort of the real underdog. Because I think the whole advertising campaign, right, you know, like the typical Sega ads of the 90s, those were pretty dominant.
So even if gaming was more skewed towards Nintendo in the States, like I think there was still enough of a Sega presence where it just seemed like, well, these are the two options. So it never really felt too weird. I think where the disparity came in is when the PlayStation was launched and that's when Sega was on its back heel at that point.
So I think that's where it really started to, there started to be some separation between, you know, mind share.
Yeah, I think that makes sense. So your first few, well, you had a bunch of jobs before you ended up in Games Media, James, but you were an illustrator for a while there. So as a big comics fan, can I ask, what was it like working for Marvel in what was essentially the end of its 90s heyday?
And I know you've told this story before, but you were kind of there at the very end of that heyday and you kind of witnessed a collapse in real time. Can you talk a bit about that?
Yeah, I think that was actually pretty interesting. I mean, like considering how dominant and how omnipresent Marvel and all of its facets are these days between movies and gaming and just the clothing you see everywhere. It's hard to believe that Marvel was almost bankrupt and just a comics only entity.
They hadn't transcended into... If you heard that a Marvel movie was coming out in the 90s, you knew it was like some garbage Captain America movie where the dude was wearing all this padding to look muscular and stuff. It was cool.
I mean, for me, that was a lifetime dream, right? I went to school of visual arts as an illustration major. And again, there was no real straight path forward to...
No obvious path because we didn't have really the internet at the time when I was working for Marvel. And I didn't know who to look up as far as the contacts are concerned. And I didn't know what to show a portfolio to.
And I would say that most of my life opportunities actually came to me because I was a bartender. I worked in a really popular bar in New York City. And so all manner of creature would come in and sit down at the bar.
It was right in the heart of the advertising district in New York City. So there was ad agencies, creative agencies. There were modeling agencies.
There were tons of things. And in Union Square, which is where I worked. And so we'd get people in for lunch.
We'd get people in for dinner. It was open 24 hours. So usually it was when I was working a day shift.
There wouldn't be as many people at the bar. So there would be people to talk to or whatever. And the person you talk to when you're at the bar, if you're not with friends or something, is you talk to the bartender.
So people would just talk to me. And eventually they'd come around. So what do you do when you're not bartending?
And I would say, well, I'm a freelance illustrator and I usually DJ in the evenings as well. So those were usually the conversations I'd have. So then a lot of people would be like, I'd ask them what they were doing.
They would tell me whatever career they came from. But eventually one guy sat down, his name was Mort Todd. That's his professional name, Mort Todd.
That's basically death in different languages, I guess, like or Latin. And he was like, come on in and see me at Marvel, which was like, I know it was like 287 Madison Avenue or something like that. And I was like, seriously?
And he was like, yeah, come on in. He was like, you know, you just gave me a time, it's number and like, you know, the next week I was up there in Marvel's office and brought my portfolio. And he was like, he was in charge of something called the Marvel Music Division.
And so they worked with artists like, I think Dave McKean and a whole bunch of people, I'm blanking on it now because it's so long ago, but they did comics like Kiss Psycho Circus and just a whole bunch of random things based on bands and stuff. And so they got me doing inking and various freelance things for some of their comics. I think I inked a Public Enemy story or something and then they sent me loose on doing a House of Pain comic.
Now the problem that you alluded to was that they went, this was literally the end of days of Marvel, the version of Marvel that existed at that time, which I think is when they were owned by the, I'm getting his name wrong, it's something like Ron Perlman or something, not the actor, but the guy who was in charge of Revlon or something. And he was driving it into the ground. It was before the toy company took over.
Again, I can't remember the name of the company it took over, but.
Toy Biz, is that right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's Toy Biz. And so I was working on this comic probably for about six months. I was doing all the painting, the pencils, the inks and then the coloring over it.
I was doing it kind of like how Kyle Baker does his comics, which is, he does the painted or the colored version. And then he does the inks over that. And the inks are done separately so that they, when they print them, they print them with an overlay.
So the outlines really pop. It almost looks like it's cell shaded. So I was taking that approach.
And since I was doing all three aspects of it, it was really time consuming. I lived in an apartment on Central Park North and I remember how hot it was because I didn't own an air conditioner. Some of the illustration board was constantly sticking to my arm.
And every time I'd lift my pen up, the page would come with it and I was like, damn it, I have to get an air conditioner. So I went and bought one of those. Installing it, I nearly threw it out the window because it was so heavy.
But yeah, my life then was basically stay up at night. I worked on this thing from nine o'clock at night to six o'clock in the morning because that's when nobody was bothering you. So those are my working hours.
I drink like a six pack of Mountain Dew every night and just to power through the evening, which now I understand is really, really bad for you, but that's what it took. And I got it done, handed it in to my editor, who I'd see like once a week. I'd go into Marvel.
I'd walk out with bags of comic books, just like FedEx bags full of, he was like, you want some of these here? Take a stack. And I was like, wow, okay.
And then I went in one day to hand in the last bits. It was a Friday, and you've heard about the Marvel bullpen, maybe, it's kind of like on staff artists. And it's just literally like rows and rows and rows of like drawing tables and people doing touch-up work and stuff like that.
So yeah, I went in to check how the comic was going. And everything was business as usual.
Things were looking good.
It was at the printers. I was like, oh cool, that's really great. And we were talking about our next project together.
And we were looking for something humble from Marvel's archives that we could reboot in kind of like a more modern, edgy 90s kind of way. And so then I went home, did whatever I was doing normally. And then I came back the next Monday or Tuesday, literally just a few days later.
And when I walked in, the entire bullpen was empty. Not just like nobody was there, they were out to lunch, but the whole place was like nobody ever existed there. There were no drawing utensils.
There was no paper, all the supplies were gone. It was just like a room full of tables. And that was it.
I was like, what happened here? And I walked past John Romita Sr.'s office. I don't know how familiar you are with comic luminaries, but John Romita Sr. had a big office that I would pass every time I came in.
And I wish I'd actually stopped by and said hi or whatever, but I'm a little too intimidating to just pop my head in and be like, yo, what's up? So, yeah, it was empty and John Romita Sr.'s office was empty. And I was like, what is going on here?
I went to go see my editor, who was still there, and I was like, what happened? He's like, the axe dropped.
We filed for bankruptcy after you left.
At some point between when I had last showed up and when I showed up again, they had gone Chapter 11 and laid everybody off. And that was wild. And I was like, I know this is probably like a weird time to be asking this book, what's up with my comic?
And he was like, they canceled all projects that weren't already out in that division. He said, basically, if you're not Spider-Man or X-Men or one of the like, you know, the tent pole properties, your project got canceled. So my fully completed comic of the hip hop group House of Pain was on the drums at the printers, almost ready to go.
And then, you know, it got canceled. If I had maybe handed in my comic a week earlier, it might have gone through. I'll never know, but it was pretty wild that, you know, that that all happened in that kind of like, it was perfect timing if perfect timing is appropriate in this.
It was perfectly bad timing. So but it was also so much work that I actually was so burned out on drawing that I haven't really I haven't really utilized that skill much in that capacity to this day. And you know, nowadays when I sketch or draw or whatever, it's, you know, usually in service of like, okay, this is what I want the thing to look like if I'm working on key art for the next BitSummit or if I'm illustrating a character that we're gonna use in a video game or something like that, that's usually where it manifests.
But you know, I don't really draw as much anymore. I'm trying to find time to work my way back to it because I have a lot of ideas that I want to work up, but it's just hard fighting time.
Yeah, of course. But yeah, pretty amazing story to have been there at that time. That's a particularly fascinating bit of Marvel history, that whole moment.
Yeah, it was pretty devastating. Yeah, I bet. So your first job in games journalism was at GameSpot in 1998.
At least this is according to your LinkedIn profile, James, which is very well maintained, I must say. It has a lot of very useful information when researching you as a podcast guest. But you spent two years there.
How did you go from illustration to writing about games?
Well, as I mentioned, I did import a lot of video games, right? Probably too many. I have crates of them still.
So I was importing video games, and at this point, I was importing PlayStation games as well. There were multiple import video game shops in New York City. There was one called Games and James, and there was another one called Penguin Village, and there were a couple other.
There was J&L Game Trading as well, and they're still around actually. So I would usually frequent these places in my off hours when I wasn't bartending or if I wasn't drawing comics. Eventually, I started reading up on video game websites that were kind of popping up at the time.
This was like, you know, 97, 98. And at one point, I decided, well, I'm going to try writing up, you know, a review. And I tried to write it in this kind of professional way as possible, right?
I didn't want to say this game rocks or this game sucks. You know, I wanted to try and write it as if I was a movie reviewer or something like that. So I made my best effort.
And there was a website called animeplaystation.com. And what I liked about them was that their layout didn't look like your typical GeoCities website of the time. They actually had a pretty decent layout.
I mean, I'm sure it would look terrible now, but at the time it was pretty clean. They would populate people's... It was all fan written reviews, but they would populate the reviews with screenshots.
You know, they would do that themselves. I didn't have any screen capture capacity at the time. So they would provide screenshots for the game, and then they would post your review, and then they'd post the link to your email, right?
So I'm writing the byline written by so-and-so, and if you click that link it would go to your email. So at the time I was running my own bar in New York City, and I wasn't really paying attention. I submitted a couple reviews.
The first one I wrote was a review of some import Ultraman game, like typical Bandai licensed cash-in game at the time. And the second review I wrote was on the import version of Bushido Blade 2, which I really liked. And that review got posted, and it was really satisfying to see your review up online, especially in 98 or so.
And I went and opened up my bar one night, and did that whole thing, and at the end of the night, wrapped everything up, shut it all down, locked it up, went back home. And when I got home, I checked my email. It was an email from Joe Fielder of Games...
He was the executive editor at Gamespot at the time. And he was like, I got to do my Joe Fielder voice.
And he was like, Hey, James, I saw your review of Bushido Blade 2 on Anime PlayStation. I thought it was really good. And I was wondering if you wanted to write for Gamespot.
Right. So at that time, he kind of said like, you know, they're trying to build up their community reviews, right? Now everybody has functionality like this.
But at the time, it was pretty innovative. So, you know, to be able to jump from animeplaystation.com after two reviews to gamespot.com and have my reviews kind of featured there, I thought, well, yeah, that's really cool. Thanks.
Like, I'll be happy to do that. And before I even, you know, I can't even remember if I did or did not write any sort of fan-based, community-based review for Gamespot. But I would email him fairly, you know, a couple times a week.
And there was one point where I said, hey, have you checked out Theme Hospital on PlayStation? And I said, it's really good. And he wrote back and said, well, you know, now that you mention it, Electronic Arts hasn't sent us our review copy of the game.
So would you be willing to write up the review for that? And he's like, you know, I'll pay 100 bucks or whatever. And I said, well, that would be great because that would pay for the game, right?
That would more than cover the cost of the game. And so I said, sure. And so I wrote up a review, you know, it's kind of painful to read stuff that I wrote 25 years ago because it was, you know, they were my first reviews.
I hadn't really, I was not, you know, in any way really editorially trained. So, you know, I just did my best and, you know, and that got published. That was my first paid review.
It was my first professional work, I guess. And then it just kind of like spun up from there. I would, I was always buying like the import magazines at the local Japanese bookstore in New York.
I would get like Sega Saturn Weekly and Official PlayStation Magazine from Japan, both which were published by SoftBank, which also owned GameSpot and EGN at that time, which I didn't realize. And so I would email Joe a couple times a week. I'd be like, hey, check this out.
Did you hear about this news or whatever? And so I was always telling him about the latest news. There weren't really Japanese gaming websites at that time that I knew of that had this kind of information up there.
It was still a print-dominated industry. So I would send him all these tidbits. At some point, very soon after that, he asked me if I'd be interested in writing up news for them once a week and submitting, I think it was three reviews a month.
And he said if I could do that, they'd put me on a monthly stipend on Retina. And it was 800 bucks a month, which to me was like a lot of money for doing easy stuff. And it covered the cost of the magazines, it covered the cost of the games I'd have to buy to review.
And I did that for quite a while. It was like, I don't know, maybe 8, 9, 10 months or something before they started giving me full time job offers. In that time, he also introduced me to the guys at EGM because they were always kind of short staffed when it came to monthly deadlines for getting the magazine out.
And so EGM flew me out to Chicago for a couple of deadlines, especially during one hectic, intense holiday deadline where they were doing those big, big, fat versions of the magazine, like half ads, half editorial. And they had something like, I don't know, I think like 18 previews that they needed written, and I wrote them all overnight. And so that had a big impact.
They were like, wow, this guy's a machine. I don't know if my work was all that accurate or very, very good, but they were happy with it. Because previews weren't that long, and if you were into it, you could just write up stuff about it and it was fine.
And if they had any problems, they would kick it back to me and say, can you flesh this out a little bit more? But that was that. And there was one time where Crispin Boyer, and I might be getting some of this out of order, but Crispin Boyer from EGM assigned me a feature, and that was about importing video games.
So I wrote a guide on how to import video games, and he gave me a deadline. From when he assigned me the game, I was like, when he assigned me the project, I was like, when is this due? And he gave me a deadline that was probably like two and a half weeks later.
I was like, okay, that's cool. But I went and did the article overnight, and I sent it to him the next morning. And that kind of blew minds at the time because they weren't expecting it for two and a half weeks, and it was like, next day, here it is.
So where I found myself fairly quickly was I found myself in a position where I had two full-time job offers from EGM and GameSpot, and that was really, really appealing. The thing is I really wanted to work for EGM because that's, as a gamer, especially for the last few years from when I started importing games to the present where I was fielding these job offers, EGM was the thing I had been reading. I wasn't really reading websites that much, so all of my knowledge came from the video game magazines at the time.
And so I really wanted to work for EGM, but I really didn't want to move to Chicago because it's cold winter. Plus, it wasn't like they were in Chicago, Chicago. At the time, they were in Oak Brook, Chicago, which is a suburb outside of Chicago.
And eventually they moved to another town called Lombard that was also not in Chicago proper. That was probably a half hour drive out of Chicago or something. I didn't really want to move there.
So I took the GameSpot job eventually. I had to eventually say goodbye to my bar because that was just a job. It wasn't a career.
And then I moved out to San Francisco and worked at GameSpot. But the reality of working at GameSpot was a bit different than what I anticipated. And I'm sure what they probably saw in me at the time was different than what they were envisioning.
So it was a little bit of a mismatch. It was around the time where I was kind of like struggling with my role at GameSpot. Because this was the first full-time job I ever had, especially working in an office.
It was really a big transition for me. Right around that time, EGM, John Davidson from EGM got back to me. He reached out and said, he was like, James, you know that job offer we offered you over the past year?
He was like, if you're still interested in working for EGM, we're opening up a position on the West Coast where you could work for us, but you wouldn't have to move to Chicago. And I was like, okay, cool. You know, that's really interesting, especially because I wasn't loving my role at GameSpot at the time.
I was like, yeah, let's talk about it. I guess you haven't really considered salary yet. He's like, we'll pay you this amount of money.
And he had thought about it. And I was like, wow, okay. Because what they offered me at the time at GameSpot and EGM when they first were approaching me, there was a $5,000 difference between the two jobs, which was significant enough for me to, you know, to hesitate at the time.
GameSpot was paying more because they were in San Francisco and the cost of living there is higher. So mostly the reason I went to San Francisco is because it was a city and I was moving from New York City, so I felt it would be the least adjustment. But then when John Davison came to me again and offered me another shot at an EGM gig, basically what he was offering me then was $10,000 more than what I was making at GameSpot.
So for six months, you know, for waiting six months and kind of, you know, toughing it out in San Francisco at GameSpot and turning down the initial EGM offer, the space of six months, they basically gave me an offer that was $15,000 more than what they initially offered me, you know, previously. So for me, you know, at that age, to make a $15,000 leap in the space of six months was tremendous. So, you know, I mean, don't get it wrong, like it still didn't go very far because San Francisco was really, really expensive.
So, but, you know, it was still a good place to be. And plus, I was able to move over to the print side and work on the West Coast. So that was the best of both worlds.
So that was like, that was actually a really great time.
I did want to ask a little bit, a bit of a naive question, I guess, about EGM, because we didn't have EGM in the UK. I bought maybe like three or four import copies when it was running in the early noughties, but it still had a huge reputation even here. Why, I guess, like, do you mind just explaining what the significance of EGM was in that games media landscape in the US?
Sir, I mean, this is my perspective, but... So, opinions may vary on this, but print media in the nineties was the dominant information source for video games, right? Because the internet was still really young in the late nineties.
I honestly don't think video gaming websites really, really, really took hold until... Or at least in the mind share of video games, every video game company's PR team, websites were just kind of like a nice addition, but the print magazines were pretty much dominant up until the mid-2000s, probably where the landscape shifted from print to digital was probably in the 2006, 2007 area. That's where the power shift really started to happen.
That's when advertising dollars left the print side and were being found more in clickable banners on websites. 2006, 2007 is where we really saw that paradigm change. In the 90s, everything was a video game magazine, from EGM to Game Informer to the Imagine feature.
Their whole history confuses me. Imagine a brand of magazines to Tips and Tricks, GamePro, PS Extreme, magazines like that. That's where all the ad dollars were.
Every full page ad was a $10,000 buy. Or if you got the back cover, I don't know how much it was, but it was probably much, much greater, something like $50,000 to get the back page. You know what magazines from the 90s look like, right?
Big, thick magazines, tons of ads, those really cringy, bad, terrible ads of people holding controllers in extremely distorted ways that nobody ever does in real life. The reason AGM was so big is because we had the biggest circulation. By the time I took over, and this was many years later, our circulation was about 650,000 per month.
Whatever it was in the 90s, it was proportionate. Maybe it wasn't as big at that point, but it was big enough that Ziff Davis actually spun off AGM. There was EGM 2.
That transformed into Game Now. We had the Official PlayStation Magazine. We had our Xbox variant called Xbox Nation later.
This was in the 2000s, of course, but that's how big EGM was. They were like, well, EGM can only support so many pages, so let's spin off a couple of magazines. That will take the pressure off of EGM, having to run so many pages, and we can do these other magazines and sell all those ad pages.
It was a real kind of like dynasty for a while. Until GameStop, let's get GameStop and GameSpot confused coming out of my mouth, but when GameStop acquired Game Informer and then started printing upwards of 2 million copies a month, EGM was the number one video game for a long time. For a lot of gamers, they associate that era of dominance with print, the kind of golden age of print media and gaming.
So I think that's why EGM has such a big reputation and why people still refer to it now, just because for the longest time, it was the number one magazine in North America, which is huge. I'm not sure if that answers your question.
No, it's good because I think something that I noted when I was reading EGM in the noughties is that it was really good at surfacing personalities, and it felt like every writer in the magazine had some kind of prominence, just in terms of how reviews were structured and things like that. I know that obviously you are a hugely significant figure in the history of that magazine. Is that something that happened straight away for you, that you built up this reputation, or was that something that very gradually unfolded over time?
What were your first few years at EGM like?
In terms of the visibility or the personality, I mean, that was always part of the magazine. So it's probably for other people to say whether or not, you know, that was something I built up or was apparent from the start. But I think we were kind of uniquely situated to give off those kinds of impressions because, you know, like GamePro had the aliases, right?
You know, everybody worked under kind of like a cartoonish pseudonym, whereas, you know, in EGM it was our real names and you'd see like photos of us in the magazine. So, you know, people would gravitate towards the editors that they liked because, you know, if John Riccardi was always going on about Zelda or Dragon Quest, which he does to this day, you know, and if you like those games, you would, you know, kind of automatically say like, oh, I love that guy Riccardi, you know, he likes the same games I do. So, I guess since I was more of the, you know, we had guys like Dean Hager and Craig Kujawa, they were like the sports game guys, right?
And, you know, then you'd have other guys who liked, you know, racing games or, you know, action games like Soul Reaver or something. And so if you like those kinds of games, you'd gravitate towards them. But for me, I was always into the Japanese games, the obscure games, fighting games, whatever.
So if you like those kinds of games, you know, I was probably the editor that made it onto your radar. And, you know, I get a lot of comments like DMs and emails and stuff for, you know, various social media from people who read stuff a long time ago and said like, oh, you're one of my favorite editors or whatever. And it's always nice to hear that because, you know, like I've really just kind of put it behind me, but it's nice to hear from somebody.
I always appreciate it when somebody says, you know, I used to read your stuff back in the day all the time and blah, blah, blah. You know, and that happens in my professional life, too. Like, I'll meet somebody from, you know, from Twitter, like who works at Twitter, or I'll meet somebody who works at, like, this publisher, you know.
Like, I think at Limited Run Games, I think we were working on the recent Alien game that came out on Switch and stuff. And one of the guys from the UK, one of the production team, side-channeled me to let me know that, like, hey, you know, I'm a long-time fan of your work or whatever, and, you know, I read your stuff at EGM and 1up.com for years, so it's awesome to be able to work with you. And even somebody, I met up with somebody from the ESRB, our rating system in North America, and he said, like, oh, yeah, a long-time fan, read all your stuff on EGM and 1Up, and, you know, that's almost unexpected.
You know, it's cool to meet people who appreciate the time and effort you made back in those days. So, you know, it's always humbling to, you know, to know somebody who knows you from a past life, basically. So I think it's fun.
Absolutely. So after your first few years at EGM, you founded a short-lived magazine at Ziff Davis called GMR as its executive editor. So it seems like you progressed very quickly there.
Was it exciting to launch a games magazine at that time? How did you try and put your mark on it as something that was a part of your creation?
It was, that was interesting. I always look at GMR as like one of the highlights of my times in the games media. I was having a hard time at EGM because EGM at that point had moved out from Chicago to San Francisco because Ziff Davis decided they wanted to centralize all their operations.
The EGM being in Chicago was kind of a legacy thing because it was from the Sendai days or whatever. They just happened to be started there, but Ziff Davis wasn't really interested in maintaining a separate office in Chicago, so they moved everybody out. It was a big production.
It cost a lot because they had to move all these guys and all the equipment and all the staff out from Chicago to San Francisco. It was really exciting for me initially because I was like, oh, these are the guys I almost went out and worked with in Chicago, but once they came out there, I realized, keep in mind that these guys came from whatever walks of life. Most of them were local.
Some of them came from other places, but most of them were like Oak Brook, Lombard, Chicago area, so they were coming into a completely different environment. And I came from a different walk of life. I came from the nightlife in New York City, right?
So I was always playing music. I was keeping the energy up and stuff. But when you suddenly get surrounded by a bunch of guys who are used to working in a much quieter environment, I guess, my style of working was probably kind of like a shock to their systems.
There were personality classes, right? There were not only personality classes, but there were, I guess, more work styles, right? So yeah, again, I was always playing music.
That was probably the biggest problem.
People were used to, and to be fair, for my part, that was the way we conducted ourselves, both myself and Sam Kennedy, who I brought over with me when I left GameSpot. And when we were working at our first office in San Francisco, we were kind of stationed next to the computer gaming world guys. And they were totally cool with how we were just the two new kids over on the other side of the cubicles who were constantly playing music.
But they liked that energy, so it was cool. But when the Chicago team came out, it was a bit of a clash. So it wasn't so fun for me at that point.
And the other thing that was different was that Dan Hsu, I love Dan Hsu, but he went from one of their senior editors to being made the editor-in-chief. We went through a big screening process. There were a whole bunch of people who were up for the job.
But Dan Hsu ultimately got the editor-in-chief gig for EGM. John Davison had moved off to become more of the editorial director and also work on Official PlayStation Magazine. And he was actually the reason why I wanted to work at EGM.
So the incident I went full-time at EGM, he went over to Official PlayStation Magazine. So I was like, well, shit, that was my whole reason for coming over here. So when Dan Hsu got to be the editor, it was interesting because he got really serious about the editorial quality at that time, like the way things were written.
We suddenly had copy editors. I mean, we always had managing editors who would look everything over, but it wasn't as, I guess, professional as when Dan took over and we started having real copy editors. So the editorial was like, I have no problem with this.
The editorial was made as clean and as professional and as well written as it could possibly be. However, where that became hard for me was that I kind of stumbled backwards into this industry by accident. I never told anybody, hey, look, I'm a really good writer.
I'm trained and I'm professional and I went to school for this and I was an English major. There was none of that. It was just kind of like I did it for fun.
Somehow Joe Fielder noticed it at GameSpot.
Suddenly the assignments I was handing in were coming under real scrutiny. Dan was definitely giving me a deservedly hard time. He was like, don't you know that this is passive voice?
I literally don't know what passive voice is. I'm sorry.
To be fair, I think this made everybody a better writer. I'm sure everybody had their own levels of adversity that they had to deal with. But for me, I had to suddenly go from like, hey, I'm doing a pretty good job, aren't I?
To like, wow, I'm really not doing a good job and I could be doing a lot better. So that was a hard transition. And I don't know, it seemed like I was suddenly like, I went from being like the guy who could knock out 18 previews in a night or a feature overnight to the guy who doesn't know what passive voice is.
So for me, there was a real learning curve that happened really quickly. And I didn't know these things and it's hard to learn on the job. So I was having a really hard time, but I was working on it.
In addition to like my layout skills and all that stuff. And then one day I found myself at an Xbox conference. This was before the Xbox launched.
It was an Xbox, we wouldn't call it a conference, but it was like an Xbox reveal. It was a media event in New York City. And I was with Simon Cox, who you may know from, you know, the Dreamcast magazine in the UK and Edge.
You know, he was working for Ziff Davis at that time. And we were both on this trip to New York. I was covering Xbox.
He was covering the Xbox event because they were working on creating an Xbox magazine which became Xbox Nation. And we really hit it off on that trip because we were like, OK, well, we're both from Ziff Davis, so he was telling me about this magazine or whatever. But we were just getting along famously for reasons completely unrelated to gaming.
It wasn't like we were there saying, like, oh, do you like Sonic the Hedgehog or do you like Final Fantasy? We were not talking about that stuff at all. We were talking about music.
We're talking about music, like club life, nightlife, you know. And these are the reasons why John Davidson hired me in the first place because he thought I brought a different perspective, right? They had enough dudes who came up through the gaming industry because they had a GeoCities website dedicated to Dragon Quest or whatever.
But I was this guy who was, like, you know, doing... I was a bartender. I was a bar owner.
I was a DJ in New York City. I worked for Marvel Comics. All the reasons, all the things that you were discussing with me before, those are the things that I brought to EGM.
It's as if they was a completely different perspective. So, like, I think those are the reasons why I hit it off with Simon so well. And then Simon, at the end of, like, the trip, he was like, you know what?
He's like, I think you would really be good on this magazine that I'm working on. It's called GMR. It's going to be a thing that we do with Electronics Boutique.
And I said, sure. Well, you know, let me know. Like, when we get back, I'd be happy to talk about it.
So, you know, once we got back from this trip to New York, it wasn't long before Simon emailed me and said, like, hey, I've got an offer for you. And I was like, wow, okay, that was quick. Every time, like in my career up until this point, when somebody says, like, hey, I've got an offer for you, they were ready.
So, you know, they said, you know, Simon said, like, yeah, let's meet. And then we just met up in his office. He said, like, yeah, I'd like you to be the executive editor.
And, you know, again, we'll pay you this much. And it was like a nice bump up. So I was like, yeah, that sounds great.
Start a new magazine from scratch. Kind of, you know, put a little distance between me and Shu. And Shu will back all this stuff up, too.
So, like, I have no problem saying this stuff. Like, it was, you know, I wasn't maybe... I was adversarial at that point, I think.
So, like, it was probably a good... It was a healthy thing for me to move over to GMR. Because there were things that I had proposed at EGM that I thought would be really good, because I thought we should be tastemakers, right?
Not trend followers. And I had the opportunity to put, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3 on a magazine cover for the first time, because I really identified that as... that was going to be a game-changer.
And I was right. And, you know, my old friends who used to be PR at Rockstar and stuff, they admit, they were like, you know, I remember Mielke when we had... when I first showed him laser prints of Grand Theft Auto 3 at this, you know, smuggler's run event in Arizona, and he got on his phone and he called up John Davidson and said, you have to put this on the cover of the magazine.
And they were like, Grand Theft Auto, that little overhead pixel-looking car hijacking thing? Like, nah, that's niche. And then I did the same thing again with Kingdom Hearts, and I was like, you guys have to put it on the cover.
And, you know, everybody passed because they were like, like Disney games, Disney games are all crap, right? So they're like... even though it's got that Final Fantasy connection, like, it's still gonna be...
it's still gonna be whatever. And I was like, no, it's gonna be great. I did mock-ups, everything.
Everybody passed. So for me, GMR was my opportunity to, like, make those decisions instead of mortgaging, you know, the cover of the magazine for, like, you know, other reasons. You know, like, for going with the safe thing, for going with the recognizable IP that's gonna make sure that you sell as many copies on newsstands, right?
I was less concerned about that and more concerned about being the place that showed you the new thing before anybody else, right? So, for me, GMR was that opportunity. And, yeah, I mean, it was exciting.
What was scary to me was, like, even though I was having a hard time with EGM at that time, at least it was, like, you know, I was probably, like, maybe, like, a little bit of, like, in a kind of, like, battered spouse relationship or something. It's like I was... It was a little bit scary to go to something completely new and unknown because Simon had a bit of a reputation for being, like, you know, tough to work with.
And I can see, you know, in hindsight, like, I can see why he got that reputation. But, like, you know, I was able to navigate it because our chemistry works well together. And so, you know, I'm older than him.
So it's easier for me to say, like, hey, you need to calm down or you need to do this or that. So I was kind of, like, you know, I was kind of, like, his voice of reason. And I'm pretty sure Simon would readily admit that.
But, you know, it was it was scary to go from a from a slightly, you know, tough situation, like, you know, she was like, you know, a father figure who was tough. It was like, you know, tough love was hard to go from that tough love to like, you know, a much more open relationship that was unknown at the time. But, you know, as it turned out, like my working relationship with Simon was really great.
You know, he'll be the first one to tell you that I was really the EIC of that magazine and everything but title. You know, I think Simon mostly liked to basically get the design covers every month. And that was probably where we had the biggest clashes because as a designer myself, I would say, Simon, that is a terrible idea.
You're using way too much magenta.
You know, and I was like, it doesn't really do the artwork justice. So, you know, there were a lot of, like, kind of, like, good, heated discussions, good creative discussions. You know, if we would lock horns, it was because we were really into what we were doing, not because we were mad at each other.
But so in that way, like, yeah, GMR was short lived, but it was one of the best experiences I've ever had as a professional.
Were there any particular covers that you did on GMR that you were proud of or that you remember now as being significant in the way that that GTA III cover was?
Um, whoosh, I got, let me look up GMR covers.
Sorry, that one I knew out of nowhere, so I do apologize.
That's alright. In terms of, like, you mean in terms of, like, where we had the chance to reveal something that, you know, was really groundbreaking?
Yeah, or even just, you know, spotlighting something that would go on to be a big deal, or even just a particular cover that you were proud of, you know?
Yeah, so there were probably three covers that I really liked. There was the Monster Hunter cover, so that was like a split cover. I think it was all based around multiplayer things.
That month, we did like three or four covers. There was Monster Hunter, there was that Matrix MMO, and I think there might have been one of the Sony kind of like multiplayer games, the Diablo. I'm totally blanking on it now, but...
EverQuest kind of thing?
Yeah, oh yeah, I think it actually was EverQuest 2. But Monster Hunter was the one I was interested in because at that time, I was really looking forward to kind of something to fill the hole that Phantasy Star Online had left for me, right? Because Phantasy Star Online 3 wasn't doing it for me.
I'm not into card games at all. So when Monster Hunter was first revealed to us at a Capcom media event, I thought like, wow, that looks really cool. And then we did this collaboration with them where there was a weapon in the first Monster Hunter on PS2 that you could...
I forget how it was distributed, but I guess it was baked into the game or something and you had to unlock it through a certain means. Because we didn't have DLC at that time. But it was basically a sword, a broadsword that you could get.
It was called the GMR Chrome Heart because I like Chrome Heart rings. That's so stupid, but I like Chrome Hearts rings. I had to give the thing a name, but they basically made a special weapon in the game that I created and they put it in the game.
So we have that cover, the Monster Hunter cover. I thought the art was really great. I was happy to be the place to reveal that in North America.
You know how big Monster Hunter is now. That was cool. I also really liked the Metal Gear Solid cover, the Metal Gear Solid 3 cover we did because we did a lot of transparencies on that cover.
So everything's really got a camouflage vibe. And what was really cool was that we were working really closely with Kojima on that one. And they sent us over, remember the quality of the internet in like the 2002, 2003 era.
It was terrible. And he took these screenshots. I don't remember how big they were realistically.
Nowadays, we wouldn't even blink at the file size. But at that time, you know, it was probably like something like an 800-megabyte file. When you're trying to download it on 2002 caliber internet connections, right, from Japan, it took us, I think, an entire day just to download like one file.
And they were like every screenshot that they sent us was that big, right? So it took us like a whole week to download all the assets for this cover. But like I think the cover came out really good.
And Kojima obviously liked it enough that he had a blowout, like a large format print in his apartment at Roppongi Hills, which I saw like the next time I interviewed him for a cover that we did for Official PlayStation Magazine, he had that cover up framed on his wall. So obviously he liked it. So that was cool.
And then the third cover that I really liked was the punk rock flyer looking cover that we did for Dead or Alive and Fable. So again, this is where Simon got to fulfill his magenta dreams. It was basically black, white and magenta.
Those were the colors. Because we had two games, like Fable and we had Dead or Alive. And the problem with these two games was they look nothing alike.
So how do we do a split cover that's in some way kind of like uniform? So I proposed kind of like dirtying everything up to make it look like a cheap photocopied, you know, DIY flyer from like the punk rock era. You know, flyers, club flyers that I had seen a million times over in my DJ career in New York City.
You know, you'd see flyers all over the East Village, you know, being handed out, stapled to telephone poles and stuff. And they were always like the kind of cheap, kind of, you know, do-it-yourself flyer that you get done at Kinko's. Photocopied, you know, newsprint looking, real crappy.
But, you know, I had that punk rock look that, you know, that Jamie Reid, Sex Pistols kind of like look. So I said, why don't we do, you know, instead of just running another Team Ninja render or just running this fable art, how about we, you know, unify them by making both covers look like a, you know, like a club flyer from the 80s. And so Simon was into that, plus he got to slather as much magenta on the cover as he wanted to.
And, you know, that's how we came about that cover. You know, every cover, we put so much work into every cover, whether it looks like it or not. And to be honest, I think the last cover that we did, the Resident Evil 4 cover was really cool too, because we made that whole thing like Leon Kennedy and an explosion, and we were going out with a bang.
So that cover was really, really fun too. But yeah, since Simon had come from a background of working on Edge, we tried to bring as much of that Edge energy to GMR as possible. I look back at these magazines and I think they hold up to this day.
Yeah, they're cool.
I think it was really fun.
Yeah, I don't think there are other games' magazines at that time that looked like that, so yeah, I definitely think they stand the test of time. Yeah, so something I did want to ask about, we always ask our guests about the bizarre trips or events they were taking on during the heyday of GamesPR blowouts in the 90s and 00s. It always provokes some good stories.
Do you have anything along these lines that you can share?
Yeah, I mean, I don't think if I... The first one that comes to mind is a trip that I didn't even attend because I didn't really like going to Las Vegas at the time. There were some...
This is all going to be secondhand, but this one fascinated me because after hearing about it, I wish I was on this trip. I forget the publisher, but I just know that my friend Raymond Padilla, I forget which magazine or outlet he was working for at the time, but he was always present. It must have been Midway because it was...
This is Vegas. This is Vegas, in Las Vegas, yeah. I think it was Midway.
I think it was a Midway event because it was something that was probably ready to rumble boxing or something. So they actually put these editors in a boxing ring and had them fight each other. I'm not a small person, so I feel like I would have done fairly well, you know, holding up, but my friend Raymond Padilla, he got put into a ring with my friend Ryan McDonald, who was like the video editor over at GameSpot.
And Ryan McDonald was like a professional amateur boxer. So that was actually a bad situation for Raymond, who was not in any way a boxer. And, you know, I mean, even if like, you know, Ryan was taking it easy on him, he would still get cleansed by Ryan.
There's just no contest, right? Ryan knew what he was doing. However, in what had to have been like the best stroke of luck for Raymond possible, Ryan in that match, I believe, if I am getting my facts right, dislocated his arm.
He took a swing and somehow he managed to dislocate his shoulder from its socket. And so Raymond was crowned the winner by default, and managed to escape without any major damage. So that was an event that after I heard about it, I was like, man, I really wish I was in there because there are some freelancers I really would have liked to knock out.
That was one of the wildest ones. I mean, most of the crazy stories, usually I heard about them secondhand. Yeah, there were stories where I think it was midway again.
They took people to... I don't even know if I can tell this one. It's too crazy.
I would say it's too long and involved, and it would be hard to not incriminate some of the people involved. So I'm thinking about... But let me just say that midway was responsible for some of the craziest shit that I've ever heard about.
Gosh, there are so many. Because you have to remember, these were the days where it wasn't really a playola situation. I think it was mostly that PR people saw these...
PR management and teams at the time saw this as a way to actually help themselves to a paid vacation. Because they were like, okay, well... Because Ubisoft...
I can share this, but Ubisoft, when they were trying to make a name for themselves, and this was maybe 2000, 2001, the Dreamcast era, they were always having media events in places like Hawaii. When they were showing off their entire Dreamcast lineup of games like Speed Devils and Rayman 2 on Dreamcast, and Grandia 2 and stuff like that, they decided they were going to have this media event in Honolulu. Partly probably because they wanted to make a big impression.
If editors went to Honolulu and just remembered being in this amazing tropical environment while also looking at the launch lineup of Dreamcast games, they would probably come out with a pretty good buzz and write these things up in as positive a manner as possible. That was probably their underlying motive. Their secondary motivation was probably like, well, if we host this event in Hawaii, we get to go to Hawaii.
They did that for two years in a row. Some places like Ziff Davis, we had the editorial policy that we would pay for our own events. We wouldn't let publishers pay for our events.
If we were going to attend this, we had to be the ones to pay our own way, whereas other publications would totally let them put the bill. We wanted to avoid that perception of conflict of interest. Ziff Davis was pretty serious about that.
The only way I was able to go was if our magazine was able to pay for it. If we had the budget and we went, then cool. But otherwise, it's much different now because games media, first of all, the games media seems so decentralized now.
I don't recognize the names of most of the editors who exist in the industry now unless they've been around for more than 10 years because everybody works remotely. You don't remember people as easily as you do in the days that people were reading these magazines in the 90s because you had a select group of people whose names you saw every month. Nowadays, it just seems like random people and the byline.
It's a very different time then. I guess my point is that most game publishers, they would try and host these kind of extravagant events, but nowadays, it's just kind of like, oh, you want the assets? Here's the link.
Oh, you want a review copy of the game? Here's the download code. It used to be a thrill to get a review build or a burn on a disk and arrive in FedEx and be like, oh, we can finally review Grand Theft Auto or whatever.
But nowadays, it's a much different industry, so you don't really see that kind of extravagant, exorbitant, indulgent media trip these days. I mean, they pop up occasionally, but there are so many more efficient ways to kind of distribute the information and the assets that those things don't really happen quite like that anymore.
Yeah. What about meeting developers you're interested in, James? I mean, you mentioned Kojima there.
Did you get to rack up some cool interviewees in the time that you worked in games media?
Yeah. I mean, I think that interviewing is probably where I really found my niche and kind of my groove. Because like I said, I never got into this with the best of intentions.
It wasn't like, oh, well, I graduated from college with like a degree in English lit, and I'm a really accomplished writer, and I know all the rules and stuff. You know, I learned these things on the fly and like worked really hard to get my bad habits out of my writing. And I think by the time I finished up my career, I was like in a much better place.
And I do give Shu full credit for that. You know, he turned me around. He made me aware of things that I just didn't know.
So that was like, that was cool. But yeah, so that's why I feel like I really hit my groove. And the reason for that is because, you know, as someone who's not a technically or traditionally trained writer, where it was easier for me to make a mark was in interviews.
Because in interviews, I could, my approach was different, I think. Instead of showing up with, you know, a list of 20 questions and just kind of going through them, which I found to be a very limiting kind of approach when talking to creators. I'll give you a couple of examples.
Like when I met Yuji Horii from Dragon Quest, right? Like it wasn't something that I won, had a great interest in. I was never really a Dragon Quest guy.
I was more of a Final Fantasy person. So I didn't really know that much about Dragon Quest, but I got this one assignment sprung on me at, I think it was for 1up.com or something, but it was during an E3 where Yuji Horii was at E3. And whoever I was working for at the time, I guess it was 1Up, they said like, oh, can you go interview Yuji Horii?
He's available at the Square Enix booth. And I was like, well, shit, I don't know anything about Yuji Horii, so let me try and work up, you know, 20 questions or something. And I'll head over there and handle this interview.
And I went there and it was really tough because he gives really brief answers. It doesn't matter how nuanced, you know, I try to set up the interviewees with, so that, you know, they can expand upon, you know, they could talk at length about, like, you know, what their inspirations were, you know, or, you know, what fundamental theme they were trying to get across in this game and how it was different from past games to really kind of, like, you know, elaborate, right? But he didn't care about such editorial luxuries.
I would ask the question and he would answer me in, like, you know, a single sentence. You know, I would say, like, oh, so, you know, with Dragon Quest IX, you know, and I didn't know anything about it. Like, I look back and I realize that in my pictures, that I was looking through pictures, like, the other day and I saw that, like, I had interviewed the, also interviewed the president of Level 5, who I've always wanted to interview, and I didn't realize that I already had interviewed him.
But he was like, you know, he was, he didn't really contribute much to the interview. It was mostly Hori's son that was, who was doing the talking. So that's why it didn't really make an impression upon me that he was the guy who created, you know, Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud 2 and all the games since then.
Because I really, I really regret that interview and not taking advantage of it. But like, I would ask Yuji Hori, like, some nuanced, in-depth question, and then he would come back with, like, well, yeah, we really wanted to kind of change the theme up. And so the theme for this one was blah, blah, blah.
And I would be kind of like, and, you know, and, you know, so that was a really, really dry interview. And I realized I can't do this thing where you're just, you go in with a list of questions. So for me, where it really clicked was an interview with Kojima and it was, I was doing an interview for Xbox Nation.
They sent me over there. They're like, James, you like, you like Metal Gear. Can you go do this interview for us at Tokyo Game Show?
I was like, sure. So I don't know if you've ever been to Tokyo Game Show. Have you guys?
Sadly not. Yes. If it was in the nineties, now it's just a completely different beast.
So I wouldn't say that you're missing much, but I'm sure you would like to find out for yourselves. But the way the the Makahari Messe is laid out and the way a lot of interviews are structured is that a lot of interviews take place in this hotel called the New Otani. The New Otani Hotel, which is adjacent to the Makahari Messe Convention Center, but it's not, you know, it's like across the street and stuff.
So I was at an interview there, I think, with like, maybe it was with Swery or it was with Arc Systems or something like that. And I had that interview was like already running a little bit late. But the problem is, is that in order to get from the New Otani over to the Makahari there, it's not like a direct thing, like where you just walk across the street, you have to deal with this network of like over, over, over the ground kind of like bridges and walkways and stuff like that and they're all like angular and there's no such thing as like a straight line to get to the Makahari, right?
So and plus the Makahari is this big. There's two convention, main conventions halls like A and B and my interview was in the far one and it was taking me a long time to get over there and I was like and so here's the thing, like this was the only interview that Kojima was giving in North America, the only interview he was giving in North America for that entire year. This was leading up to the release of Metal Gear Solid 2 for Xbox.
So this was the only interview. We had the exclusive interview and we only had a 30 minute interview and I'm like dying because it's so hot, right? It's so bloody hot and then I get a call on my phone.
I don't even know how I had a phone at that time but like I get a call on my phone and yeah, this was like, you know, probably like 2003 or something. This was post GMR. So it was it was Xbox Nation.
It was probably like 2003, 2004. I get a call on my phone and it's my friend Tammy, who's the PR head for Konami US and she's yelling at me on the phone. She's like, where are you?
You're 15 minutes late to a 30 minute interview with the only interview with Kojima in North America for 2004. Where are you? And I was like, I am so sorry.
I am like, I'm basically like stuck on this network of catwalks trying to figure out how to get over the Macahari. I'll be there. I'll be there in five minutes.
She's like, you're 15 minutes late. I said, I know. I know.
I know. Like, but I was like, I promise you, it's going to be the best 15 minute interview you've ever seen. So I eventually show up.
I am a sweaty mess. I am not presentable. But like Kojima is there getting like his picture taken.
So he loved that shit. And you know, we were doing photos for the for the interview and stuff like that. We had a photographer there.
So the photographer was basically buying me some time. So that was good. I get settled down.
I'd interviewed Kojima before, you know, so I sat, I sit down with him. I reintroduced myself. I said, so sorry, I'm late, do all the apologetic stuff.
And then, you know, the interview started off a little bit dry. I don't think he was particularly peeved that I was late. I just think he doesn't care for doing interviews much at all.
So that was just his general kind of like lack of enthusiasm for doing interviews. So the first few the first few questions were sort of like just kind of like icebreakers get going, get in the rhythm. And then, you know, I said to him, I said, So, you know, a lot of the things that you put into your games are based on kind of sort of autobiographical elements in your life.
You know, you'll take real life inspiration, you'll put them into the game. He's like, Yeah, that's that's absolutely true. I said, So should I be reading something into the fact that Otakon was in love with his sister and had a relationship with his sister?
And that immediately shattered whatever shell Kojima-san had built up around him, like this force field of like, you know, whatever, like, you know, it lowered his guardrails, basically, right? And he instantly was like, Oh, no, you know, he was like really bashful about it. He was like, No, that didn't happen.
And he's like, I see why you might say that. But that's no, that's not that's not a real thing. And so once I said that, we were able to have a real once he dropped that pretentious bullshit, like, you know, we were able to have a really great conversation.
And we just talked, we just talked the rest of the the time. And we had a really great conversation. And I was 15 minutes late to a 30 minute interview, but the interview ended up lasting an hour and a half, much to the annoyance of the Makahari security staff, who were constantly like pointing at their watches and letting us know we had to go.
But Kojima just did not give a shit. So he was just like, happy to keep talking, laughing. We're having a great conversation.
And then after the interview was over, and we all said our goodbyes, like the my friend Tammy who was yelling at me leading up to the interview, she was like, what the fuck just happened? I was like, what, she was like, she was like, he was laughing. I've never seen Kojima laugh.
He was laughing. And he was having a great time. He gave great answers.
And she was just like, I've never seen that was she was like, James, that was amazing. Thank you so much. And I was like, I told you, you know, I was like cocky about it.
I was like, I told you would be good.
But you know, it was totally coincidental that it just ended up being that good. But like, you know, once I was able to break that wall with him, you know, bring down that barrier, I was we had we just had a great conversation. I just spoke to him like a human, like a bartender whose job it was to make conversation with hundreds of people at night.
You know, like, I guess I had picked up some sort of Latin skill, some like, you know, some passive ability that enabled me to have a really good conversation with him. And, you know, after that, I realized this is the way this is the way this is the way I'm going to handle all my interviews, you know, and I was probably I was probably able I probably kind of refined my approach a bit like in my interviews with Ida Khaki at Team Ninja during the during the GMR days because we did a couple of GMR covers and I spent I spent substantial amounts of time with him looking at Ninja Gaiden, looking at Tetra Live Xtreme, Volleyball, Tetra Live 3, whatever, you know, and having really frank conversations with him. So, you know, I found that that approach really resonates with interview subjects because especially in Japan, they're always amazed when any Westerner knows anything about their stuff in Japan, like like we live in a vacuum or something like, oh, you know, very, they love to say, oh, you know, very well, you know, about my history and when they when they see that, you know, their their work, you know, their games and you know, their, you know, kind of like their maybe their artistic intentions, they really that really resonates with them and they they open up.
It's amazing. It's just like a flower. They just blossom and then they everything just pours out of them.
And that's when you get the best stuff. Right. So instead of doing 20 questions with them, I just go in and have a conversation and do, you know, there's still some people whose personalities might just be a little too rigid for that kind of thing.
Maybe they're nervous, they're scared or they're they don't trust you or whatever. But for the most part, I found that that that is the best approach and that gets the best possible results. So that's I think interviewing people is where, you know, usually like when I do a an article nowadays, it's an interview opportunity.
And that's that's the kind of thing I like to do because I get to go and talk to people whose work I respect and we get to really get down to the to the nitty gritty.
That makes sense. After GMR, you worked on 1up.com, which is a very well respected site. What do you remember about the landscape of games websites in the mid-noughties?
When you joined, did you feel like you were in that moment of websites taking over print or overtaking print rather?
Well, that was interesting for us because that was when we were trying to really kind of like, and I really hate using this word, but we were trying to get some kind of synergy going between 1Up and EGM. The EGM, and this was really difficult because we were one of the only editorial entities that had this sort of conundrum where we were, you know, John Davison, like I really think John Davison is like a visionary. He saw things before they happened.
He knew that the whole landscape was shifting. And that's why we created 1Up to begin with. And unfortunately, we had Sam Kennedy because Sam came from like, you know, when he created gaming and stuff.
So he was a perfect person to lead the 1Up project with with John Davison. They identified that like the future of games editorial, games journalism, games media was all going to be internet based right now. It just seems like, you know, you wouldn't even have that conversation with like a younger kid these days because it's all they know, right?
They're like, oh, what are magazines? Those are cute, right? But they knew that these guys saw that like all advertising was going to transition to web based stuff that, you know, that print media was was basically the writing was on the wall.
But the EGM guys didn't really feel that they still felt like they were the number one powerhouse in the industry, you know, that they were, you know, it was just legacy stuff. It was hard to break them out of the mentality that like, look, this is all changing. This is all going to be all this is going to be gone at some point.
And I think people just didn't want to acknowledge that it was a bit of denial. Right. So 1Up, you know, for us, like for us, there was a lot of challenge in getting those guys to contribute.
They literally didn't really want to. They just felt those like added work for no benefit to write stuff for for the website. Right.
I think a lot of a lot of people felt it was almost beneath them. So we had to really train them, condition them to, you know, do stuff for the web. It basically started with repurposing EGM articles on 1up.com, right?
You know, and before 1up.com, we actually kind of came into an agreement with gamers.com. We didn't own gamers.com, but we I think we licensed it from them, like, which was funny because Shu and Chay Chow, they left EGM at one point to go to gamers.com. They kind of like, you know, gamers.com was throwing tons of money at like editors around the industry.
So like, they staffed up really quickly. And my buddy Sam Kennedy almost went when I was leaving GameSpot, he almost went to gamers.com because he had an offer on the table. I was like, don't do it.
That website's not going to be here six months from now. And I was right and like, you know, when gamers.com first folded, like, you know, Sam was safely over an official PlayStation magazine. So I felt good about that.
But you know, years later, when we had 1up.com or before we had 1up.com, we started doing editorial on the web with gamers.com. And then eventually, like, you know, I guess that business relationship wasn't really built for the long term. So we started looking at creating our own solution.
And then we came up with 1up.com. I wasn't on that thing initially until GMR closed. And then I was going to leave Ziff Davis after GMR closed.
I was going to go do something else. But Sam came to me. We went out and had dinner one night and he said, like, I don't think your work here is done.
And those were his exact words. I don't think your work here is done. And I felt like that was very meaningful.
I felt appreciated. So I was like, all right, I'll give this web thing another shot. And what was cool about 1up.com is that, you know, the reason I stayed at Ziff Davis for so long is because the team was just amazing.
Everybody was amazing. You know, even, you know, the good and the bad, there are people who really pulled their weight. There are people who kind of, like, mailed it in, you know, just like any team, you have, like, you know, different dynamics.
But the people who really made the publications and the website saying they were so great to work with. We were always understaffed, but I think we always overachieved, which was the best thing. And this is why I never left Zip Davis, because it was, there, we just did too much good work that we were all very proud of.
So, you know, 1Up was always like, we were always like, you know, trying to find more ways to raise traffic with very, very limited resources and stuff, and, you know, we spent so much time and money and effort putting together stuff like game videos, you know, and it was ahead of its time, right now, everybody just uses YouTube. But like, in those days, it wasn't, it wasn't quite as robust a platform as it is now. So you know that we had to build our own thing, it was, it was, we were constantly struggling, but all people saw on the other side of things were things like the 1Up show, right, or the podcasts that we did, and, you know, that Garnett did, and, you know, and what I what I brought to the table was what I, you know, it was hard to leverage the real exclusives from publishers, unless you had the magazine.
So for as long as we could, we leveraged like, okay, we'll give you the one, two punch, we'll give you coverage on 1Up, if you give us this for the magazine, or, you know, or we'll if you give us this for 1Up, we'll give you this in the magazine, you know, it went both ways. But we had that one, two punch of being able to offer people an editorial package that nobody else could really provide. And but with the with the website, I started doing these things called cover stories, right?
They were week long exposés on on things and they were really well designed. We basically designed a magazine quality cover for these 1Up cover stories where we would cover stuff like Resident Evil, or, you know, we did a big thing on Resident Evil 5, we did Shadow of the Colossus, we did, you know, I think we did a Team Ninja spread. That was the one where, I don't know if you know, but like, where it showed like, our, I think our intern Jared Rhee, he, he did a thing for an Itagaki spread where it showed like Paul Phoenix through like six different Tekken games doing the same punch over and over and over again, which reinforced Itagaki's jokes and that it was the same game they released every year.
But, you know, we, we, we, we got to do a lot of innovative things because it was still, you know, it wasn't as nearly as templated as a lot of the other sites. We had a lot of, we had a lot of editorial freedom and we were always able to, you know, if we had a good idea, that was one of the few places I've ever seen where you could actually make that happen, right? So, you know, and then eventually like, you know, I took over EGM, so it was EGM and 1up.com and we were able to even better integrate the, you know, those, those, those two outlets.
So, you know, EGM eventually shuttered as, as, as you know, like before Steve Harris took over again, but, and reacquired the IP, but, you know, I think, I think we went out on a real high note and we all knew it was coming, right? We all knew that, like, we didn't know how long it was going to last, but we knew that the end of EGM was coming just because, you know, the people, the, the capitalists, venture capitalists who own Ziff Davis, they, you know, they were always trying to find a buyer. They were keeping us alive so they could find a buyer.
And, you know, eventually EGM went away, but I think up until the last minute, we were all very proud of what we did.
I was curious if there was anything about Games Media that you missed. I guess as well, like, why did you want to leave Games Media after, after EGM closed?
This is going to, this is going to sound so entitled, so I apologize in advance, but like, I didn't really feel like I had that much more to give. I mean, yes, I could keep doing all the things that I had been doing. But I grew up as a creator, as an illustrator.
And so it gets, to me, it gets frustrating talking about other people's work when I would rather create my own, whatever, you know, whether it's games, whether it's comic books or whatever, I want to be creating things. So and this is the part that's going to sound entitled, but it's like, how many times can I interview Kojima? Right?
Because they're like, you know, once I did a cover story with him for Official PlayStation Magazine, and I went really biographical on him. And once you've done that, it's hard to go back from that. Right?
All I can do, and especially since I've interviewed him about most of the old stuff, you know, at this point, all it becomes is kind of like, you know, it's like movie reviewers, like they probably go through the same thing, you know, meeting Spielberg again and then like talking about his new movie. But like for me, it was Kojima and Michael was kind of like, Oh, so what do you what inspired the new game? Right?
Oh, what are your what are your themes? And there's there's there's very few secrets that you can unearth when you've already spoken to the guy like half a dozen times. I mean, there are people who are always interesting to talk to, but I just didn't know how much, you know, I've had outlets ask me like, Oh, can you do an interview with so and so?
And I would be like, I've interviewed that dude a dozen times. I've asked him every question in every possible way that I can. And I don't think I can bring anything new to the table.
So I think you should really find somebody else is going to have fresh questions for him, or at least the naivete that will make old questions feel fresh again. I don't know. But like, I'm not that guy.
Like, I'm maybe I'm a little too cynical at this point. But, you know, there comes a point where you've the well runs dry. And it's hard to like, you know, it's hard to see that same guy again.
You know, yeah, I could go and have drinks with Kojima and just chill out and just talk about music and shit. But like, that might not really make the the best interview. It's just more of like, it's better to conduct ourselves as like, you know, you know, people who've known each other for a long time having a casual chat rather than, you know, like, doing it as a job.
It's just it's just hard to it's just hard to to talk to people about their work when I'm really restless and itchy and just want to go off and do my own thing. So, you know, around that around that time that EGM was wrapping up, it just so happened that Itagaki was offering me a job at at Team Ninja and then his, you know, what became Valhalla. He extended a job offer to me for like, he was probably waiting on a decision for about six months.
But around that time and slightly after Itagaki offered me a job, Tetsuya Mizuguchi offered me a job at Q Entertainment. And that was really hard. That was one of the hardest times of my life because, you know, I love both of those guys.
And it was, you know, especially with Itagaki, it was I felt really bad because I was going to have I knew I was going to turn him down because of this other. But, you know, if Mizuguchi had not ever offered me a position at Q Entertainment, I would have certainly taken the Valhalla position. But it would have been really hard because those guys are the kings of crunch time.
Their development style is the stuff that nightmare articles are made of, right? Because they would go to work like, you know, the guys there would tell me that they don't go home for two weeks, that they sleep under their desks and sleeping bags. And that might be cool for a young single guy to feel like you're in the trenches with a cool development team.
And, you know, who wouldn't want, you know, Ninja Gaiden or Dead or Alive on their resume? But, you know, I was having a baby at that time and I knew that, like, I couldn't be away from home for weeks at a time to leave my wife to just raise the kid by herself, right? So I knew I would have to take this job from a job offer from Cure Entertainment, which everybody who I've spoken to in my personal life said that that was the right move because, like, I'm so into music and like games like res and stuff like that, that, you know, it would just be ridiculous.
It would just be foolish to turn that opportunity down, right? And it was the right move because by the time I left Cure Entertainment, I had, you know, a number of games under my belt, whereas the one game that Valhalla was working on didn't ship until I had actually moved back to New York. Like, when I moved back to New York, like, you know, in 2013, 2014, that's when that game finally came out, and they've been working on it for like eight years at that point.
So one, that would have been frustrating. Two, they smoke like crazy at, you know, on Itagaki's development team. So I would have been dying from secondhand smoke, and, you know, and then like, I would only have had one game that like kind of came out and then just kind of vanished, you know, the multiplayer was shut down really quickly by Nintendo.
You know, they only printed a very small amount of copies, like it just, that would have not been a great outcome for like that much effort. And, you know, it's, who knows what would happen. But maybe if I was on that project, maybe I would have helped them for whatever reason, galvanize, you know, some of the things that were like, you know, slowing them down.
And, you know, maybe maybe the game would have come out sooner, who knows. But, you know, I definitely had the best professional experience of my life at at at Q Entertainment. So I got, you know, I'll never I'll never regret that decision because it was the working with Mizoguchi is like the it's definitely a dream come true.
Gosh, there's so much I could ask you about, James. I think I could talk to you. I'm going to respect your time and just ask one last question about you live in New Zealand now.
Right. So what are you currently working on? And what's your life like there?
Well, my quality of life is a lot better because I was actually I got a green light in the visa to move to New Zealand just before the pandemic caused them to close their borders. So I couldn't get in for like another two years. So we moved what years now?
2024. We moved here last year in 2023, but I had basically been approved to move here in 2020 or 2021. So we had that was a long two years.
So basically, because we weren't sure when the borders were going to open back up and when we'd be able to move, we moved into an apartment in New York City and put a lot of my stuff in storage. And the apartment in New York City was really small. My mother owned it.
So like it was convenient. And it was we were only looking at that as a temporary kind of stopgap measure. But we ended up being there for like about a year and a half longer than we were hoping to because just because of the way like rental is handled in New York City.
You know, we would we would otherwise be locked into a lease. And, you know, in order to get out of that lease, we'd have to break the lease. And that would mean paying a lot of money that we didn't need to spend on, you know, just lease breaking situations.
So because my mother owned this apartment in New York City, we were able to like stay there and leave when we needed to. So we moved here. And it's I guess the reason I'm bringing up the apartment is because my apartment here is five times the size of my apartment in New York City.
So I was able to bring all my crap here and I'm looking around my office as we speak right now. And I'm just like, man, I just own way too much stuff. But, you know, it's great because I'm able to be united with all my stuff.
Most of my stuff has been in storage for like the last 15 years or so. But now I've got it all here, so it's nice to be able to like kind of like spread these things out and display them. The country is just beautiful.
I mean, you can if you've watched Lord of the Rings, you know how beautiful it is. It's just a different lifestyle, right? Like going from New York City, the noise and the congestion of like all the people, you know, there's one forty fourth the amount of people here.
I mean, there's I think there's something like five million people in New Zealand in total, you know, and there's like eight and a half million people in New York City alone. So there's just a lot less people in your face. You know, it's a much more it's just a quality of life improvement all across the board.
You know, you don't have as many things here, of course, as you might in New York City or any major city in the world. But, you know, the payoff is the trade offs is that, you know, it's just a much more peaceful existence. I really love it.
You know, and things like Amazon exists. So, you know, if there's something I can't get, you know, locally, I'll just order it online and it'll get here eventually. I just have to be a little bit more patient.
You know, in New York, if you order something, there's on Amazon and especially in Tokyo, if you order something on Amazon, if you order it before like 12 o'clock noon, there's a very good chance you could get the thing you ordered that same day. And if you and if you don't get it through Amazon, you could, you know, I could walk over to Best Buy and buy it or I could go to Target or something. I could go to a bookstore like Barnes and Nobles and get what I want.
So you don't get that instant gratification here. But you in almost every other way, it's like a massive improvement on, you know, my quality of living. So I'm really glad I moved here because it's so nice.
That's awesome to hear about. And yeah, I hope we'll go as well with BitSummit in July. So yeah, maybe like a year or so down the line, we'll reach out and see if there's we could have you back on the show and ask you a little bit more about working in game dev as well.
Because yeah, we've really only just covered like one part of your career here. So yeah, but thanks so much for your time, James. I really appreciate it.
Is there anything you want to plug or I guess like, where can people get you on social media?
I mean, like I guess Twitter is the best place. My handle is Wireframe James. And yeah, that's where I interact mostly.
I mean, you can just find me on Instagram too, James Mielke. That's my handle. Pretty active on both.
Is there anything else I want to say? No, I mean, I'm working on setting up a studio here as well. So that's going to be fun once we get that going.
Tiger Tron is still very much active. We've got a couple of games in development there. I definitely always have too much on my plate, but you know, you've only YOLO, right?
So, you know, you've got one life to live. So I'm just trying to make the most of it and make things happen. BitSummit is happening this year, and we'll have every year it just seems to grow, grow, grow.
So we started off with 175 industry-only, invite-only attendees, and now last year we had 26,000. So that's... Yeah, it's the second largest gaming event in Japan, and nothing else is even close.
So, you know, besides Tokyo Game Show, which brings in a quarter of a million people every year, you know, we're the biggest event. But honestly, having been at both, I can honestly say that, like, I think BitSummit is the much more fun event, because it's just pure games, you know. Like, at Tokyo Game Show, you know, Tokyo Game Show is an institution, but like now half of it is like, you know, Chinese mobile games and stuff like that, and, you know, and all the Japanese game industry.
Tokyo Game Show in the 2000s, like the early 2000s was amazing, just non-stop wall-to-wall developers, every developer out there. But now everything's been like absorbed. It's like Square Enix or Capcom or Konami or whatever, you know.
It's all Monster Hunter, Dragon Quest and, you know, Dynasty Warriors. So it doesn't feel as big, and it's a lot of effort to go all the way out to Maka Hard Massade to, you know, deal with the heat and deal with all that, whereas you come to BitSummit and it's just wall-to-wall games, and it's very, very energetic. And, you know, most of the people I talk to tell me it's their favorite gaming event in the world because it's so concentrated and because it's, you know, it's a real throwback to when game conventions were super fun and something to look forward to.
So, you know, if you're ever able to join us for BitSummit, I would highly recommend it because I'd love for you to witness that energy firsthand. So, let me know if you can make it.
Yeah, it sounds great and what an amazing thing to have helped build. So, yeah, thanks so much, James. It's been awesome talking to you.
So, yeah, thank you.
You got it. Sorry if I went on too long.
No, it was great. No, it was fantastic. So, yeah, we'll just plug our stuff briefly.
But Back Page: Pod on Twitter, if you want to follow us. Matthew, where can people get you on social media? Mr. Basil underscore pesto on Twitter, Mr. Basil pesto on Blue Sky.
I feel terrible. I contributed nothing to this episode, but I really enjoyed listening to it.
Your presence influenced all of my answers, so don't worry.
Thanks so much, guys.
Yeah, and I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter, and we'll be back next week. Thanks so much for listening.
Bye-bye.
