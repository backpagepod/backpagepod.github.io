Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello Matthew, how did you find Nosferatu? Was it a Nosferatu or a Yesferatu for you? Sorry, a lot of people have made that joke, but I've seen your letterbox score, I know the answer, but still.
I am thinking of tweaking that up a half a star. It was a big no from me, and for the worst reason imaginable, just found it really boring. I just kept sitting there turning to Catherine, being like, oh god, and she was asleep at one point.
So, which has never happened before. I was in for the first 25 minutes, and once Nosferatu was revealed, and then loads of people started talking in rooms, I was so, so out. Good craft, but I didn't think it had anything going for it.
But I am very much in the minority on this. You had a better time, right?
I did. A one and a half stars was harsh, I thought.
I was really cross. I felt like I had wasted my evening. So it was like a fuck you.
But I am willing to boost it to two stars.
That's very good of you. I thought it had a little bit of momentum, actually. And so I didn't ever feel bored in the way that you said you were.
I actually, I felt like I was in lockstep with it most of the time. It was never really that scary. And there are limitations to what the story can give you, I think, in 2025, but people feel differently about this.
I think very ornately presented versions of classic stories in that fashion, horror stories in that fashion are quite boring. I'd have rather, I still rather watch something like Barbarian that's a bit different or interesting than, oh, it's that thing that's not that scary and that you know the exact story of isn't this exciting. And it's not really.
I mean, the lighthouse is exciting. This is not that exciting by comparison.
I guess with the lighthouse, you don't know what's going to happen. Its original story, it's more of a dread thing. I just, lighthouse, all these films up to this point have had like weird sort of character and texture to them and a sort of sly modern humor almost, like all the weird farting in the lighthouse.
And this didn't have any of that. I thought it was very well behaved, you know, apart from like the vampire's mustache, which I guess is a bit goofy. But I wanted a bit more, like I wanted the mad, not the Renfield style character, the kind of do-lally estate agent guy.
You know, I wanted him to be 10 times crazier than he was, or something. I just didn't think he was loopy enough.
Yeah, I think I kind of agree with that. I think it's just that thing where there was maybe a few areas in which it could have been a little bit more out there and it chooses to be a bit more conservative. So yeah, you know, hey, it seems like it's making some money though, so good for him.
But yeah, I think he's made his two weakest films in a row now though. So that's kind of a bummer because of his first two films, I think have like enormous potential to them. But like you say, other people feel differently about this.
I gave it three and a half on Let's Box. I was very impressed by the visual presentation of it. And I thought the acting was pretty good overall actually, including I resented the idea that I had to watch Lily Rose Depp in that after The Idol should have deleted her career, really.
It was so it was so bad. And yet we are one of the many Nepo babies that we are stuck with. And she was perfectly fine.
And the film was perfectly fine for me, but...
And here ends Robert Eggerscourt. Our new format. Did you like it?
Eggerscourt does have a good ring to it. I mean, I can take the name and reverse engineer it into something else. Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe you turn the listeners into eggs. I'm not sure.
Something to do with Dr. Eggman?
Oh, yeah. I noticed that you did the dual blue skypost and letterboxed Dr. Eggman observation about the design of Nosferatu. And I thought, fair enough, he's got his one observation.
He's going in, you know, multi-strike. Like we use an airstrike in worms. You're like, I'm going to hit a large target area with this.
You know what I mean? As much damage as possible.
There was no appetite for it. No one gave a shit.
I enjoyed it. I thought I watched it. I thought he's correct.
You know, so, yeah, you know, no criticism from this side, Matthew. So this episode then, Games Court is back. Oh God, oh God, the pain in my side.
I almost sent you a picture earlier of Mary McDonald at the end of Donnie Darko when her son's been killed by, spoiler alert, by a piece of airplane that's traveled backwards or forwards in time through a wormhole and landed on their house. And she's just sat there smoking. I was like, I was going to be like, Matthew, this is how I feel when we make Games Court.
Just sort of like this very spaced out, sort of like morning. That's kind of how I feel about it. How do you feel about Games Court returning to it?
I get that. There was a point where I was about halfway through writing the law for Matthew Castle Eye and where I was rereading what I just read and thought, I hate this person who wrote this. So that's good.
That's how I felt too. I went a little bit too hard on my speech. There was a point where I wrote, fuck these listeners.
I just thought, I've just gone too far here. I just need to reset, calm down, and just recalibrate. I deleted that and I've got a better behaved one, and it should be all okay.
But yeah, Games Court, on it goes. So what is Games Court? Listeners buy things secondhand on eBay and other various services.
CEX, whatever you might call it, GameStop in the US, I guess. And then basically we put them in front of Judge Castle and he decides whether the listener lives or dies based on the quality of the purchase, the price of the purchase, etc. Sometimes it's just arbitrary and he kills them for a laugh.
That's fine too. It's all content basically. It is a Back Page original, and yet it is the thing that we try our best to avoid making.
And it is not a technical exercise. I say this every time. I do not have all the average pre-owned values of games.
If you are a retro enthusiast who has somehow stumbled onto this episode, this is not a technical exercise in game evaluation. This is not the antiques roadshow. I do not know what things are worth, only what I think of them, and that is entirely it.
I just want to make that clear because I'm always worried that's going to happen.
Yes, however, listeners quite enjoy it, and if you want to submit your own games, quite entries, because we do about two of these a year now on average. We used to do a few more, I think, but it takes a while to build up entries because people have to actually buy things for them. backpagegames.gmail.com would like to send us a longer entry, but we do prefer them to be slightly shorter.
There's also a Game Court Submissions channel in the Discord, which you can find in our Twitter and Blue Sky profiles. So go find that, submit your entries, and we may judge them in a future Games Court probably towards the end of the year. So he says in January, trying to put it off as long as possible.
But yeah, so it's always a bit of world building. This takes place on Matthew Castle Island, an island beyond time where conventional human rights sort of rules don't really apply. All kinds of wacky stuff happens there, Matthew.
So how are things on Castle Island these days?
Good, I've got quite a few headlines for you.
I can't wait. This is the best bit for me. I've got to do loads of reading after this.
We've just been celebrating Christmas, which means everyone's stuck with those festive music earworms. Right. Such as Andy Williams, it's the most wonderful of the-
Yes. Yeah, good. I like it.
Is it going to be a Paul McCartney one?
Yeah. Simply having a wonderful.
I knew that was coming.
Of course, Wham's Christmas.
Oh my God. Have you got a hope for the buy Paul McCartney one as well?
Oh, Jesus.
Damn it. That would have been great. Never mind.
Also on Castle Island, inspired by the Nintendo Museum, I've invested in a state-of-the-art, billion-pound museum dedicated to Games Court. You'll enter past the wall of the pulp. Every two hours, Michael Caine does a water tank dunking demonstration, and no visit is complete without seeing the actual pubes from that copy of Doom 3.
Very good, Matthew. I like that. That's two solid gags so far.
I'm having a good time.
They get worse.
Excellent. I look forward to it.
I read a headline that the traitors are back, but unfortunately I didn't read the rest of it, and so I needlessly killed 300 families in a fit of suspicion. My bad.
Good. If you watch traitors, I imagine you enjoy that joke 30% more.
That's good. Please do inform which members of the audience are meant to enjoy each joke. They need every bit of help they can get.
This is the worst one. This is the one where I wanted to end it all. While the rest of the world is going nuts for Chat GPT, we obviously don't have that here because there's no internet, but we do have Chat GBK, which is where I'll talk about Gourmet Burger Kitchen to anyone who'll listen.
How are you feeling about that closing down in Bath? Good, bad, not? Because it's been replaced, obviously, for the change.
I guess that's where this comes from. It was fine. It was fine.
Chat GPT, Chat GBK. That's where my brain was at.
Excellent. Next joke.
We've got some more to go.
Good.
Of course, due to the lack of internet on Castle Island, Rockstar have decided this is the only place safe enough to do QA testing for GTA 6 prevents all leaks. Unfortunately, Reddit did find out about this, and now people keep writing to me asking me how long to beat GTA. I'm like, what exactly are we meant to measure that in?
Bananas?
Very good, Matthew. Anymore to come? Oh, good.
We're in the sort of Elden Ring DLC by a portion of the jokes now, I think, in terms of difficulty.
Sticking with video game news. I've just had a memo saying that there will be a Dino Crisis reboot happening right now. Oh no, wait, this says Castle Island is undergoing a Dino Crisis right now.
Oh, I knew those Warsaw Raptor clones were a bad idea. Good, good. And this is the closer.
Excellent.
So brace yourself.
I believe Chris Rock does this on stage as well. This is the last joke, ladies and gentlemen.
One thing I'm really excited about this year is that Castle Island was actually the filming location for a movie that's going to be very big in 2025. It's the third instalment in a series. It's all about a deadly infection that transforms people into monsters.
I'm of course talking about Danny Boyle's 28.
Very good. I think that's the second time 28 Days Later has come up.
That's it? Oh, well, listen.
No, that's okay. It's okay. I'm one guy.
I'm out here doing my best.
I'm just one guy. I don't have a fucking team of writers.
Yeah, this is not, you know, you're not Letterman in 1998. This is not that situation. So fair enough, Matthew.
Okay. Do you know who's in the courtroom today? Have you made notes on that, Matthew?
I made a couple, but this is the bit I struggle with the most.
Okay. Well, I can always chuck a few in off the cuff. So let's see how we go.
I've got loads of pyramid heads.
Right.
I've got OG pyramid head, 2024 pyramid head. And for the kids, cute pyramid head from Konami Crazy Racers.
There's two pyramid heads in Silent Hill too, if that helps. So you can have, that's two more right there. You know, just chuck them in.
Yeah, endless pyramid heads.
Yeah, indeed. Okay.
I've got that priest in Indiana Jones played by Keith Miles.
Enrico Colantonio. Excellent. Yep.
Love that guy. Good luck, Indy.
I've got a potato faced witness from the Golden Idol Games whose hair is standing on end because they've just seen a dog burst into flames or something.
Excellent.
That's what I got.
Cool. I also see here the egg joker card from Bellatro. That's there.
Oh, the classic.
Yeah, that's good. We've got one of the racers from F-Zero here, just driving around. That's there.
We've got Daisy from the Mario games. She's just here. Gender balance.
I guess you could say that the egg has no gender. The egg is beyond gender. The egg is just an egg really, so make of that what you will.
Witnessing Golden Idol can be a lady.
Let's see. What else? I think that might be actually.
Yeah, that's how things go. Chuck in more. What other hilarious jokers would be good from Bellatro?
Any of those? You chuck in Matthew?
Last time it was Baseball Joker, which is always my go-to.
That's good.
There's that hiking looking one. What's his deal?
I can't remember.
He's got a rucksack on and a hat.
We've got PS2 version of Cleon from The Warriors. He's around before he gets killed halfway through.
Oh, nice.
Then the rest of the Warriors have to go on a run, but it's specifically the PS2 renders of The Warriors. They're the ones that will be running around. They will not be higher resolution than 480i, so just keep that in mind.
Okay, Matthew, I've got my opening statement before we kick off. Just expect a similar hit rate of jokes, I would say, just setting expectations there. Okay, ladies, gentlemen, and low-res Hagrid's of the court, should I chuck a Hagrid in there?
He could be here, can't he? Welcome to late stage capitalism, or well, it would be if the concept of late was permitted here. You've heard of contempt of court, but what about contempt of defendant?
That's my USP as a lawyer. These deadbeats on trial today are the kind of parents who buy wooly Yoshi Amiibos for themselves before purchasing baby formula for their offspring. We're talking about humanity's dregs, the kind of people who get stuck in Silent Hill to be judged once they park their Peugeot 308s on the outskirts and pop into Silent Hill Ranch for a quick piss.
You just know they've got their partner's remains stored in the back seat, masked vaguely by PS2 fog. Speaking of dregs, Judge Castle, back from his Xmas break, though he keeps the concept of Christmas a secret from other residents of the island to disguise the concept of time, and also because a lot of holiday gifts are mass produced in his factories here. Hobbling on his gout foot to the stand, who's he to judge the listeners?
This is a man who's planning on playing Hope for the Future at any all upcoming funerals. This is a man who thinks the funds spent on Better Man, which converted Robbie Williams into a CG chimp, should have been spent on a CG sloth version of Randy Newman. This is a man who's hatred of Astrobot keeps him up all night, where each journalist who warded it a night or ten out of ten will one day be hunted for sport on this island.
Let's have it then. Execute some shitehawks and we'll get a few off to keep the numbers up. It's great to be back in court, and this time not for a heinous crime that I've been cancelled for on social media.
Oh, fucking hell. There you go Matthew. I hope you got at least one light laugh out of that.
I enjoyed that. I would definitely watch the Randy Newman biopic with him as Soth. I got the Randy Newman biography for Christmas.
Oh really? Is it in hardcover?
That isn't like fiction or Castle Island lore. I just want to break character. That's real Matthew speaking.
Yeah, okay. That happened. All right.
Okay. So I've got actually one thing to kick us off Matthew.
I've got a speech as well.
Oh shit. Look at you putting all the effort in. I forgot about this bit.
Go ahead.
Welcome to Castle Island, rated as Earth's 14th most welcoming dictatorship on TripAdvisor. Well, I say TripAdvisor, it's actually a Photoshopped web page to give the citizens of the island the illusion that they have internet access. Some call our island backwards.
I call it a safe haven from the digital age. Is an AI ever going to take your job on Castle Island? Never.
Can an AI pull the lever on a great pulping machine? I wish. My arm is getting knackered.
What an AI will never be able to do is assign the correct value to pre-owned video games. You know how Ghost Rider stares into people's souls and judges their entire existence? I do the same, but it's based on whether or not you paid too much for Call of Duty 2 Big Red One on PS2.
A Big Red One, incidentally, is what many of Samuel Roberts' clients turned into. If I find your purchase worthy, you will live to spend your money on a different bad game at another time. If I believe you've blown it, death will be swift and possibly over elaborate.
Do you want to bet your existence on an 80 quid version of Piglet's Big Game because you saw a funny TikTok? As I look around my courthouse, I see a lot of familiar faces all over to the pyramid heads. None more familiar than my adversary today, so-called defence attorney Samuel Roberts.
A few good men, he's not even one good man. He's the laughing stock of the legal profession, aka Shatticus Finch, aka Wally McBeal, aka Phoenix Shite, aka Lionel Putz, aka Shat Murdoch, aka Shatlock. A lot of lawyers have Matt in their name, and it only rhymes with Shat, okay?
My condolences to his clients, you're as good as dead.
Wow, that's really good. I've got to say, it's rare that I'm like, he's put in about 40% more effort than me. But in my defense, I wrote my speech in eight minutes after I was compiling entries, which took an hour and a half.
So that's why I have less law than Matthew this week. I needed to put more time into Games Court. I underestimated the task at hand.
I think Wally McBeal is excellent. Phoenix Shite, very good. Piling on the AKAs there, Matthew.
I was very impressed. So good jokes. Thank you.
Well-reviewed.
Well-reviewed in the Discord this little run. I had a good time. Okay.
Should we get to it then?
The execution method.
Oh, of course. Yeah. I've just completely forgotten how to do GameSquad, haven't I?
How will the listeners be executed?
You actually, it sounded like you almost sort of prophesied it in your intro.
Oh, right.
Because today, all the people who are found guilty are going to be dropped in a Silent Hill version of a CEX. All the boxes will be covered in rust and water damage, which actually a lot of them are in real life too. And you'll have to wade through pubeshavings and eventually cut in half by a creature pulled from my own nightmare's Toblerone head.
Very good. Okay, I like that. So is Toblerone head just going to be watched by the various pyramid heads as he does his thing?
Is that basically what's going to happen here?
Yeah, I think so. I think so. And you know, it's their day off.
Yeah, okay. Fair enough. They're just here.
This is their leisure, basically watching this.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Toblerone head. My worst nightmare, but very good as a father's day gift. My dad always gets Toblerone.
Does your dad do that?
It's a bit too...
Is that supposed to be a reference?
No, no, no, not at all. It's just a bit like, I think my dad would consider it a bit obvious if I bought him Toblerone. He's a bit more like...
Toblerone is a father's day thing. I haven't just imagined that.
No, it is. They're very much like a dad's gift sort of thing.
Dads like Toblerones.
I definitely in the 90s bought my dad Toblerone a few times, but I think the expectations have been reset by me getting them Hotel Chocolat stuff for holidays. So now they're a bit like, I want a 25-pound box of like 8 chocolates. So you're like, well, that's mental, but all right, fine, if that's what you want.
The only thing that resembles a pyramid head is a Toblerone box. That's the only confectionery that works, I think.
There's that triangle in the... Is it in Roses or Quality Street? That's a triangle, isn't it?
Oh, the giant green triangle head.
But I think Toblerone head is a lot better. It's also quite amusing. I do wonder how many pyramid head jokes we made on this podcast at this point.
Oboe Head, Pyramid Head, I'm sure there are more.
I can't help it. That guy's fully infiltrated pop culture. He's just there.
He's too familiar now. Ever since they put him in that GBA card game, parodying him became ripe. It's not like you see people making memes out of the figure in the red coat in Don't Look Now.
Do you know what I mean? People treat that character with real respect, I think, and reverence.
Does it have a clear name? Pyramid Head is very easy to say, and that's exactly what it is.
Yeah, I don't know what her name is.
It's a real coat.
Just not the child, basically. But I would say that's a figure comparable to Pyramid Head as a scary icon of media. But no one's out there making...
Actually, no, that's not true. I saw an action figure, a joke action figure of that character. So maybe that character isn't it.
They haven't Funko'd it, have they?
I don't think there's a Funko of that one to date, but who knows? Maybe things are getting thin over there. They need to go into Rosemary's baby.
You know, like 70s prestige horror basically. Right then, let's get this over with. Lots of entries here.
I have to do lots of reading, so I do apologize. And when I copy and paste things out of the Discord, it's a fucking formatting nightmare. So that makes it harder to read as well.
This is actually just a little anecdote to start with Matthew. It's not quite an exhibit, but I thought it was quite funny. Not quite an exhibit, but in year eight, I bought San Andreas on PS2 for £2.95 from a dodgy independent game shop.
It froze whenever you went to Las Venturas, so I couldn't finish it. I kept that a secret and sold it to a friend for £4. Went back to the shop to buy another copy to find it had shut down and my mother wouldn't buy it for me from the nearest game station.
So I saved the breakaway bars from my lunchbox for two weeks and traded them for my old copy back. That's from Martin. And then Martin then goes to point out that because breakaway bars are no longer available for sale, they actually sell for quite a lot of money on eBay, so I believe that's the case.
So yes, there you go, Matthew. Just sort of wetting your appetite for what's to come, really. Any thoughts there?
Well, he bought a broken version of a game with something which, unbeknownst to him, would become a precious commodity. You know, I mean, the guy who gave away a fortune in breakaway bars, that's a heartbreaker. It's a bit like me wishing I'd invested in future shares like 15 years ago and could have basically just retired now.
Yeah, well, we didn't see e-coms coming, did we, Matthew? We didn't see SSD deals coming.
No, and no one saw the death of breakaway coming either. The financial analysts were slow on that one too.
Yeah, Pacta. I didn't see here Pacta going or, what's it? Harding Rolls, Piers Harding Rolls.
Piers Harding Rolls. He's given breakaway an eat rating. He says, eat, eat, eat.
This wouldn't have been a problem from Piers Tubby Rolls. He would have been on this. No problem.
Oh yeah. Anyway, okay.
I should have been on this. I don't believe that anyone's paying big money for fetid breakaways.
They were very mediocre, like biscuits, sort of. There are loads of things that do similar things. I don't really get that, but anyway, I thought that was good, Matthew.
On with the entries.
Yeah, on with the misery.
Exhibit A, this is from Stefan, who's at Slowest Bro on various social media platforms. Hey lads, months ago, I had an entry where I had Summer Night Swordcraft Story 1 and 2 for the GBA purchased for $200 each, and if I recall, my judgment was postponed pending my reasoning behind the purchase. Honestly, it was two things.
One, that they were odd, rare games I had never heard of till 2024, which lends them a very alluring mystery. Two, they sound like games I would have been obsessed with as a teenager with my GBA back in the day. For what it's worth, I finished the first one since sending in that entry and it was a great time.
Incredibly 7 out of 10 game. Looking forward to the second. Not much of a case if you ask me.
If it makes the judgment any easier, here's some more potential kindling for the fire. Legacy of Cain, Soul Reaver, PS1, 2880. Love this as a kid.
I'm going to do a full playthrough of the series. Now, I will point out Matthew, this is before they announced the remaster. Legacy of Cain, Soul Reaver 2, PS2, 2997.
Again dollars there. Legacy of Cain, Defiance, Xbox, 1799. Devil May Cry 2, PS2, $15.
Bracket screw up on 1 and 3, and always avoided 2, but now I want to see for myself why I got kicked in by critics. Well, you could have got that in the HD collection and saved yourself about 10 quid there. Shite, Devil May Cry 2.
It's fucking rubbish. It's the first one I played in that series. It's the worst one.
Thoughts Matthew?
I mean, it's 200... Was it 200 for the individual games?
Yeah, 200 plus each.
Each?
Yeah.
I mean, that's a lot for a 7 out of 10. Yeah. I kind of buy the whole...
These have the kind of shitty names of the kind of things I used to like. You know, I do buy that, you know, but I just think it's a lot of money for like a nearly fine time.
Yeah.
Like, if you came out the other end going, this was now one of my favourite video games, then I'd probably think differently. But, you know, I mean, you know, fair play for getting back to us. Like, he could have just gone on...
I guess he was on bail. He could have just like, legged it, but he didn't. He stayed, he faced the music, and unfortunately, he is banished to Silent Hill CEX.
Yeah, Toblerone Head is coming for him. Yeah, and it's the other world version of Silent Hill. Sort of like, textures.
So it's extra grimy in there, Matthew, and horrible.
Oh, it's extra grimy. And CEX is like, pretty grimy to begin with, so...
Yeah, it's not ideal. Is there a lot of fog in there as well? Is it hard to see?
Is it sort of like, thick with fog, or...?
Yeah, but it's like a sort of deodorant fog. It's like links.
Well, that's nothing like the real CEX, is it? That's, if anything, it's got the opposite problem. Okay, good.
Love to make jokes about CEX.
Right for Barry. If anyone is listening to this from CEX, you provide a great service. Sorry, this wasn't intended as a dig.
Okay, good. Yeah, I will say, if you are listening from CEX, I have a moderately fine time in there. So if you'd like to sponsor us, get in touch.
Okay, I feel like they should sponsor Games Court particularly. This is like a good bit of branding for them.
They must have a product manager out there who's like, not really, because there's lots of people going, I bought something at CEX and now I'm like, I'm going to murder you.
It's a fair play.
It sends quite a mixed message.
Fair play. So that's guilty, right, Matthew?
Yeah.
Okay, good. Yeah.
The classic, yeah, yeah, yeah, as judges always say.
Yeah, get them out of here, get them out of here. Exhibit B from Reese Britain. I like this entry.
Hi, Sam and Matthew. Wanted to submit an entry as I believe it's an area that has not been covered yet in your courtroom. A year or two ago, I started repurchasing my PlayStation 2 collection.
I only have one game up for judgment, which is one of my favorite games of all time, Final Fantasy X, which I purchased for around four pounds. So far, nothing unusual and quite a common purchase. However, after receiving my purchase, I discovered something was missing.
No, not the manual, but the Beyond Final Fantasy DVD, which I'm sure Samuel will remember and explain, so I don't have to. Annoyed that my copy didn't include the bonus DVD, which is highlighted with a nice gold sticker on the cover, I might add. I decided to repurchase FFX again, this time with the bonus DVD for again around four pounds.
I now have two copies of FFX, as selling my first copy isn't worth the postage stamp and packaging costs, so it's currently sat behind the rest of my PS2 collection. I haven't watched the DVD yet, however, in my defense, I remember watching it back in the day and would like to one day watch it again, so I'm glad that I have the option to do so. Also, I believe that if you're going to buy any old games back, then buy them complete with manual and any additional content, otherwise, just buy them digitally.
Before Judge Castle was quick to judge me for not watching the bonus DVD yet, please think of The Shoe Puff. Thank you. Side note, thank you very much for all the work you put into both the podcast.
I discovered your podcast less than a year ago, and I've recently caught up with the latest episodes and now subscribed to Excel Patreon for more great content. Well, that won't get you off here because it's a different fictional reality to regular Back Page.
Yes, unfortunately, that's Matthew Castle and I'm Judge Castle, who has never made a podcast in my life.
Those two men have never met either, as far as I know, so that's not ideal.
This Judge Castle is only 13 stone.
He looks like NGamer circa 2008's Matthew Castle. He's a beanpole, basically.
What a dreamboat.
Yeah, this DVD is, if I remember it, it's a very superficial selection of making of content. It wasn't really in depth. In fact, I had this when I borrowed it off of a friend when I first played FFX, watched it all, and then when I went to buy the Platinum Edition, which didn't have the DVD, I didn't really mind losing it at all.
To me, it felt like a pretty lousy exchange for the fact that people had to wait months and months after the US to actually get FFX here. So I don't think it was really much cop, Matthew. So I also could just watch all the same videos on YouTube, so I don't really get it.
There is something very low-stakes about, like fundamentally, the anecdote is I paid £8 to not watch a DVD.
Basically, that's the whole thing.
Like either of those things is not, like, in and of itself, particularly interesting.
No, no offence. That's a boring entry, that.
Like if it was £100, then I'd be like, wow, okay, like there's some crazy stakes here. The thing I do wonder, and I've often wondered about many of these entries where people are like, I bought this because it meant so much to me, is why they got rid of it in the first place.
Yeah.
Because I understand if something has that level of meaning, you know, we've all done it. I know I've definitely sold some things which have gone on to regret, but not my all time favourite. It's not things that meant I had an emotional connection to.
So it's hard to, you know, I can't start judging people on their past selves because I haven't been doing that up until now. So it would be unfair, but... Oh, I don't know.
An eight pounds, it's kind of harmless, but I almost want to say guilty just for a lot of wasting the court's time.
Yeah, I also feel like I wasted my larynx reading all that out. That was like a fucking life story. And it's just...
And now my throat is exhausted and I've got so many entries to go. So on that basis alone, I say guilty. But I don't think there's anything wrong with only two copies of FFX.
I've done it myself. So, yeah.
I mean, like... Guilty? Thanks for saying, Shoe Puff.
Thanks for trying to talk to me on terms I don't understand. That is the only bit of Final Fantasy X that sticks with me. Brutal.
What an absolute dunk on that game.
Yeah. But yeah, let's say guilty. Off to CEX with you where maybe you'll find another copy of Final Fantasy X with the DVD intact.
How quickly do you think FFX will go in the PS2 redraft, Matthew? Do you think that's on the cards fairly early?
It's an important one for you.
Yeah. But then we actually did this last time. I didn't actually pick it straight away.
I waited quite a long time to pick it. I thought there were other things to go. I'm picking different angles that have attacked to the last PS2 draft.
So, yeah, we'll see.
Yeah, it's weird, because I've been thinking, again, this isn't Judge Castle, this is Matthew Castle speaking.
Thank you.
I keep thinking about their Ash and Dave of it.
Yeah.
They are also both quite weird in their tastes.
Quite unknowable, yeah.
Yeah, so it's not like, oh, there's two more news in the mix, because that definitely isn't what it is.
No, it's not. No.
So I actually don't, you know, I don't almost feel more comfortable with, like, if it was me versus three Samuel Roberts.
You don't expect.
Like, you do one of those JRPG spells where you create two clones of yourself in a boss battle. Like that, I'd be fine with. It's like, well, I'll just whack the two clones a little bit and then realise which one's the real one and go for him.
Like, that's the classic tactic. That's what I plan to deploy. But it's not like that at all, because, you know, they are not clones of you, Ash and Dave.
No, it could be that we get to pick one and Dave's like, I'm taking Lord of the Rings Return of the King for license game.
I mean, I'm fully expecting that kind of thing to happen.
I really hope so, because I think it would be great fun. So yeah, we'll see. Okay, back to Games Court then.
That's a bit like, you know, when boxers do a little bit of stuff in the build up to a match, they kind of weigh in and then they spit on each other or whatever it is boxers do. That's a bit like that, just wetting the appetite.
Or that bit in the Simpsons boxing episode where Dredric Tatum is chatting to Charlie Sheen. It's a bit of that vibe to it. Okay, Exhibit C from Luke Summerhaze.
Everything from the Simpsons.
That's all I've got. I don't have a proper cultural dialect like you, Matthew. Okay, Exhibit C, Luke Summerhaze.
I think I've tried posting one or all of these before but missed the appropriate dates. I'll try again. When I moved to Japan back in 2018, I had very unrealistic expectations about the pace at which I would learn the language and subsequently bought a copy of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on GBA to study with.
I didn't have a GBA on me but had my eye on buying a micro to play it on. Oh, that was only about 1600 yen. But when I first tried to submit this story, I had not even tried playing it.
Three years later or so, I went to a Nagoya branch of Super Potato with the intention of buying that GBA micro. I walked in and they had the purple one I wanted and the silver one for 8,000 yen. They also have a nice Famicom edition one for 15,000 yen.
I asked for the purple one. Oh, but the A button doesn't work? Okay, I'll take the silver one.
Oh, it doesn't come with any wires? I guess I'll take the Famicom one. They absolutely saw me coming.
I eventually played Final Fantasy on it. The Japanese is hard. In 2022, I visited the UK for the first time since moving to Japan and went to JC's kitchen on a trip in which Samuel saw me but didn't say hello.
Just prior, my friend Amelia told me she had never played a Pikmin game so I decided to buy a copy of Pikmin 1 for her, but I went into CX and they wanted 50 quid. Fucking hell, CX, come on, it's only Pikmin. When I got back to Japan and saw a copy for 500 yen, I bought it out of spite and I never got around to playing it in Japanese before the two games were released on Switch and I just played that version again instead.
I mean, there's a lot of spite purchases going on here. I think that…
And there's spite towards you which I like. That guy throws his own defense attorney under the bus for snubbing him at a food stall.
I didn't snub him and I wasn't at the food stall. I passed him at… I think it was outside Kotai on that.
To be fair, I will say again, not Judge Castle, I often see you in town. I see you a lot more in town than you think I do.
That's because I'm not wearing my glasses.
You walk with such purpose. We have walked past each other several times and I've waved and you've not seen me.
Oh, shit.
You are just a very focused walker, is my, at least I hope it's that. Either that or you're a very rude bastard.
No, is it not clear that I'm very fond of you at this point?
Yeah, no, but when you've got your headphones in, you are like... Because the couple of times I have caught you, you've been quite surprised. It's like I've broken you from your walking trance.
Oh, okay, interesting.
You're like... I'm back in reality.
Yeah, it's a bit of... I'm trying to get... There are some days where that's my main exercise is doing that power walk at lunchtime and then going back, but it's not an anti-castle act and plus my eyesight is a bit fucked.
I would say to any listener who feels like you've tried to pass them, you know, it's nothing personal.
Well, a bit of context here. I didn't know it was a listener, but there was someone who locked eyes with me a bit longer than a stranger would and as I walked past them, and then that person later posted in the Discord a picture of them next to JC's kitchen eating some bubble and squeak or whatever. And then I realized it was the same person and I was like, oh, I walked past you earlier.
I wasn't being rude. I didn't know who the fuck it was, you know? This is not someone I know.
You mean you don't know every listener?
No, not...
You haven't stalked every listener?
No, sadly not. It's not really my vibe stalking, so it's tough.
Yeah.
Yeah, so anyway...
Yeah, back to the issue.
I like those GBA versions of the FF games. I like that they did those. They were quite nice.
Some of the sound was fucked on the SNES conversions, but it's quite cool that they did FF1 and FF2 on GBA. If you can't play it and you're going to study with it, I mean, that's just bollocks, isn't it? I don't think that's actually ever going to happen.
It's not a good idea.
Again, I'm meant to be defending you here, but you did throw me under the bus there with the whole I mean, I don't really have experience with very early Final Fantasy. I just, you know, they're so sort of stripped back and bare compared to, you know, what the series becomes. I do sort of struggle with them.
You know, I get their importance, but so I mean, they're not that story heavy, are they? They're quite...
No, it takes until 4 to get a story in it.
Yeah, so it's not like you're missing out on loads of stuff. Oh!
Just good to have, I think, but not in Japanese, if you don't know Japanese personally.
Yeah, he didn't say if he eventually did play him, did he?
Let's see. The Japanese is hard, basically, was all we got for that one.
Right. Well, listen, let's go guilty with this one. Yep.
You've been to Bath CX, you can see that 50 pound copy. It's the Bath CX that I'm visualizing when I came up with the punishment for this week's episode. So you'll know it.
If anything, you're already familiar with it. So you've got some idea of the layout and you might be able to survive against Tobro and head a bit longer. I'd hide behind the pillar by the front door.
Yeah.
Just like a great line of sight.
Put your hand into a hole to retrieve an item and then realizing it's full of pubes. Just not ideal, but that's how it goes.
And then a third-party GameCube controller comes out and you're like, Oh God, there's no hole here is going to give me what I want.
With a turbo button on it. Yeah, good stuff. All right.
Three Guilties ends so far. Exhibit D, ThrillX. This is a really good one.
This is a long but an enjoyable Games Court entry with you. I've had a bunch of light gun games and Donkey Konga. I've wanted to replay for years now.
So back in 2022, I decided to go for a 32-inch Sony Trinitron I saw for free on Facebook Marketplace as a TV, a CRT, I believe. Couldn't believe my luck at the non-existent price, but it was over an hour's drive to Southend to pick it up. Still worth it.
When I got there, I asked the guy selling it why it was free, and he told me that it belonged to his recently deceased mother, and he just wanted to clear her old house out. I should have known then that the TV was cursed, or maybe haunted. When I got home, my wife was not pleased at the size of it, and was even less pleased when we both nearly put our backs out, lugging it up the stairs and into my games room.
Honestly, it's the heaviest thing ever. It has legs with glass shelves attached. Took us absolutely ages due to having to stop every two steps for a sweaty cry, and probably nearly ended our marriage right there and then.
Regardless, I was now ready to fire up my PS2 and some time crisis too, except my G-Con 2 was being all weird and glitchy when I had to calibrate it. Assuming it had just somehow broken in the many years since I last used it, I went to eBay and bought a replacement for £26.99. But that didn't work either.
Now knowing it may have just been the model of gun not compatible with my TV, I returned it to the seller, did some research and bought something called a High Clear 100Hz Light Gun on eBay for £37. Obviously, that didn't work either. Yet more research revealed that the precise model of my CRT is apparently 120Hz and won't work with any light guns at all.
I returned that gun too and am left with a high quality but basically useless dead woman's CRT that neither my back nor marriage will be able to survive moving out of my room. I think I understand now why that old lady died with it still in her house. I mean, that's good, isn't it?
You gotta say.
That's gold. That's got everything you want. All kinds of little character details, like the emotional toil, like the argument in your life.
I'm there. I can see that. Like we've all had those little arguments that feel like this could be the one over something stupid.
That's, yeah, very, yeah, I like that. That's a great entry. Like that you're having to buy endless fake guns.
Like that looks weird, like fake guns coming to your house. The judge is satisfied with this entry.
Yeah, me too. This is what Games Court's all about, people.
Yeah, this is the stuff.
We're having a good time. The TV is free, but the cost is like a Twilight Zone-esque kind of cost, isn't it?
I mean, surely there's something you can do with it. Like I'm often, you know, Digital Foundry, every like year or so will do a, you know, on the secret pleasures of CRTs. And you go, hmm, I wonder and then you think, no, no, I probably shouldn't.
I love a good CRT.
But for free, but then it doesn't really work.
I see this works with PS2 games fine, though.
Yeah, I want to, you know, I feel like the it being free, it is cursed. I feel like the cursed object is punishment enough.
Yeah.
I don't need to send you to, like, I don't think the punishment going to a Silent Hill version of Seeing X is more cursed than being in your house with that television. So I feel like you've suffered enough.
Yeah, I look forward to it. It'd be funny if a year from now, someone gives us this exact story, except a guy died with this. They say a guy and his wife died.
And this TV, this is all we got left, basically. That would be quite a spooky coda to this. That said, ThrillX, I hope you don't die.
I hope you don't die.
I'm surprised a cursed TV hasn't been done as a J or K horror film that I'm aware of, you know?
Have you noticed there's a big spate of horror films now, though, that are like Y2K or We Time Travel back to 2002? Have you noticed that's a growing thing in horror? I hate seeing that.
It makes me feel very ancient, but also like it's just Gen Z people going, eww, the noughties basically, which I can't be dealing with, you know?
There's a bit of that in Better Man as well, not a horror film, but...
Yeah, a little bit. Did you feel very...
Oh, look how weird things were in 1998.
Yeah, I felt you might end up being going out with Nicole Appleton, who knows what might happen, all kinds of wacky stuff. I felt very, it was very us coded when he had to put on that jacket that he had to like suck air out of to make himself look thinner. Matthew, I found that felt big, too giant men coded to me.
Anyway, yes, we talked about that quite a lot in this podcast now. Right, not guilty then.
That was a great entry.
Yeah.
Listeners, I know not everyone has a story like that, but that's really what we want.
Yeah, that's the dream. If every, we do Games Court four times a year if they were all that good. You know what I mean?
Anyway, onto another shit entry. No, I'm only joking.
No, no, they've all been good so far.
No, we appreciate them. Okay. Exhibit E from Tanner.
Every time I drive north through my state of South Carolina, I stop by a great board game store that also sells used games. Here's the haul I got today all on GameCube. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, $19.
There must be something in the air at the moment about this fucking drum games on GameCube.
People know that Nintendo, deep down, they know Nintendo are making a new Donkey Kong 3D game for Switch 2 launch. That's what people are sensing in themselves.
In the air, yeah. So that's $19 a Jungle Beat. Brackets have held onto the bongos all these years.
I wonder if those are the ones that Amy Winehouse signed. Who can say? NBA Street Volume 3 disc only, $23.
I think these were pretty well regarded back in the day, the disgeneration of EA Sports Big Games, he says, doing research on SSX3 for the next week's PS2 draft. Adama, $25, cursed GameCube classic. Soul Calibur 2, $28.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 disc only, $12. There's a theme of strange Nintendo character crossovers. If they had SSX on tour, I could have completed the set.
What's the crossover in that one, Matthew?
Well, one of them's got Mario in it, right?
Oh, right, really?
Snowboarding, yeah.
Oh, I didn't know that. Okay, interesting. I knew about the other ones, but yeah.
Okay. All right, Matthew. So those are your games.
They're all GameCube games, and they're all under $30. They're not necessarily the tastiest GameCube purchasers, but they're not horrible either. What do you think?
Yeah. I mean, just to say, it was Donkey Kong Jungle Adventures rather than Konga.
Jungle Beat.
Jungle Beat, sorry, yes, Jungle Beat, rather than the Konga game.
That's correct, yeah.
I mean, that is great, and if you can play it with the bongo drums, that still holds up as an experience.
Loving low bar for entry there. If you have these 20-year-old bongo drums, you can enjoy this game.
Yeah. I quite like the angle of these are the games which have weird crossovers, because so many people who weren't ever going to enjoy Soul Calibur, bought Soul Calibur because of Link going, Oh, well, if Link's saying it, I must like it. And no, I don't read it.
I did not.
That led to loads of cursed characters, sort of like cameos, which they still kind of have in those games, really, don't they? Just people turning up out of other games and stuff, but...
Yeah, there was some that was like Yoda and Darth Vader and Spawn.
Yeah. I mean, Spawn was the worst one, but that was the Xbox one, wasn't it?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
I don't hate any of these games, and those prices don't seem like crazy to me.
What if Adama came with the microphone? Is that what you need for it?
Yeah. You sort of shout orders into it. I mean, that's, again, don't know the price of these things.
So I was about to say, that sounds reasonable, but that's based on nothing. So I'm not going to say that. Like, that feels like quite a good price for something I would deem like a real oddity.
Yeah.
And the fact that you bought it from not the odd, you know, it isn't a traditional game shop. You know, it's some pre-owned games in a board game shop. Maybe they didn't really know what they had.
Yeah, I think I'm going to let this one go, you know?
Yeah, I think that's moderately fine. Not too bad. Okay, not guilty.
Next one's nice and short, Matthew. This is from Ryan Plugs. Okay, just made a Quintessential Games Court purchase.
1999 for a Steam Controller in 2024. Interesting, Steam Controller. So yeah, a controller that was made by Valve, I think for the first generation of...
It works with any PC, but the idea is you could wirelessly use a Steam Controller with your PC, plug it into your TV, and they had a bunch of Steam branded Steam boxes, I believe they were called, or Steam Machines, I can't remember now.
Steam Machines, I think.
That's right, and I don't know if many of them actually ended up coming out, but in some ways, I think they were maybe about 10 years too early, because now I think if they did a standalone Steam PC for your living room, I think that would actually do incredibly well, and people would be well up for it based on the Steam Deck reception. However, I was never really that into this controller. It did allow you to play some PC games in ways that you couldn't on console, i.e.
you could map any mouse control to the two trackpads. However, I always found those trackpads a little fiddly and never quite the same.
Do you have much interaction with the trackpad equivalents on Steam Deck?
A little bit, and I don't like using them, because you only really use them for mouse and key, sorry, mouse kind of control. But generally speaking, everything I play on there already has controller support, so you don't need to use them. What about you?
Because I think they feel alright under the hands, but they're never that precise to me.
No, I always feel like I'm missing something, or I'm not willing to put in the time to get used to them. That time is just too long. I remember when these pads originally came out, picking one up for just a couple of minutes and thinking, well, that's a disaster.
I want nothing to do with it. But you do hear people advocating for it as a good middle ground, but I don't know, it just requires a thumb discipline I don't have.
It was quite interesting. Probably the most prominent game I played with a Steam controller from start to finish was Max Payne, the original Max Payne. And it was hard, but not impossible.
It wasn't quite as easy as just using a mouse to aim in bullet time, but you could do everything on it. And it was more precise than using the Xbox controller for Max Payne 2 or 3 on Xbox. It is more precise, but it was also unwieldy enough that I never really wanted to play another game like it in that way.
So yeah, it's a true niche. It's got big PS Vita interface energy. You know what I mean?
Like the back touch pad. It's like, did we need this? SimulaVoy.
Yeah. Yeah. I feel like these things came and went for a reason.
Yeah, I agree.
And like, it is a novelty, but it's quite a cursed object. I think it does have to be guilty, I'm afraid.
Okay, guilty.
Good luck fighting off ToeBroneHead with that trackpad.
Very good. Okay. Exhibit G.
This is on Joey Jojo Jr. First post in the Discord here. Following from the Fantastic PS1 Draft episode, yeah, some of these are from a while ago, all right? I wanted to try playing Einhander, a big Sammy pick, that game rules, I played that over Christmas.
I bought a Japanese copy off eBay for £35 expecting it to work on my PS3, given I had played US and Japanese PS3 games on it before. I was unaware, however, that PS1 and PS2 games are still region locked when playing on PS3. Undeterred, I decided to buy a Japanese PS2 Slim from eBay for £33, with the intention of using a PS2-to-HDMI adapter to play on my TV.
Annoyingly, because PS1 games output in 240p and modern TVs are not built to properly display these signals, the TV does not display any video or audio. Reading up further, it appears the cheapest solution to this would be to buy a different PS2-to-HDMI cable for £50 that supposedly works with PS1 games too. Given I'm 68 pounds deep and not even seen the title screen of Einhander yet, I'm not sure if I should skim up the venture.
I do intend to look into other PS1 or PS2 Japanese-only games if I can get this bloody setup working, if that helps my case at all. There's a follow-up later on, Matthew. Took a punt on a £30 cable from Amazon that had some decent reviews and thankfully is now working.
All in around £100 for the PS2 cable and Einhander, but thankfully the game is a banger. Just need to find some more Japanese-exclusive PS1 and PS2 games to make the investment truly worth it. There was a link to the cable there if people were interested, but whatever, we can't do URLs on fucking podcasts.
Einhander then, Matthew, and I would say the time lost here is the real price that was paid more than the £100. What do you think?
I don't know Einhander, so I can't speak to that part of it, which is the crucial part of it. In your heart of hearts, putting aside the animosity between defence attorney and judge, £100 to play Einhander, yeah or nay?
I wouldn't pay it, for the simple reason of it's quite easy, or so an older boy tells me, to emulate this game on various handheld devices that are available for less than £100. And this with save states is probably a more viable and convenient way to play it these days than playing this particular version, at least until Square makes it available commercially again, which it currently is not available in that form. But £100 Matthew, I would not spend it myself.
It's a tricky one this, because I completely hear everything you're saying, but I also know the madness of there's one thing I want to try, and then you end up going down the rabbit hole of, well, I bought this, but then I need this and I need this. And this is what happened to me when I wanted to watch the Japanese adaptations of some of the crime novels I've read, and I bought DVDs and then had to buy a special Blu-ray, chipped Blu-ray player in order to play them. And that itself has been kind of tricky.
And now the thing that I originally bought it to play is just being shown on Netflix anyway. So it's like, well, that was a waste of time. So I do sympathise with people who kind of commit to the bit, but that is quite a lot of money for one experience.
And so, you know, as a warning to others, I say guilty.
That's good. Just get it off the streets, basically. That's the philosophy there.
Okay. Very good, Matthew. Nice short entry here from JBD.
A very discord inside baseball entry. I bought a PS3 with six games, Nino Kuni, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus HD Collection, Odin Sphere, Dark Souls, Burnout Paradise, Yakuza 3, for £19.19 including postage. I won't say which lovely discord I bought it from, but I think you can probably figure out when I say they shipped it with a Nintendo HDMI cable.
I can work that out and I'm not giving them the pleasure of reading out their name on the podcast yet again, Matthew. So I will leave that alone. But I don't think you can really argue with that.
That's a very good price. I'm surprised you're getting out of the house for that price. I feel like eventually, just Icon and Shadow of the Colossus, that will eventually be worth a bit of money because Ico has never been re-released.
But what do you think?
Yeah. That was with the console as well. Yeah.
So you just got that to play. How much was it?
£19.19.
I mean, that's very cheap.
Yeah. And it even comes to the HDMI cable, which Sony would not give you.
Sony wouldn't do that for you.
No, they certainly didn't in 2007.
Yeah. I think that, I can't really, it feels that there should be a but, but there isn't really. That's just good value.
Even just for those games, I'd say that's fine. But if you've got the machine to play them, that can play other games. I would rather spend £19.99 to get a PS3 sent to my front door than have to go and look for my PS3 somewhere in the house.
Yeah, that's fair. That is funny. I'm going to just have a quick look at what Odin Sphere on PS3 goes for, because I imagine that costs a little bit of money.
Yeah, see, to buy that alone.
Please don't try and add actual nutritional value to this episode.
Let's just get it over with so we can get on with our Sundays. That's Matthew's policy of Games Court.
Come on, let's see what it is.
It goes for about £20 plus, so even just that alone. There you go, then. That's it.
That's pretty good.
What a generous discorder.
Indeed, yes, and it's similar price to the Ico Shad the Colossus collection, really. This is a good lesson about not being too nice to strangers because they might grift you to get a good deal, Matthew. Okay, not guilty there, JBD.
Very good. Next up then, Exhibit I. This is from Egmund.
Hello, Games Court. Last week, I decided to check out a local collectible shop that I've been curious about. They had a small cabinet of games and one in particular caught my eye.
Wario Blast on the Game Boy. I asked the clerk to take out the cabinet so I could look at it. It was in good condition with a manual and box, but the price was 99 Australian dollary dues.
After saying I would think about it, they quickly offered to discount it to 80 dollary dues, about 42 pounds at the time of writing, which after doing a cursory eBay search, I determined was still a bit on the higher side, but at least I was able to see how good the condition is, so I decided to buy it. Here is my long-winded rationale. I like Wario and I like Bomberman.
I also have both a Game Boy Color and a GBA SP at my mum's, under 30-minute drive from my place, so I do intend to grab one of those and play it, eventually. Haven't played it yet though, Matthew. Not too familiar with Wario Blast.
Is this something that you've come across in your various writing about Nintendo stuff?
It's just Wario Bomberman. I think it is.
It's literally, I think, a crossover between the two. It's actually got Bomberman in it, hasn't it? So, yeah.
I mean, I don't know, 80 Australian dollars.
Yeah. For a game, I feel like...
Hasn't played it.
Yeah. There's loads of ways to get a Bomberman based experience. You have to really like Wario, I think, to take the plunge of this.
I would say just think with Game Boy, it's so easy. You know, you can just play those all in your web browser these days. And it's what it looks like.
No.
No. I agree. Okay.
Sorry.
That's all right. You have to apologize. This is your courtroom.
So, guilty it is, Matthew. Okay.
But I'll make it like a Silent Hill version of an Australian. Do they have CEXs in Australia? You know, an Australian equivalent.
Yeah.
You know, just so that you're on some kind of familiar ground.
Yeah. Okay. Exhibit J is from Effie.
I, after paying a fortune for Analog Pocket and working my way through my old favourites, have started scooping up cheap Japanese Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. My Japanese is so-so, enough to complete Wario, but I failed Sakura Wars' quick-fire quiz about how to brush my teeth and got told I was a bad date. So, we've got a few entries here, Matthew.
They're all very cheap, actually. Final Fantasy Legend 1, 2 and 3, £5 each. Wario Land 3, £8.
One Piece, Maburoshino, Grand Line Bukenki, £5.80. Probably butchered the reading of that, sorry about that. Sakura Wars for the Game Boy somehow, £5.80.
Finally, cave and bought Dragon Warrior 3 Game Boy Color in English for £35. Christ alive. Those are all the entries, Matthew.
I thought none of that seemed that egregious until you got to the Dragon Warrior 3 one, and that just sounds like a very pricey curio to me. I assume Dragon Warrior 3 is the game that's been ported to new formats this year? Is it not the same thing?
I don't really know.
Is that how they link up? I can never remember which one's which, if it's Final Fantasy where they're all out of whack, or if it's Dragon Quest where they're all out of whack.
Yeah. I think this is the version that just got re-released, basically. But obviously, it's the Game Boy kind of version.
Yeah. I don't know. It's weird with the Game Boy.
I just don't know if I have in myself enough affection for it. If it goes back just a little bit too far for me, yeah, this feels a little bit a little bit to it. Like I can't ever imagine like buying an old Game Boy game in the way that like I could imagine and have bought Game Boy Advance games say.
But that's me. That's got nothing to do with this guy.
Well, you kind of have this a little bit with N64 games, I feel as well where you're like, that's just a touch far back for me to get super sort of like nostalgic enough to go back and play something, want to own it. That's not something you've really done with N64 either.
No, but that's yeah. But then I know that there are some people in the nuts, this stuff and want to own as much of it and all of it. I just think if you have any interest in it, there are so many ways of playing that stuff that isn't having to buy it.
Yeah. And you'll get out your system really quickly as well in most cases.
Yeah. It's wonderful about James Bond 007 here, you know?
Yeah, the true classic.
The classic of the platform.
Yeah. It's evident from the fact that we've not done our gayboy draft yet still, you know?
Yes. Yeah. I'm going to say guilty.
Maybe people will moan about that, but I'm going to say I'm going to say guilty based on my own value system.
Fair enough, Matthew. That is what we're here. That's what the listeners tune in for ultimately is your value system.
Guilty. Damn, a lot of guilties today. Tough time for the listeners.
Exhibit K, Stu Cumber. I've been nostalgic for late 2000s games when I was in my first year of university and I've bought some absolute seven out of tens in recent months. Magin and the Forsaken Kingdom for £13.24 on Xbox 360.
Again, with quite broken brightness slash gamma. That makes it quite hard to see anything. Remember Me for £15 on PS3.
Turns out it's on PS Plus at one point and I had it in my PS3 library anyway. Great soundtrack though. Command and Conquer the first decade for £13.99, despite owning it on EA App and the remasters of the good games being on the EA App.
Hey, they didn't do Red Alert 2 now, did they? That's the best one. PS2, Itoy and Itoy Play Sports for £7.50.
Never dabbled and now I have dabbled, I can confirm it's intensely garbage. Quite a big spag there, Matthew. Do you ever, are we ever familiar with Magin and the Forsaken Kingdom?
Yeah, it had like a big monster in it. I think I get a bit confused with folklore.
Yeah, it's got, it's the same developer, I believe.
Okay, right.
And it has a whiff of, we've got Fumito Ueda at home to it.
We've got Fumito Ueda at home, but he is making more games than the real Fumito Ueda, so that's got to be worth something.
The game Papo Eo seemed like a similar thing, except I think that had some kind of alcoholism sort of thing in it. I don't think this is nearly as sort of thematically in depth as that, but it's very PS3 era if you look at some shots of it, like the amount of bloom going on. Bit 6 out of 10.
I guess if you did play at the time, maybe you'd have a little bit more nostalgia for it, but certainly Edge gave it a 7, so maybe it's slightly more interesting than we're giving it credit for, but never released on PC, so it is actually trapped on consoles a little bit, and this specific generation. Okay, so there's that one. Remember Me is a bit of a weird one.
I think that might actually still be on Steam and easy to play on PC. That is a game by the Life is Strange devs, right?
Don't know. Yeah, I don't know if it was their first game, but definitely the first one I'd heard of.
Yeah, and I feel like it's a little bit of a victim of that Capcom making Western stuff and it all curdling a little bit, so people weren't really up for this when it came along, plus it was a little bit mediocre anyway. I think I played it for preview at the time and thought, there's something a little bit off about this, but I couldn't really put my finger on it. Yeah, I think with time, it probably seems more interesting from this generation.
Yeah, because they've got, like don't nod, there's almost like two strands to them. There's all the narrative adventures and then there's the sort of bits of them that makes like Remember Me and Vampire, and did they do, was Banishers of New Eden, was that them?
Yeah, I think it was.
Yeah, so like there is this sort of action RPG, but with big story beats, kind of a bit like Ninja Theory-ish, maybe, in like mix of action story stuff. Yeah! Show me a comparison.
I don't know about this. He didn't seem very enthused about his own picks.
No, but maybe that's because...
I got an iToy that was a load of shit.
Well, iToy I don't really have any truck with. I mean, it's like buying a worse version of eSports, basically, isn't it?
Yeah, we definitely played it. I don't know if we owned it or if we rented one or something, but I remember like a weekend of pretending to clean windows or whatever it was that you did in that game.
That's all the fun you can ever get out of it, basically. So it all fits inside one weekend. I had the Sega-specific collection they did and I remember doing the Virtua Fighter fighting game stuff with it and it was all right.
It was responsive enough.
Oh, I don't know about this. I don't know that Command and Conquer one at all.
That's just all of the good Command and Conquer games, basically, but I don't know.
Oh, okay. Oh, it wasn't a weird spin-off, okay.
No, the first decade is basically all of the mainline ones.
Oh, the first decade. Sorry, the way you said it, the first decade sounds like some bullshit subtitle.
Oh, right, as in like a bad kind of spin-off.
This is the coming of the first decade. I can see some like E-list actors saying that.
No, this gets you all of the good ones plus Renegade.
That makes a lot more sense.
Yeah, plus Renegade and I think also with the EA ones be in there, but most of the all the Westwood ones would certainly fit in here and Generals. Those are generally considered the best ones, so yeah. It's a bit of an unenthusiastic selection of stuff, isn't it?
It's not very interesting.
Yeah, let's...
Magin's interesting. That's the most interesting one.
It is... Nah, let's execute this guy.
Into the pub chamber you go, young man.
Into the pub chamber you shall go.
Stu Cumberg has been doomed to the pub chamber.
Has there ever been a copy of Magin in a CEX? That doesn't seem like a very CEX-y kind of game.
No, it doesn't. I mean, if I can't find 50 cent blood on the sand in there, then it feels like that's Magin. It's not going to happen.
Let's find out how much that retails for now. That really is worth not much money. You can get it from...
Oh no, it is worth quite a lot of money, actually. It's worth about 40 quid plus, because there are no copies of it around, probably.
Oh, interesting.
Yeah, but nonetheless...
Well, unfortunately, we've already sent him to hell dimensions, so...
You're in cube hell now, my friend. That's not how it was originally pitched, but yes, let's go with that.
That is part of it.
Yeah. Exhibit L. Tovfly.
Dear the jolly Judge Castle and the belligerent barrister Roberts, may I present the evidence to my defense. As video arcades are critically endangered in the UK, outside of already slightly run down arcade bars, I spent a birthday afternoon with my partner in Four Quarters, Bristol, throwing credit after credit into time crisis too, and having a whale of a time. Later on, in a few drinks in, I found myself thinking of how to recreate the experience at home.
Light gun hardware was out of the question, not being much of a collector and the rare such ancient hardware probably being more trouble than it's worth. Well, we have a previous story that confirms that, the back set up. So I turned to the only real alternative, the affordable and surprisingly extensive Wii library.
Not quite the same in terms of mechanics, cursor based rather than reacting to light pulses, say la vie, but an affable enough experience if Resi 4 has anything to show about it. So we've got Link's Awakening, sorry, no, that's not correct. Link's crossbow training with Wii Zapper, £6.
Disaster Day of Crisis, not yet played, £3.50. Sadly not compatible with the Wii Zapper. Resident Evil Dark Side Chronicles, one of Matthew's favourite games of all time, £10.
Ghost Squad, £2! Wii Play Motion, £5. Dead Space Extraction, £12.
House of the Dead, £2 and £3, £8. Decent little collection for not very much, I thought.
Yeah, you want to get House of the Dead Overkill as well, that's a fun one, I'd add that to that.
Yeah, that'd be nice. Decent little collection for not very much, I thought.
Yeah, but I mean, I'm not going to argue with that, like Ghost Squad for £2 alone is like, you know, can you even play an arcade game of Ghost Squad for £2? I don't know how much it is.
Last time I checked, they still had one in the Rundown Talkie Arcade, I sometimes go to my brother once a year, and I think it was 50p a play there.
Oh, okay, well that's four plays of that, or all the Ghost Squad you can eat at home.
And a £38 train ticket from Bristol to Talkie as well, so, you know, not ideal.
I think, I'm not going to argue with that, the only one I would put a little question mark over, I'm not a big Dead Space extraction guy.
It's a very cheap feeling getting that to me.
I just, I just thought it, it isn't one or the other, you know, it's quite slow and, you know, cinematically made. It's an even sort of fussier version of what they did with the Resident Evil Lightgun games, but, you know, those games at least had like the manic nature of the story to kind of keep them going. Darkseid Chronicles is fucking great.
Resident Evil 2 boiled down to a two hour arcade game or whatever. That just makes a huge amount of sense to me. I will always advocate for that game.
Yeah, of course, this is no way, no way is this guilty.
I don't know what that's like playing that on a HDTV these days, but that's certainly a, I guess with the Wii U, it probably works okay, but yeah, I think in general, I agree. That's a strong little selection of stuff. Those are also experiences you have no real comparison point to on the other consoles from that time.
They are, that's something that we did that other consoles couldn't do nearly as well, unless you wanted to faff with Move controllers and no one does. So yeah, okay, not guilty. Exhibit M then Matthew, some Nige.
Hello lads, Pokemon the card game, is that right? Trading card game, that's it, on Game Boy Color for 14 pounds. CX Leeds, although not the other world version with pubes in it presumably, Matthew, unbox some cosmetic damage surrounded by men of questionable character like us all.
Okay, so I didn't play this at the time. I understand that it's a pretty good translation of the original few sets of the Pokemon trading card game, which I thought was a really decent little card game in and of itself. Very quaint these days and available on the Nintendo Switch Online library, I believe, for Game Boy 2, so you can enjoy that as part of that.
For 14 pounds, this to me seems like an alright purchase for a Pokemon game of this time. Normally these games spike out of control and the mainline Pokemon entries are all massively overpriced because of the resurgence in interest around that brand that's followed in the last 10 years or so. But what do you think, Judge?
I have no relationship with this part of the Pokemon universe at all. I find it completely mystifying. There's a new thing of it, right?
There's an online version of this that everyone's playing. That's a thing, right?
Yeah, for about two months, people are going to keep posting about this on Blue Sky, I think.
Yeah, I'm just so, so out of the loop on that kind of stuff. Like, I'm so out of Pokemon. I'm willing to believe you on this, um, defense attorney, Shatticus Finch.
I think that's, I think that's, uh, you know, you sounded sincere and quite earnest about it. You know, this is a double whammy. It's like Game Boy and it's a Pokemon thing, which I'm not interested in at best of times, but, uh, I believe your words.
So this time you are a good hire. You and you alone have got this person off.
Thank you. Um, yeah, not in a sexy way, just to point out.
No, you know, we're clearly in a legal proceeding. Everyone knows the context of that. I don't think judges and lawyers have to keep explaining to people when they said they got off.
It didn't mean that.
No, it's a bit of blue Sunday evening humor for you, Matthew. Okay, so yeah, that also a bit of a bonus. I saw Jeremy Peel actually playing this on Blue Sky.
So even he has gotten involved with this, this particular Game Boy Color version. Yeah, I guess it's maybe a thing that happened in this. Maybe this is before someone handed him a copy of Planescape Tourman and says, this is your personality now.
Go play this. Okay, good. Little loving.
It's like no vents to crawl through in this game.
Yeah. You cannot ghost this game. Unless you play Haunter and Ghastly.
A little Pokemon ghost.
The funniest thing Jeremy could do is rename one of his Pokemon vents and put a screenshot of that up. I would respect that so much.
That'd be good. Or 0451. That'd be like another good one, wouldn't it?
Okay, good. Exhibit N. We got Joey Jojo Jr. back again.
I can't remember what happened to this guy. It was a few entries ago. Let me double check.
I think he might have gotten away with it. Oh no, this guy's already guilty. So he's already in the other world, Matthew.
So he was the one who got Einhander and the PS2. So he's back again, but this time from...
Oh yeah, I almost let him go because I bought a Blu-ray player to watch a detective series that's already on Netflix.
This isn't going to help, I feel.
No, but let's hear it.
Exhibit N. Okay, hi lads, I picked up a box copy of the GBA Bit Generations game Dial Hex recently for 70 pounds. This leaves me one short of a complete Bit Generations collection.
Just need colorists. I fucking hope you know what these things are, Matthew. After my brother gifted me five of the seven games following a recent trip to Japan, an extremely generous gift.
The price is a little high, but given I've spent nothing on this collection so far, it seems slightly more justifiable. Are these like interesting, sort of like little mobile-sized games?
Yeah, this is like, this is like, if, if Nintendo did like iPhone games before iPhone was a thing, right, like very minimalist, simple, um, I try to think if there's a better... Like, it's the sort of similar part of Nintendo that would give you like, Electroplankton, say. It's like that weird, very artfully done, they had quite cool packaging.
I don't know if any of them were like, amazing. You know, I've played a couple of them. I think they've just been reviewed when I first joined NGamer and were around at the time.
But they are, they were kind of like, you know, ooh, for the, intellectual Nintendo player in the know, you might have the bit generation games. I'm sure they've got their advocates out there who say, well, actually, they're superb and da da da da da. But 70 quid, I mean, they're the kind of games that appeal to the kind of people who would spend up spending 70 pounds on one of them down the line.
Yeah. So I get that, like that all tracks. But I also think it's like, I don't know, a bit of a waste of money personally.
And anyway, this person's dead. I'm not, let's just say, this might not have sent them to Silent Hill, but I'm certainly not dragging them out of Silent Hill, you know, on its behalf. Yeah.
So you don't get to leave Silent Hill with Maria. You have to stay there and like be doomed to try and like make a life in Silent Hill. Sorry about that.
Yeah.
Yeah. To pay a price for all of your previous sins. Okay, good.
This is another brief one, Matthew. This is from Darren Jones of Retro Gamer, who appeared on the PSP episode that you refused to work on.
But Darren understands the value of things. So this is unfair.
It is a little bit. This is an interesting little selection though.
It feels like he's testing us.
This was off the back of the PSP draft, I think. So not a bad for £50 all in. Okay, so there's no manual for one of these games.
I'll point it out when we get to it. Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII, Peace Walker, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker. That's the one with no manual.
Micro Machines V4, Power Stone Collection. Now we feel about that, Matthew. Team America, World Police on UMD, Extra Cursed, Seiken Mega Drive Collection, which I believe was quite a mediocre selection of Mega Drive games that required loading times because it was on a UMD.
Street Fighter Alpha Max 3 and Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection and Wipeout Pulse. I think that's a good little selection for 50 pounds, Matthew. Crisis Core was for a while going for a little bit of money.
I don't know if that's come down a bit since they did that remaster a bit, but I think that's all right for a selection of at least three or four genuine PSP classics and then some more so-and-so rounds.
Yeah, that's the thing. The ones that I've heard of, played and liked, 50 quid just for those would be all right. The other, sort of detritus in the mix, I'm not bothered about, but that's okay, because I think you've earned your safety with the actually good games.
It would have been funnier, though, if you did execute him, because Team America seems extra cursed these days. Like, what a... I think it is a funny film, but it's a very, like, Bush-era artifact, isn't it?
It wouldn't be anyone's go-to film these days, I don't think.
Especially on that format. I just want to laugh my ass off looking down at my PSP.
Yeah, sorry kids, I'm going the other room to watch Team America on UMD.
I swear every time we slag off Power Stone, someone says to me on social media, I really like Power Stone on PSP.
Yeah, but it's all like…
That's the thing, the Power Stone stands, lesser in number, but almost as persistent as, like, the Shenmue stands.
It's a very similar vibe. That means the Dreamcast heads, isn't it?
Yeah, but it's a sub thing. Anyway, yeah, I think this is fine despite Power Stone.
Yeah, fair enough. I think we agree that Power Stone 2 was better than 1, but we're still not massively into it. And I think they're re-releasing these.
I think that's happening. So we'll have to...
They're part of the... There's like a big Capcom, okay, Megamix thing and yeah, the Power Stones are the ones.
Yep, good. I look forward to that coming out and playing it in multiplayer and get absolutely fucked by one attack like I did when I played it with you. That would be good, Matthew.
Okay. Exhibit P from Dr. Van Nostrand. Dear Judge, jury and executioners, in advance of the 3DS shop closing, I hoovered up a few curios in case the prices of them went mad.
Thank god, Matthew, we're finally in your home territory. I can now safely say they have not. Codename Steam £3.56.
Picross 3D Round 2 £5.99. Chibi-Robo Zip Lash £2.99. This is definitely not a good game, but in mitigation, it was a much cheaper way to see what the deal is with this cute little guy than buying the GameCube one.
The seller paid £3.29 in postage, effectively paying £30 for the privilege of sending me their game. Not sure if this makes it a better deal for me, or just a worse transaction for all involved. Tomodachi Life £18.
I suspect it might not please the judge, but through the magic of an old NGamer QR code, Judge Castle's official me likeness is a resident on my island.
I like that.
That's good. He is happily married to Agent Scully, having won out in a battle for her affections with his best friend Tingle.
I'm not a big Gillian Anderson person, you know.
Yeah, it's never really come up as like, it's a bit ten years older than you.
Yeah, it's not, yeah.
Matthew isn't very SFX core. He's not like all really fancied Holly from series eight of Red Dwarf or whatever. That's not really Matthew's vibe.
Or that Borg one from Voyager.
Yeah, seven of nine. Yeah.
Yes.
That's not really your vibe or my vibe, to be honest. Yeah.
No, that's fine. Like, I'm glad that I've at least got a relationship on that island, that I'm not just in my room, kind of withering away to myself in that demented Tomodachi speech.
Have you ever heard that? No, I never played these.
It's just sort of synthesized speech. So it's like Animal Crossing, except they say out loud all the nonsense, but it's slightly helium. They all sort of talk like this.
I am going to the shops today. I am very happy if I eat a cake.
That sounds terrible. Why do people play this game?
Yeah, but that's a good impression of what Tomodachi is like. Sometimes they sing and it's like auto-tunes the voice.
Well, I'm a guy who doesn't even allow Siri in my house, so that's not really my vibe.
I like this collection of games.
Yeah, interesting.
They're right about Project Steam. That thing, Codename Steaming, that was 99p from launch. That poor game.
They never ever sold a copy of that thing. I think I bought that for £1.99 after the fact.
I think I got it for something like £3.99 in an Argos Going Away sale for the 3DS.
I will say, I'm going to say not guilty, but I think it's pretty rough to judge Chibi Robo as a thing based on the 3DS game, which is shit and nothing like the GameCube game. I'm not going to play that, but I'll play this instead to get the idea. That's unfair on Chibi Robo.
Sorry, how do you feel about Chibi Robo? Because that is one of those very coveted GameCube oddities. The ultimate one, arguably, end of the generation, undersold, now goes for loads of money, and people bang on about it.
A particular kind of Nintendo head bangs on about it. What's your point, if you want to?
I feel like I've got the kind of profile where I should be a big Chibi Robo guy.
I thought this is the case. I thought so.
But it's not... This isn't... Sorry, Ash.
Ash Day is like Mr. Chibi Robo. But it isn't... Oh, I think it's shit or anything.
It's just not... It's not like a cornerstone of my personality. I think it's cool.
I'm glad it exists. I get the kind of developer heritage it comes from, and that kind of, you know, that weirdness thing. But it's, yeah, just a little bit of the Ven guy of Grime, where there isn't that kind of crossover, I guess, between me and my natural people.
My natural people. Yeah, okay. That makes sense, Matthew.
We got a not guilty verdict anyway here, so nice to have a little meat on the bones for some game analysis. Okay. Exhibit Q from Koig.
There's no coherent thread here. This is just a bunch of stuff I bought on a whim, or to satisfy fleeting nostalgic obsessions. Some CEX and some eBay.
Pro Evolution Soccer 6, PS2, 50p. Soldier of Fortune on Dreamcast, 12 pounds. Alfred Hitchcock Vertigo, limited edition, PS4, 12 pounds.
Dead Space Extraction, must be something in the air here. Wii, 12 pounds. Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City, Xbox 360, eight pounds.
Zombie, as in Zombie U, without the U. PS4, nine pound 26. Toy Racer, Dreamcast, five pound 94.
Cursed little selection there, Matthew. Of the ones I know, I guess I have to go to bat for my precious episodes from Liberty City. Two of the greatest pieces of DLC of all time.
Not really sure what happens when you put that in an Xbox Series X actually. I don't know that I've tried that. I'm not sure if you need to own the DLC separately or if it just works off the cuff.
Two great DLC packs. I think most of the music is still in those ones. They might have taken out a few of them from Ballad of Gay Tony.
But it's a good DLC nonetheless. So what do you think overall?
I have no idea about Pro Evo. Like is that a good one?
That was still when it was good. It was a PS2. It was good constantly.
And then when it went to HD, it was fine.
It was a good constantly and it's 50p. So it's just 50p for a game which you can just play forever and that's fine. I agree with you on the episodes.
That's basically how you feel. So that's a bad purchase.
The Dreamcast ones. I'm not passionate about the good Dreamcast games. Let alone like the sort of no-hopers.
I mean, come on. So is that Soldier of Fortune 1?
It's one. I believe this was the only console it was released on the original.
But the first one isn't good. The Soldier of Fortune 2, if even that is good. I mean, it's like morally murky, but at least has a bit more shape to it.
I am wrong, actually. This was released on PS2 as well. And you can play it on GOG as well, but yeah.
I don't know. If this was just like the Liberty City entry, I'd have no problem with it.
Yeah. I thought there was something kind of guilty pleasure about the original Soldier of Fortune. It was really dumb.
But it almost feels like the people making it knew how dumb the overall, the whole bloke with a moustache who's there. It was just so stupid in late 90s, but I was, I don't know. I think it was all right.
But the second ones are legit.
I had to. I had to. Like I had to.
They're raving software games. They're like, these are people who know how to make first person shooters.
Yeah.
Yeah. Anyway.
These are always the entries which are nightmarish, which is like a selection.
No rationality there.
If you remove this one, if it was like all this for £40, then you start playing that, okay, well, this thing justifies that.
I think it's more duff than good in here, Matthew. I'm going to be honest with you.
Yeah. Let's execute Coig.
I think Matthew's been looking forward to doing that. So that's fair.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's for dunking on Wicked, you philistine.
Okay. Exhibit R. This is a really funny one.
ONE567. All it says is, and this is all lowercase, 40 pounds for a Doctor Who Sonic screwdriver Wii remote, and then there's a picture of it. So my theory here is that people who liked Doctor Who and the people who owned Wiis, that Venn diagram is a circle.
I don't think, anyone who liked Doctor Who, their only games console was a Wii, in that time period. I don't think there's anyone, unlike me, a 360 owning Chad, who also had a box set of The Wire. The opposite of that was a nice dad who had a Wii and Doctor Who David Tennant box sets on his shelf.
That's a real person. Do you know what I mean?
The problem is, I know a few Doctor Who fans who definitely weren't that. You just forget that Doctor Who was massive at the time.
Yeah, it was like the big UK TV show.
So I can kind of see it, but also I don't think it's going to be a perfect Venn diagram eclipse. Was this controller made specifically to tie into it? There was definitely a Doctor Who Wii game that was absolutely shit.
I think it was like the Matt Smith era. Yeah. Like had Amy Pond in it.
I have a feeling this controller was made almost to be sold alongside it or with it. We had one of these in the office kicking around. Very cursed thing.
I like the Wii Remote design. It sat comfortably in my hand. Anything you'd add to it to make it like knobbly and weird is bad.
Yeah, it could be used.
Which this is just like knobbly, weird Wii Remote through and through.
For context, this could be used with a 2010 Wii release, Doctor Who Return to Earth, which I assume was a Matt Smith one because that was 2010.
No, this is bad. This is bad. This was a bad thing.
It's bad. This is bad. If you bought it then or now or whenever, this is just bad.
Funny one, Doctor Who and video games. I feel like there probably is potential for a really good point and click adventure in the Lucasfilm mold, but it's just doomed to be a like, you've got one year to make this and it's got to come out on the console where you can make games the cheapest vibe to it.
They don't have like a big games department or anything, or it feels like you need someone who's really going to like champion it and knows what they're doing. Games based on BBC shows are always made by small studios who only seem to make adaptations of like ITV and BBC games.
Yeah.
I just don't think anything good could have really come with that.
Historically, as well, that's certainly the case. But it moves on quite quickly. They get new doctors and it's hard to put four years into making a Doctor Who game.
It's not going to change it by then or it might have been taken off the air again. So not to say.
It's a shame that it only got like the Lego treatment inside Lego dimensions.
Yeah, that's a good fit actually, isn't it?
Because it did work, because they're kind of puzzly, you know, very light combat, scary monster design, you know, loads of different characters because of all the different companions and doctors. Like it suits Lego brilliantly. But unfortunately, you had to play it like mixed in with all this other brand stuff, which I thought was a bit naff.
Yeah, OK, fair enough. All right. So yeah, Doctor Who has not had the best time on the back page, such as it is.
However, I look forward to the the industry tie-in game coming to Nintendo Switch next year, Matthew. Make money, shag, get drunk. Those are the options you get in that game.
Look forward to it.
OK, like a very low res 2D character illustration of Ken Lung.
Yeah, that's obviously based on a still from the show. Obviously based on a still from the show. OK, Exhibit S from Superboy.
A few years ago now, I thought it was worth submitting to the court. New 3DS XL, Carrie Case, Luigi's Mansion 2, Pokemon Sun, Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, Mario Party Island Tour, Super Smash Bros. for 3DS, Super Mario Maker for 3DS, All In, advertised and purchased for £75, bought from a colleague at work whose kid had gone off Nintendo stuff.
I hadn't had a Nintendo handheld since the DS Lite and primarily picked this up for the console. But there's a lot of games for the money alongside it. PS, on opening the carry case, also found an R4 cart with a bunch of games loaded onto it including Call of Duty 4, Crash of the Titans, Plants vs.
Zombies and the clearly essential RU Smarter Than a Fifth Grader. I didn't buy it for this, so whether you consider this value add or taking away from the overall purchase is at your discretion. Did it not even have the house MD game on there?
What a disappointment. Seems pretty good, Matthew. I wouldn't have minded having a bit more specifics on timing.
The pandemic is when the 3DS prices went out of control because that's when all the remaining stock was bought up because people were stuck indoors, so they wanted anything and they couldn't get hold of the Switch. So ever since then, I think the 3DS has been a bit out of control, but the new 3DS XL, pretty decent version of this hardware. Lots of good games in there.
Seems good to me, but what do you think?
Yeah, I mean, for that price and that many games and the hardware, you can't really argue with it. I'd say, not a mystery the kid went off on Nintendo if you bought them shit like Mario Party. That's on you.
Yeah, that is on you. I'm not a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon guy either, but the good Nintendo games, Luigi's Mansion 2, absolutely fantastic on 3DS. That's still where it should be played, not Switch, I think.
Yeah, I think this is fine.
Yeah, I agree. That's pretty good, aside from the two duff games. But every kid of that age had some shit, 3DS or DS games in the mix, didn't they?
So, Exhibit T from Sweet Bill. Hello gents, I'd like to present my purchases from July to the Games Court for Judge Castle's judgment. Firstly, I'd like to mention these purchases as the result of my old CD collection.
Finding its way back into my life and the realisation I didn't have a CD player to play them with, I came up with the idea of hooking up my PS1 as a dedicated CD player whilst also being able to play some of my old PS1 games, Tekken 3, Ridge Racer 4, Resi 3, etc. The following purchases are a result of this. PS2 DVD Remote with Receiver, £13.24.
This does work on PS1 for CD playback. PS1 Controller, £11.30. PS1 Memory Card, £6.49.
PS1 HDMI Cable, £34.98. I also live nearby to the wonderful Forgotten Worlds Retro Shop near Glasgow, so I ended up buying some lovely Japanese games even though I'm unable to play them as they are just nice things to have. Boxed Super Famicom Final Fantasy VI from Japan, £35.
Boxed GameKey WarioWare game from Japan, £18. Boxed Gran Turismo PS1 also from Japan, £4. Grand Total is £123.01.
Hopefully the judge will be lenient, however the purchase of a Japanese WarioWare game has resulted in the search for a Japanese GameCube on eBay. Quite a mixed bag of stuff there, Matthew. All that PS1 and PS2 stuff seems like bollocks to me.
I don't quite get all of that. I suppose even if you had a PS2, you could use the memory card there, but I don't get the PS1 specific focus to all of that. I will say they did include some nice photos of those boxed games.
They do look absolutely lovely, including the FF6 one from there. Those prices don't seem to egregious, but it's almost like two entries here. A load of PlayStation peripherals that are a bit of a shrug, and then a load of boxed games, which are probably quite nice to own.
The hardware stuff, I don't really have a read on that. The reason for it seems a little strange to me as well, but whatever, put that aside. I'm really torn about the idea of just buying a game as a cosmetic thing because I get it.
The art design, particularly on Japanese games, it's often beautiful. They're interesting objects to have around the house, but there seems to be, I don't know, owning something for the sake of owning it and then not using it seems a bit wrong. It's a bit like dads always moaning about bastards who buy up interesting wines and never drink them.
It seems a bit arbitrary to say, well, if someone else does want to play that game, they won't be able to play it now because it's on this person's shelf. I know there are other copies and it's not as severe as that, but I do think that a little bit of, well...
Well, you know what, though?
I just don't think of games as a cause, but all our games are packed away in boxes and things. I just don't have them around the house. It's like owning a book.
It's got a nice cover. That, to me, would be baffling.
Well, the thing is, you're not taking those games away from anyone, really, for the simple reason of when I went to Super Potato, there were loads of copies of Final Fantasy 6 on stairs, unboxed, but those are games that are really easy to get, I think, the ones that he's bought, I think.
Yeah.
Just kill it, Matthew, get on with it.
Yeah. Off you go to Cursed Scenics.
Sorry, sweet Bill. If you'd have just bought the games, it would have been fine, but, you know. No, I don't think I've bought any physical...
I know, that's a lie, I did this exact thing with FF4 when I was in Japan, but that was like three or four quid or something. That was no money at all.
Yeah, but at the same time, I bought Catherine a couple of Christmases ago, there's a guy who sells like, he makes special like framed versions of games, like, but he frames like the box and the disc, but on a kind of bespoke background.
Yeah.
So, and I got her one for Final Fantasy X, so it's quite an artful complete piece, but it is fundamentally, you know, a copy of the game taken out of action to become a purely cosmetic thing. So I am, I can't really judge anyone on that.
Ah, but does it come with the Beyond Final Fantasy DVD, Matthew?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe sell a tape to the back. I always remember when it arrived, it had a load of sweets in there.
He just thrown in a load of sweets. It's just like some guy who does these in the UK. Did he know it was me specifically or does he do this for everyone?
Because it works like glowing review after that.
An intense amount of research. Okay. All right.
So that one's guilty. I'm sorry about that sweet Bill. This next one has some of the most ostentatious purchases Games Court has ever seen Matthew.
Perhaps the most ostentatious. Really? So Lexington87, who I assume must be some millionaire.
If you are a millionaire, by the way, if you'd like me and Matthew to be living entertainers, just make podcasts and you give us 50 grand a year each. We're in. We'll do it.
Just do it. Get in touch. We are waiting for that benefactor to basically make this into a full-time job for us.
If that's you, then get on the phone. Thoughts, Matthew?
If you've made your money by being evil, I don't mind.
I don't mind.
If you are still evil, I don't mind.
Yeah. Are you shorting the concept of milk or something? We don't mind.
We'll take your money no matter what. We don't care how unethical your investments are. Okay.
Big Zelda Madness. I believe the following is the result of a semi-midlife crisis, where I decided I wanted a collection of every limited edition Zelda-themed Nintendo console, some Japan only. And if it says new, that is sealed and unopened when bought.
I did open them and put them on display. See link at the end. In my defense, your honor, the new items were the going prices for the market at the time.
Adding all these links for reference is not helpful. I've described these to Matthew on the podcast. This is the first time he hears them.
He's not going to click on a URL in the middle of the episode. Pay attention to the concept. But we will still take money off your hands to be your living entertainers, as previously discussed.
Again, just to reiterate.
Yeah, exactly. Okay, okay, number one. Nintendo 3DS Zelda 25th Anniversary, $649.
No, Matthew. I bought, at brackets, I bought and returned several $200 used variants, but this particular console is gloss and they were all scratched to shit. So we're already at $649.
Nintendo 2DS Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Console, refurbished 159.99 for a 2DS. Probably the worst Nintendo hardware of all time. I mean, it did the job, but it wasn't very nice, was it?
I can't even visualise that thing.
Yeah, well, this link's here. I can paste them into the Discord if you want. That might be good.
Oh, no, I've seen this. It's green.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, three.
Nintendo 2DS The Legend of Zelda Hylian Shield Edition, Japan only, new, $1,310. Fucking hell. We're already paid my rent like two months in a row here.
Four, Nintendo 3DS XL A Link Between Worlds Limited Edition, new, $363. That's one of the cheaper ones, so I sound less shocked there. Five, Nintendo New 3DS XL Zelda Majora's Mask Edition, new, £325.
First one I could get new in the UK, not the US. Six, Nintendo 3DS XL Hyrule Edition, £290. Seven, Wii U Legend of Zelda Limited Edition, £120.
I don't know that one, actually. That doesn't seem too egregious. Number eight, Legend of Zelda Nez Box with Map and Manual, £294.99.
See, that's just a game, then. Not eBay for completeness. Switch Lite Hyrule Edition, £209.
Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED, £319. That's just a go listing. Sorry, going pricing, basically.
Then there's something about some bespoke stands on Etsy that I'm not really bothered about looking into. But that's a grand total of about £3,000 all in there, Matthew, maybe a bit more. A truly ridiculous purchase.
It doesn't feel like it's in the spirit of how you interact with video games to me. Feels like an obvious doom them to the pub hell. But what do you think?
I mean, $1,300 for pounds. Is it pounds or dollars?
Dollars.
$1,300 for a 2DS. 2DS Hylian Shield Edition.
That's actually a 2DS LL.
Oh, that's so expensive. I just don't really understand it.
That's almost what I spend on my gaming PC. Like a new gaming PC that will last me like...
Well, that's what you'd see at like... Yeah, I don't know. They are nice, but they are just marketing for the thing which I'm interested in, which is the Zelda games, which are 50 quid for everyone when they come out.
Yeah.
Everyone just plays that. Like, listen, if you are a millionaire or something approaching it, then by all means, I can understand. Like, if you have crazy money to burn and you're into games, then it's hard to find nice things.
They are nice. I will say that.
Yeah.
Nintendo Special Edition consoles are generally quite artfully done, quite minimalist, never particularly gaudy. But that is so much money. I wouldn't want to encourage any listener, any other listener to do that.
I don't want anyone to come away from this thinking that spending more than $1,000 on a 2DS of any kind is acceptable. Like, good for you, I'm sure. Like, these are now looking nice in a cabinet, I'm going to assume, on their bespoke stands from Etsy.
Listen, you've got them, you'll enjoy them. Good for you, but for the sake of everyone else, this is just so, so guilty. It is.
The thing is, I think I would have, I think I would have forgiven one of these purchases if it was sort of like, if you'd have got the second hand 3DS Zelda 25th anniversary one, and it wasn't scratched to shit, and it was like, maybe you still got it in a box or something, I'd be like, yeah, okay, it's okay you spent 250 quid on that, or 300 quid or something like that, it's a really nice thing to own. But it's the successive 3DSs and DSs, it's just like a pile up of them, and each one just does unspeakable psychic damage to me, just reading the prices out. It's just, yeah, it's a lot to take, I will say.
But the 2DS LL, which is a really nice looking thing, but the idea of paying $13, $10 for that, probably some import fees of some kind, and oh, so much pain for that.
I mean, you're right, I'm not a collector, so I will never understand that mentality of collecting the different versions of that same thing. I have spent some stupid money on individual books for my Japanese crime collection that's very, very hard to get and are genuinely rare. And I'm like, well, that is the missing piece of the puzzle.
You know, and it's a thing I will read and have read and enjoyed. Like my relationship with, particularly with handhelds is, well, this is the handheld and the wear and tear of it, and me using it loads is part of my connection to it. I don't want a load of sterile, unused hardware.
That doesn't mean anything to me personally. I've got a few 3DSs from over the years and DSs, and the unique nature of them, like the weird games that are on them or the save files that are on them or the dents on them are part of it. But like I say, who knows what would happen if I had the money.
Okay. All right. So guilty, Matthew?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, crazy entry though. Thanks for submitting it.
Yeah. And the good news is Matthew will let you keep your purchases in the pub hell realm. As Toblerone head stalks you and you're trying to hold about 18 different prestige DSs at the same time.
That will be. Yeah.
You'll be trading them for like favors with the other inmates who are there in the hell world. But they're worth quite a lot. So you might actually survive.
Yeah. I could just picture like James Sunderland coming across a weird guy with loads of 3DSs and be like, oh, what happened to you then? Who's this weird man who keeps coveting all his 3DSs or whatever?
I think it should be like the end of Marathon Man. You can only keep as many as you can swallow.
Perfect, Matthew. Coming up with new and evil punishments all the time. Cool and unusual.
Okay. We've got three more entries here, but they're all quite brief, so let's fire through them. This is from Pinch, Exhibit V, long-term listener, and it's my first time making an entry to the court, looking to capture some Xbox 360 nostalgia.
I wanted to play Project Gotham Racing 4. Unfortunately, I had to buy a few copies. PGR4, £2 from CEX, brackets, disc was scratched.
PGR4, £3 from a car boot. Didn't open the case till I got home, only to find it was missing the disc. PGR4, £2, CEX had weird paste on the disc.
Weird paste.
Weird paste feels like something you would come across in the silent hit, actually. PGR4, £3, eBay, finally a working copy. I now own four mostly broken copies of PGR4.
I quickly realized it wasn't as good as I remembered, but I pushed through and finished the campaign. Thanks to the countless great episodes and for making the workdays more bearable. Not sure this episode did, but the rest, sure.
Did you break a tenner with all those combined?
Let's see, two, three, two, so five, seven, ten, ten pounds, just about, yeah.
Ten pounds, okay.
That's all right.
Yeah, I mean, the pace of it all was quite funny.
Yeah.
The idea was buying an empty box.
If this was like, this is such a sort of like amazing contrast to the last entry though. It's like, I wanted one cheap game that worked properly versus I needed like eight 3DSs, you know.
But it's finally like, you know, it's finally was set by the first instance of two pounds.
Yeah.
So he's paid five times over for what it should be.
Guilty.
Not necessarily their fault, but, and they played it, but didn't really enjoy it. Often the way, you remember everything being better like this.
Yeah, that's true.
That's a tricky one.
He's never really a PGR guy. I think we played a bit of MSR when I brought the Dreamcast around. And we couldn't get over how jagged the edges was when we played that split screen.
Yeah.
We were in full digital foundry on its ass.
Yeah. I was John Lilliman that day.
I was one of the other ones. I'm willing to let it go.
Yeah. I already wrote down not guilty. So confident was I that after the Zelda entry, that would be fine.
Yeah. I mean, it's just not the same crime.
It's truly not. Again, there's another... We got like the word bongo comes up again in this entry.
There must be something in the water, in the air Matthew, with this. It's all like a precursor to the Matthew's prediction coming true. Exhibit W from Tom, greeting lads, long time listener, finally looking for a piece of that sweet Games Court action.
Here's my purchase, a boxed Japanese copy of Donkey Konga complete with bongo controller, picked up from a second hand store for 110 yen. At the time of writing, that's about 56p. I currently don't have a GameCube on which to play it, and the bongo skins have a slight brown to them.
However, I have fond memories of playing with my brother, and it will look good on a shelf. I don't know about that brown looking good myself.
Oh, what are those fake-ass plastic brown bongos you've got there? They look interesting.
Yeah, it's just what I will want a lady to see when I bring her home. Considering retro game prices of Sky Rockers here in the past couple of years, I can only assume it was incorrectly priced, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Peace and love from Japan.
What do you think, Matthew? 56p, but no console to play on.
I mean, that sucks. Also, if you remember from our little edge discussion a few episodes ago, the Japanese version of Donkey Konga was quite frowned upon for its soundtrack.
Ah, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The UK one added lots of bangers, which Edge celebrated in their Game of the Year feature that year. It's so little money that you're almost like, who fucking cares? But at the same time, the idea of putting brown bongos on your shelf as a point of pride.
Come on.
So cursed.
I've got to put this person out there misery.
Okay. Into the pub, hell will you go. Look out.
Thanks for writing in though.
Oh no, a second white Toblerone head has turned up now. Different flavor, Toblerone. Straight out of Heathrow Airport.
He's here.
Straight out of Heathrow Airport.
Okay. Last entry. Zim-X on Regbook Fly.
Right. Here it is. A copy of Codename Steep.
Why do these same games keep coming up for £8? Because it was sealed. I mean, there's about a million unsold copies of these on the streets, isn't there?
I had already completed the game on another copy. DJ Hero 2, game only for PS3 for £4 because I had the deck. I've played it once.
Muramasa the Dragon Blade. Is that the Demon Blade, that game, Matthew?
I thought it was called Demon Blade.
I think so too. That's a Wii game, isn't it? For £15, I've never played it.
Kof, Hotel Dusk for £17 on eBay. Played and never finished, same brother. Dragon Quest IX for £7.
Played an astonishing number of hours and never cleared. Metaphor Refantazio I bought for £50 because I heard it was hard to find, so I got it. And I've gone straight back to Echoes of Wisdom.
Why is, what are you talking about? It's a new game! What are you talking about, anyway?
Hexen64, N64, opportunity struck and it was £7 all in. What a fucking grab bag that is to end with, Matthew.
One of your favourite games. That's a chaos selection of games.
I alone would push for a guilty verdict for the simple reason that if you didn't know that they were going to restock Metaphor again, that's a game that came out and sold a million copies and it's a Sega game. There are always loads of Sega versions, like copies of Sega games around. They drop the prices swiftly enough that you can get it for a reasonable price.
I don't really get that one, Metaphor being in there. That's strange.
That's strange. I also don't quite get the, I played Codename Steam, stole it and then bought it again for a lot more than the other person bought it.
Yeah, for double, for eight whole pounds, triple its value.
I mean, I've literally just looked up and seen my audio timeline cross the two hour mark, which unfortunately means you are guilty, my friend.
That is a great criteria. I think you are too muddled there. I think you need to boil that down to some, we needed a bit more coherence of what the deal was.
You need to put it on the line. For future reference, anyone who's got more than three games, just pick a couple of them and give us a bit of the thinking mind. Just give us a little bit of source to work with.
I'm worried that when I told people we don't want your whole fucking life story with an entry, that they took that and now we got a bit too boiled down to just the games and the prices.
Yeah, so now a little bit more life story.
Yeah, but let's say that the TV, the CRT with The Dead Woman was like the model version of this, right? It's a great anecdote and there's only a couple of things for us to think about in the midst of it. But next time, yeah, let's give us some proper rationale.
What does this game mean to you? Ideally, a fun anecdote, but I'll take just a little bit of waffle.
I think something which could be very lucrative for us and everyone involved, if people could start doing weird trades on Facebook and going to see strange people to pick stuff up, I want to hear about that. That is always interesting to me.
Like that bloke who sold me the busted Sega Saturn.
Yeah, I want to hear like I met someone in a scary ass car park and they gave me a copy of fucking Red Steel 2 that I didn't play because I don't have a Wii anymore, however these stories always end.
Yeah, like the dude I sold, I think it was a Callisto protocol I sold to a dude. That was a bit strange, but nothing is stranger than the dude in the van I sold the Oculus Quest 2 to. That was so weird.
That felt like I was going to get knifed outside Coffee No. 1 on Victoria Bridge Road and Bath, so wouldn't have been ideal, Matthew. Okay, that's Games Court done.
I'm going to quickly total up the guilty verdicts.
I think you lost this one.
Yeah, I think so. One, two, three, four, five, six, 13, 14, 15. Yeah, 15 guilty verdicts.
I lost this easily. But nonetheless, did I have fun? Certainly, a Games Court happened, as it always does, Matthew.
I actually enjoyed that way more than I thought I was going to.
Did you really? That's nice. I thought there were actually some good games.
There were enough genuinely good entries, and even the ones which were less colorful still felt pretty solid.
Yeah, I liked it too. I like having a weird, I like the Wario Blast one. That was quite good as a sort of like a bit of an odd purchase.
We had to sort of look up and be like, oh, that's weird.
Yeah, I need to work on my Game Boy rationale. It's a bit half formed.
The themed Light Gun Wii one, I really like that entry as well.
Oh yeah, that was good.
That was good. Yeah, again, we're getting to the model of what the good Games Court entries are here. But yes, we will do another one this year if we get enough entries.
So as mentioned, backpagegames.gmail.com. We'd like to send us some more. I hope you enjoyed this nonetheless.
I know it's a popular format with our listeners, even if me and Matthew are consistently baffled by it. You can also drop them into the Games Court submissions channel on the Discord. Okay, the podcast is done.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am mrbazzlepesto on Blue Sky or mrbazzle__pesto on Twitter, not often on there, but you know.
Indeed, Matthew is out there. He's also, we're both on Letterboxd as well. I'm Samuel W.
Roberts. That's my favorite social media platform now. I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on there and Matthew, are you mrbazzle__pesto?
I think I'm just mrbazzlepesto now, underscore.
Excellent. Okay. The podcast is supported financially by Patreon.
patreon.com/backpagepod. We have no ads in this podcast. We've done no sponsored content, anything like that.
We haven't even done sponsored content for Renny. We just passed the £3,000 a month mark on there, which means at some point in the future, this year, we and Matthew will stream something. We'll figure out the logistics of that, but we're very grateful for the support.
Thank you to everyone who helped us to hit that. That barrier makes the podcast well worth investing our time in, to be rewarded on that scale. Thank you so much.
That said, would we still pack it all in to work for a millionaire? Of course. That's still on the cards.
That's available at any time. The millionaires tier. I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on the social media platforms as well, and Back Page Pod if you'd like to follow us on Twitter or Blue Sky. Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
