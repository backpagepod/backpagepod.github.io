Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we're finally doing the long-teased PS2 redraft. We've been talking about this for about two years. We even made a joke about it in episode 200, and we're doing it with our first ever Two Guests episode.
So, we have returning guests, Ashley Day and Dave Scarborough. So, let's start with you, Ash, how you doing?
Hello, I'm wonderful, thank you. Nice to be here, and I'm excited to smash Dave in a video game form.
Indeed.
I've never smashed him in any other form. I don't know what I'm talking about.
Dave, how do you respond?
Well, I'm excited to be here as well. I was obviously more open for a friendly bit of competition, but it sounds like it's serious. Honestly, when I was sort of putting together my draft picks, I was considering just stealing all of Ash's picks, but then I decided I wanted good games, so I went for a totally different tactic in the end.
Impossible. You can't be taking Dog of Bay and Sky Gunner in different categories instead of your beloved Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Dave. That's just not going to fly in this draft.
It's hilarious how well you know me because that's actually on my list.
I'll be honest. So what I've been praying for in planning this draft is that, so just for some context, myself, Ash, Dave, we all worked together basically at the same time in Imagine Publishing for a couple of years. So it's great to have them on.
Matthew, obviously, a good friend as well. So it's going to be a fun podcast. Thanks for pointing that out.
So I think the differences between the two of you, in terms of your taste in games, but also your personalities and the fact that you do know each other, I think it's going to make for a fun draft. There's 44 picks in this PS2 redraft. That's going to take fucking ages.
We've got quite a light preamble to kick us off. I will just ask, though, Matthew, how are you doing? You OK, pal?
Yes, I'm good, thanks. I'm excited to be going up against the Bournemouth Boys in this one. See if I can hold my own, Barth represent, et cetera, et cetera.
You're in a good position, Matthew, because I'm here with my two old managers, and you're the only person I haven't had to talk to HR about. So you're the real innocent party in this quadrant.
We're all wearing our Imagine Publishing football shirts that say content is paramount on the front, so that's good.
Content is king, Sam, content is king.
Indeed.
Yes, it was, wasn't it, excellence are paramount?
It's something like that, something that sounds like it's from a beat-em-up on the stairs or something. So yeah, I'm looking forward to this. I really enjoyed our original PS2 Draft episode.
That's still available. Me and Matthew did that in late 2021, so more than three years ago. Exciting to come back to this.
There's gonna be like a whole bunch new games that are in the mix. We only really scratched the surface of what the PS2's library holds, so I think it's gonna be good fun. I suppose, then, to kick off with, we will, like I say, keep the preamble brief for this one, because we have so many picks, but the PS2 was a huge deal for a bunch of reasons.
The PlayStation was Sony's move into gaming, and they managed to pitch the PlayStation a much older audience. The PS2 was a far more powerful console, had a DVD player, and was once again able to find that mass market, mass audience, and was just the monolith of this generation of consoles. The GameCube and the Xbox were far behind, and the library is absolutely enormous, and Sony will never quite have another console like this.
They've obviously been dominant in the time since then, with the PS4 and the PS5, but the PS2's own library is so distinctive versus the libraries of the competing consoles that it makes for a really interesting console to revisit and redraft, so excited to get into that. It was apparently a fucking nightmare to develop for. I read a very long deep dive on the Emotion Engine that was on Ars Technica, and then realized I couldn't pass that in any interesting way for the listeners, so I thought I'd just reference it in this preamble basically before moving on to games chat, where I'm more firmly in home territory.
So Ash, what is your relationship with the PS2? I can never quite gauge it from working with you at Imagine, where you seemed very much Sega first, Nintendo second.
Yeah, I mean, that's an accurate description of me, but the PS2 I would describe, and I hope this doesn't sound like condescending, I would describe it as the kind of like everyman console, in that everyone had one, and it was a necessary console to own, but it was never personally my favourite, it never really had the soul that Sega or Nintendo had. But I've been there from the start, I actually worked retail for the UK PS2 launch, so I was working at Game Station when it came out, and we were taking pre-orders, that's the first console I remember where pre-orders were a big deal, because there was so much hype around it that scarcity was a real problem, and we had these physical pre-order forms that were done in triplicates, because one went to the customer, one went to the shop, and the other one went to Sony, so they were like you were actually officially pre-ordering your console with Sony, not just the retailer. It all felt very serious and high stakes at the time, and so that's always stuck in my mind of like, oh, this is a special moment in time where there's so much anticipation for, you know, what were those launch titles?
Phantavision, Street Fighter EX3, all the hits.
Were you selling a lot of Kessin bundles?
Kessin, yeah.
Was Original Time Splitters aâ€¦
I think it was, yeah. That was probably the pick of the bunch. And then obviously we all know the history.
It took off with GTA 3 and Metal Gear Solid 2. I was a university student in those years from 2001 to 2004. So we were playing PS2 games every day in those years and I've never been without a PS2 since.
I do love it. It's just not something I talk about much.
Fair enough. Well, it sounds like you got a deep knowledge of the system, so excited to tap into that. Dave Scarborough, what's your history with the PS2?
Weirdly enough, although I don't think it's quite sort of my brand as it is Ash. I was very much a Nintendo guy growing up, and so I came quite late to the PlayStation 2 as well. It was something I used to play around Friends House quite a bit.
I think I got my GameCube before I got my PS2, and then it was something that was gathering momentum, I think, on the playground. I'm a bit younger than Ash is. I think I'm between your ages, but you got that momentum building on the playground and it wasn't until GTA 3 hit where it felt like it became a phenomenon, and it just became an essential thing that everyone our age had to have.
I think I got it just before GTA Vice City came out, and I got it with GTA 3 and MGS2, and then I didn't look back. It was like the mature console for someone who was just entering their teenage years, and I then remember it coming to university with me, it being sort of like a mainstay of uniculture, playing a lot of multiplayer games, Battlefront, Gitar Hero. It became an essential part of everyday socialising, and since then I've been a big Sony guy.
I bought the PS3 while I was at university as well, PS4 I was working on the Mag. But PS2 was sort of my gateway into the world of PlayStation.
Yeah, that makes sense. I remember that too, the early years of it, feeling like they were selling a very premium adult console. And then by comparison, this is when they'd released the PS1 for the PlayStation, as in the soft edged, cheaper model.
I think they bundled in with the first Harry Potter game, that had the cursed low res Hagrid in it. And so that felt very deliberate to me. And even like the official Mags of the time, the official PS1 Mags started to feel quite kiddy.
Meanwhile, the PS2 Mag was selling something quite premium. So I think that was something that Sony were deliberately cultivating.
You went from like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon being the cover stars of PlayStation to it being Grand Theft Auto and Solid Snake. You know, it felt to me at least like they were sort of promoted, pushed forward to the audience more so than the mascots of the previous generation.
I think that they do push the mascots, but they come a little bit later. Like Jack and Daxter comes first in 01, but then you have Sly Cooper and Ratchet and Clank the next year. You know, I think it's the next year.
And then, it does have its own helping of that, but I agree that this is a generation where adult games start to define what the overall key exclusives are, more so in a way that they did than, you know, the PS1 generation, which had, yeah, like a bit more of a focus on trying to find the new Sony or Sony's first platforming mascot. This is a little bit less about that, partly driven by the fact that GTA as a series was so huge throughout this generation. Yeah, in 2001, I think it was Gran Turismo 3 that really kicked it off, and I remember it just becoming this big deal, then I think it was at the end of summer or in the early holiday sales period, that's when GTA 3 hit, and that was definitely, like Dave says, the subject of playground discussion and excitement, and from there, it becomes the must-have thing, and obviously, the GameCube and Xbox launched late enough that they can never really catch up, despite having some pretty amazing exclusives themselves, so a great generation for sure.
Matthew, we should recap the listeners as well on our respective histories with the PS2, so what's yours?
Obviously, it comes out when I'm right in the depths of Nintendo mania. I didn't own a PS2 until right towards the end of it, 2006, where I bought a slim one and loads and loads of pre-owned games. My brother Alex got one for Christmas quite early on, where he famously wept on Christmas Day, a story he hates me telling on this podcast, so that one's for him.
I was always in a house or dorms or student house where there was a PS2 and I could play the biggies that I wanted to, so reading multi-format magazines and wanting to play Metal Gear Solid 2 or the Grand Theft Auto as they came along. I feel like I kept on top of it without ever truly owning one and being there in the mix. Yeah, I don't have a huge emotional connection to it, but so it makes the draft a bit of a tricky one.
I haven't got many heart picks, they're more head picks.
That's fair enough. Maybe I am the number one PS2 fanboy on this podcast, which is quite interesting, I suppose, because it was the first console apart from a second-hand Mega Drive, where my parents finally caved and went, yeah, okay, fine, you can have one. We accept you can't play all of these games on PC, our slightly naff Windows PC that was already about three years out of date with the graphics card.
Christmas 2001, my parents bought me this. My dad, the greatest act he ever did for me, genuinely the best thing he ever did for me was buying me GTA 3 at Argos. That was like an incredible gesture, much to the annoyance of my mom who did not like that.
But from there, I was just deeply curious about the PS2's catalog. I went back and discovered a load of PS1 games that I'd never played at the time. Going through MGS for the first time, playing FF7, FF8, FF6, a whole bunch of stuff.
But just rating game stations, PS1 section for that kind of thing. Endlessly trading in the PS2 games I did have to get slightly better ones, cycling through the mediocre likes of Headhunter, The Sims on PS2, LMA Manager 2002. I did so much wheeling and dealing trading to play as much as I could.
Did you do a lot of playground trading as well? This was when it really became a case of disks being swapped around the playground constantly, so people were just able to play the latest releases, or at least fairly recent releases because we don't have infinite amounts of money.
No, I didn't really do much of that, did anyone else? It wasn't a thing for me.
I was trading Commodore 64 games in the playground, so I can't really comment, to be honest.
Ashley, you're a hundred years old, like I just...
Did an old man used to come to your playground to swap Commodore games with you?
We don't talk about that.
Okay, yeah, so I didn't have much experience with that, Dave, but I do think that it was just really broadly accessible, the PS2 catalogue. They brought out that Platinum range so you could get a load of the classics for 20 quid, and it was everywhere, and the generation went on for so long. When you look at the GameCube and Xbox, they burned brightly for about four, five years, and they're gone.
The PS2 kind of trucks away for about eight years, arguably nine years at a stretch. It's a really prolonged generation and deep into the latter days of the generation that you're still getting a bunch of essential games.
I was going to say actually, Sam, like when I joined GameStream in 2006, we were reviewing Xbox 360 games, the PS3 and the Wii were coming out, but this first couple of years, it was still mostly PS2 games all the way. And that feels a little bit surreal now that there was that crossover, but it just kept going. And they weren't also around games.
Like some of the best games on the system came out really late in the day, I think.
Yeah, it's true. I remember when I joined Imagine, I think that Akami had just come out and God Hand was coming out and you still had Persona 3 and Persona 4 still to release. And Bully was at the end of 06, and God of War 2 was at the start of 07 as well.
So yeah, it really is quite an unusual generation in that respect, Ashley. That's a good observation. Okay, good.
Well, that was a brief preamble, maybe slightly briefer than I planned for. But nonetheless, I think that's okay because we've got a lot to talk about with the categories. So let's take a quick break and we'll come back with the PS2 MegaDraft.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, the PS2 MegaDraft, lots to discuss here. We have 11 categories.
We all agreed on the categories. I sent them around. Ash suggested an additional category.
So, this is the first draft we've done that has 11 categories to pick from, which is a bit unusual, but I think it makes sense. The PS2 definitely has the catalogue to support 44 picks, thankfully. So I will read those out first up here and then we will discuss them a bit and I will recap the categories once more before we start picking.
So category 1, 90 plus on Metacritic. Category 2, RPG. Category 3, Sports or Racing.
Category 4, Survival Horror or Stealth. Category 5, License Game. Category 6, PS2 Exclusive.
So it can't have launched on Xbox, PC or GameCube this generation. Category 7, Shooter or Platformer. Category 8, Open World.
Category 9, Rhythm Action or Arcade. Category 10, Wild Card. And Category 11, Free Pick.
So Ash, discuss those categories and how you approached the picking for the draft process.
Yeah, do you know what? I've got dozens of games written down in my shortlist and I'm worried. I'm worried because I just think that, you know, the catalog on this system, as you rightly said, is so sprawling, so much variety and quality.
Are you worried, Ash, that no one's heard of the ones that you're picking?
I do have some explaining to do.
Well, as in most cases of you in a room.
Oh, come on. Even with 44 games, it's really difficult to encapsulate everything that was great about PlayStation 2. So my main anxiety is the games I just won't have space to talk about.
That's okay. I think it's going to make for a really interesting podcast in between the four of us. I think we'll have a wide variety of picks.
I was looking at the average Metacritic score of the games I've picked and I think I will definitely have the lowest. Some of the games I've picked have got like a 54% Metacritic average, but that's because the children are wrong.
This is why you're here.
This is why you're here. Okay, good. Our tight final then.
Ash has taken that in category seven, so I look forward to that. That would be good.
No comment.
The contrarian in chief has arrived.
But do you know what? I do want to... I kind of see it as my social responsibility to get across some of the quirkier games that are on PS2 and champion them.
But I do also want to beat Dave in the rankings. I don't need to win. I just need to beat Dave.
So I do have some mainstream picks as well and some tactical picks. And I'll say finally, I think there's, despite the vast catalog on PS2, I think there's one or two categories here that actually don't have that many games available to them and certainly not that many top tier games. So I think there could be a bit of a fight over a couple of those.
Yeah, I definitely structured it so people have to make difficult choices. Survival Horror or Stealth is an interesting power because I think the king picks for that category are quite obvious, but you have to make the difficult choice of, do you keep one or the other in some cases? And like you say, some things will come off the board quite quickly.
I will say in terms of your picks Ash, that was why I invited you, I wanted those deep cuts, I wanted the interesting perspective on the PS2 that isn't just the canon 20 or 30 games that everyone knows, because me and Matthew, we already picked those when we did the first version of this draft.
And I plan to pick them again.
I also plan to pick some of those games.
Yep, okay, so Matthew will be taking Red Faction as his first pick, so I look forward to that. The lesson learned there, perhaps. Yeah, okay, so Dave, how about you?
What did you think of the categories and how did you approach the selection process?
Well, I love that Ash is coming to this with the same sort of energy that he brought to our time at Imagine, where he came into the office one day saying that Ted was the greatest comedy of the last 30 years, like this pure unhinged enthusiasm.
It's been surpassed by Ted too now.
For some terribly mid-content. It's an embarrassment of riches. That's the thing with the PS2.
There's just the breadth of choices available has actually got me in that choice paralysis. When I was looking at what my top picks should be, what I'm putting in which categories because so many of them apply to a multitude of different categories. So it's going to be really interesting.
I don't really have a game plan. I really shit the bed on the PS4 draft when I tried to outmaneuver you, Sam.
No, you did pretty well. You were winning that draft until they went live and then, sorry, when I put up the screen grab of the games we picked. For some reason, mine written down, people liked that more than yours written down.
I don't know why.
It was really my last Guardian Heads came out in full force. I was pretty poo-pooed by you both. But yeah, I didn't do too bad last time and who knows if the pole hadn't broken, I could have had a late surge.
But yeah, there's just a huge number of games. As I say, I came to a little late, but I think I've got some picks that I do have a few hard picks. Don't worry, I don't have any dead relatives this time, Sam, that I spent my evenings playing Prince of Persia, Sands of Time with just to pull at the heartstrings of the listeners.
But I think I've got some solid titles. Sentimentality, notwithstanding.
Well, you say that. I mean, my dead aunt loved Lord of the Rings, the third age. It was like her favorite.
You know what?
I will say some of the licensed games, I have a lot of licensed games on my list because you know what I'm like? There is some incredible licensed games at this time. This was really the peak of that genre.
You've got Spider-Man games where you've actually got Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst doing the voice work. Now, do they sound enthusiastic? Do they know where they are?
No, they don't. But you've got authenticity alongside actually a pretty spectacular product.
It's proper, sort of like the voice acting equivalent of, oh, I've got a two page review to do over the weekend freelance. I've got 120 quid and it's like an 80 hour RPG and I'm probably going to play it for like eight hours. That is the energy that Tobey Maguire brings to both those Spider-Man games on PS2.
Tell you what though, didn't those games have Bruce Campbell doing the tutorials?
They do, yeah.
He probably got paid the same for that as he did for his cameo in the films and no one told him not to make an effort. Those tutorials are the best bit of the game, voice acting wise.
They are good. I like that we have a licensed game category because I think that for a lot of people those games do define the PS2 experience to a large extent and you can pick one of the more acclaimed culty ones that have stood the test of time and me and Matthew will likely be wrestling over the same one we wrestled over last time, I imagine. But I think that's actually where you might pick up a few voters who are like, you know what, I really fucking liked The Simpsons hit and run to give an example.
You know, so I like we have more people picking so we're going to get just a slightly broader selection of some of those like weird edge cases that didn't score particularly well with reviewers but at the time were the big blockbusters of the time. So yeah, Matthew, how about you? How did you approach the picks and what do you think of the categories?
Yeah, the categories are good. There's lots of potential for you can starve some of the categories by putting the top picks in like free pick or 90 plus on Metacritic. But I'm also worried about starving categories not coming back to me quick enough because there's quite a lot of picks between the picks in this one because there are four of us.
So that's quite dangerous. As Ash said, I think there are a few genres which are weaker or slightly underserved, which means there's a bit more of a race for those. I could very well fuck this up.
I can already see on my shortlist several picks that I just haven't played, but I know are good. And I always hate having to pick those because people can tell what I'm full of shit. So yeah, let's see how that goes.
Yeah, an interesting test for the for reference, by the way, the category that Ash asked to be added to the to the to the list was rhythm action. Ash asked for that. I decided to weld Arcade onto that.
So people had a bit more choice of what they could pick for it. I agree. That's an interesting category.
There are definitely more than four interesting games in rhythm action specifically. That's a good one. Okay.
So let's get to the drafting then, because we've got a lot of games to talk about. So this is a snake draft. It is a four-way coin toss, basically, to determine who goes first, second, third and fourth.
So basically how that works is that basically you go 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the choice order reverses. So you go 4, 3, 2, 1, and then the person who's won then picks again. So it goes 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on and so forth until the draft is done.
So you can go quite a long time without a pick. You can go, I think it's like, is it like five picks each time that you miss out on before you pick again? It's, I guess it would be, yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?
Because of the two in the middle.
So it's like a Professor Layton logic puzzle, Sam.
The person who picks first doesn't get to pick another game for six games.
Yeah, which is bonkers really. That's just a long, long time. A lot's going to come off the board in that time.
It's going to seem quite scary. It's going to be exciting. I think this is going to add some fun drama to the draft.
I share the fear of running out of things for certain categories.
I've only put in some categories two choices at the moment. I'm just going to absolutely just improvise when I get to it. It's going to be bad.
It's going to be bad.
Yeah. Well, then.
How many Lord of the Rings games are there? Just checking.
I think there are three, and not counting the Vivendi one that was an adaptation of the book. That was apparently Ass, or the Hobbit game, which was also apparently a bit weird. Okay.
Good. In which case, I will recap the categories one more time before we get into it, and decide who's going to be picking first, second, third and fourth. Good Lord.
It's getting quite dramatic in here. Category 1, 90 plus and Metacritic. Category 2, RPG.
Category 3, Sports or Racing. Category 4, Survival Horror or Stealth. Category 5, Licensed Game.
Category 6, PS2 exclusive. Category 7, Shooter or Platformer. Category 8, Open World.
Category 9, Rhythm Action or Arcade. Category 10, Wildcard and Category 11, Free Pick. Matthew, do you want to do the honors?
Yeah, so I've created a wheel of names. So I think rather than the first name picks where they... Are we going to do it that way or is it just the first name is number one?
First name is number one, I think. It gets too complicated otherwise.
So going first is... It's me.
Hey!
What a coincidence.
No, genuinely, I swear, I swear.
He never goes first either. I always win the fucking coin toss apart from one time.
Going second is...
Genuinely nervous.
Me too.
It's Ash.
Oh, the worst person. Well, actually, that's probably the best person.
Going third is...
Clonowa coming off the board straight away.
It's Samuel.
Oh, I think it's good being last.
So Dave, it's number four.
I think it's good, because I get two picks off the bat.
All right then, so there we have it. First, Matthew, second, Ashley Day.
Oh, I hate going first so much.
Third, me, and fourth, the late, great Dave Scarborough. Okay, all right, so I've got to keep track of this as it goes. So people remember this with the PS4 draft.
I was really bad at being a producer at the same time as hosting the podcast and expect that to happen again, but we'll see how it goes.
Where's your Greg?
Everyone should track themselves as best they can. I thought one extra rule, didn't we have only one version of a game can be picked? Isn't that right?
Yes, absolutely. So when we originally did this, it was very much a PS2 mini we were building. If you want to conceptualize it that way in your head as we build these lists, go for it.
I think we also talked about the idea of whether we can justify certain games being PS2 games when they maybe had another life on a different format, Resi 4 being the main example of that. But the one hard rule that we did have was yes, you can't pick two versions of the same game. So if you pick Metal Gear Solid 2 Substance, for example, you can't then take Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty just to stop any kind of shitty behavior going on or at least holding it back a little bit.
There will definitely be some shitty behavior in this draft. Okay, Matthew, anything else to establish or should we get into it?
No, no.
You're stalling. Pick, pick, my friend, go.
I don't think there is like one killer pick.
Not necessarily, no.
I believe there are certain killer picks for certain genres.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
Imagine if I picked Shadows of Memories first. I'm going to pick, just to get it off the board, for Open World. I'm going to pick Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
I remember last time there was some to-ing and throwing over San Andreas and Vice City, whether that Vice City, while the smaller, earlier game had a bit more character to it, you know, just in terms of the music makeup and the period it's set in. But I do think just the epic scale of San Andreas and what it was trying to do, the almost insane level of simulation with the eating to get fat and exercising to get thin, a story that took you between three different cities, all that countryside in between. It just felt beyond anything I'd ever played at the time.
GTA is always a tricky one because I feel like obviously there are newer versions of this, but there is always a reason to go back to them. And I think a lot of people played it, I think a lot of people still have fondness for this game if you ignore the horrible difficulty spikes. So I think that is still the solid pick for open world.
It's interesting because you did pick Vice City last time. And I feel like more people said that Vice City was the superior pick because they liked the 80s setting and the vibes more. But I agree that this is a defining PS2 title in terms of scale, what you can achieve with the hardware, having three cities rather than just one.
Definitely like the weird cult around CJ as a character, the fact that we still live with that fucking CJ meme all these years later, and CJ is always the first character modded into Breath of the Wild or whatever, or any game you can think of. Just shows that there is an enduring appeal to San Andreas, it is singular to that game. So I think it's a good pick, Matthew.
Thank you.
You didn't fuck it.
I think it's the obvious pick, right? And I'm not saying that to disregard it at all, I think that's probably at the top of most of our lists, apart from Ash.
It wasn't my first pick.
I think it's the highest scoring game on the console, right? On Metacritic.
I think that's true, yes. But yeah.
Not that that means anything, but you know.
I think there are three games that tie for like the sexy pick straight up.
So I remember like physically shaking going into HMV to buy Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. It felt like such a momentous occasion in gaming, like unlike anything before it. I just remember just being so hyped up to the point of like my adrenaline spiking.
Ash, I'm guessing you have no regard for this game whatsoever.
Ash, do you know what Grand Theft Auto is? There's one on DS, of course.
I played Chinatown Wars and I had a great time. I worked at a game station when this came out and we had mountains, mountains and mountains of copies that you couldn't see over the counter. It was just people queuing through the door one after another.
That's all they were buying that day. So that's my memory of it. I've never played it.
That's why you're here, pal.
Is it on your list, Ash? No.
Amazing. Then we come to the second pick, which is Ash.
Well, I'm so interested. I'm so interested.
Strap in. I think I've got here, probably, Sam, you said there's a top three games we should be going for. I think I've got one of those games.
It's a very, very mainstream game, but I've found a way to make it obscure and retro.
Okay, go on.
So, in survival horror or stealth, I'm going to go for Metal Gear Solid 3, Subsistence.
Yeah, that was the pick I wanted first, so well done.
Sorry, Sam.
Sorry.
Arguably the best Metal Gear game, I think, certainly the most complete feeling, in my opinion. A game so wonderful, they're going to spend a lot of money remaking it this year. Everyone knows it.
I think I don't need to go into loads of detail there, but specifically, Subsistence, not for the online bonus mode that nobody played, but for the 2D MSX Metal Gear games that came included on the bonus disc. Especially Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake, which at that time, I think it was about 2006, it was the first time ever that game had been released in Europe, officially localizing to English. And you know what?
Those 2D games are bloody good. I think if you love Metal Gear Solid and you go back and play those old games, you'd be surprised at how much of a great time you would have. Metal Gear Solid basically is a remake of Metal Gear 2 in 3D.
So they're wonderful games with all of the Hideo Kojima source that you would expect. So that's my pick.
Yep, it's a great pick. I do think it's the Metal Gear to take here. Like the subsistence 3D camera means it still holds up pretty well.
This is the version, you know, minus HD graphics that me and Matthew played for our playthrough in 2023 of the podcast. And we both had a great time still. Great foundation for the remake that's coming up.
So yes, a good pick, Ash.
Is this where you salt the earth on any one pick in MGS2?
No, because there's 44 fucking draft picks.
You get a Batman Arkham Knight this thing.
Well, you know what, there are no Batmobile sections in MGS2, are there, Dave? So, you know, that's a differentiator, isn't it? Yeah, so I did think that would be what Ash would take, though.
There's a lot left on the board. So I've got one pick now before Dave gets his two picks, and it's back to me. All right, so I think we're going to run out of oxygen on Category 8 Open World quite quickly.
So I'm going to take Grand Theft Auto Vice City for that category. So have fun taking GTA 3 and arguing why that's better than Vice City in San Andreas, when I'm literally the only person on this planet who believes that. But I don't have to talk about that this time.
Vice City, it was basically the foundation of GTA 3, but with the Sunkist Miami visuals riffing on the look and vibe of Miami Vice with this satirical Rockstar edge and this absolutely stacked licensed soundtrack, you really just saw the money they made from GTA 3 on the screen in this game. And also just the sort of elevation in production values around the cinematics, having famous voice actors involved, that kind of stuff. And also adding like a flying to the game, which was a huge addition.
That was just something you always craved doing in GTA 3, but you could only ever make the fucking dodo plane go around having like helicopters in here and airplanes. Just really exciting. I think to a lot of people it's the iconic PS2 GTA.
San Andreas definitely has the scale, but I think like the character, this is the one that people think of as the defining PS2 GTA. So yeah, like a quintessential pick. And one I need to get off the board because I just worry a bit about open world running out of gas.
So what do you think of that pick, guys? Matthew, any thoughts?
I like it. I'm so fucking far away from my next pick. It's unreal.
I've definitely done this correctly, haven't I? This is how it's supposed to work.
Yeah, it is right, but it also fucking sucks.
Okay, good. Dave, do you like Vice City?
Oh, I love Vice City. It was my first pick, is what I would have gone with. Everything you said is correct.
And honestly, nothing demonstrates how little I understand about game development and the fact that they made this in a year, right, after GTA 3. So like having to have the success of GTA 3 and turn that round and create Vice City, you know, as you say, which is just the experience of GTA 3 amped up in so many different ways. It's just astounding to me.
And then on the opposite side of things, taking however many, what was it, like 10 years since GTA 5 to 12 years. You know, game development, what is it? Like, how does that happen?
But no, I love this game. Effortously cool, it's all aesthetic and homage and homage. And it hasn't really been done with this sort of edge and style before or since, I don't think.
And it's a shame, really, Rockstar hasn't really gone back to doing period games, but I mean, I don't know if that's just because it takes some 12 years to make a game now, so they don't really have the chance. But it'd be great to see another GTA, like Vice City or San Andreas, that goes back in time.
Dave, would you trade one GTA 6 for 12 PS2 GTAs? Would you do it?
Yeah, probably. I feel like GTA 6, not to go on too much for tangent, I feel like GTA 6 is going to feel very much like GTA 5. I just don't know how.
From that one trade we've had, it doesn't feel differentiated enough, just like new map.
Yeah, we'll see though. Like Red Dead 2 really steps things up in terms of simulation and sort of like the environment and that kind of stuff. So I'm kind of curious to see.
I think they've probably got some gas in the tank there, but I hear your concerns, Dave.
Let's not write off these Rock Star guys yet. You know, I got a feeling they know what they're doing. You know.
Indeed. So Dave, we come to your two picks in a row. Excited to hear them.
I'm excited to hear them too. I actually don't know what I'm going to do now. I was going to go GTA 5C.
I think I'm going to go Survival Horror, Silent Hill 2, off the board.
Solid.
Yeah. Yeah. I think that that I need because that's also a tricky category.
Obviously just been remade. It's one of the sort of defining horror experiences of all time in gaming. Iconic monsters in it with Pyramid Head.
The story as well is just really well told for its time. I'm a bit of a wimp, so it was quite effective on me. I found it to be genuinely like a significant step up in terms of horror and tension than the Resident Evil franchise and well, of that time.
And it felt like a more, to me at least, a sort of more maturely developed horror experience than what was sort of available around that time.
Yeah, it's the defining PS2 survival horror game. There is a fairly decent bench of these, but there are none that really have this reputation to them. The remake this year speaks to the maturity, you allude to there, Dave, like just the themes and the way they're presented in the game via the enemies and then like the different endings that tap into the psychology of James as a character and the things that he's done.
It's amazing. A good first pick for sure. Ash, do you have any take on this one?
I was more of a Resident Evil guy back in those days and I still am really. Like this is a real blind spot for me. So maybe I'll play the remake.
It's, I hear it's good.
It is really good. Dave, sorry, you had something else to say there.
I was going to say the Silent Hill movie is actually pretty good. I feel like it's underrated.
No, it's not. It's got fucking Sean Bean in that room for about two hours. Being like, oh, should I go to Silent Hill?
And that's what he does in that entire film, basically.
There is a whole part of the movie that's in Silent Hill, but it's very effective.
Yeah, a bit of Pyramid Head walking around, good production values. It gets a two and a half on letter box out of me, dog.
I mean, it's like a free from me, but you know, it's a respectable effort given the sort of failings of the video game adaptations.
Matthew, any thoughts on this pick?
I'm just sad with every good game that goes from this category because I am several picks away from it.
I hear that. I understand your anxiety.
I feel like I'm sitting at a restaurant and all these amazing dishes are like coming past me and I can see what everyone else is eating. And for some reason, the menu is not going to let me order any of them and that sucks. So it's really bad being first.
Lots of go on.
Okay. Well, good to know. Dave, what's your next pick?
See, I think there's less room for shithouse-ery in this because it's so long till it comes back to me that I can't just take something to annoy you because I have like three solid games here that I know are like Sam Hart picks. And I know I've got a couple of Ash ones too, but I think I've got to go with what the people want and it's tough. So I'm going to go PS2 exclusive.
I think this is the right choice. It's really hard. I'm going to go Shadows of the Colossus.
Oh, Dave. Shadow of the Colossus, Dave.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shadow of the Colossus, whatever.
Whatever. Have you played it?
Yeah, I've played it. You know what though, I'll tell you my first experience of this game. Has anyone seen the movie Rain Over Me starring Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle?
No, no one's seen it.
I'm aware of the game's relationship to the film.
It's a major part of the plot of that movie. So Adam Sandler's family are killed in 9-11, and the way he processes his grief is playing Shadow of the Colossus.
Dave, you said no dead relatives.
Doesn't seem like a laughing matter to me, Dave.
I mean, it's a very, very powerful, nuanced story of grief and the lengths we go to to deal with it via this incredible PlayStation 2 exclusive Shadow of the Colossus. So I think we have to respect that, that it transcended its humble roots in gaming to become a more important piece of art within a wider literature.
Watch Dave link every one of his picks to a shit film from the noughties.
I really hope people don't vote on this just on the list. I hope they listen to the episode and see Dave tarnish each of his picks with his cursed film references.
He hasn't said a single thing about the game.
I just told you about the game. So, anyway.
What is the story of Shadow Clusters? What are you doing in this game, Dave?
The guy's doing a thing. He's going up and killing the... I know the ending.
No, but why is he doing it? What's his motivation?
He's protecting a girl. I played it a long time ago. He's protecting a girl, right?
No, he's not protecting a girl.
Oh, I don't know then. He's killing the monsters and then Twist, it turns out he was the monster all along.
No, that will do. That's fine. But I agree, people please listen to the draft and at least factor your film references into your vote.
It's not about how much I appreciate the game. I can appreciate the film that appreciates the game. The fact of the matter is, it's a great game, it's a PS2 exclusive and it belongs at the top of anyone's list.
And I think you're all being... I think you're being a little condescending and frankly, I think the audience should mark points on the three of you.
Dave's like, this game would be improved with Batmobile sections, that's your take.
All games would be improved if they appeared in Adam Sandler movies.
That's all I'm saying. Okay, I'll do Dave's job for him. This is an unbelievably good game, a mix of adventure, but also puzzles and combat.
Each of the colossi you encounter are just... The design of them is completely distinctive, how you beat them is completely distinctive. The environment around them has been thought about in loads of detail.
There's a fucking terrifying sand snake in there. There's massive monsters sitting in a valley waiting for you. And some of the most horrible, spooky shit, and some of the borderline cute ones that are tiny, you grab onto and once you kill them, you feel terrible.
I mean, it really just runs the gamut of emotions. And in terms of pushing the PS2 and what it could do visually, this game is unbelievable. There's a reason the framerate judders every time one of these things smash it into the ground around you.
It's just doing things that no other PS2 game could do with scale and drama and the music's incredible. And so, yeah, I think this is an essential PS2 pick, Dave. I'm not surprised it's come off the board this time.
And I will add to actually speak to the game and sort of the feelings it evokes in a player.
Oh, that's good of you.
Yeah, sorry. Well, you know, you read the description on the back of the box, and I respect that. What it does with scale and how imposing it is and threatening it is as a player, it felt very unique.
Like, I don't think, and correct me if I'm wrong, because of, you know, especially Ash, who's very, he's more of a professor in old games. But I don't think there was a game before it. And the only thing I could think of is God of War after it, where you got that sense of scale, where it just felt so intimidating.
It felt so overbearing on the player. And that was something really striking to me when I played it. I think that was just incredible.
Incredible first time experience.
Yeah, I think the God of War games tap into that. I think some of the From games tap into that as well.
Did God of War come before Shadow of the Colossus? I can't remember.
I believe the first one did arrive before Shadow of the Colossus. So yeah, you hide your fight on the boat and stuff that was in... Actually, no, maybe it was a contemporary.
It might have been end of 05, God of War. Certainly close anyway. Maybe it was early 06, Shadow of the Colossus.
I will say, the idea of a big boss, a very large screen filling boss is as old as time, but the difference with Shadow of the Colossus was you were clinging on to the backs of those giant bosses. They were the level itself and you were trying to traverse up them while they're flying around or try to shake you off. I think that's what made it really, really exciting to play.
That's the thing that had never been done before.
Sounds like we've all got a lot to say about this classic game, which really speaks to its importance and relevance on the top of my list.
That's because you shat the bed when you talked about Adam Sandler, mate. Moving on then, next pick. So it's back to me.
I do think that in some ways, the draft is determined by what are the hot things that people played and remembered from the time. I will pick that because I see enough of those game names in there to determine my pick based on that. And so with that in mind, for category 190 plus on Metacritic, I'm going to take Final Fantasy 10.
There are a lot of RPGs on this system. PlayStation, early PlayStation were very good for this genre. And I was a little bit nervous about this category boxing me in a bit too much in terms of genre.
And a couple of things I wanted have already gone for this category. So I was conscious of that. This is one of my favorite games of all time.
It pushed the series forward in terms of presentation. An unbelievable amount of detail in Spira, the first properly 3D Final Fantasy game that they did. You can't really move the camera around much, but there is a guided camera that shows you this world in detail that you could never see on the PS1 with its static backgrounds and the lack of detail in the world map between all of those static backgrounds.
So this is them pushing forward in terms of environmental presentation, but also storytelling. Fully voiced cutscenes, which I'll fully cop to the voice acting being quite bad. Some of the best combat in Final Fantasy's history though, turn-based, but you always know what the order is, so you can affect the outcome of turns based on what you know is coming up and how fast your characters are and that sort of thing.
One of the best progression systems of all time in the Sphere Grid. I've seen it riffed on so many times by different games, but I still think it's the best at doing what it does. Just moving around this giant board, unlocking nodes to get new abilities and improve your stats.
And of course, as Final Fantasy always does, it's amazing music as well and just like one of the great RPG stories, even if the voice acting doesn't necessarily live up to it. I think I even just saw people this past weekend talking about the ending of this game in the Discord, Matthew. So, FFX, Matthew, what do you think of this pick?
One of the few Final Fantasies I have experienced through to the end, is playing it with Catherine. I like the Hawaiian vibes. I think it's an exceedingly well-disguised linear path around a load of islands.
Didn't get too much into the end games. It looks stressful as shit. Really like the way the guy says, shoo puff.
That's basically it.
A very rich set of observations. I don't want Dave to link this to a shit movie from 2008. So I'll ask Ash what he thinks of this game.
Did you play this game, Ash?
No, never played it. I'm really sorry. I can't even muster.
I can't even fake it, I'm afraid.
This is going to be Ash's reaction to like 60% of the draft picks. He hasn't played any GTAs. He hasn't played any Final Fantasies.
I still think you're a good guy, Ash.
Okay, moving on then.
So we're back to...
I like how you didn't come to me because you know I have no affection whatsoever for the Final Fantasy series. As much as I love unlocking nodes to improve my stats, I've yet to really fall in love with the Final Fantasy franchise.
Well, that's okay because I know a lot of people love this game. But I think again, the reason I wanted to have us four on this draft is because I knew we'd all have some areas of commonality and some areas where we're specialists. Yeah, FF10 feels like a banner pick to me, but the listeners will decide.
Ash, what's your next pick?
Don't worry, this podcast will really grind to a halt when I pick a load of stuff that only I can talk about and it's just going to be dead air when you go around the room. So look forward to that. What am I going to go with next?
I feel like I should go to open world because it's diminishing, but I also feel like I feel like Dave will just go for a game I don't care about in that category.
He's going to pick GTA 3 and he'll go look guys at what the film was. Whoa, whoa, whoa, spoilers!
Has anyone seen the movie Drive starring Ryan Gosling?
Go on Ash.
Okay, I'll go 90 plus on Metacritic and I will go Devil May Cry.
The original?
The original Devil May Cry 3, which I think is better, as far as I could tell, did not have 90 plus on Metacritic.
Okay, interesting.
Yeah. You may want to fact check that, but I'm pretty sure that is the case. Anyway.
That is true.
I've checked it earlier. Cool. I'm quite happy to take Devil May Cry.
This is the game I bought my Japanese PS2 for. I remember walking into Computer Exchange in Leeds and they were playing on the counter, the staff were, and I was just like, what the hell is that? One of those games where I just felt like I'd never seen anything like it before.
It's so fast, so stylish. It felt like it was resurrecting. Like, arcade beat-em-ups, like Final Fight and Streets of Rage, but in this entirely new way that took advantage of 3D, was super cool, super imaginative.
Being able to launch someone in the air and then juggle them with your gunfire. Also, while controlling this really cool guy, like, cool for the time, I'm not sure people would describe Dante as cool now, but in that post-Matrix world, he definitely was. Yeah, this was a system seller for me, and I think it's still a really special game.
Yeah, I love this game as well. I think I slightly prefer Death May Cry 3 because it has all the different styles in it, but it was undeniably iconic. It was a version of Resi 4 that went on a different, basically a fork in the road, became this much wilder, weirder game, fighting lots of giant puppets in this big castle.
It's such a Capcom ass game. It's wonderful, and it's one of those sort of PS2, just even all of these new series that pop up out of nowhere, and I just suddenly just feel so legitimate and exciting. And this was basically the 3D version of this genre being birthed, basically, this kind of hack and slash experience.
Like it would never been done to this level anywhere else. I love Devil May Cry. Ash, it's a very good pick.
Okay. Matthew Castle, are you in this draft, Matthew? It's been so long since you picked, I don't even remember.
So then, we come back to you, Matthew.
For 90 plus on Metacritic, I'm going to take Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty.
Intriguing.
Weirdly, the later, substance version is only 84 on Metacritic. This was 94 on Metacritic. That might be wrong as a thing that happened, but it's true for the sake of this draft.
Part of it is about having some big name recognition in that number one slot at the top of when you write out the list. Because I know what people will like when they look at these things. They're a carcinese from the beginning.
I'm happy to put Metal Gear, any Metal Gear on PS2 up against Devil May Cry and Final Fantasy X, personally. Definitely an uneven game. Some people love it, not everyone loves it.
But I did love what a step up it was in terms of stealth mechanics, AI behaviors from the original Metal Gear Solid. I think there's arguably a bigger leap there than there is between two and three. As an actual structure of the game, like Kojima's obsession with the cinematic, definitely hamstrings a lot of the oil rig section of this game.
But taking in isolation, I think that the tanker is still one of the best half hours Kojima has ever made, in terms of just a small space with lots of interesting props, lots of interesting room shapes that all those systems can just come through. There's a reason everyone played that demo to death. They may not have loved the rest of the game, but I think it's certainly strong enough to be worth revisiting and replaying now.
This is a great game about hosing down bombs with coolant spray. It's the best PS2 game that does that.
It is that too, yeah.
And that goes on for much longer than the tanker section.
Yeah, yes, but you can replay the tanker section and people do and people love it.
It would be funny if you picked the demo for MGS2 and not the actual game. That would have been a funny pivot, but...
That would have been strong.
It's a defining PS2 game no matter what. It was the... What I recall as being the most hyped game of this generation.
And then over time, opinion on it has gone up and down. Obviously a lot of its themes in the story have remained relevant. I think it's only a slightly weaker pick because MGS3 is a better game.
But I see your logic in having it right at the very top there.
It is interesting how that perception shifted over time. Because I remember when Metal Gear Solid 3 was announced and previewed, people treated it like it was going to be a little bit gimmicky. Like, oh, it's the 60s, James Bond, it's the silly Metal Gear.
And they're all silly Metal Gears. Where actually I think it's definitely stood the test of time. It's just a much more substantial game than 2.
But I don't think you can have a mini PS2 or a PS2 draft without Metal Gear in the mix, personally.
Wow, I'm satisfied.
Well, I am going to say that because I've got one.
I mean, yeah, I'd say the same about fucking Silent Hill 2 or FF10 or Vicey, but whatever.
Yeah, that's absolutely fair. For my second pick.
I was going to say, I was just going to add, I think I personally think MGS2 is better than Snake Eater. I love this game. It was one of the two games I got when I bought my PS2 and I played it a few times through.
I just absolutely adored it.
Bad take, Dave. Next pick.
I know it's a bad pick, but I just want to say nothing has scared me more playing a video game than when it tells you to turn your console off. I've been playing it for about 10 hours one night, like into my evening as a kid, and then it turned you to turn your console off, just freaked me the fuck out. I turned it off and ran downstairs and to my parents, they were like, you're right.
I was like, I don't want to talk about it.
The game was turning on me like I was having some sort of psychiatric breakdown, psychological breakdown.
Well, a nice gentle anecdote there. Ash, do you have any quick thoughts on MGS2?
It's definitely the weaker of the two Metal Gears on this list. In fact, it's the weaker of the four Metal Gears on this list, if you include the MSX games that are in subsistence. So I'll leave it at that.
The earth has been salted, nothing may ever grow again. Matthew, next pick. Your last pick for about 10 years.
Yeah, so I've got to make it a good one.
I was just looking up who did the sound drive for Metal Gear Solid 2, because I thought it was Hans Zimmer, but it's Harry Griggs and Williams.
Harry Griggs and Williams.
For PS2 Exclusive, so kind of launch on Xbox, PC or Gamecube this gen, I'm going to take Akami.
Interesting, this early for Akami?
Which category?
PS2 Exclusive. Yeah, I don't think that's that wild a pick. I think there's a lot of affection for it.
Certainly, I know from fellow Nintendo heads, this was not completely correctly, but sort of seen as the closest thing to a Zelda or like on PS2. So, it was like highly desirable for that reason before you even got to the amazing art style and just the sort of sheer weirdness of it. It is a bit of a cult pick, but it's a very aggressive, loud cult.
Maybe there's a bit of Akami love in the air because of the sequel recently announced. But you know, I remember seeing this in magazines and thinking it was absolutely impossible that it could exist, that a game could look like this and function like I had just, you know, no idea how these painterly stills would translate into a game. And it did translate into quite a robust action game, very strange control scheme where you paint your attacks into the battle arenas to attack people.
But one that you certainly master over a very long adventure. And also just a game with an amazing sense of humor. I think it takes all this Japanese mythology as its source material, but then riffs on it in a really silly way, something I really associate with Kamiya.
I think it's one of his more successfully outright funny games. I think he's struggled to ever really find that tone again in Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101. This is, I think, so characterful and narratively rich in that sense, as well as just that beautiful ornate art style.
So, yeah, I'm confident in this one.
Interesting.
I like it.
You do fight those bosses a long time, a lot of times, but it is undeniably gorgeous and definitely probably the number one best looking game on the system because of that art style. Ashley, thoughts on this one? Feels like some of you would have played.
Played it when it came out. Never finished it. It's a very, very long, very long game, but it's quite beautiful.
Bought it again on Switch a couple of weeks ago when the sequel got announced for like Â£2 or something. It was like dirt cheap in the sale, so I will be playing it again. I'm looking forward to it.
Good pick. Indeed. Good pick.
So good. IGN put their logo on the box.
So then we come back to you, Ash.
Okay. Right. I'm thinking open world.
There aren't many picks left. Yes, Dave may go with GTA 3, which I've never played. I'm really weak on open world because in this era, weren't really any Japanese developers making open world games.
I've got a couple in front of me. They're quite unorthodox picks. I'm going to go with Spider-Man 2.
I knew it. I knew you would.
I like that. I like that pick. That's good.
There's a couple of good reasons. One, I hoped it would hurt Dave and it sounds like it has.
It hasn't hurt me. No, it's fine.
But seriously, this was a really fun spin on the open world genre. I think also it was a great way to step up with a licensed game and do something ambitious. Those swinging mechanics, they've stood the test of time and they've been refined and refined over the years.
It's still making for great open-world superhero games to this day. I think swinging around that city is a real joy.
It's undeniably the thing in my head of the Insomniac game soft replaces this. Indeed, the reason for that Insomniac game to exist was that no one had ever captured the Spider-Man experience again as well as this. It's like the license changed hands.
Well, it didn't change hands, but different developers had a go at it within Activision and they were all worse than Spider-Man 2. It really did take 14 years for a game this good with Spider-Man in it to be made again. I think it's a good choice, Ash.
I had a delightful summer in 04 playing this. I was so high on the Raimi films. They were obviously key techs for teenagers going to the cinema at the time, so mega hyped about this.
Love the fact they were like, we're just going to put Black Cat in this game, even though she wasn't in the film. Just the kind of creative license people used to be able to take in the slightly more cowboy era of licensed games, really. Yeah, really enjoyed that.
I get really confused with this game because I downloaded an illegal ROM of it originally and the PC version was vastly different to the console version where you didn't have free swinging. It wasn't an open city. You had specific circles, targets that you could only swing through.
So I get confused which missions are in the crap version I played for about a month before I realized there was a good version out there that everyone was talking about. I thought everyone was having this fantastic experience with this game that was just, for me, terrible and then discovered there was this much much more.
Sounds like you got what you deserved, Dave.
I know.
That's why you shouldn't pirate games.
I was young and poor.
Yeah, fair enough. That is true about Dave.
And also I make up stories so if anyone is listening from, you know, works at the police, you know, who's to say whether I'm telling the truth? There is no evidence out there.
An older boy made Dave do it basically. That's the stance we take on this podcast.
The great thing about this game, Dave, is that you can't relate it to a crap film.
Well, it's got Bluish Campbell in it, so I actually can relate it to several crap films. And that is a shot at you.
It's time to move on, but yes, I like that. I wasn't even really thinking of that as an open world game, which is stupid really in retrospect, but it's a good choice. It was on my list.
I thought of, I guess in my head, it was like a licensed game, but obviously it is open world. It's a good pick. Okay, next choice then.
I think I am going to take, because I think it went down super well last time, category five licensed game. I'm going to take The Warriors. I need you to do that.
I don't like this game. Oh, sorry, Sam, go on. You tell everyone why it's great.
Ah, it's aâ€¦ ha ha, motherfucker. It's a brawler by Rockstar Games.
It takes the film, The Warriors, the kind of cult film, and expands on it in a bunch of different ways. Like, it adds a bunch of story before and then links up to the story of the film, including re-enacting the kind of cutscenes with the original voice actors, after a really complete ultimate sort of Warriors fan work and a great co-op brawler. It's the only co-op Rockstar game of this generation, and it was great fun to play in split-screen.
Just going around hitting guys with bricks, spray painting things, going around these slightly cursed-looking kind of 80s New York streets, this sort of hyper-real, almost like a slightly dystopian version of New York. There's like these weird music riffing in the background, all of these really distinctive gangs fighting each other, chunky combat, a bit... We just did a podcast on Bully Me and Matthew, which would have been a good pick for Open World Game, by the way.
And in that, we decided that, you know, the strength of doing the kind of like melee focus of the Rockstar game is that you don't have the slightly fraught shooting that you have in the GTAs. And this has that in common with Bully, just that great thumpy combat, smashing things up, chucking enemies around, just great fun. And just a really mega distinctive licensed game about something so unusual.
Yeah, nothing ever really like it before, or nothing before or since has been like it really. Matthew, what do you think of this pick, as the guy picked it last time?
I think it's great for all those reasons. I just like the exercise of can we take a thing, really pay homage to it, also extend it in really sensitive ways, just capture the vibe of it, everything that's cool about it. Did this come before Bully?
I can't remember if you said.
I think it did by about like six months, something like that.
Yeah, but again, I quite like the combat system, I think is just complex enough to be interesting, but still like punchy and raw enough to feel great.
I feel like this is a game and a movie that people pretend they like, but is actually very mediocre.
Oh fuck off. Don't sound like a piece of shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He went through so much, Matthew. What have these guys gone through? Oh, it's tough times on the streets, you know, whatever.
Fucking Cleon gets killed at the start of the film and then they get chased down to be killed and kicked to death by gangs, Dave. You haven't even seen it, you motherfucker.
I have seen it and it's boring. No one talks about this with any affection.
What a dickhead. Mega dickhead. That is just not true at all.
This is like the definition of a cult film, this. It's a Walter Hill film for fuck's sake.
What does that mean?
He can make bad movies too.
Okay, David's pretending the Warriors is bad and worse than the Silent Hill movie and Rain Over Me with Adam Sandler because he's a dickhead. So, with that in mind, we do go to his next pick. And I look forward to hearing about some shitty 2008 comedy that no one remembers.
Rain Over Me is definitely not a comedy. I just want to put that out there. Right, okay.
I think there's two things I have to go for.
No, there aren't. Whatever you're gonna say, there aren't.
I think there's two things I have to go for, I think, but there's a bunch of games on my list that I just really want to pick now, but I know I would be sacrificing, because I've lost a lot of stuff that was on my list. MGS2, Akami, were both sort of on my next list. I think I'm gonna do this one first.
I think I have to do it for open world, and I think I have to have a Grand Theft Auto on there. You can't have a PS2 console without a Grand Theft Auto, so I'm gonna go Grand Theft Auto 3, and whilst I do agree that it's not the best out of the bunch, I would rate it higher than San Andreas for me personally. For my personal taste, I have more affection for it, because it's a more straightforward game.
I wasn't really into the whole sort of like working out, keeping on top of your relationships in San Andreas, the territory stuff. GTA 3 was just such a phenomenon for me as a young guy, like going around people's house, first going and playing it around people's houses, and that sort of like, almost like this secret, this sort of thing that we weren't allowed to speak about out loud in front of our parents in case they took it away from us, because it was so ultra violent. It was so out there compared to what other games were doing at the time.
Only the only thing that was comparable to it was sort of Mortal Kombat in the 90s. It was just this really visceral, smack around the head of what games could do when there were no rules. And so, you know, I remember we were just doing past the pad on it, you know, on who can survive five stars the longest, you know, sticking all the cheats on, doing like just stuff like that outside of the missions and the, and sort of the exploring the map and completing the side missions and all that stuff.
The stuff you're meant to do, there was just so much to the game that just made it so immersive and enjoyable and endlessly replayable. Along with MGS2, it was the other game that I got when I bought my PS2. It's a classic.
It launched the franchise.
It didn't launch the franchise, Dave.
Didn't they?
Okay. It launched what the franchise would then become.
It supercharged the franchise.
Let me re-say that then. It defined the franchise and what it would be moving forward because it was just such a huge hit and so unlike anything else. We're still talking about GTA today and all three of the GTA games on the PS2 are classics.
Let's just say it doesn't matter which one you have, you're going to have a good time whichever one you're playing.
Much like 2008's Pineapple Express, he says, it's a classic.
You know I'm right on this though.
I love GTA 3. I only question it because I don't think there was a rush to pick this, because I doubt Matthew would use another slot for it. I wasn't planning on doing it.
Ash, as established, is not really bothered about GTA. So what was the rush to get GTA 3 off the wall?
Well, because I didn't have a good open world, and I felt like Ash might have taken it despite me. But both of you both had GTAs. So I just didn't want to risk it.
But why not wait and pick something spicy? Because there's no question you're drawing a strategy.
It's like what, eight picks before I get back to me? Things are going to get desperate.
Well, I love GTA 3 and it has got its own specific tone. I keep banging on about this video that said GTA 3 is a horror game, which is not strictly true. But it does have a slightly unusual, spooky vibe to it.
It's a little bit odd, the kind of feel of the world, this kind of like slightly taxi driver-esque vibe they're going for with it. I'm very fond of it. It's good.
It's just obviously, it's a bit stripped back feature-wise compared to Vice City and Silent Dress. Nonetheless, they're defining a PS2 game. What's your next pick, Dave?
Is Joey Pantz in GTA 3?
He is. I think he plays-
The only GTA game with Joey Pantz in it.
I think that's right. I think he plays Luigi and then Michael Madsen plays the other guy. I can't remember his name.
We need to know.
Tony. That's it. Tony Cipriani.
Joey Pantz certified.
Next pick, Dave.
So I'm going to go... And this was another category that was looking a bit sweaty for me. 90 plus Metacritic.
And I mean, you look at the list, there's a lot of Madden games, which obviously none of us are going to go for. I'm going to go for one of the, again, one of the defining franchises of PlayStation in general, which started on the PS2, which is God of War. Now, I could have gone God of War 2, but I actually prefer the first God of War.
It's difficult one to articulate what I love so much about it. It's the combat is obviously just so visceral, really chunky. Again, it's that gratuitousness at that age when blood, guts, violence, things that aren't necessarily actually mature when you think about it, but feel mature at that young age when you're like 13, 14.
Yeah, it just took this sort of unique spin on sort of the mythos of Greek gods that I really loved. I kind of prefer this to the modern take on God of War personally, just like this full-rage, no-nuance version of Kratos. But I do like the newer games, but this kicked it all off and the boss battles are just outstanding.
Again, much like Shadow of the Colossus, it's a game that centers around these huge boss battles that felt sort of unreal at the time. And yeah, it's just a great game.
It's a good game. It's a great game, Sam.
I think it's a great game.
In our episode, God of War Games Rank Narok, I love that we called it that. Back in 2022, we did put two above one, but one was still above Chains of Olympus.
So I think most people would put two above it. I played them both recently. I can't remember.
Did you have a reissue on PS4? I feel like.
Nope. Well, they've not.
Why did I play them again? I played them again in the last few years. I definitely preferred one.
And maybe because I'm dumb and the puzzles were harder in two. That might have been why. But I had a much better time with one.
What is certain about this game is that they arrive out of the gates with what they want it to be. It's not like it takes its time to find its feet. It's that they know immediately what the action is.
And the action remains the same basically throughout this entire iteration of God of War. So it's very confident out of the gates. It feels great out of the gates and the spectacle is there from the start.
There's a really bad bit of a desert in this and some very frustrating moments, but it's a great game. Matthew, what do you think about this one?
I am very much in the God of War 2 camp. God of War 2 is better camp. But yeah, as something that turned up and had something new to say in the way that it mixed the action with the quick time events and the epic cinematic takedowns.
It had a real sense of style that marked it out. Not as deep an action again as like a Devil May Cry or what Cameo and the Platinum guys have gone on to do. But a really satisfying version of this.
It's definitely more of a casuals action game, which is the sweet spot for me personally. But yeah, Metacritic has it one whole point higher than God of War 2. So who are we to argue with Metacritic, especially in the category 90 plus Metacritic?
If anything, I pick in the best version of the game for that category.
2 has the greater spectacle, more variety and weapon design, enemy design, all that stuff. It's just bigger and better, Dave. But it's still a good pick, so it's all good.
Ashley, you ever played God of War? Is this your sort of thing?
Yeah, I'll say I agree with Dave. It is the casuals choice. I played this on a lunch break at Game Station when it came out.
It's getting so much hype. I was like, I've got to check this out. And yeah, I thought it was good.
How long was your lunch break?
Well, half an hour, an hour, like plenty of time to play one level of a game while, you know, holding a sandwich in the other hand. I've got three hands, as you know.
I realized how stupid it was to say that I was playing a game while holding a sandwich in the other hand. What did I think? I liked it, but I was already like devil may cry, pilled by this point, so I didn't buy into it and went back to playing Japanese masterpieces.
I bet you're intolerable going back to your colleagues like, oh, it's no devil may cry. And they were just like fucking ash.
Yep, probably.
And on that note then, we go on to my next pick, I believe, as it cycles back down to 4-3-2-1 for those keeping track. Okay, I'm going to take, for category six PS2 exclusive, I'm going to take Ico, or Ico, however you say it. I think it might actually be Ico.
Doesn't even know the title.
Probably the most influential game on the greatest number of games of anything that happened. Well, I suppose probably GTA 3 does actually exceed that technically, but every fucking indie game, well, at least a very large proportion of them, including the game NIVA, which I just played over the weekend, owe something to this game. Game where you play this exiled little horned lad who escapes this castle with this incarcerated princess, or at least you attempt to, and fend off these shadows while trying to get out of this huge, huge environment.
It is very minimalist in its design. You have no HUD. It's just so straightforward and so beautifully presented.
The art direction out of the gates just marks these developers within Sony as ones to watch. It hugely significant, sold no copies when it launched, certainly in Europe, and had the most cursed box art of all time in the US. But then they reissued it when Shadow of the Colossus came out.
Such was its reputation growing over time. And it is a defining PS2 exclusive. It's not that long.
It's a little bit lost to time as well, so maybe there's a little bit of fondness there. I love this and Shadow of the Colossus equally, really. They're a dyad of PS2, important PS2 games.
Matthew, I know you're not much of an Ueda head. What do you think of this pick?
It's a good pick for this category. I never really got this game. I always thought it was a little bit sort of nimbly-bimbly.
Shadow of the Colossus is the Ueda pick for me. But you are definitely right in how important it is and how much it means to lots of people. So, that's smart draft thinking.
Ash, what do you think? It feels like a pick you would get.
Yeah, this is a game, again, everyone at Game Station was raving about and deservedly so. I think utterly beautiful, felt completely distinct, and made good on that kind of marketing promise of the emotion engine that Sony had made a couple of years earlier. It did make you feel things.
So, yeah, like a total masterpiece.
It's no Spider-Man 2 though, is it?
Needs more Adam Sandler, is what Dave thinks.
We've been putting a couple of shots in, but you know.
Good stuff, I'm happy to get that off the board. Thank God. Okay, it's back to you, Ash.
Another PlayStation 2 exclusive for me. It is a game made by the undisputed master of Japanese action games, Shinji Mikami. I'm going to see if Sam types it in the chat before I say it.
Correct, Sam. It's God Hand. This is kind of like the other side of the coin from Devil May Cry.
Devil May Cry was the kind of stylish crowd pleaser where God Hand was the unknowable weird action game. But for those who really got to grips with it and started to understand how it worked, the rewards were plentiful. Deserves loads of praise for the way you could customize combos, even kind of like an RPG in a way, like acquiring these combos, then going into the menus and experimenting with how you can build your character.
But then really paid off that experimentation with massively stupid over-the-top action where you're spanking people on the arse and kicking them up to the moon. Stupid boss battles, incredible sense of humor. This game, it's really hard, but hard in a way where you really enjoy chipping away at it and getting better.
A wonderful, wonderful game that needs to come back. It's still PS2 exclusive, I think.
Yep, there's no commercial reason to excavate it for Capcom. I mean, I love the game, obviously. It's one of my favorite games of all time.
It just does something that no other game of this type does in that sort of combo, customization element. It's really just a great use of Mikami's cache at the time, after Resident Evil 4, to kind of blow it all on this. Love that he did that.
Probably the easiest way to play this, apart from emulation, obviously, is on PS3. I think you can still get access to that store. It's available on there, backwards compatible via PS3.
What a pain in the arse for most people. But such a great game, and it is very, very funny, for sure.
I never played it, it's a blind spot for me. But I know there's a great deal of affection for many, many, many people.
Okay, cool. Well, these next two picks, I think, are going to be quite pivotal. Things are coming off the board, thick and fast now.
So we come back to Matthew Castle for his two picks.
Oh, don't say that. Why do you frame it to put the pressure on me?
There's never been a more important moment in this draft than now.
In the history of mankind.
I don't think this is what you would consider a pivotal pick, but it is one I want on there to be part of the PS2 story. I am for free pick going to take God of War 2. The better of the two games, I think just the more memorable set pieces right from the off fighting the giant golden man, the Colossus of Rhodes or whatever his name is, and taking you through the kind of divine realms a lot more explicitly than the first.
It is mainly because I think God of War 2 should beâ€¦ God of War should be represented on PS2. I thought it was one of the defining series on there.
Like I said, when Dave was talking about God of War 1, I liked the way that it took slightly simpler action but really jazzed it up with those amazing finishes and the huge quick time events on the bosses. This is one of the first games where I remember being super impressed by just how flexible and dynamic the camera was, the way it moved around and pivoted to frame these environments. It often takes something quite simple, quite a small space where you're fighting two or three people but make you feel like you were doing something so much bigger.
That has just become such a dominant style of game making since God of War. I'm not saying God of War invented it but definitely helped popularise that pursuit of the cinematic which some people might think is evil. I've always had an appetite for it so on the list it shall go.
I probably would have picked this as well, Matthew. It makes total sense to me. I agree it's a superior game.
Did I fuck it? They're both very good. Did I fuck it up?
No, no.
I think there's not much in it. I'm not going to say God of War won shit because I don't think that.
Yeah, I mean God of War, like I say, it arrives at the gate with everything it is but then the Colossus of Rhodes is like one of the all-time PS2 moments in terms of scale, drama, excitement. Right at the end of the generation again, it's just PS2 still producing bangers, only surpassed by our beloved cursed and canceled God of War 3, Matthew.
Yes. It's no God of War 3.
I agree with that.
I will take, I'm actually going to do a bit of a switcheroo from the last draft. For License Game, I'm going to take Kingdom Hearts.
Interesting.
In License Game?
Last time I took the Warriors for License Game and Sam took Kingdom Hearts. A series, you know, I've not had a load of experience with it. I think since we did that draft, definitely while we've been doing this podcast, I went in and did, I would say, the meat of Kingdom Hearts 1.
I think maybe it was on Game Pass or PS Plus or something. So I feel a bit more familiar with it. I'm picking it mainly for the License Game category, because it's one of just the most ingenious License Game experiments to take not just one film but the whole Disney canon or reach into the whole Disney canon and take specific chunks of it.
Somehow kind of weave it together. Also, the fact that it's the first game, this is it at its purest with the least amount of bullshit that makes it confusing. This is before any spin-off games you have to play to understand.
It's really the core magic of it, of here's some characters, some Final Fantasy characters, some absolutely iconic Disney characters treated with the utmost respect and really nailing the art style, bringing in the original voice cast of the film, or some of the big names anyway, to do their characters. It's an incredible feat of licensed game making. Makes it worthwhile picking.
Also, I know that there are a lot of fans of this out there, so I don't think it will upset too many people to see it on my list.
No significant PS2 series that really just grew and grew. I think more and more people discovered this game over time, and it just became quietly enormous. Then by the time the second one came out, which I think is better as a combat game, and expands that palette of Disney worlds, but is, like Matthew says, rife with lore bullshit that would only get worse as the series continues.
I think 2 is pretty okay on that front. It definitely falls off a cliff beyond that when you get into the DS ones and beyond.
It's all the Organization 13 stuff, I think, is where it starts to go wrong in 2. But 2 also does have Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean, back when that was less cursed. And I don't mean Black Pearl cursed, I mean Johnny Depp cursed.
Just to make that clear. But I think that's a good pick, Matthew. It was like, if I couldn't get the Warriors, I would have taken this again.
If you hadn't taken the Warriors, I would have taken that again.
There you go. Alright, good stuff. We come back to you, Ash.
I'm gonna go RPG. Have we had an RPG yet or did you take?
I took FF10 but not in RPG.
That was in 90 plus, yeah. Right, okay, RPG. I'm gonna go with the Connoisseur's Choice.
Dragon Quest VIII, The Cursed King. Is that Matthew sighing?
That was my next pick. That was gonna be my next pick.
Sorry. Yeah, I think this was the first Dragon Quest game to come out in Europe, so I was super intrigued, rushed out and picked it up and wasn't disappointed. It's a stunning looking game, almost like Okami levels of beautiful, in my opinion, on the PS2, and remains one of the best Dragon Quest games.
An amazing world to explore. I think one of its key strengths is its characters. The titular Cursed King is this king who's been transformed into a Yoda, mushy P fella, who's dragging behind him his daughter, who's been transformed into a pack horse, and you're escorting these two and trying to lift the curse on them and bring them back to their rightful place in the world.
As you might tell from that strange description, it's packed full of humour, had uncommonly good voice acting in my opinion for the era.
Yeah, British character acting, right?
Yeah, really good. Yangus was a good kind of comic foil in that game. I haven't talked much about the gameplay, but it's standard Dragon Quest fare.
The thing about Dragon Quest is it doesn't really change that much from one entry to the next, but this was the first kind of full 3D one. So it was riding high on your ability to go out and explore this 3D world. But it was my introduction to the Dragon Quest formula.
So everything that we now know about that game, all the iconic stuff, the slimes, the really like strategic turn based battles, it's all there. I'd probably say play the 3DS remake. These days, it's a bit more polished and a bit more accessible.
Yeah, a great RPG.
Yep, very good. It certainly looked apart for the time. I bristled a little bit with just how trad Dragon Quest is, but I do also know that that is seen as a strength by people.
It's so pure though. It's like the purest version of that formula.
It also brought it to Europe for the first time properly. It's a series we've been properly messed around with. I don't think they'd even tried to release the previous entries.
Ash, you're no better than me, but no, that's it.
Yeah, there were some that got unofficial import releases on Game Boy and that sort of thing, but this was the first proper one, so it was a bit of an eye-opener for Final Fantasy loving Brits.
Indeed.
This was on my screw-over Ash list, but...
I was waiting for someone to break the foil on the RPG Milk. I was like, who's going to be the first person to... When is this category going to be in play?
And I stupidly thought it would be a bit long here.
My interest in that game is so little, I went to the toilet and I don't think anyone noticed because I just didn't need to hear Ash talking about it.
I wasn't even going to ask you what you thought of it, Dave, but I actually am pleased you came back and weighed in with that.
Have you seen the Dragon Quest movie, Dave?
Why would I? Has anyone?
It's directed by the guy who did Godzilla Minus One, so it should be added to your Letterboxd watchlist.
Oh, there you go. Actually, I do like Godzilla Minus One.
Okay. I look forward to Dave logging that on Letterboxd.
I'm more likely to watch Monster Hunter than I am a Dragon Quest movie.
Jesus Christ. I believe you.
All right. Good stuff. Comes back to me then.
I'm a little bit worried about Category 7 Shooter or Platformer. We had this problem last time where I think we decided, Matthew, there weren't that many good shooters on PS2 and you didn't like any of the platformers either.
Well, last time I think it wasn't just Shooter as a category.
Yeah. And maybe just Platformer as a category as well.
They were split. I really struggled in Shooter, thus picking Red Faction. I think there's one valid pick and even that I'm not wild about.
In terms of first person shooting anyway.
Yeah. I know what you're talking about there. We'll come back to that, I'm sure.
Yeah. For Category 7 Shooter or Platformer, I'm going to take Jack and Dax to the precursor legacy. Overall, I'm trying to build a bit of a variety in terms of genres and just make sure there's not too much crossover.
There's no other platformer I'd take on this platform. Maybe Ash is going to disagree because he has a deeper knowledge of these games than I do, like say, Clanoa 2 likely to come off the board or something. But in terms of melding Naughty Dog's Crash Bandicoot moveset with the Nintendo Super Mario 64 slightly Zelda-y approach to open world and more open level design and the continuous world.
I think this is a great happy medium of mascot platforming and pushing things forward a little bit because you've got new hardware to play with. It's still a really fun game to rattle through, just collecting the different energy cells in this game and just racking them up through all the different side quests and different maps. You can clear them quite quickly, but it's just quite moreish and fun.
Precise enough platforming, Matthew. Really good looking for the time, no loading screens. I've played through this.
It's great comfort food. And yeah, like I said, I did not like the Jack games that followed this, but I've always had a lot of affection for this. And it was like the first major game of its type on PS2 and felt like a big deal in O1 when it rolled around finally.
And as revealed, as discussed on this podcast, the character is named Jack because of Ellie Gibson. Because Ellie Gibson has a mate called Jack with a K. Which was wild to learn as a bit of detail.
So any thoughts on this one, guys? Did anyone play this one?
I've replayed a bit of this recently for something work related and thought it held up pretty well as a more of an exploration platformer, you know, in the kind of bigger, like, I guess Mario 64 areas kind of style, or Banjo-Kazooie maybe, collecting infinite trinkets from very colorful maps. Looks really nice. The only thing I would ding it for is whichever one of the two, I don't know which one's Jack and which one's Daxter, but the rat thing is quite obnoxious and unpleasant.
Oh yeah.
He's a bad hang, but it doesn't really matter because he doesn't have much to do.
Yeah. That's a fair criticism. Yes.
I'm pleased to hear you go to bat for a little bit. Dave, this sounds like something you would have played.
I've never touched these games.
Okay.
No, genuinely, it's what we were talking about earlier about the PS2 for me, being a console for a more mature gamer. I kind of at that age was just like, I'm not going to play the sort of kiddy platformers anymore, and I'm just going to be playing the stuff that felt sort of in line with sort of that tone at that time. So I was, you know, so it was all about, you know, GTA got a war, you know, shooters, stuff like that.
So unfortunately, stuff like Jack and Daxter fell to the wayside.
Yep, fair enough. It's Sony likes this game enough that it's been basically every single PlayStation format since has been able to play it, including PS5. So is there a PS5, Jack and Daxter?
It's like the PS4 version that you can play. But yeah, so yeah, definitely never gets better when they add guns and vehicles to this. The formula is pretty much as good as it would get here.
And definitely the best of this kind of mascotty Naughty Dog game that they made before they became the Uncharted Studio. So Dave, we come to you for two picks.
Yeah, I'm having a think. It's tough now, right? You know what?
I will say there is still a lot of really great games on the board. It is just thinking what are going to get sort of taken between now and then. I feel like I want to go shooter.
And there's one that I think is the smart move and one which is a game I know you and I have a lot of affection for, Sam.
I think I know where this is going.
I'm going to go TimeSplitters 2 for shooter, which was previously mentioned. It's a great pick. It's a fantastic game.
Obviously, Free Radical, this was sort of a spiritual successor to GoldenEye Perfect Dark. It's one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made. You know, it really is sort of one of those defining couch multiplayer games that you played in your youth if you're of that generation.
It kind of took the work that that team was doing on Nintendo and improving on it, going a little bit more wilder with the design. And, you know, I love GoldenEye. Perfect Dark was great, but I think maybe, maybe I'm misremembering.
Matthew, you have similar sort of feelings with Perfect Dark where it didn't quite scratch that itch that GoldenEye did. But then TimeSplitters 2 kind of was a return to form for me. I didn't play the original TimeSplitters.
TimeSplitters 2 just had this buzz about it. And then it just became one of those essential games while I was at university that everyone was just playing constantly, very competitive, just an incredible time. And yeah, it's one of the defining games of that generation for sure, especially in shooters.
Yeah, it's funny to go back to because it's aiming, it's absolutely heinous to play now.
Well, they were though.
It's definitely that era where they're still figuring out how to do these games on console. But Halo gets there faster than TimeSplitters does, I would argue. But it is still great fun.
A lot of the campaign levels are still really fun. Not the stealth one, we have to follow that woman around, that sucks, but a lot of the other ones are pretty good fun. Yeah, and definitely was a defining sort of like couch, a split screen game playing the campaign in carp.
I think this was the other pick I had for this category. Any thoughts on TimeSplitters, guys?
I've always struggled with it. I think it's one of the great overrated games of all time. Yeah, I was excited for it because of the whole GoldenEye link, and I thought, of course I want a successor to GoldenEye and Perfect Dark, but I hated the cartoonishness of it.
It really took me out of it, and I always found the shooting weirdly spongy and non-lethal. I've always thought this felt like you were shooting various skin, reskinned versions of Nerf air blasters. Never ever did it for me, I'm afraid.
That isn't me just trying to rain on a good pick. I know people like this game.
What about you Ash? You must be a TimeSplitters guy.
I played all of them. I played TimeSplitters 3 last year actually, when I wheeled out my Xbox 360 through the backwards compatibility thing, when they were shutting down the store.
I look forward to when you catch up to the PS5 one day Ash, in 10 years, you could join us playing Marvel Rivals.
Yeah, I think when they did the Xbox wrapped thing, I think TimeSplitters 3 was one of my three most played Xbox games last year. But I kind of pretty much agree with Matthew. I think we were all so desperate for the next Golden Eye in Perfect Dark, that we kind of just all collectively agreed that TimeSplitters was good.
But it wasn't that hot, in my opinion.
Interesting. See, I think this is a good bit, Dave, because I think that a lot of people will vote for it. And it is...
It's of its time.
I do think it's dated.
It's of its time in the same way the Golden Eye in Perfect Dark were of their time. You know, they don't hold up as well now as we remember. But there was something about the time and the place of when you were playing it and the people you were playing it with that just makes it, you know, iconic.
Yeah, I don't know. Me and Matthew Catherine, we had a great time playing Perfect Dark and Split Screen. I think that did hold up quite well.
But anyway, we don't need to litigate that now. What's your next pick, Dave?
I'm going to take what I think is the best rhythm action game on the PlayStation 2. I'm going to go for Rez.
Oh, mother...
Yeah, I knew that would fuck Ash off as well.
This is great.
It's like this mesmerizing, psychedelic musical journey. It's kind of this singular creative voyage. I don't know if words can adequately describe it.
It's just one of those games that you just kind of have to play, and it's an experience. So it's fantastic in VR as well. I don't know if anyone's played the version that came out on PSVR, but it's sort of transcending.
I found it absolutely fantastic, and it's really almost therapeutic in its design. But yeah, I really love this game. I think our friend Chris McMahon has a signed copy of this game, kicking around somewhere.
Yeah, I got him that signed copy. It was former Back Page guest James Milky got a copy for me, and I asked for an extra one for Chris.
I'm sure his kids have drawn on it with crayon at this point.
But this is a bit of a heart pick, because I don't think it's one that necessarily would be on the top of everyone's list, but I do believe it's the strongest game in this category.
Yeah. Okay. Well, so this category now has to be, the lid has been busted on this one too now.
Oh, great.
Yeah. This is how we got to play it now though, right? We've got to break open these categories with the best games, so then, you know, everyone's panicking now.
I thought I'd have longer before I had to pick this next one then.
Sports is going to be fucking last, surely.
There's quite a lot in that one is the thing. There's like at least, I've got at least four picks for that one.
I've definitely got Ash's top pick at the top of mine.
I'm not going to pretend I want amplitude for rhythm action. That's the thing. I'm not prepared to do that.
Sam, don't do it. Don't do this.
Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Fuck you, Ash. I'm doing it. Okay.
So it's my pick again. Rhythm Action or Arcade, I'm going to take Gitaroo Man.
Ash doesn't know any other games.
It's fine. It's not what I thought you were going to do. All right.
Interesting. Okay. Well, I fucking love Gitaroo Man.
It's like the only, apart from Rez, the only rhythm action game I give a shit about on PS2, really. Never really much of a guitar hero guy. It was an excuse for dudes with ponytails to sort of lord it over at house parties, I imagine, which I was never really interested in.
But Gitaroo Man is like this stylized sort of like anime, basically superhero with a guitar. It's by Ines who will go on to make Elite Beat Agents. Ines, I don't know how you pronounce that, but you basically just strum along to the guitar using the analog sticks and it's just really nicely done, great feedback with the rumble and just like really amazing music to bring it to life.
I remember just playing the demo of this and being like, what the heck is this game? It was like probably like 7th or 8th on the demo disc of like, well, we've thrown this thing into this like weird coey rhythm action game, but I think it really is like an immortal sort of PS2 experience. I love it.
What do you think Ash, for this pick?
It's an utterly beautiful game. Like it really like, is it a legendary song? Is that the one where you're like sitting under the tree, like serenading his girlfriend?
Absolutely amazing. When I suggested we put in a rhythm action category, although it's not my pick, this is the game I was thinking about because it absolutely deserves to be on a PS2 list.
It's wonderful. Good stuff. Well, that was a bit dicey there.
I don't want to pretend I like amplitude as mentioned. So, whew.
Okay, Ash, it comes back to you.
Right, okay, a quick bit of housekeeping. Yeah. Shooter or platformer?
Shooter, it doesn't say FPS, so can you include shoot'em ups in that?
Yes, yes you can.
Wicked, right, we'll come back to that. In that case, I'm gonna go rhythm action or arcade. Dave has sadly taken res, which was top of my list.
I've got Amperdude on here, which is wonderful, but I'm not gonna take it. I'm gonna go very, very traditional here. I'm gonna pick Guitar Hero.
Did you have a pony tail back then?
Ash had his Harry Potter hair at the time.
Are you taking Guitar Hero 1?
I'm gonna go Guitar Hero 1. I do think 2 is the better game, but for sentimental reasons, I'm gonna go Guitar Hero 1. A lot of its songs were cover versions and not master recordings, but this was a massive, massive deal when it came out.
It was like Japan had had Guitar Freaks, I don't care. We didn't have it, and also it's not as good. Guitar Hero is massive.
I like clubbed together with my housemate at the time, and we went halves on importing an American version with the guitar controllers because we just heard about this thing and it just sounded like something we had to have. And we were playing it night after night after night. It was amazing.
And I think years later, I was still playing it night after night through various sequels and iterations. I very, very fondly remember my first week at Imagine Publishing. Kezzie McDonald invited me to a house party as a kind of like, hey, welcome to Bournemouth.
Let's get you ingratiated with everyone. And of course, as Sam alluded to earlier, big guitar hero parties around that time. I've just got nothing but fond memories.
This is a heart pick, but I think it's a crowd pleaser as well.
I like this pick because what I liked about the original guitar hero was it was a very small publisher and harmonics, obviously, and it was very bold to go out there with this peripheral that you basically need to play it properly. And they found an audience and it exploded so much that Activision swooped in and it became this enormous deal even by the second game. And I love the idea of it being like this sort of self-generated success story near the end of the PS2's life.
I think that's a nice sentiment.
I think that's a really good pick.
The Gitar Hero 3 was the best of those PS2 entries. The track listâ€¦
It's a bit more of a 360 era by then.
Yeah, 3 wasn't on PS2.
It was on PS2 as well. I had it on PS2. I'm pretty sure I did.
Hang on. I'm looking it up.
No way.
I will research it in the background.
Yeah, you research it. Then I'll defend it.
Great for Googling.
It is on PS2 as well.
Yeah, I had it on PS2.
No way. No way.
This was like quintessential university tracks on it. You had block party, you had killers, you had the strokes, and obviously, by that point, they were actually licensing the music, and so that became really the perfect version of what that game was reaching for with its first entry, was this really authentic party game that's taking the best of rock and roll and putting it into this user experience.
Are you changing your res pictures?
No, because I've picked the best game in this category, which you alluded, which you mentioned, you said that yourself. I'm just saying, you've picked the second best guitar hero out of the two you could have picked.
Let's see if someone else picks one of the other guitar heroes elsewhere.
Well, that's the thing, is I think this might split the vote, is the number of guitar hero games on this console. It's a bit, yeah, it's sort of like, I wanted to pick something quite singular, as opposed to one of like the three or four games that are in this specific mould.
We did it right, Sam, we did it right. It's, I don't have to apologise for being good at playing the game.
It's a good pick. Okay, all right then. In which case it comes back to you, Matthew.
Pivotal two picks here.
Oh, always with the pivotal.
It's funny how all three of us picked rhythm action in a row there. That properly kicked off.
I did, I did send a... Everyone got a bit nervy after I picked a rest.
Yeah, that's weird. I'm going to go RPG. I'll take Final Fantasy XII.
Good choice.
A bit more of an acquired taste compared to Final Fantasy X, definitely. I think last time we put X up against XII in the RPG category. I picked XII last time as well, I think.
You know, sometimes thought of or referred to as the slightly more like grown up. It's slightly more dour Final Fantasy, like in its art style. I guess that's, there's some Matsuno influence on this, I believe.
Is that right?
Yes, that's right. Yeah.
I always get a little confused about who did which one and was involved with which. I think the main reason I like it is the automated combat system where you program your party through gambits to behave in certain ways. If your health drops lower than X, cast a heal on me.
And that's very, very experimental. I think quite baffling for a lot of people, which is maybe why some people don't get on as well with it. But if you do put time into getting your head around the gambits, programming your party, you get to a point where it's just this well-oiled machine doing its thing.
And that's incredibly satisfying. It's not an open world Final Fantasy game at all, but there are larger areas with monsters in them. It has a little bit of what I would later like about Xenoblade in terms of being in spaces with monsters and the sense of it all kicking off there.
But it is mainly like, as a kind of mechanical entry, it's super interesting. But I do wonder if that makes it like less of a crowd pleaser. But we shall see.
It's one of those games that is more of a head pick for people than a heart pick, I think. It's a game that to be admired, I think, rather than loved for a lot of people. Unless you're like a big numbers guy, I guess it might be a different deal.
But it is absolutely beautiful. I think you can notice in the original PS2 version that there is a resolution penalty you pay for just how beautiful and detailed the art is. And then, yeah, but emulating and blown up, this still looks unbelievably good, like a borderline PS3 360 ass looking thing.
So so good. Yeah, I think it's a solid pick, Matthew. It could see a Final Fantasy in an RPG category on a PlayStation draft, I think.
Makes sense.
Yeah, yeah. And yeah, I think RPGs still got some strong picks left in it, though. So I don't know if I needed to rush to it.
I've been looking at survival horror stealth, thinking, well, these categories are so lost to Metal Gear Solid 3 and Silent Hill 2, but I want something a bit interesting in there. So I'm going to take Manhunt for that.
Oh, that's cool.
Kind of a game which is both survival horror and stealth in a way, in that it presents an incredibly bleak sort of snuff film game show where you are sneaking through these quite grim industrial environments, killingâ€¦ I don't think they are contestants, they're just sort of like psychos who are in the space that you're being kind of told to hunt down. So the sort of stealth element is that, you know, in oneâ€¦
you know, you don't want to be in open combat with these people, you want to really be sneaking up on them. But the horror element isâ€¦ it's just an intensely grimy game about executing people with quite believable real-world tools like bricks and carrier bags.
Like suffocating a guy with a carrier bag over his head is quite an iconic image from this game. And it's not playful at all, like it's just impressively grimy, bleak and unpleasant. I don't know if that means it's like the most enjoyable thing to experience, but it's so singular and kind of commits to the bit that I think it is, you know, it certainly sticks with you.
And you know, I think I wanted to play it because the kind of, you know, when I was a teenager, you want to see like extreme violence in video games because you're probably a bit of a sicko or, you know, and it definitely lured me in that way. But I think it is an incredibly tense and unpleasant stealth experience to boot. And I think you come away, you're like more impressed with it for those reasons, rather than, you know, this isn't really the same thing as just watching fatalities in a Mortal Kombat game.
Like it's somehow like much more unholy than that. And that's quite a feat. If anything, the PS2 era visuals of it only like feed into the murkiness of what's going on.
So yeah, a little bit of both.
Was it the first manhunt or the second that sort of tickled the red top newspapers in terms of controversy and being taboo?
It's both really, both really. But I think the first one definitely did. I remember that.
Two got it in the neck a bit because it was on the Wii. And I think they were saying it was like the first adults only game on the Nintendo platform, whether or not that was true. But like they actually cut it.
They were going to about to release it. So remember we reviewed it on NGamer and then they withdrew it and didn't sell it for like another six months and they censored the game to get a lower rating, I think.
Interesting. Yeah, I played this the first time last night. I think it's maybe the best use of one of the best uses of video game voice acting of all time, having Brian Cox whispering in your ear.
Just so sinister, but so good. And I think people have more of a relationship with the actor now than they did back then. PS2 is very much a stomping ground between this and Killzone.
But I think that that part of it and the fact that it is really bleak, but it's also not, it doesn't like thumb your nose in it. It's very committed to being like as nihilistic as it is. And it kind of like, it justifies the violence, I think.
It's not immature. It actually is a game for adults. I think this is something quite, I agree, it's singular.
It really is. It's, I think I was really good, even though I think obviously the stealth is going to date. I even get the reassuring thumb of some like GTA PS2 sounds as you pick up items, which I like, yeah, game dividing to scenes, VHS kind of filter as you go in for these kills.
It's a cool thing, manhunt. Anyone else play this game? Yeah.
Did any of you guys play this with, did the PS2 version have the headset support or was that just Xbox?
I don't remember, but someone did ask me this when I posted about it.
So I played the Xbox version with the headset, so hopefully the PS2 version was the same, but that was, you mentioned the Brian Cox voice acting. Having that in your ear, literally in your ear, really amped up the atmosphere, and there was also a mechanic where the microphone picked up what you were doing as well, so you had to be quite quiet during the stealth versions, or they would come and, I don't know, kick you in the balls or whatever it is they did. That was good, so hopefully that applies to the PS2.
Ties in nicely with Michael Mann's 1980s Manhunt movie as well, obviously, with Brian Cox being in there.
Manhunter, Dave, Manhunter, sorry.
Loves films, this guy, loves them.
Loves the films. That's funny. I like that pic, Matthew, very PS2 as well.
Well, it came out on Xbox, but you know, I certainly, this is just such a big deal. Came out between GTA's Vice City and San Andreas. Absurdly productive Rockstar North generation.
So then, we come back to Ash, I believe, for this next pic.
Right, I think it's time to get weird. I think I'm going to go wild card with a game I spent years trying to track down and eventually did a few years ago. Raw Danger.
Okay.
Has anyone played this?
I've never even heard of it.
I think I've only heard about it from you talking about it.
Otherwise known as Disaster Report 2, so it's part of a long running series. The first game on PS2 was called SOS. Raw Danger was the sequel.
SOS was kind of a survival game. You're stuck in the middle of a city while an earthquake was going on and trying to survive and escape the city. Disaster Report 2, Raw Danger, you're in a flooding city at Christmas.
So it's got a great kind of seasonal atmosphere to it. I do recommend playing it at Christmas if you can. It's a game of two halves, is Raw Danger.
On the one hand, it's a really kind of exciting survival game because it's this 3D world that is falling apart, changing in real-time platforms that you're going to kind of jump onto for dear life, get swept away in torrential rain and flooding. It jumps between different characters that you get to play as. So in one chapter, you're like an amnesiac doctor trying to figure out how to get out of the city when he doesn't even know who he is.
In another chapter, you're a taxi driver and you're driving around trying to rescue people who are stranded. It finds different ways to have fun with survival 3D gameplay. It's also got like a wicked sense of humor to it.
It's really cheeky, really like off the wall. One of my favorite bits in the first chapter, there's a chef who's like hanging from the side of like a freeway and he's losing his grip and he's going, I'm about to fall, I'm about to fall, I can't cling on any longer. You get this multiple choice option at that point of what to do.
First option is obviously like help him up. The second option is smile at him. The third option is take his hat.
If you take his hat, he will fall to his death and die, which is horrible. But then you've got a chef's hat that you can wear for the rest of the game. It appears in all of the cutscenes.
I think one of the most difficult choices there's ever been in a video game, to be honest. Quite hard to track down now, quite a rare game, but if you ever find it and you love weird and wonderful games, which the PS2 was brilliant at doing, because it had such a vast catalogue, there's lots of great oddities on there that are also really fun to play. This is one of the best.
I didn't play this one, but I remember reading about SOS The Final Escape and coveting it. The idea of it, the idea of navigating this, this kind of adventure puzzle kind of narrative game, where there had been a disastrous earthquake and you were traversing this world. That seems so appealing to me.
That was proper fodder for the Japan-focused pages of every PS2 magazine at that time.
That game is also really good and easier to find. So you can probably get that for like 20 quid these days. So I recommend that.
I've always had a feeling, do you remember Disaster Day of Crisis?
Yeah, I played that one.
Soft. I always had a feeling that was inspired by these games. It's not as good, but it's got a similar kind of, hey, you're trying to survive the city feel.
Can I assume that Dave wrote Disaster Report, the name of Asher's draft in the document while I was...
Who can say? Who can say?
Oh dear. No, I like that, Ash. I mean, me or Matthew would never would have picked that.
So I appreciate you going to bat for something really weird and interesting. Before I pick something highly conventional for my next pick, I am going to take for Category 11 free pick Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition. This was my favorite Devil May Cry game on the console.
I think in some ways this is where they firm up what the identity of these games are going to be going forwards. It's about style, but also letting you choose which style suits you and building a combat system that's durable enough to support those styles. Whether it's like a trickster or royal guard, definitely more of a trickster man myself, dodging around the environment, avoiding attacks, that kind of stuff.
Added the option to play as Virgil, Dante's brother. Just a really confident sequel. Devil May Cry 2 is a notorious mishap of a dour game made by a different developer.
Not very well liked. Devil May Cry 3 is a proper course correction. Banged on about this before, but it's all there in the opening cut scene of three as Dante is eating pizza while beating up loads of enemies.
I've made this joke before. I still don't know what the Devil May Cry business is. I don't know how they make money.
I don't know what that business model is. It's very confusing to me. But really stylish and beautiful.
Yeah, close to the end of the generation PS2 game. Special Edition also had some more difficulty modes because the original Devil May Cry 3 release was notoriously quite tricky. These days, I imagine that go down quite well.
But yeah, it's great. It's got some fantastic bosses. He's on a motorbike at one point and gets swallowed by a big monster.
So you're inside a monster for a level. Yeah, just great. It really has the kind of like the attitude of the original game, but then just pushes it further in these kind of silly and fun directions.
Ash, as the person who picked DMC1, what do you think of 3?
It is the better game. I must concede that. It just doesn't have the sentimentality for me.
But I'd say it's in the top 10 games on the system. I think it's the best Devil May Cry games to date. It perfects the formula, really.
It can't come at the finest. I'm spitting out a lot of hyperbole here, but it's deserved because it's such a great game.
In which case, we come back to another cursed Dave double pick.
I think I'm on firing on all cylinders on this draft. It's going in my way, maybe. I don't know.
I've got wild card, free pick, a licensed game and sports. I think sports are pretty open too. I actually have a really good pick in sports.
I don't think anyone else would go for.
I don't know.
I don't think you would. It's really tough. It's actually really tough when you're at the end of the snake and you have to pick two.
I don't know why. It feels like there's more pressure at this point. I feel for you, Matthew.
Kill yourself.
I'm just joking, Dave. You shouldn't joke about these things.
Scrub that from the pod.
Don't let your audience know what shit you are. I got to keep it in. I will apologize now.
It's so many joking.
It's the biggest laugh for me.
This is why we should never do another podcast with four weeks on it. It's a bad call.
Okay. I'm going to go in wild card. I'm going to go Katamari Damacy.
That was my pick for wild card.
I know it's just whether it's the choice for now, but I'm doing it.
Have you played it, Dave?
Yeah, I've played it. It's a guy rolling a thing up into a giant ball called a Katamari.
He's not wrong. He's not wrong. That is what you do.
The goal is to create a ball.
Yeah, you've convinced me.
You create a ball of a size and you've got to collect specific things. It's a really simple kind of puzzle game and you navigate different environments. It's like, it's fun.
It's super quirky, unique. I always feel like it's sort of an iconic PlayStation character that's sort of gone beyond necessarily how widely played the game is. Like he pops up in Astro Bot as well.
Probably one of the sort of better interactions you have with one of those bots you collect because he can run you over and you get a little trophy for it if you let him do it, which is pretty cool. Don't know if you knew that, fact fans. Can't link this to a movie, but despite all that, it's a pretty addictive gameplay loop.
The art style is fantastic. The aesthetic is very distinct, kind of childlike, very whimsical, very odd, lots of bright, bold colors. Soundtrack is fantastic too.
It's quite funky, got sort of a bit of jazz pop, electronica sort of vibe to it all. I really like this game. I haven't played it in a long time, but it's always stuck with me as one of those sort of oddities of the era that grew in esteem as the years passed.
I don't know, what do other people think of it?
It's great, I mean, using the two analog sticks to perfection, its imagery is still highly memed to this day. I don't know if I'd say it's one of my personal favourites, but in a PS2 draft, a category called wild card, it's about as wild card as it gets really, unless you're Ash, you're sicko like Ash and you pick fucking God Hand as one of your conventional games and have to take something much stranger. Yep, good pick.
Anyone else have any thoughts on this one?
It's good.
It's on your list, isn't it Ash? I know it's on your list too.
Is this the one you picked to like gazump me?
No, no, no. Rez was the one.
All right. Yeah, Rez hurts. This one isn't on my list, but it's emblematic of what was great about PS2.
Dave, what's your next pick?
I've really got a coin toss on my free pick between two games I really like. I feel like one is more of a defining game of the PS2 era, but I feel like the other game is going to be more beloved by your audience.
I want to know what you really like.
What I really like?
Yeah, I want a Dave Hart pick.
Just pick Middle of Honor Frontline, Dave, your favorite game of all time.
You know what? It is on my list. Don't use shit on Middle of Honor Frontline.
That is a banger and it was on my shooter list. Thank you very much.
It's for people who didn't have a PC and could see how much better Allied Assault was. That's what I think of that game.
Allied Assault is much better and I did have a friend who had a PC who let me go around his house to play it.
Excuse my very PC dweeb tone there, but I am correct about this one, unfortunately. It was a bit too paired down front line for me. But anyway.
You never think it would be this tough when you actually sat in the hot seat trying to think of a couple of games. But I'm just going to go for it. I'm going to go free pick Prince of Persia, Sands of Time, which is my heart pick versus my other choice.
Again, this was one of the early games I picked up on the PS2. I have, again, very fond memories sitting around with family members playing this. The whole turn back time mechanic just felt so novel, so unique.
I'm sure there's a bunch of games that did something similar before. I have no knowledge of them, but...
Blinks the time sweeper.
There we go.
I don't know if it was actually before.
This was an incredible platform. It rebooted a franchise that was pretty much dead. Very fast-paced, action-orientated platforming experience that had this just killer mechanic at the center of it that just made it just so fun, so rewarding, just allowed the developers to just have loads of fun with the type of puzzles that they created around that mechanic.
I don't think, and people may disagree, I know the recent Prince of Persia was quite liked by a lot of people, I don't think they ever bettered it. They certainly didn't make a good movie out of it, as you know, I love the movies. And they made a movie out of this one.
But no, this was, for me, one of the quintessential PlayStation 2 titles that really defined the console.
I think it's a great pick. And actually, I don't know why, I just didn't even have this really on my radar as a selection, but it's a really solid choice.
It was going to be my next pick for platformer.
Yeah, it's a good choice, Dave. I respect it. Really, really solid.
Ash, do you play this one?
Yes, I remember getting this and Beyond Good and Evil, which was both of those games were on my shortlist. I remember getting them around the same time and being stranded in my student house in London over whatever Christmas that was, 2003. So, wild away the hours with this game and have really fond memories of it.
It's a wonderful, wonderful game.
Really innovative, but also beautiful and charming, looked great, sounded great. Everything you would want from a video game, really. It's a rare example of Dave Scarborough having exceptional taste.
I was also, I remember it must have come out around the Christmas. I remember I had to go to my mum's for Christmas that year, and she was with her new future husband, her new partner, and I just didn't want to have to interact with either of them for the whole week I was there, just sat with sands of time, just played it the whole time.
A beautiful cursed memory there.
Well, that's a good pick, Dave, well done. I think we're all very impressed. Right then, it comes back to me for the next pick.
I'm going to take my RPG finally, and I thought because people are going to be looking at this list top down, you want something a bit different to Final Fantasy X for that RPG slot. So I thought about Dark Chronicle, which is PS2 to its bones. That's an action RPG that also has a bit of a city building elements to it, a level five game, very beautiful.
I got to admit though, when you play it now, it is so hard and the melee combat is so unpleasant. I couldn't possibly sit here and pretend it's like a great pick to you. Just don't...
Sorting the Earth.
Don't... Everyone's picked their RPGs now, I think.
Trust me, that ain't on my list.
Yeah, I know. Lord of the Rings III H-Pick coming right up from you, Dave. So let's take Persona 3 Fez, FES, which is the first time this series really cracked the West, certainly North America, maybe took a bit more time.
Didn't take Persona 4 because everyone agrees that Golden on Vita is the definitive version of Persona 4, so it doesn't make sense to take it. There's a lot of good Shin Megami Tensei games on PS2.
Now you're fucking salted the earth because Persona 4 was my pick. I've got another one.
I would take Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne over Persona 4, personally, as a distinctive PS2 pick, but that's up to you, Dave. So Persona 3, yep, this is-
Sarkham Knight all over the place.
This is during the nights you go through this dungeon, Tartarus, fighting all of these different shadows. During the day, you go to school and do a bunch of Persona life sim elements. This has always been the duality of Persona's design, but here it's so nicely packaged up visually, and the music is so good.
It was really a breath of fresh air to anyone who discovered it on PS2, highly coveted towards the end of the generation, and Persona 4 and 5 really just build on it in terms of presentation. Persona 5, obviously, taking things much, much further. I talked about the game many times in this podcast, but it's all here.
What everything Persona does well is here, remade this year for good reason, and it still uses the bones of this game, really. It's not massively dissimilar because they got it straight away in a lot of ways. I think the combat is where they've maybe overhauled it a little bit, but just teenagers putting guns to their heads, summoning monsters, and going through these quite, quite spooky sort of environments.
And really, the day stuff is what people love about these games, and the characters are what defines what makes a great persona versus like a really good persona to people. But it happens on PS2, that story. It happens here.
What do you think of this pic, Matthew, as someone who's maybe considering this?
Yeah, I think your logic why this over four is definitely right. I've played more of Persona 3 Reload than I have any other version of this, but apart from all the obvious big difference structurally and contents-wise, I think Persona 3 Reload is probably closest to Fez in terms of like, it hasn't got the female protagonist from the PSP version, but it has got some of the extra campaign gubbins. I remember seeing this on PS2 at the time and thinking that is the coolest shit ever.
You know, the idea of doing an RPG in a contemporary setting, even though it sort of courts controversy, the image of them shooting the kind of demons out of their heads. It just looks fucking cool. Yeah, I think this is a really strong pick.
Any thoughts on this Ash? You remember the Persona guy?
Shin Megami Tensei III was my other RPG pick in case someone took Dragon Quest. I've always found Persona a little bit impenetrable personally. Very, very long intros that take a while to get going.
I'll come back to this because obviously it's a beloved RPG, so I'd love to get into it.
I was thinking of IV, but I think you're right. It is more defined by the Vita version, which is the version I played, so it probably would have been a little disingenuous for me to have gone for Persona IV. So I think this is the right pick.
Good stuff. We'll come back to you then, Ash.
Okay, so you actually predicted this one earlier, Sam. In Shooter or Platformer, I'm going to take the Monumental R-Type Final by Irem. This, as the name suggests, was meant to be kind of the ultimate 2D shoot'em up.
It's kind of the Gran Turismo of shoot'em ups in that a lot of the game is about you accumulating a garage full of spaceships to use in the game. There's a hundred and one different ships to collect. Lots of interesting variations on the classic R-Type ship, but also lots of fun Easter eggs for fans of shooters, old Irem shooters like Mr. Helly or X Multiply, like classic shooters that really appeal to the hardcore, like all represented in this Smash Brothers of Japanese shooters.
That's really appealing. But then the game itself is really incredible, beautiful level design, like using the power of the PS2 to show what is probably one of the oldest genres, if not the oldest genre in gaming, and really bring it to life with this kind of... It's almost like a horror game, is R-Type Final.
Like a lot of the levels are organic and disgusting to look at. There's a classic R-Type 1 level where you're flying around and below like a giant ship and that makes up the entire level. It pays tribute to that, but in 3D, so the camera will turn 90 degrees and you fly around the giant ship and see the other side of it that you never would have seen in the 80s.
It's rock hard, but the way you unlock these ships and unlock these extra abilities that you have, like the more you play, the more rewarding it is and that difficulty comes down a little bit because you get these crazy ships that can help you. And it's got something I've never really seen in any other shooter map, which is the actions that you take in one run affect the next time you play it. So it makes use of the memory card, saves what you're doing.
Best example of this is, I think it's the second level, has rising and falling water levels and depending on the route you take through that level, the next time you play it, the water level will be completely different to the point where it looks like a bit of a puddle in one variation, in another, the level will be completely submerged and you're literally flying underwater and dealing with underwater enemies. Kind of got that like Star Fox 64 feel to it of depending on what you do, you will unlock exciting secrets that are actually like within the gameplay. A brilliant, brilliant game.
Do I want to say it's the best 2D shoot of my perv set? No, I'm not going to do that. People will come for me.
Let's keep it grounded.
Better than Delta, Ash, do you think?
Better than R-Type Delta. Yeah, I do think it is better than R-Type Delta. I think it's the best R-Type game.
There is an R-Type Final 2 that came out on PS4 and there's an R-Type Final 3 which was a content update for R-Type Final 2. So if you downloaded the content update it actually transformed the game into its own sequel, which is very IREM. This is by the same guy, the guy who created this is the same guy who made Roar Danger.
He was also one of the main guys on Metal Slug, so you've got a real pedigree here in this game.
I'm starting to think you're not going to pick Lord of the Rings of Two Towers now, Ash.
I've got to leave something for Dave.
I will play this once I've bullshit save stated my way through R-Type Delta, Ash, which is an ongoing project for me, but they are beautiful games.
Yeah, I'll play it when hell freezes over.
And that's why Dave is here for that kind of commentary. Matthew, it comes back to you for two picks.
Category 3, Sports or Racing. Let's rip the lid off. I'll take Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3.
Nice.
Absolutely rock solid pick this. A great series. I think, you know, one through to four.
You know, you're going to have a good time in any of these. Opens up the levels a little bit more, but not so much so that they become too unworkable, which some people have said of Pro Skater 4, which I have picked in Dross before. I am a Pro Skater 4 guy in my heart of hearts, but I think Pro Skater 3 just always lands better.
So, cynically, I am going with that. I've said it a million times on the podcast. I think everyone should experience a Tony Hawk's learning curve at some point and master those games, work out what makes them tick, start getting those crazy score combos.
I think when you see people playing these, you know, who are very experienced at them, it's kind of quite hard to pass and you think, well, I'm never going to be able to do any of that. But I think the way it kind of teases the skills out of you with mission objectives sort of hidden around the maps is really, really neat. I think they're such a pleasure to master.
Kind of sad this series has gotten a bit murkier over the years. Starts going downhill when you can get off the skateboard, in my opinion. But yeah, this is probably the sweet spot.
Yeah, PS2 to its bones, this pick, just like, yeah, was one of those 2001 games. It was just enormous and got massive review scores. Sort of the peak of the series for a lot of people.
I think that's good drafting, Matthew, even though I know you're a pro Skater 4 guy. Dave, this was like a Yuu game.
Oh, yeah. I loved the Tony Hawk franchise. For me, it peaked at two personally.
I agree with Matthew, as soon as you can get off the skateboard, the series lost its relevancy. But no, this is a really solid pick. Great soundtrack.
It's always about the soundtrack with Tony Hawk as well. It's like just awesome.
Big vast levels as well. And yeah, it's a good choice. What's your next pick, Matthew?
No one else is going to take it. But I'm basically filling out some categories where everyone else has done their business. So Shooter or Platformer.
I hope this is synonymous enough with PS2 to count. I wanted to pick Psychonauts.
Oh, good choice.
It's maybe a bit hypocritical going for me in terms of, as a technical platformer, Psychonauts is a little bit ropey. Like it's quite hard to play. It's got quite an erratic camera.
And I'd say like they don't really like properly nail the platforming fundamentals until Psychonauts 2, which I think is a big step up in that regard. But as sort of stylistic kind of settings riff, the idea of going to this psychic summer camp and then diving into the heads of troubled teachers and campers and whatnot to sort of solve their problems by exploring their psyches as landscapes. I think it's such a brilliant idea that just gives you really visually diverse areas to explore.
They really like mess around with specific gimmicks for specific brains and strange perspective shifts for different boss fights. Really, really inventive, as you'd expect from Tim Schafer. You know, I'd say his point and click work aside, I don't think he's ever really like nailed it like he has in Psychonauts 1 and 2.
There's other things I'm not as into. Well, maybe that's only brutal legend. Maybe there's nothing else.
But yes, this is really, really good stuff.
Must have been on your list, Ash.
Not on my list.
Really? Solid choice, though.
Yeah, I think it's a great choice.
Good choice.
I was very tempted by Tomb Raider Anniversary, but I sometimes wonder, am I the only person who truly loves that game? I think it's such a good riff on the original. Just makes it much easier for starters.
But yeah, that never seems to play particularly well on the pod, so I've abandoned it.
Would have been so funny if you tried to bullshit your way through Beyond Good and Evil after we did that podcast about how much we hated it. That would have been great. Okay, good stuff then.
We come to Ash.
I'm really struggling now and that's because pretty much my entire list now is a load of quirky stuff, which is great. I get to pick a quirky thing, but in doing so, I lock out a lot of other quirky things that I then can't talk about, which is, I don't know, it's just a personal annoyance. Looking at licensed game, I think I'm gonna go, a game that I didn't even know was a licensed game when I played it.
It's a Capcom game, and it's called Gregory Horror Show.
Matthew picked it last time.
Ah, right.
Yeah, I picked it for Wildcard, I think.
Good, you know it. I didn't know this. This is based on a CG anime that I think was only shown in Japan, but it came to me as a Capcom PS2 game.
I saw the Capcom badge on the box, so I just had to play it. It's really weird. It's kind of a survival horror game where you're a little boy in a hotel run by animals.
Very horror themed. And you're trying to, if I remember correctly, you're trying to retrieve souls from these animals. And you do that by...
It's one of these games where you have to follow the routine of everyone in the building, learn their routines, learn when they're going to be vulnerable or doing the thing that you need them to be doing in order for you to do X, Y, and Z. And I think if you've played Majora's Mask, that's probably the most mainstream example of that kind of genre where you're following routines. But it has really creepy undertones to it.
A lot of the gameplay is about spying through keyholes into the rooms of the guests and watching what those guests get up to when they don't think they are being watched. And even though they are these cute little animals, they are all doing quite horrible and perverse things. So it's quite a surprisingly disturbing game to play.
If you make some mistakes, then you end up getting chased around the hotel by a nurse with a giant syringe. It really brilliantly treads the line between comic and horror pretty well. And there's not really anything else on PS2 quite like it.
So it's really good fun, I thought.
I like that pic. Matthew went to Batford last time. It's truly lost to history as well as a Capcom classic.
Dave, do you want to piss on this one?
I think Ash spoke to me about it a while back and I confused it. I thought you were talking about a wet dream you had because that sounds exactly like your kink.
For fuck's sake.
Yeah, I've got... No, it's fine. It's a bizarre game but a little repetitive.
No more bloke guests on this podcast this year.
It's a flavor we don't normally have.
It's really like not us. That's the thing. It's so not us.
It's just tickling me.
Yeah, it is funny. Okay. All right.
Kill yourself. Kill you. Okay.
Back to me there. It's time for me to take Category 3 Sports or Racing and take the mighty Burnout 3 Takedown. Nice.
Very good.
Yeah. Just the sweet spot between the absolute carnage of taking downloads of cars to amp up your boost and keep going versus the just really great arcade racing that the previous two Burnout games had been sort of like honing. This is the right sort of tonal sweet spot and it's just still great fun.
It still hasn't been replaced as a proposition really. It's still the best version of its type of thing. And then, of course, the addition of Aftertouch 2.
Once your car has been wrecked, wreck another car, do another take down, then you can sort of negate the effect of the take down on you. Just great shit, really. And the concept of just like mashing through cars to like keep going is just so, so fun.
And it's still just really like fast and technically impressive. You will definitely notice the Jagged Edgers playing it now. I played it at NQ64 last year with a mate, but I think this is great.
Matthew, you're fond of this one, right?
A great pig. It's very like of its era. You know, I was also weighing up like this and maybe an SSX for sports racing.
Maybe that will still come into play. I don't know. But I love the just the super loud, obnoxious era of sports games that is very PS2.
Yeah, for sure. Just had all the all the right bits in the right places. Good modes to extend the life of it as well.
Great stuff. All right, then we come back to you, Dave.
Now, there's two solid picks in License Game, I think, for me. I think there's the fan favorite and there's the one I love.
I want to know what your idea of the fan favorite is.
Is it Simpsons Hit and Run?
It's Simpsons Hit and Run. It's Simpsons Hit and Run. I'm going to go for it.
I'm going to go Simpsons Hit and Run License Game. Let's lock it in. Let's go green on Simpsons Hit and Run.
Would you even consider it a cult game? Because it was a massive hit at the time, but it's certainly its reputation has far outlived its quality at this point. I played it again a couple of years ago.
I downloaded it, and it's pretty clunky, but you can't deny the fun it is by essentially making a GTA clone in The Simpsons. It's arguably the best licensed Simpsons game there's been. Then I get some jeers from the people here.
There's some solid early platformer ones for my taste.
The arcade game is probably the best one, I think.
That's true, the arcade game, yeah, that is the best one. I take that back. But the hit and run is second.
It's just fun to explore a 3D, sorry, a sort of open world Springfield as well, which up to that point I don't think had been done. The Simpsons movie game did it later on. But up until this point, it's always been sort of snapshots of the world that for our generation is much beloved.
So being able to do that, being able to interact with all the characters, to do these sort of fun zany missions that felt very in tone humor-wise with the quality of the better episodes of The Simpsons. There's a reason why it's still many, many, many years later very well regarded. So yeah, I do really like this game.
And I think it's probably, if not Spider-Man 2, it's the best licensed game you can pick on this list.
I don't know if best is right. It's like, I think it's a winning choice. It was a proper chocolate and peanut butter game at the time.
And every little kid had this in their PS2 collection. And they are now, they have grown up to be people on the internet who bang on about it.
And who vote in drafts.
Yeah, it was something that it just scratched in it. She just wanted to see a Simpsons game do this kind of thing. It's not really great at anything in terms of like driving or, you know, on foot.
I think the driving is fine. It's a little loose.
Cars blow up so quickly. That's the problem.
Maybe the way you drive them.
But it's more like the fact that they did these locations in with these graphics. I mean, the slightly warped looking 3D is like the Homer 3D Halloween special episode. That's not really a criticism.
I think it's quite an endearing aesthetic to look back on. And yeah, just has a lot of different sides of Springfield for your buck. Ash, what do you think of this pic?
Are you much of a Simpsons guy?
Like everyone, I adore the first eight or so seasons of the show. I had the DVDs when they first started coming out and yeah, absolutely love it. My Simpsons game is Bart vs.
the Space Mutants on the Commodore 64. We can do an entire book about that if you like.
I really love that game.
Sounds like XL tier fodder to me.
Yes, I never played this game. Sorry.
Fair enough. Okay, what's your next pic, Dave?
I'm going to go sports or racing and I'm going to go everybody's golf for this one.
Intriguing.
There's definitely games I played more, but I think those are fairly generic multi-format sports games of the era. Everybody's golf, again, feels like one of those defining PlayStation franchises. For people who don't know, it's very easy to pick up arcade golf game.
It's not by any means Tiger Woods. It has its very cartoony aesthetic. It's very charming, a lighthearted take on the sport for people who want something more casual.
Yeah, you get sort of very cartoony looking characters. There's a lot of customisation options in it, I seem to remember. It's kind of relaxing and laid back and something that I enjoy playing with friends.
It wasn't a high pressure sports game. It was fairly friendly, competitive. And the courses themselves offered sort of really unique and different settings for a golf game, whether it's something with like a fish tanks in it, windmills sort of like had a little bit of crazy golf to it.
But yeah, it's a really fun sports game that sort of doesn't take itself too seriously. And I think in this era, there was a lot of serious sports games. And so this really stood out to me as something that stood out by its approach.
Yeah, fair enough. I mean, it does go on to be quite a big series. I'm not really familiar with this one.
But I will take your word for it, David.
Ash must have played it.
Big fan of these games. The first one was made by Camelot, who also made the Mario Golf and Mario Tennis games. So it's very familiar if you played Mario Golf.
I think the great strength of this game, like the clues in the name, like this is a sports game that anyone can pick up and enjoy because it's so accessible, so fun, but also like really juicy to play. Like it just feels good to play. It's a great game.
Lovely. All right, comes back around to me for my penultimate pick. It's time to finally do a survival horror or stealth game.
And I'm going to take Hitman Blood Money, the defining Hitman game of this generation, and a game that would hang over the series, overshadow the series for basically the next decade until they finally, with the World of Assassination Trilogy, tapped back into loads of the things that this game does well, including very memorable set pieces. I mean, the level in the neighborhood in this new life is still, me and Matthew did a whole podcast about this game. It's still really good fun.
They are more simple versions of levels than the big clockwork masterpieces that you get in the World of Assassination Trilogy. But it does all the things that Hitman does, the freedom of approach and rewarding your ingenuity and your tidiness, not getting caught, that kind of stuff. Levels are unexpectedly vast in some cases.
In the second half, they grow to be quite huge. Great Mardi Gras level in this, great theater level in this, just really finding their feet in terms of distinctive level design. Didn't get a Metal Gear.
I do like Silent Hill 3, but I think next to Silent Hill 2, it's going to look a bit weak. But so why not counter program and pick a genuinely great stealth game of the time? What do you think of this, Matthew?
I think when we did that podcast, I think we both found it like a little hard to go back to. But that doesn't really like diminish the strength of its ideas and the fact that every level throws something completely different at you. It's just so hard because 2016 Hitman Forward is just so much.
It's probably one of my 10 favorite games of all time. And it's so hard to go back to. But for the longest time, it felt like this was going to be it for Hitman in terms of the perfect balance of depth of gameplay, but also with the variety of levels.
And there's so many levels in this game. You know, it's like two and a half modern Hitman games in one, really. And you're right in terms of it's very, very different to Man Hunt, Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid 3.
So well salvaged, I'd say.
Does it have the most sort of like iconic Hitman level in a new life with where you're Corky the Clown? Like that for me, it's just when I think of Hitman is the level.
Yeah, that's that's pretty up there. The Opera House is quite iconic as well.
Yeah, it's very fiddly that level to do these days. But the idea of it, the Opera House one they still haven't really done in another level in exactly the same way. Whereas in a new life obviously they did like a better version of in Hitman 2.
But still like going into the tree house with the sniper rifle, great stuff in this. It's just, it's all there. Okay, that feels like a strong pick then, in which case we go back to Ash.
Okay, I'm going to go free pick and I'm going to take a game that requires a little bit of explanation. It's a Konami game called Remote Control Dandy SF.
Here he is.
He's cooking.
You're like a parody of yourself.
One with a control dandy. Is that a desperate Dan or a different dandy?
Yeah, like Dandy and Beano. And then crucially SF on the end, which stands for science fiction. It's a sequel to a PlayStation 1 game called Remote Control Dandy.
It is a giant robot simulation game. The key differentiator with this version is that you control two entities at the same time with one controller. So with the analog sticks, you are controlling a human character in first person perspective in a 3D world, who then with a remote control is controlling a giant robot, which you guide using the remaining buttons on your DualShock 2 controller.
So, it's quite purposefully cumbersome game to play. It takes a long time to get used to it, and it's a very tutorial heavy game, because you're trying to move this character around in first person perspective, while also looking up at this giant robot with an enormous sense of scale, and trying to make that move, and make it puncture the robots while you're running around and getting to safety. Lots of different combinations of the shoulder buttons are required, just to make this robot go where you want it to go.
So the left leg is controlled with the left shoulder buttons, the right leg controlled with the right shoulder buttons. So you're kind of tapping them to make your robot move one step at a time. But then you can hold both right buttons to make him turn right, hold both left buttons to make him turn left, you get the idea.
Hold both L2 and R2 to crouch, and then hit the other shoulder buttons to make him jump in the air. There's all sorts of stuff you can do with your robot and with your little guy. Trying to do them both at once, it creates like a really high skill ceiling for this game.
But of course, as you would find with many games that have a high skill ceiling, as you master it, the rewards come and it feels really good to play and to get good at it. I played some levels of it today. I think a really good example of how this works is there's a mission where to succeed you are required to knock your enemy robot onto its face and then expose the kind of energy core on its back and freeze it.
So you do this by walking up to it as a giant robot. You have to kind of lift his arm in the air, which requires you to press about 400 buttons to do that and then karate chop the robot down. Any other form of attack might knock the robot onto its back or knock it flying, but you need the specific attack to make it fall onto its face.
Then your robot's work is done and using the analog sticks as the little guy in first person, you then use your jet pack to fly up to the robot, jump on his back and shoot a little freeze spray. You've got a freeze spray that you can spray onto his battery and freezes the robot's battery and stops it dead. By the way, one of my favourite things to do in this game is the little guy's jet pack onto the roof of a building so you can get a better vantage point for making your giant robot fight.
But that creates some risk because these robots are creating all kinds of damage so the building you're on could literally crumble beneath your feet. You can fly up and stand on the shoulders of your robot if you like, like a little anime kid. There's loads of different ways that are not necessarily rules of the game but you can find to have fun with it if you spend the time mastering the controls and being playful.
So this is a very, very obscure game but it's one that people who have played it and they've put the time into it, I think really get a lot out of it. So I needed to have it on this list.
I love Ashtar. You've come to this and you're like every pick you've had, you're like here's 10 minutes of precise detail of one level that I played, every little minutia of what happens. And then it comes to me and it's like, here's me trying to remember something I played 20 years ago in the vaguest terms possible.
Here's when this game was in a crap film.
The Simpsons was a TV show that was popular in the 90s. This game really tapped into that I found. That was what your hit and run explanation was like.
I know, but that's true. That's basically everything that's great about hit and run.
I appreciate Asher's precision at Gone 11 on a Sunday evening.
You can't pick a game like Remote Control, Dan DSF and not explain what it is, right?
It's exactly why we brought you on the podcast. And if Dave hadn't taken so long with technical issues, it would still be sub 11pm, so that's fine. In which case, we move on to Matthew's final two picks.
Truth is, so many things I wanted have been gone. Wild Cards, Tricky, I did have a Gregory Horror Show down as a potential for this, and a fancied Katamari Damacy. Will we accept slightly flawed David Cage thriller Fahrenheit as a Wild Card?
Fuck yes. Go for it, mate.
Excellent. I'm a big fan of this game. I know I dunk on the David Cage games on this podcast a lot, but there was a time where I was so up for his schtick, in terms of trying to push video game storytelling further.
I'm trying to capture emotions and thrills and moments in films that no one else has done. The anticipation I had for Fahrenheit or Indigo Prophecy if you played it in the States was just like through the roof. I remember going to Bayes and Stoke after work on the bus to pick up a copy on release date.
I just had to get it in my life as fast as possible. Probably no better scene than in the opening scene where you start the game having murdered someone in a bathroom and have to decide whether to tidy up the crime scene or get the fuck out of the diner before the police turn up and use all these split screens to show you the progress of threats coming towards you as you're doing different quick time events to try and sort things out. No beating around the bush.
This game does go to complete shit in the final third. You end up fighting an old lady who is like the internet or something.
You have sex with a zombie, don't you?
Yeah. It's flawed. I'll admit.
But I think the few scenes where it does capture that sensation of, I've got to make a lot of decisions very quickly before things come and get me is very unique sensation. And it's one that he's kind of leant on over and over again. But I don't know if he's ever really done much more than what he did in Fahrenheit.
I'm still fond of it. It's very, very uneven. I think it's a good wild card as a result.
Yeah, I like this pic. You got to watch that Andy Kelly video, The Madness of Fahrenheit. Absolutely the funniest thing I've ever seen.
But definitely support the idea that there's a hot minute when you're playing this at the start, where you think this is incredible that they pulled this off on a PS2. The presentation is immaculate. Good pic, Matthew.
What's your final pic?
My final pic? It's got to be the old music, rhythm, action or arcade. Is it shitty of me if I do pick another guitar hero?
Nope, it's your... I picked Another Devil May Cry. It happens.
Yeah, I didn't have a huge amount of experience with many rhythm games on PS2, to be honest. I struggled to work out what the really killer arcade pic is as well. I thought either would sound a bit false.
I did play Guitar Hero. I'm going to take Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock. I did a cursory glance down the track lists of 2 and 3 this afternoon and was mainly impressed.
They used so many master tracks on 3. Even 2 only had a couple of them. Not really my genre of music.
There's not a lot of Randy Newman in it.
I was reading a thing where someone was like, yes, you get to have a boss fight with Tom Morello. I have no fucking idea what that is. I wish him well and his guitar.
Guitar Hero 3, the era of plastic guitars. It lived beyond PS2, but it felt very PS2 to me.
Okay, so that is Guitar Hero 3, so you picked, right?
Yes.
Yeah, okay, sorry. Okay, cool. It's a good pick.
It's the right Guitar Hero.
Well, it's interesting, because I do think that the one that you locked into is the one that... Like, I played this on 360, but if this is the first Guitar Hero you played, and it does define it in your brain, so it does make sense, Matthew. Good stuff.
We come to Ash's final pick. Ash, I've set aside 45 minutes to this pick, so go for it. The more obscure, the better.
Let's start with the beginning of time. It's like Terrence Malick. It's like there's a dinosaur on a piece of ice floating in the Pacific.
What have you got for your last pick?
Yeah, this PS2 game only came out in Indonesia and I sold five copies. Now, right, we've got Sports or Racing left, and I am, oh God, I am torn.
I know what he's going to pick, and it's a fucking banger.
Well, okay, I'm going to have to pick it now. I'm torn between the banger and something obscure that will take 10 minutes to explain, so I'll go for the banger.
I want you to have a good chance at the poll, so I think the banger will serve you well, Ash. It's my drafting advice.
No, this is, this is, this is being me. Let's end on a high with a game that everybody loves, and it is called Outrun 2006, Coast to Coast. Since Dave took a Sega game from me, I decided to put one back in.
This is console conversion of Outrun 2 SP, the finest Sega racing game known to man, but with loads of extras thrown in there, a whole kind of career mode lovingly made by Sumo Digital in Sheffield, who they'd cut their teeth on the Xbox conversion of Outrun 2, and then they really went wild with this version, which threw everything but the kitchen sink at Outrun, and kind of pulled off a minor miracle, which was taking like a five-minute arcade game and turning it into something you can just play over and over again for a long time with loads of modes, unlockables, all that kind of thing, which is great. I think that was the expectation of PS2 owners at the day, but also you can just switch it on and play for five minutes and go along for that beautiful journey as Yuu Suzuki so brilliantly put it. It's a great, timeless arcade game and it has yet to be bettered.
Great choice. I'm glad you picked this. I think that's a real high to go out with.
Anyone who came into contact with this, whether it is on PS2 or PSP or wherever, they might have got it. It's just magnificent. Yeah, really, really good.
OK, that's strong. It comes to my final pick. Am I allowed an Onimusha game as a wild card?
Thoughts?
Yes. I wonder if it's the one I was playing yesterday.
Matthew, what do you think?
Yeah, I mean, I'm OK with it.
In which case, then, yes, my final pick is for wild card category 10 Onimusha 2 Samurai's Destiny, one of my favorite games of all time. The reason this stands out, I've talked about this in the podcast before. I don't remember the last time this came up, though, is that it is a game where you affect the outcome of the story in many moments throughout the game based on items that you trade with the different supporting characters in the game, to the point where different characters can join you for combat encounters as help.
There are bespoke sections where you play as those characters, where Control is taking off your main character and you play as like this little ninja lad or this dude with a load of guns or this fat monk with a load of big spears, and you play as those characters that you're like your pal in the story basically for a section, and then Control is reverted back to Jube, the protagonist, looked way better than the first Onimusha which felt like a bit of a proof of concept, and you just had so much replay value from that system. Great bosses, has that Capcom DNA of like the fixed perspective survival horror, but layers all of this cool hack and slash combat on top of it. Kind of splits the difference between Rezi and Devil May Cry really, Onimusha.
I think that's probably fair to say. Ash, what did you think I was gonna pick?
I think we're gonna go for Onimusha 3 here, which is I think the most wild thing about it is that it somehow stars Jean Renault as a playable character. Also brilliant, I've never played Onimusha 2, it's one of the three I haven't played, but your description makes it sound essential. Like I really want to play it, that's what you've just said.
It's a real one-off. It's just nothing else I've encountered exactly like it is. They're not like, it's not like moral decisions in the right way.
It's like knowing that your dude likes guns, has an interest in antiques and then saving up, buying this flamethrower and trading it to him. Then later on, when you take control of him, he's got that flamethrower and the machine gun that you've bought him. It's just like you get the big tree at the end of all of the different choices you could have had depending on which characters were you allied with at that time.
I love this game. I feel like that's a very me pick to end on. So what's your final pick, Dave?
Now, unfortunately, as we hit the free hour mark, my microphone decided to stop recording. What that means is that it missed my last pick of the draft. So hopefully Sam and Matthew will add this into the final edit.
And so I can just tell you what it is. So after much deliberation, I decided to go for my last pick in the category of RPG Kingdom Hearts 2. We talked about this a little bit earlier on in the draft.
Sam says that the first Kingdom Hearts is a better pick, given that it's when the narrative is relatively straightforward. It's before the story gets sort of tied into knots around the sort of various intricacies and nonsensical plotting that it gets lost in from two onwards. But for me, two is the best of the series.
I'm not so bothered about the story. It's all kind of white noise to me. That's not why I play the Kingdom Hearts games.
It's all about the different locations you get to visit, the sort of recreation of those popular Disney worlds. And Kingdom Hearts 2 absolutely tickles the nostalgia glands for me, especially as someone born in the 80s and as a child of the 90s. You get a lot of the fantastic Disney Renaissance characters and locations from stuff like Lion King and Mulan.
And then you go back to the Hundred Acre Wood, you've got Aladdin again, you've got Little Mermaid again. This one has Beauty and the Beast. Getting to explore those places felt so novel and unique.
And the authenticity that Kingdom Hearts brings to those various locations, having a lot of the voice actors back works really well for that. It's just fantastic, really immersed me. And what I really love about Kingdom Hearts 2 is how for each of the worlds, it has a different sort of twist on the usual gameplay.
And I think the best version of this is the Tron world where you get to ride light cycles. And I did mention that the remake, the 2.8 that came out, does this even better because you get to do the light cycles at really high fidelity.
But I think you'll find it was exactly the same game, Dave, but with in HD.
You know, this came at a time when the Tron brand wasn't as big as it is now. Tron Legacy hadn't come out. You know, it was a fairly niche curiosity from the 80s.
So to be able to go back into that world, to have it so lovingly recreated was really special for me. And yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2, I can't imagine a PlayStation draft for myself, a PS2 draft without it. So that's my final pick.
I think it's a great final pick. Like the Kingdom Hearts 2 is really good. It is enhanced over the original in some ways.
I agree the elegance of storytelling in the first one. It makes it like an iconic PS2 game and a great pick. But the second one does have better combat.
It is interesting how it expands the pool of Disney worlds. The Mulan world is really great in this one too. I really rated that.
When this came out, this is a huge event for me. I thought some of the set pieces they pull off are really good, like where you have to kill a thousand Heartless in a row. That was quite a feat for the PS2 to pull off.
Has a bit where fucking Tifa, Cloud, Squall from FF8 all team up and beat up a load of Heartless. I thought that was rad because I was 17. Okay, good stuff.
