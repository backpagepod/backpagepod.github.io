Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's it going? Where to start, really, with what's been going down? It's fucking freezing in a bath.
I don't know if you've noticed that. It is. I've been struggling to just stay warm.
I think it's quadrupled the amount of calories I've been consuming the last few days. We were on a train yesterday together, coming back from London.
Yeah, randomly, we ended up on a train together.
It was actually really fun. You should tell me next time you go to London, and I'll make sure that I'm going the same day on the off chance we can line that up. I enjoyed that.
But I explained to you how much food I'd eaten that day. I think it was a shockingly large amount, but yeah.
I bought a bottle of flavored water, which I found abnormally sweet.
And you complained about it after every single sip. I noted that. You've also gone big on the Hotel Chocolat Velvetizer.
Do you want to talk about this addition to your life and your home setup?
We got a Velvetizer for Christmas from Catherine's mom, and it's life changing. I mean, it's like, it's a very dangerous thing to have because I know hot chocolate isn't the hardest thing to make it, but a Velvetizer makes it incredibly easy because you just pour milk in up to the line, put in the sachet of perfectly weighed out proportion of chocolate flakes, press a button and two minutes later, you've got the perfect cup of hot chocolate. And it's like having like a little meth factory or something in the kitchen.
It's like I'm only ever two and a half minutes max from having hot chocolate, which makes all the difference from how it was before with sauce pans and whatnot. So yes, I'm going big on that. We got given a big box of sachets of different blends for the Velvetizer, which we've been working through.
And I've singled out the salted caramel blend as the sweetest and so my favorite. So what you saw happen yesterday was I'd just bought a box of salted caramel Velvetizer sachets from Hotel Chocolat in Paddington Station. It must have seemed like a parody of myself to bump into me in the train station holding a Hotel Chocolat shopping bag.
I didn't even fucking blink. I was like, well, yeah, of course he does. You know what I mean?
We're beyond parody at this point. I'm just like, yeah, the parody is part of the program. So yeah, very good.
That's what's going on with me.
Yeah, excellent stuff. So this episode then is a mail bag. It is going to be slightly briefer than some of our more recent mail bags.
So there'll be less banging on at the start here and more banging on, I suppose, when we get into the questions.
That was a solid two minutes on the Velvetizer.
Yeah, I think so. Will that go up, you know, sort of be remembered as one of the great pod bits of The Back Page? I'm not sure.
They're few and far between these days. Everyone's just like, play the hit, play the hit, play Randy Newman being lowered in a car at E3. We were like, that was two years ago.
Yeah, we're so much more sophisticated now, no we're not. Did you see actually in the pod lore channel of the Discord, someone dropped in, like, there's a viral tweet of DS, Dame Judi Dench going around from, well, I can't remember which game it was from, actually, but actually, I'll just double check that. It might have been Bloodstone.
Yeah, it was Bloodstone.
I tell you what, I mean, I don't know what the intention is behind that tweet, but I think that's a pretty good Judi Dench for a DS.
I think the DS is doing all right. I mean, I think that's a better Judi Dench than the DS did, like, Pikachu, for example. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, that's a better Judi Dench than PS Hagrid.
I did almost go with Dime Judi Dench as my kind of tweeter girl with that, but I thought, you know what? I just can't be bothered, so yeah.
But yeah, I was like, I think the DS is punching above its weight there. Like, you can look at that, and you're like, that is clearly Dame Judi Dench.
Definitely. There's a guy in the background who is more ambiguous. There's like...
Yeah, well like, someone has to pay the price for the amount of polygons in Judi Dench. And it's that guy.
Judi Dench was like a week of work for an artist. That guy was like a day of work, basically. So, you know, that's all good.
He was made from the offcuts of Judi Dench.
Yeah, the remnant of Judi Dench. Okay, good stuff. So yeah, we've wasted a bit of time there.
So we have a bunch of questions to go through here. To the listeners who have submitted questions between Christmas and New Year, if we missed some of these here, I'm sorry about that. If we've gone past them and you feel like it's a good question you'd like us to answer, feel free to drop it back into pod questions and we'll try our best.
Surely they think all these questions are good. You couldn't possibly be suggesting that they're just putting in things here for the sake of being noticed.
Not at all, Matthew. I have a lot of respect for our listeners, asterisk. But no, it's basically because like some of them, for example, Angry Kurt has asked, in a surprise announcement, Rockstar decides to sell the next GTA, set the next GTA in Bath, and if I had you to script one of the missions.
I think we did that in a previous episode. I think we did that in the GTA clones on trial, when you came up with your sort of Bath open world game. And I think that was a thing that happened.
And I think like, did you say that the Roman Bath would be in your game or something like that?
Oh, and if you're doing GTA in Bath, that's kind of, I'd say that's one of like three places you have to put in. The other, the Crescent and the Abbey, just in case you care to.
Yeah, definitely. And then like, you know, I think like, I don't think I've made, maybe I didn't make this joke, but like the J.C.'s Kitchen appearing can be like the UFO in GTA V where you're like, oh, I've heard this myth that there's like a J.C.'s Kitchen thing that appears on some days when it's not raining in the open world. Anyway, I guess that kind of is an answer to that one.
But we're gonna go through some of the questions we've had here. Okay, so personal today, this first question is from 17th of November. So that's kind of where we're starting.
Hello, Samuel and Matthew, over your careers to date, how did writing about games change, if at all? Were there trends you noticed in your peers and do you think this approach to review has shifted significantly from when you first started to the present? God, sorry, it's been a day, so I'm reading that very incoherently.
But writing style of reviews, Matthew, has that changed significantly since we started? I think like my answer to this would be like a lot of the sort of tonal roughness of the, you know, the noughties has been purged, like the kind of like more ladsmaggy writing you might get. It's more the kind of turns of phrase and stuff like that.
I don't know if I'd say that the review writing is any better necessarily. Like I think that there's probably like other ways in which it's changed actually, like maybe you get less of the itemized list of how things are reviewed, like the, now we're doing the paragraph on the audio, now there's the paragraph on the graphics and things like that. And maybe it's more of a kind of like a more consistent sort of piece.
Like you never read a movie review that does that about the, and all the sound. Or maybe you would have like a paragraph about a Hans Zimmer soundtrack or something like that. But I think it's, yeah, I guess like it's changed and it hasn't changed.
I don't know. Like I think I would read a review from about 15 years ago, 16 years ago, and still pretty much enjoy it as much as I'd enjoy a review now. But what do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I think you're definitely right about it being less sladdy. These days, I think if you put any slang for breasts in review text, it would be frowned upon. And there was a lot of that in games mags, even innocent ones.
It wasn't necessarily laddy, it was just sort of silly and cheeky, a bit more carry on, I think. And I guess the shift that definitely was happening when I was on magazines was the idea of vanishing into a brand and being part of this kind of collective whole versus this more individual take thing, which was emerging, particularly in PC games writing, and people like Kieran Gillan and whatnot were kind of pushing for this lot more lived in experience, which was quite kind of, I wouldn't say it was anti. I don't think they were like, they hated the magazine's style, but that was very different.
And now that is the predominant form, like there's a lot of people's personal experience and why this game resonated with me because of this, and that is in vogue. I'm still kind of quite old fashioned in how I write about games, I think. I don't think I've lived an exciting enough life to have a huge amount of input on how games reflect experiences I've had, because I haven't had many experiences.
So, you know, you sometimes read these things where they're like, this really reminded me of when I was a bouncer in a nightclub in Thailand, and you're like, what the fuck? You know, like I worked in Homebase. I mean, if there's a game with a paint mixing mini game, then, you know, sign me up.
I got a lot of personal takes. But yeah, I'd say that's the difference. I was never a, here's my graphics paragraph, here's my sound paragraph.
But I am quite meat and potatoes in terms of, I cover some of the basics. I'm quite old fashioned that way.
Yeah, I think I've forgotten how to do it to a large extent. I remember the last review I wrote before I moved into PR was Deathloop. And I had forgotten exactly what I was doing.
And then like, there was a lot of like, writing and rewriting and like, oh, how did this start again? And do I have this like, do I have like the waffly paragraph at the start where I'm like, time, what a concept. You know, like sometimes you get those reviews, you know what I mean?
Where it's like, you know, you take two paragraphs to sort of go around the block before you get to what you're aiming for. And I don't know if I've ever much of those kinds of reviewers. It's kind of like, I was kind of straight in there really.
But yeah, I think you're making a point about that lived and experienced thing. Like, I've definitely mentioned it before, but like, Phil Savage reviewing the pub from Everybody's Gone to the Rapture as someone who worked at a pub once. That was good.
Or like, I think we hired, I think someone on PC Gamer hired a farmer to review Stardew Valley. And that was like a massive piece that year that it went live. So yeah, yeah, good stuff really.
But yeah, I don't have any relevant experience. There are no games that you play as like a shopkeeper, like on weekends in like a small town in Hampshire. It's not a thing that ever happened.
It should exist though. That's the kind of game that if you made that here, it would become a massive curio to Japanese people in the same way that those games about the summer holidays that are only ever released in Japan are like obsessed over by Western fans.
Yeah, it would be like, you know, a sort of a 10 pound steam game here, but sold in a PS5 box in Japan and for like 50 quid.
There'd be a Japanese equivalent of Tim Rogers doing a four hour video essay about like, oh my God, I love how much dog shit you step in in this game. Is that really what England's like?
I'd love to do, what I could do is like, basically when I worked in One Stop, but I don't know why I'm talking about this because I'm probably using up half the episode time doing this.
This is fine.
But basically, I used to have to manage the like paper rounds and like go through these big books and like people had to pay their bills, they had to tick them off and all this stuff. I do like papers, please, but it's like I have to decide whether some old lady gets her copy of the Telegraph this week. That's like basically what I do.
It's like, Agnes, no, no Telegraph for you. And it's like, Barbara, she can have her Daily Mail. Like that'd be my...
That sounds like a great game. It'd be like, Tory papers, please, basically. That's what I would do.
Oh, okay. Very good. Okay.
So do you want to do this next question about biscuits, Matthew? Oh, where's that? Yeah.
Scroll down a few days. To the listeners, normally we have a very arranged plan. This one's a little bit more flying by the seat.
We're being a bit more loose this year. This is The New Back Page.
No, I just didn't have time to make the plan. Next time, we'll have a plan.
Lads, this is from the Food Channel on Discord. Which three biscuits would you get rich rid of? And which three would you eat all day every day?
Feel free to expand the remit to cover various chocolate or flavored variants. I mean, the biscuits, for anyone who's interested, are Hobnob, Chocolate Vauban, Digestive, Vienna, Nice. Is that Nice or Nice?
Nice?
Don't know, like coconut, basically.
Jammie Dodger. No, no, as in the biscuit, nice. Is that nice or is it Nice?
No, no, I know what you're asking, but I was saying it's basically the coconut one, isn't it? Yeah.
Oh, wait, so I thought you were saying, I thought you thought I was asking whether you thought of Vienna was nice, and then I was asking whether that word is pronounced Nice. Don't worry.
Let's go great this episode.
A garibaldi, a rich tea, malted milk, custard cream, ginger nut, pink wafer, cabaret finger, Viennese whorl, I thought that was a Viennese, a Jaffa cake or a fox's crunch cream.
16 biscuits, but it's like a draught for it, isn't it?
So what, you've got to get rid of three of these, and then three of these you eat the rest of your days?
Yeah, so I'd get rid of the Nice slash nice biscuit, no problem. That'd be fine. I think I would also get rid of the custard cream.
I've had a lot of bad ones over the years, and maybe it's because when I was a child, these were the cheapest biscuits you could get. You get a big pack of them for 25p or something, and there was no real flavor to them. And I think I'd probably also get rid of the Garibaldi.
That's not really my sort of thing. So that's actually quite easy to eliminate three there. And the three I'd eat all day every day would be the Jammy Dodger, the...
What?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's like a party food. That's a once-in-a-while party food. It seems attractive because you can't eat it all the time.
I mean, you can as an adult, but I think if you had to eat it all day every day, you'd soon get sick of a Jammy Dodger.
But that's true for all biscuits, surely. I don't know. It's like a casual biscuit.
That's what the exercise is, isn't it?
Yeah, I suppose so. I mean, I suppose rich tea is like a biscuit you could eat all day every day. But I think it's about me I've got a relentless sweet to.
So I'd keep the Jammy Dodger, Cadbury Finger and I'd want a Hobnob to offset the rest of them, basically. So yeah, that's a bit of contrast there for you. Matthew, what do you got?
You see, I'd get rid of the Cadbury Finger. I think the Cadbury Finger is rank because it's like bad biscuit and not enough chocolate. It's like just be chocolate or just be a good biscuit.
Don't be this kind of middle ground. I'd probably get rid of the Pink Wafer, again, sort of associated with birthday parties. I'd probably get rid of it.
I really don't rate Jammie Dodgers. So, Jammie Dodgers. And then the three I'd eat all day every day.
Well, quite like a Jaffa Cake, actually.
Oh, yeah, they're good. You can get through a pack of those, no problem, as well. They're like air.
Oh, yeah, I couldn't unwind Jaffa Cakes.
It's like breathing.
Yeah, probably. Hobnob is really strong. Is it bored?
I do like a Digestive.
No, Digestive is like a good sort of middle ground between like something a bit sweeter and a rich tea biscuit. I find it something… Yeah.
The rich tea is just… I don't like the finish on it. The texture is too smooth.
It's too, like, matte.
The finish.
The finish on the… Whatever they've done to that fucking thing in the factory, I don't like it.
Stop varnishing the rich teas.
Yeah, so Hobnob Digestive and Jaffa Cake. I mean, I don't know what that means for the other, like, nine options.
Yeah, maybe you can eat those sometimes. You know, like you do now, basically.
Well, there you go. I hope that was lightning for you, mad brood.
Oh, knackered after that. Okay, next one. Roboku.
Hello, Samuel and Matthew. Apologies if this has been asked before, but what sort of note taking do you do when playing games? Do you keep a journal even when not playing for work?
What tools do you use and what do you write? Thanks. Well, I'm not a journalist anymore, but even when I was a journalist, I didn't take any notes, really, to be honest.
Oh, nice. Which is a bit stupid, but I suppose my reviews were just quite experiential. I'm quite big on...
If you looked at the early drafts of my writing, they are basically the notes. I would write clumps of sentences that would turn into full paragraphs later on and then piece them together. I don't even know how I would have functioned as a writer without word processing software, basically.
So that's my version of taking notes, but actual notes notes. The only time I can think of doing this was Jindosh's Lock in Dishonored 2, where if you basically looked at my iPad, there was a document of what looked like a sort of like year four student's maths homework, just like some of the dumbest things you've ever seen, basically. What about you, Matthew?
Originally, I used to take notes of things like specific names of places, just because I'd often get them wrong if I just tried to remember them. I also like the names of Mario Galaxy Galaxies when I was playing for review. But in terms of actual review notes, I've never been that big on it.
I always think the stuff I remember is the good stuff. If it jumps out enough, or if it stays in my head, then it's worth talking about. If I don't remember it, it's probably not worth talking about as a rule.
If I wrote everything down, I'd just have choice paralysis when I came to writing, because it's like, it is every thought you had remembered in this like, artificial way. The one thing I might write is, sometimes I'm playing a game, I think of a line or a joke or something that I want to put in a review, and I might write that down.
Right, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, that's basically you as a sort of like, amateur stand-up comedian basically.
Well, no, but more like lines, like an opening line for the review, or like a finishing line perhaps, like this little point here, or this character, or this mission, is a neat anecdote for this whole game. I might write that down just to remind myself, but generally, no.
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. I think you're quite good at those kind of like, zingers as well, like, you know, like a funny little line to pull you into the review. I think that's definitely something that you, you thrive at, so that makes sense.
Okay, should we go for this? Oh, that's so good. There's quite a few Christmas questions here, from listeners who didn't compute that we weren't doing any more mailbags in December, and I was like three days away from taking off on an airplane when these were sent.
So I think we skipped those, Matthew, because they don't really make sense in January. So apologies, Ryan Plugs. You can ask your question about most liked Christmas foods and snacks in November next year.
I've got a good Terry's Chocolate Orange story.
Well, I mean, I'm not going to deny the listeners that.
Go ahead, Matthew. I could tell next year.
So to wait a whole year for that story. They will pay all the story on Patreon or something. OK, we did get asked, when do you open your presents?
Is it before dinner, correct, or after dinner? Weird behavior. We actually covered that on the holiday special, didn't we?
So, OK. This question from NK on the 27th of November, Matthew. Do you want to read that one out?
Question, obviously. Any chance that Samuel and Matthew would revisit their previous drafts but limit themselves to games that are 5 or 6 out of 10s and below? Might be fun to hear if you gents could salvage a console or year with those conditions, or it might devolve into creating a cursed meme list and this premise doesn't have any merit, haha.
I think 5 or 6 is a bit too harsh. I don't think you'd actually get good insight, and I don't think you'd get things that we actually like and therefore can contribute any value to. They'd just be like, yeah, I guess I'll pick, you know, like The Simpsons Wrestling.
That's a bad example, because that's a 3, but you know.
Also, there's not really enough games that get low enough scores. Even back in the olden days, I think if you did a Metacritic of it those times, you're still looking at a lot of 7s and above. I could see doing one draft of bad games.
Right, yeah.
Rather than every draft, bad game variation.
Yeah, that sort of 7 out of 10 draft might be fun as well as an idea. I guess we did the best 7 out of 10 games. That covered a lot of the classics.
You could do a draft where you're trying to find things which the consensus was wrong on. How many gems are there, 6 and below on Metacritic? Are there any as an exercise?
And then maybe go into why we think some of those cases went a bit wrong or why those games have been reevaluated? Could be something in that.
Yeah, that's not a bad idea. I quite like that. But yeah, a bit of a tricky one, generally that.
That's yeah, it's definitely... I think the problem is with the draft, you don't want to ever give yourself too many restrictions because these sort of infinite possibilities of why drafts are exciting combined with the very obvious, like get these off the board first thing.
It is funny when you've got infinite possibilities and then you still manage to shit the bed or specifically, I still manage to shit the bed. I think that's part of the drafts charm.
I think you've still won more than half the drafts, Matthew. So again, the underdog thing, I never really get with you in drafts.
But it's like, you're given enough rope to select Red Faction as the best first person shooter on PS2.
Yeah, there's also two drafts. I think I did basically just cheat and ruin it for you, which was the wee draft where I picked the Metroid Prime trilogy. That was probably a bit too rude, really, in retrospect.
And then obviously the Golden Eye and Perfect Dark thing. But then people revolted against that and made me lose. So, you know, it's fine.
It balances out. All right, then. I made a joke underneath that, that Jet Force Gemini becomes a hot pick for the N64 draft in that case.
Continuing my dunks on that game from Rare, Matthew.
Very good. Just let it be known, Sam did dunk on Jet Force Gemini a month ago on Discord.
Yes, it never happened before. Okay, next question is from The Low Standard. Hello gents, I have a theory that most journalists were cast as the narrator in their school nativity plays.
What starring roles did you take? Two Giant Men play, the Archangel Gabriel. This is again another Christmassy question.
Maybe we need to not answer this one, Matthew, because I literally did play the shepherd though in the nativity play, which is very much like, sort of like in MCU terms would be like, not even the Falcon. It would be like one of those, like the, what's it called? The Eternals characters basically.
I think the shepherds are basically like Sprite or Richard Madden, do you know what I mean? Were you in the nativity play, Matthew?
Yeah, I think I was a shepherd. There's definitely a picture of me with like a headdress made from a tea towel, which is probably more shepherd than Three Wise Men. I mean, Three Wise Men is like the staff of every magazine for most of the 80s and 90s and 90s.
Did you do other school plays? Were you ever involved in amateur theatrics, dramatics, whichever one it is?
Well, I did drama in secondary school, but it didn't really amount to a play we did live. We did bits of Blue Remembered Hills, where it was all about who could do the best West Country accent, basically. And then at the end, you trap a boy, he can't walk into a barn, and then he burns to death because, I don't know, young people coming of age, I guess.
I never really got the point of Blue Remembered Hills, to be honest, but I'm slammed there. But what about you, Matthew? Were you a bit more of a into that stuff?
Well, we did school plays. I was a Lord Capulet in Romeo and Juliet, which is very much the kind of, you know, Bobby Kotick of Romeo and Juliet. That was pretty good.
I was The Undertaker in Oliver, the musical Oliver Twist, The Undertaker, who no one ever knows because The Undertaker's song isn't in the film, but he does have a song.
Oh, that's tough. So you're like basically the B-side no one knows about when that comes on.
Well, that was the play where my wife was now semi-famous person Alexa Chung.
Oh, right. Oh, OK. What, you went to school with Alexa Chung?
Yeah, I was married to her in the school play. We sang a song together about funerals. Whenever I see her, I always think, oh, we sung that song together about funerals.
I wonder if she remembers that.
How has it never come up that you went to school with Alexa Chung?
I don't know. I often think if I ever like encountered her in public, you know, like she might not remember me. But then I think, I wonder if she remembers me if I sung some bars of that song about funerals at her or if she just had me arrested.
Because the song was called That's Your Funeral, which if you shout out a celebrity, you'll probably get instantly beaten down.
That must be like... She would remember you, though, because you just do remember secondary school, don't you?
Yeah, well, you'd hope so.
That stuff jams in your memory.
Maybe we'll get her on as a guest.
For some reason, just maybe picture some kind of Hello Magazine photoshoot where you were her actual husband and there's just like, Alexa at home with Matthew! And it's like, oh, her kid's on the cards, that kind of stuff, you know?
I did once, so I once appeared randomly in Heat Magazine because Heat had a story about, look how uncool Alexa Chung was at school in this production of Oliver because they had pictures of it. They're obviously pictures of me as well. And I remember thinking like, that wasn't an uncool production.
It was a great production of Oliver, you fools at Heat Magazine. Perhaps your chronicle said it was awesome.
Perhaps your chronicle. It's like, you weren't there.
You weren't there, like, what a dweeb. And you're like, well...
Did she end up on tourney while you were at school? Did that happen?
No, afterwards. When she left, she was like, I'm going to be a model. And we were like, that's probably not going to happen.
And she started being an advert. And then she was on Pop World. And we were like, oh, well, there you go.
Fair play.
Did you go to school with anyone else famous?
I think that's pretty much it.
I went to school with a guy who tormented someone hanging them out of a window and then trying to drown them in a bathtub. He went to prison though. Was he in Heat magazine?
He was not, but he was in the Portsmouth News. A little photo of him outside the Crown Court. Great stuff, really.
Gives you a little snapshot of my life in Hampshire.
Very different teenage groups we ran with.
Yeah, the dark side of Hampshire. Like in Lady Bird, there's literally the side of the tracks that Lady Bird lives in. The Cersei Rodin character lives in the rough side and the Timothee Chalamet, I think, is from the posh side.
That's like us basically, Matthew. You're in the posh bit of Hampshire and I was in the bumpy part of Hampshire that no one wants to talk about. What are we doing on this podcast?
I hope that answers your questions about school plays.
Yeah, very good.
Let's get some video game content in this podcast.
This one's from Graham S. I've just received my annual performance review from all the major console platforms detailing the hours I've spent and all my many achievements. How many hours do you think you spent playing games last year?
How much time preparing and recording the pod? Was it time well spent for you? Thank you for all of it.
I'm very glad the time I spent with the pod this year. I know this sort of thing gets said a lot, but a good pod in your ear helps us all get through good times and bads. It's appreciated more than you realize.
Thank you very much. I did kind of go through this, and it was actually like some of the stats were quite sad. I realize I didn't play my Switch nearly as much as I hoped I would last year.
In the PS5 one, I did something like, I think I did 250 hours on PS5, and I wanted it actually because some people were posting like 600 hours on one platform, and I thought, oh, did I play as many games as everyone else last year? And I don't know, maybe I did, maybe I didn't. A lot of it is for the podcast.
A lot of it is kind of like sampling stuff so we can talk about what we've been playing episodes. But then, you know, many of the hours get sunk on the likes of, you know, playing. Final Fantasy 16 was a big chunk of my year last year, for example.
What about you, Matthew?
The only one I took a snapshot of was I did 506 hours on PlayStation. I must have done, I don't know, 400 hours on Switch, probably.
Wow! You played loads more than me last year, then.
I put loads and loads of time into Tears of the Kingdom and then Fire Emblem. You know, lots of big games that I played endlessly. Yeah, Xbox.
I don't know if I played my Xbox more than 10 hours last year. Sorry, Xbox.
So I remember, actually, my Switch one was like, you got 42 hours of Pikmin 4, you got 28 hours of Tears of the Kingdom, and then like, I think it was 8 hours of Fire Emblem, whichever the Fire Emblem was last year. What was it last year? I can't remember now.
Engage.
Yeah, from Fire Emblem Engage from last year. So yeah, that was pretty much it. But I don't know if I played more or less this year.
Your hours on PS5, though, very impressive. But there's maybe some work stuff in there, Matthew. I don't know.
80 hours of that was Final Fantasy 16.
Yeah.
So that made up a chunk. Yeah, I think I played some other things.
Okay, fair enough. All right, then. Do you want to read this next?
What about hours spent doing the podcast? How many hours do you do per episode outside of the recording time?
Gosh, it really depends on the episode. I suppose at the moment I'm playing a little bit of Marvel's Midnight Suns, a little bit of Yakuza Like a Dragon, and some other bits and pieces as well. I played a bit of Assassin's Creed Nexus, for example.
Those, I guess, are all going towards the pod in some way. I probably would normally just play one game at a time. That's the way the pod's changed my behavior, I guess, is I want to talk about a few things on what we've been playing.
I'm like, well, if I have two or three hours of each of these, then I'm not reviewing them, but I can give a credible account of my experience playing them. But there are other episodes like this one, where I didn't, as is probably self-evident, I didn't do any preparation for it, Matthew. And then there are episodes like The God of War ranking we did, where I did fucking tons of playing that game.
And Tears of the Kingdom, I played 24 hours of that. Starfield episode, I played a similar amount. I'd say probably about 30 to 40% of my playing time is linked to the pod in some way, probably more than that, actually.
And that's why you shouldn't cancel your Patreon pledges.
Yeah, so it really varies. But I'd say per episode, you're probably looking at about, I don't know, like two hours prep minimum for a podcast. Because I make the plan and you'd have to think of the idea.
If there's a guest, I have to think of questions. Sometimes I put a full afternoon into coming up with questions for a guest. Hopefully that comes across and the questions we do ask that are reasonably thoughtful.
That is awesome. That's never me because I'm a lazy shit.
Matthew contributes to the podcast in other ways. He brings the cult appeal that gives it its magic. He's a special source.
What about you Matthew? Anything more to say on that one?
No. There you go. Enjoy your dose of special sauce.
Great. I feel enriched. Do you want to read this next one from Angry Curt?
What arguments, discussions make your eyes roll whenever they come up? I'm thinking about whether Pineapple belongs on a pizza, and whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie. The type of questions which are fun the first time they come up, but maybe then become a bit boring.
Another one I want to throw into the mix. Discussions around what's the best gaming controller. I just think it's the most pointless argument because it all boils down to the size of your hands and how you like to hold things.
Too right! Apologies for the partial rant. That's the politest rant I've ever heard.
It's very tame that rant. Very PG. Maybe you can say you.
It's very you that rant is.
We all know it comes down to the size of your hands. So shut the fuck up!
That's really funny. It's like, no pineapple on a piece of your cock. It's not like he said that.
That would have made the tone of it quite different. Gosh, I don't know. I would say most conversations when they come up I'm done with.
Is X a Christmas movie? That's sort of like... I don't really engage with that, to be honest.
It's not always questions. It's sometimes just takes. The one that gets me is someone going, do you think Michael Caine's best performance was Muppet's Christmas Carol?
Or Michael Caine brings a certain level of sophistication to this, which really makes it work. It's like, I am so done with Muppet's Christmas Carol takes or opinions.
Yeah, because I think there's so much Twitter content every year about Muppet's Christmas Carol, and I really noticed it this year, because I did watch it. And I know, Matthew, that you, I don't know if you want to share your frustrations, but you had quite a funny rant to me about Muppet's Christmas Carol, how it sort of like has stuck in the public consciousness, even though maybe it shouldn't, or I don't know.
No, I just think it amused me when I was eight, and I'm happy to leave it back there. When I watch it, that's what I remember. I liked this when I was eight.
It isn't my cup of tea. I don't want to cast shade on anyone who does like it in adulthood, because it turns out for my Twitter feed, it's fucking everyone.
I would say that one actually that came up in the Discord is people who go and discover Uncharted now then complain about old Uncharted. Does that really annoy me? It's like, yeah, guess what?
Uncharted 4 is better than the rest, because the others were made years ago when the logic of this genre of games or the subgenre of third-person shooters with set pieces was being figured out in real time by the people making them. I actually think that Uncharted 2 isn't very good, and I'm like, well, do you want a fucking medal? Like, what are we doing here?
That's kind of my approach to that one.
Charles Martini is kind of the human embodiment of this question, because he only has five anecdotes, because he only really gets asked five things, very specifically about how he got the job, how he came up with the voice of Mario, and so I've heard him do, word for word, that spiel so many times that I'd scream if I heard it again coming from his mouth. In person, I'd scream in his face and say, don't, just don't tell me this, I do not want to hear it.
He's taken so many drive-bys from you on this podcast, Charles Martini, it's out of control, really.
I know, but he's not even there anymore, you know. We just don't have to think on him anymore, so.
Oh, I've got another one, actually, which is, like, people who take Doctor Who really seriously on social media and then talk about it like it's an empire rising and falling, and I'm like, that is a kid's show you're talking about. Like, I know that people have been watching it since they were young and it means a lot to them, but still, I think that people talking about Doctor Who, like, it's the centre of television, you know what I mean? Like, people who don't watch Succession but talk about Doctor Who, like, that I just, I'm a bit like, I just can't really be doing with it, so yeah.
I'm just like, oh, yeah, finally a course correction from the, I feel like people complained about the Moffat years, then they complained about the guy after the Moffat years, and like, I don't know. I just like, people have been complaining about, it's not been good by most people's criteria for like 14 years, and I'm like, oh, so that's the one that does my head in. I'd rather read football tweets than Doctor Who tweets, which is saying something really.
I do like seeing Man United fans lose their mind. I have nothing against them, but this is quite funny because it's broken their brains that they're not good. That's pretty much it, though, Matthew.
The Uncharted one is the main gaming one, though.
Yeah, that's true, but you are right, Angry Curt. No more pineapple on pizza chat. Come on.
Okay, good. There's some Zach's. Just playing Sackboy's Big Adventure, which I think completely rules, but unless it was an undigested crumb of cheese, there's a level with Uptown Funk as the soundtrack with the scenery half-heartedly hopping in time.
It really sucks. It has nothing to do with the level or the game or anything, and presumably cost a lot of money. Anyway, what are your favorite license music faves and failures?
Extra points for deep cuts. Any license music examples? Obviously, GTA does this better than anyone else, like the sort of Billy Jean at the start, which now I think when you play Vice City, because they don't have Billy Jean anymore, they have Blondie I think plays instead.
Still pretty good. You could play so many 80s tracks at the start of Vice City, and it would like blow your head off. Like I gotta say, one of my favorite 80s songs, it's in Vice City Stories actually, is Easy Lover by Phil Collins.
What a fucking banger that is. That's so good. So yes, but yeah, Matthew, anything spring to mind here?
This is why we normally prep for these, because I've been able to have a good old think and come up with some really great examples. Off the top of my head, I can't remember what songs they were, so it sounds like bullshit that I think these were good, but I really liked the musical titles to each episode of Tales from the Borderlands. They used to do those kind of like montages set to songs which I can't remember, but I remember thinking they were good.
There's like that I Need a Hero, Sinks Row 1, right? That was pretty good.
Yeah, I like it, and it's not... maybe it doesn't count as like licensed music as such, but I do like, you know, when you deploy a great bit of classical music. Little King's Story uses Bolero really well to kind of capture the tone and to set the whole vibe of the game.
Yeah, and I've always loved games that use Claire de Lune, like The Evil Within, where they use that for the save room. And whenever you hear that, you're just like, oh, thank Christ, it's Claire de Lune. I'm going to be able to save and not die and go back to the game over screen.
Also, Claire de Lune, a kind of remix of it, is used in Sayonara Wild Hearts.
Just a really great bit of music for sort of sliding along some magical space rollercoaster or whatever it is you're doing in that game. That was really cool. Those stick out as good music moments.
Those are definitely decent. I think that, I just remembered that bit in Call of Duty Black Ops where Sympathy for the Devil plays. And I think that one works because it is preposterous.
You are going up and down a river, blowing up like huts basically. But I think that why it works is because you hadn't heard it. You hadn't heard a Call of Duty do anything like that before.
And I think that it's not something you would have had in the Modern Warfare games. I would say that tonally it's something that it was quite black ops, I would say, the tone of that. But it definitely stood out as like, oh, right, that's kind of like years later, I've only played that game once, and it really has stayed with me.
So that's good. Obviously Bioshock uses licensed music well. Beyond the Sea probably being the most notable one where nothing sets the scene better than that.
And yeah, there's a few more cases of that. There's The Man Who Sold the World, mid-year version in MGS5, The Phantom Pain as well. I think that plays when Snake awakes from the coma in that game.
So that plays before quite a tense sequence. So you're going through a hospital with loads of dudes being killed basically. So yeah, a few that jump out there, Matthew.
What about that coconut song from Alan Wake on the jukebox?
Alan Wake has loads of good ones. I mean, yeah, this is like the remedy specialty. I don't know.
Is there much licensed music beyond Poets to Fall in Alan Wake 2, Matthew? I'm not sure, but...
It does. Yeah, the chapters end with songs that I think were written for the game rather than cuts from elsewhere. Like they've all got lyrics by Sam Lake, kind of wistful sort of indie pop that plays at the end of chapters.
So same vibe, but not as instantly recognisable.
A couple of chapters are completed in that game. I thought the music was decent. And that's probably just a way to get around the licensing headaches.
I think that was like a big problem for Alan Wake was just that it had Roy Orbison, Depeche Mode and all these artists. And there were really nice ways to end the chapters, but expensive to renew, I guess. So yeah.
Okay, next one then.
Dear Podcast Boys, you have been entrusted with the Muppets license and must give one video game franchise the Muppets treatment. replace the cast with Muppets, save for one character who remains unchanged. Like the incredibly sophisticated Michael Caine performance.
That was me adding that. That's what we call a callback. Which franchise do you pick and who remains un-Muppetized?
All the best, Nige.
Damn, that's like a video game franchise. In my head, I started picturing the film Anatomy of a Fall, but only the sun remained human and the rest of them were Muppets. And then, that's quite a traumatizing performance for that young man.
I think actually Anatomy of a Fall is more traumatic if everyone's a Muppet, except from the body that fell. So it's just Muppets having to deal with a very real human body.
That's pretty good. I don't know if there's anything that would be improved by Muppets. Our listeners certainly seemed excited by this question though, Matthew.
So I do want to engage with it on some level, I guess. Yeah, come on.
What's a great...
I suppose if you did like... Go on, go on.
A Muppet Phoenix Wright would be quite good.
That's good, I like that. Who would be human?
The judge. Because then it's like a judge presiding over puppet court and he's just like, oh, this is ridiculous. These already ludicrous cases are made even more so by the fact that it's puppets.
Yeah, that's a really good answer actually. I like that. It's like, yeah, funny there were more sort of silly games to sort of tap into there.
I think sort of a mass effect came to mind a little bit because I thought about if Commander Shepard was human, but you had to romance the muppets and then it's like Miranda Muppet and Tally Muppet and they're like, you got to pick the one you think is hottest. How cursed would that be? I think that's quite good.
Are there, I'm trying to think if it muppets Christmas Carol, there aren't, I think it is implied there are muppets who are married to humans.
I don't know if it strictly comes up. I think there's just like an ambiguity that hangs in the air of how the muppets and the humans coexist.
It should come up and Scrooge should be like disgusting. It shouldn't be allowed.
Well, that's the thing. He's not the only human in the film. There's flashbacks to the other characters, right?
But like, in fact, he's got his like, is he like his nephew or something as well in the-
Yeah, he's married to a human. And obviously Scrooge is the way he is because a human left him in the past.
Yeah, and presumably he didn't go to school with like, humans and other muppets because it flashes back.
Well, his teacher was, it's the stern bird, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so a lot of questions there, not many answers. So, yeah, but we have an answer each there, Matthew.
Someone suggested The Last of Us, except all of them are muppets, apart from Joel. I can't, it's just so dour, I can't quite imagine it.
What about Yakuza and everyone's a muppet, I guess, except Kiryu? Or maybe except Majima, that would be quite good.
That is good, yeah. Because I think you need to keep it a fair fight, otherwise it's just a man beating the shit out of some muppets, and that'd be quite easy fights, you know? But yeah, or it could be like, you know, this sort of, you know, one of them becomes incredibly buff or something like, by surprise, you know, like, what would be the Mr. Shakedown muppet, for example?
How big would that muppet be, you know? It'd be like the big lad, the big lad sort of like ghost and muppet Christmas cow, who's like, sort of like, looks a bit like Gimli, but is like six foot tall. Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, lots of things out there.
It'd definitely be him. Or they're all muppets, apart from like one of the very aging Japanese actors who plays like one of the older Yakuza's. So like, they're all there apart from-
Beat Takeshi, yeah.
Beat Takeshi, yeah, yeah.
I mean, that's a good, I like that choice, yeah. That makes me want to see Sonatine with muppets as well. Okay, Japanese crime classic.
Nige actually posted two days later to say my muppet's choice would be Mass Effect 2 because I love the idea of a muppet suicide mission with Beaker dying in the vents, which is actually like a great image. Better than I could do, so well done.
That's good. I feel like Nige planted that question because he knew he had a killer answer waiting in the wings.
Yeah, MGS2 is also a good shout because the different bosses you'd encounter, if you did have human, snake or Raiden, or I don't know, just, there's quite a few. Otacon could be human and Snake could be a muppet and he has to lead him around and guard him. That could be quite good.
And then you just meet the members of Dead Cell and it's like, you know, fortune. And she's got like the electric cannon, but it's a muppet, might be quite good. Okay, next question is from Dynamic Calories.
Dear lads of overwhelming mass, you both put in a shift as editors and thus will have carefully honed an axe with which to chop out certain words and phrases you find annoying or repetitive. Currently, I can't help but see the term buttery smooth popping up in every other review, as if everyone's been paid off by big frame rate slash big dairy. What words or phrases got your goat during your time as editors and have any new bug bears emerged in your time as readers?
Cheers to all the pods and a happy new year to you both. Gosh, if another of these games core entry says, a print the princely sum of, I would like, does anyone know what princely sum is? Does anyone, can anyone explain that?
If you can't explain it, you should be using it, but everyone's heard it, so they keep saying it. When I was an editor, like the, I mentioned this before, but like a long time ago, but the document, the play magazine review template said, do not put like war her, what is it good for us? You're strapline for a war game because it's really hackneyed.
Yeah, I see sort of like, I see quite, I still see quite a few terms that sort of like annoy me, but I don't know, I think like, I think maybe, yeah, what about you Matthew? What comes to mind for you here?
Yeah, I was trying to think back to style guides and what was banned by previous editors. You definitely shouldn't ever say smorgasbord.
Oh yeah, Tony LSA and smorgasbord.
That was one, that was death. I don't know, the thing is, I work with so few writers, actually, like as editor, like I had such a chosen few and staff that didn't really change that they are all pretty good. And I don't think we used people who turned to hackneyed phrases.
I'm probably use more of these phrases than anyone else. I say buttery smooth all the fucking time in video scripts. I'm so lazy when it comes to buttery smooth.
So apologies, dynamic calories.
Yeah, that's pretty much all that springs to mind though. Like, yeah, smorgasbord, I kind of like, I do agree. But there are some that I think like, generally when people are describing frame rates or all that kind of thing, or I think you can just sort of get into the weeds of like, there's only a few terms that people use to describe this one thing.
And therefore you can end up with the same few phrases over and over again.
What was the headphones one?
Oh yeah, sweet cans, that came up on PC Gamer so many times with like, headset reviews, like pair of cans or this, because you don't want to just say headphones over and over again. So cans ends up, like that came up a lot. And it still does because I get it, like if you're reviewing that, if you're reading that stuff, that's fine.
I think generally though hardware reviews are like their own kind of like, minefield of different terms and just like, their own sort of hell of cliches. Someone in our Discord mentioned compelling as one. That's kind of like a meaningless word.
It's like saying the word interesting, I suppose, without explaining what you mean by interesting.
Sometimes things can be compelling though. You're compelled to play onwards.
Yeah, that is true. So yeah.
There's a, yeah, and like you say, like a minefield around hardware, there's like a whole industry of cliches around Star Wars that you have to be really careful with. All your force is strong in this one and all that kind of bollocks. There's certain things where they've got a big pop culture footprint, you are drawn towards using NAF references.
Like every time we mention Indiana Jones on this podcast, I inevitably make a no tickets joke.
Oh yeah, that was last week, wasn't it? That one.
Yeah, like always, I would find a way to cram that into text as well, because I'm that lazy.
Yeah, I sort of like, I don't know, I haven't really seen this in games media, but like, you know, the sort of, like, I feel like Thanos Snap actually, the term Thanos Snap, I see in a lot of writing, like, you know, just like the idea, maybe I see this more on social media, but you know, ever since they Thanos snapped this away, maybe I even hear it on podcasts, but like, I think that's interesting, because this, it's a, it's a, you know, maybe the last monocultural moment, everyone kind of like knows what the Thanos Snap is, right?
Like it was tricky, though, because it shouldn't be used as a shorthand for just vanishing, because it only vanishes away half of everything. Yeah. So I'm going to be like one of those assholes who goes around telling people they're using decimating wrong.
Like, well, actually, it means to reduce by 10. It's like, actually, it means to reduce by half. It doesn't just mean to get rid of it.
But also, it only affects lifeforms as well. So it's not like you can Thanos snap away every copy of like Die Hard Trilogy 2, do you know what I mean? Like, that's not how it works.
Like, it's got to be...
That's an entirely different wish that he makes.
Yeah. It's like you took away slugs. You know what I mean?
Like half of the slugs are gone now. Do you know what I mean? Okay.
We struggled with that one a little bit, but I think we came up with some good answers in the end, Matthew. Yes. Do you want to read this next one from Dominic?
Hi both and happy new year. Which games do you think you are most proficient at? Some games journalists say they don't get the chance to play any one game for long enough to reach a high skill level.
Do you agree? Or are there any games where you're proud of the level of mastery you've achieved? Competitive online games can be very humbling when they rank you against all the world's players, and I know you're not particularly into those, but I'd be interested to hear your self-assessment of single player titles too.
Yeah, that's a bunch of questions combined there, because it's like...
Is there any game... Let's go with what I think is the most interesting bit of this, which is, is there any game you consider yourself to be particularly good at?
Yeah, I'm fucking great at Sekiro. I could pick it up tomorrow, and I could remember all of the... For the main bosses in that game, not all of the sub-bosses, I could remember...
I have the muscle memory to be like, beat, beat, beat, beat for every single parry you do in that game, basically, because it is about a game of memorizing the rhythm of the parries. So, that's a game that I thought... I did New Game Plus twice, that's a pretty good thing to boast about, I guess, in terms of games I've actually finished, so that jumps out.
I think Apex Legends, I got pretty good at, actually, in the pandemic as well. I got my kill-death ratio pretty high. I was really, really good at turning up to a firefight and actually sort of taking apart enemies.
I got out of the headspace of, oh, I'm so frazzled because someone just appeared out of nowhere and started shooting. I actually started to get so used to that situation that I became quite cool-headed and decent at it. So that has happened, but then I will be humbled over and over again by, you'll have one win and you'll get booted up into a league where you're just getting completely fucked up, basically.
So yeah, it's a bit of a mixed bag. What about you, Matthew?
Very few games. I'm definitely much better at Minesweeper than most people are. Well, when I was at university, I could play Minesweeper pretty fast.
Not like if you're a competitive Minesweeper person or going for world records, you're obviously much, much better. But given that it's a game a lot of people like, I don't even know how to play that. I feel like that's the only game where I've played where I've heard someone be audibly impressed by how good I was at it.
Holy shit, you're fast at Minesweeper. So that's basically it. Every other game, I'm as good as I need to be.
I got pretty good at Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 back on GameCube. That's the only game I ever score high enough in high score mode that I could have sent it in to NGCs to have leaderboards that they print in the magazines. And that's the only time I had something which would have got me onto that leaderboard.
So that's something.
Yeah, that's not bad at all. I think the thing is, as well, games are more and more... The intent of them is not necessarily to be challenging, or to be mastered in some way.
If they are, the learning curve can be a bit gentler. I mean, of all the games that we played for the Game of the Year episode, for example, Final Fantasy XVI has a bunch of cheats to get around you, having to engage with the combat like it is playing Bayonetta or something, like moves that basically do loads of damage and no animations can take place while they're happening, things like that. Whereas games like Cobalt Core and Pizza Tower, which were on my list, they do require a higher level of skill.
And I guess what I'm saying is I like having a mix of games that have that high skill ceiling and those that don't. I'm happy to accommodate both in my gaming diet, you know what I mean? It's not about mastery, but it's also not about mastery, you know?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, okay, good. We've probably got time for one more, Matthew, what do you reckon?
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay, so, if you guys had to choose only one food to eat every day for the rest of your lives, what would it be? That's some raspberry brain. Well, I do eat What's It's every day, so it would just have to be What's It's, I'm afraid.
I get through so many fucking bags of that that I got mocked about it when I was at Frontier by my colleagues because it's preposterous, just I'm like, yep, not had my three bags a day yet. The 80 calories a bag, but I've got a problem, I don't know how to tell you really. Matthew, what about you?
When you said, eat what is every day, that Snoop Dogg thing popped into my head.
Very good. Yes.
Well, we've already explained it's going to be those three biscuits that I chose every day forever. Isn't that the deal?
Yes.
Digestive Jaffa Cake Hobnobs.
Fair enough.
I genuinely think I could, like right now, just because I'm like early on in my relationship with it and it hasn't soured. I genuinely think I could eat LJ Hugs Chicken and Rice every day.
LJ Hugs has really jammed itself into your consciousness. It's a big like winter pick for, you know, Matthew Castle, this one.
I would have been able to eat the old JC's Kitchen every day. That Chicken and Bubblin Squeak was just absolutely divine, but you know, he's not interested in doing that anymore.
Yeah. Or indeed being open in bath. So yeah, it's difficult.
Yeah, so LJ Hugs, I've not had the rice. The rice thing, though, what's the deal with that? Is it just like a pile of meat and rice, basically?
Is that what it does?
Yeah, it's just the chicken. It's just the chicken box. You can have it with rice chips or half rice, half chips.
I often have that. I just wanted to say rice so that people thought I was not eating chips every day in this imagined future.
Is that true, though? You're not eating chips every day?
Like, I'm not Mr. Chips.
I'm not the guy from Catchphrase.
Yeah, no, not him, well, I'm not him also, but I'm also not more casually Mr. Chips.
In general, Matthew is not Mr. Chips in a larger sense.
Yeah, like, if there are people who are like, oh, you remember that advert, was it Daddy or Chips?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Got very different connotations these days, that one.
Well, yeah, I definitely picked Daddy. Well, as in, I would rather have my father than chips. I don't love chips so much that, like, there are other foods which would be better for me if you were like, Daddy or LJ Hugs, you know, or like, Daddy or Lasagna.
Stop saying Daddy. I just can't, I can't listen to you saying Daddy anymore.
If there was an advertising campaign that was Father or Lasagna, I might pick my father.
That's always too tame and strange, isn't it? Like, Father or Lasagna. That sounds like a Garfield comic strip, that one.
Father or Lasagna. Or maybe I could eat lasagna every day, actually. You got a bit of, like, actually do the tomatoes give you vitamin C and there's lasagna, probably not after you're fucking put it in the oven for, like, you know, two hours or whatever.
But theoretically, a lasagna, I could probably have a slab of that every day.
I love it. I love a good lasagna.
Yeah, but I could never be bothered to make one. So it would need to be provided for me in order for me to eat it. So, yeah, OK, good.
All right. So next, last question, then. So this last question is from Jess Wecan.
Good morning, giant lads. I'm a longtime listener and a big fan. Hugely thankful for the wonderful media you've exposed me to.
Quick shout out there to the last of Sheila. I think, Matthew, a classic that you've passed on to our listeners. Question, if you found yourselves being hunted by a murderer in a dark stormy and Christie slash Aya Tsuji-esque secluded setting, how would you go about surviving?
So I think it would be fun, Matthew, if as long as one is explaining survival, what would the setting be? Because I think you would think about that as much as the actual survival pyramid.
I don't want to pick apart this question.
Right.
But you don't necessarily get hunted by a murderer in these books. Christie isn't writing like Scream. It's not like there's the first murder and then a bloke's running around offing people.
It's like, if anything, once the murders happened, everyone's a little bit kind of safe. It's sort of a flaw with the structure of these books. The tension instantly goes out and you're just about solving them.
But let's put that aside and say we were being chased around an Aetsuji-esque secluded setting. So that references one of the great Japanese crime writers wrote The Dekken House Murders, where the Dekken House famously was a house in the shape of a Dekken.
So, yeah, the front cover of that is like when my brain like dials up Matthew Castle and there's like some floating images around your name, that the cover of that book is like one of those images.
I say, OK, that's good. I'm glad to be associated with that.
Next to Father or Lasagna now, you know, that's Father, Lasagna, Aetsuji, Dekken House Murders.
So if I was being hunted, how would I go about surviving? I mean, really, like the way to survive a murder mystery novel is to never have given anyone a reason to murder you.
Yeah.
You know, which I know it's a bit of a boring answer, but it's like living a good life, not crossing anyone.
It's OK. It's like a morality lesson, really.
Well, like, there has to be like you only get murdered if there's a motive. Like these books, it's never just someone got murdered just for the hell of it. OK, maybe you can get murdered by a maniac who imagines a slight.
I'm generalizing here, but if I think across, you know, along the kind of course of my life, there's no one who I think, oh, I've been enough of a dick that it would warrant them murdering me, or that if they murdered me, people would be like, oh, that makes sense, you know?
OK, interesting.
Sorry, I realize I didn't really answer the question, but I, you know, hide under a bed.
I think I would sort of like try and create a lot of a lot of slippy surfaces, because I think that, like, the number one thing that frightens me as a man in his mid 30s is a harsh fall. Like, that scares me much more now than the idea of, like, someone shooting me in the head, you know what I mean? Like, it's because it's far more likely to happen and, like, it's just as likely to kill me, honestly, because there's so much of me that I just, me clattering down because of, like, a slippy bit of pavement on, like, a rainy day.
It's like a genuine threat to me, so let's assume that the murderer has, like, a similar build because they're trying to kill me, I'm a large dude. If it was, like, you know, a very small man, I think I could overpower him quite easily, you know, just by the sort of, like, yeah, taking the weapon off of him, kicking him in the shins, holding me at a distance while he, like, tries to windmill me, like, in a cartoon. That would also be good.
So, yeah, so I do a lot of, like, I think a lot of, like, creating oil slicks around the sort of environment, you know?
I think you're confusing the work of Aetsuji with Home Alone.
Yeah, I might be, actually.
I think they've got a very different energy.
Yeah, I think as well, like, I've had to pick a location. There was, like, this, I stayed in this big sort of spooky old house in the Isle of Wight when I was a kid. I sometimes think about how strange it was.
It had, like, kind of, like, more, like, living quarters. Like, it must have been, like, a school trip-focused kind of place, because, like, it had a lot of, like, six bunk beds in a room kind of thing. And I'm, like, I don't know who would go to the Isle of Wight and stay there on purpose, who weren't, like, groups of kids.
And then all these, like, old school kind of, like, kitchen areas that felt like you were in a boarding school or something. I think that would be a good environment for this. So the axe murderer is chasing me around.
I am creating oil slicks and at home alone-esque mayhem. That's my answer to this question, Matthew.
Actually, the concept of, like, a locked room murder where the victim is a boy who has booby-trapped his house so you can't actually get to him, but he is somehow murdered. So like the home alone house, but Kevin McAllister is dead in the heart of it, but all the traps remain untriggered. That's a pretty good set up for a murder mystery.
That's not bad. There you go. There's a bit more meat on the bones to that answer, so that's good.
Matthew, is that it for us? I think it is, isn't it?
Yeah, I think there was, like, I think 20% of that was video game content.
Ha, okay, good. So alright, well…
That's on the question askers, I would say.
Yeah, I think so, another shot at the listers. So yes, basically what we're doing this year is we're having slightly shorter Mailbag episodes and what we've been playing, so the aim of keeping the podcast a tiny bit more sustainable, I think we've mentioned this before, but just mentioning it again here. So we're going to aim for, like, about, around, like, one hour with the Mailbag episodes, so we'll do this each month, so by all means keep supplying us questions.
You can get us at backpagegames.gmail.com if you'd like to email us questions, send us longer questions, that's fine. There's also a Pod Questions channel in the Discord. You can reach the Discord from a link in both our Blue Sky and Twitter accounts at backpagepod.
Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
On Twitter, I am MrBazzill underscore pesto, and on Blue Sky, I'm MrBazzillpesto, no underscore and no content, so don't follow me there.
Gets me every time you're reading that out. I'm Samuel W. Roberts, and we'll be back next week with a new episode.
