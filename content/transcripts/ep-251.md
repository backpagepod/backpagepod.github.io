Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, the evil has been defeated. You have finished another freelance piece set in the background has been driving you. Well, I don't know, I want to hear your perspective on this before I tell the story of private WhatsApp messages.
But you've definitely been slaying a dragon of some kind, right?
Yeah, I've done a big bit of freelance writing. I can't actually say what at the moment, but quite a substantial piece, small than your typical review or whatever. Whenever I get these things, I always panic a bit and freak out that I've completely forgotten how to write or that I should never have been writing in the first place.
That combined with just a hell of a month. Like I've been having my back garden redone, we had this gas leak and that became a whole thing. Got what we're pretty sure was COVID, attended two film festivals, and somewhere in the middle of that, yeah, I've been just trying to find headspace to write something that I wanted to be really good because it isn't just a sort of throwaway bit of writing that's going to be churned away on the internet and never seen again.
But we shall see if I have successfully landed it.
Yeah, I look forward to seeing it come out the other side, knowing privately what it is. And yeah, you have had a tough month, actually. I've tried to bombard you with less podcast admin than normal because I've just sensed that underlieing tension of like he's just like one bad day away from becoming a Batman villain, basically.
So that's... I've had that in the back of my mind. At the same time, you know, the time we've been making the podcast, I've seen you go through this arc so many times in the piece of writing.
You know, most recently, the Donkey Kong Bonanza review with Guardian, which you absolutely landed the plane on. So, you know, it's just part of the course at this point. And it happens every six months like clockwork, basically.
It does. It's because I only really do four or five bits of writing a year these days. And there's enough time between them for me to think, oh, I've completely forgotten how to do this and just have a total meltdown every time.
Every single time I say to you, oh, I'm thinking of taking this piece of work on, or, you know, I'm actively looking to review this. And you always say, well, you know, you're going to come back and say you're having a nightmare and that you hate it and that you wish you'd never done it. But, you know, I wish you well.
And, lo and behold, that's what happens every single time.
No, I get the pride of doing it, though. I got offered, about a few months ago, this has not actually, like, become a thing yet, but I got offered an essay for a version of a game, a game I like. And, you know, I don't know exactly what happened to that, but it was in the middle of me doing, like, three other things.
And I was like, I've got to do that. That's really cool. And I didn't regret doing it.
And you were the person I got to pre-read that piece of writing, actually.
Yeah, it was great.
Oh, thank you. I did get it. The idea of, like, you know, it's always the case with anything related to, you know, anything that's not an online piece of writing, I guess, anything that might go in print, is that you want to see it at the very end of the process when it's in your hands, because you know that that particular flash of pride is unlike anything else.
But it's just that your brain blocks out all of the traumatic bits that leads to the moment where it's finished. So yeah, you can romanticise it in your head, I think, and then you get back into it and you're like, oh no, I remember now, I remember the horrors, you know.
Absolutely, it's funny, because I spend my whole time mourning the fact that I'm not a full-time writer anymore, and that I have to have a day job and do other kinds of writing for that. Yeah, actually, the reality of writing full-time, I think it would end me, you know, based on the couple of pieces. I may be doing it full-time again, would actually, you know, I'd just be using those muscles more, and it would all become much easier, you'd hope.
But yeah, at the moment, it's, be careful what you wish for time every couple of months.
It's a young man's game these days, Matthew.
It is a young man's game. Well, I do read a lot of stuff by other younger writers. I'm always sort of terrified by what is coming up, you know, because I just, I feel so sort of old and backwards compared to a lot of that stuff.
So yeah, it is a thing, but I should probably go to therapy about that rather than use it in podcast intros.
Well, just because you haven't put Gooning in a headline, like maybe one of the writers on PC Gamer has, so it doesn't mean that you're out of touch, you know? It's sort of...
That isn't quite what I'm talking about. It's not so much that. It's just occasionally you read something and you're like, oh, that's so spot on or that's so brilliantly observed or just like, oh, there's a real wisdom in that.
And then the person's like 24 and you're like, fuck, I was just doing like stupid jokes about Mario when I was 24 until I was like 35. If I never had that sophistication and I don't know if I can get there at 40.
Yeah, but those people who liked you making those jokes about Mario, they're all listening to this podcast right now.
Well, there is that. So yeah, I'm amongst friends.
Well, there you go. They're supporting this. Yeah, exactly.
They're supporting this era of your career. Yeah, it's funny, because you mentioned, I don't know if this was linked to the type of piece you were alluding to, but you mentioned the Endless Mode, formerly Pace video game coverage, was a site that you're enjoying these days. And there was a Ball X Pit piece that was quite withering about the game.
That got our Discord talking the other day we were recording this. And I thought it was a really good piece by Garrett Martin. And you said that website was good, that it's been on your radar lately.
Is that right?
Yeah, because it's the video game part of Pace, right? It has sort of spun off into endless mode. Isn't that what's happened?
I think so, yeah.
And it's quite old school, but they seem to do a lot of reviews, which quite a few sites don't do anymore, and a lot of good feature writing around those games. You know, they're talking about the game several weeks after they've come out, and they've actually had a chance to sort of marinate in them a little bit and have some quite good takes. And to my eyes, it's like a feature and review site, which are the things that I like reading.
You know, there's not a lot of news, there's not a lot of like the SEO stuff a lot of people have to do to survive these days and you know, I don't know how they're doing it, but the writing there is very fine, I think. And yeah, I just really, really enjoy it. Also they score games out of 100, which I fucking love.
That's just, that's class, you know?
Yeah.
Like to be able to say that a game is like an 8.7 and not an 8.6, I got a huge amount of time for that.
Okay. Well, so this episode, it turned out there was another day in October, another Friday in October, and I just didn't plan for that, which was a blunder, frankly. I think I just thought there were 30 days in October, Matthew.
They were not. They were actually 31.
I would say Halloween is one of the famous dates.
You know what? I will own up that this is entirely on me. This is like a Samuel Roberts blunder.
So I thought I would wedge in an additional what we've been playing episode and throw in some mailbag questions as well. So that's what this episode is. But it has had a slight destabilizing effect on the schedule for November, which I will now read out Matthew because that is being revealed on the day that this episode is going live.
So it might be informative for people to know what's coming up. So what we've done is we've actually turned the Mario Galaxy XL episode we were doing into two episodes. So we got a regular episode next Friday, November 7th, two giant men play Super Mario Galaxy, and then the XL episode will be two giant men play Super Mario Galaxy 2 on November 10th.
So if you want to support us on Patreon, you get the second half of that discussion, but I'm sure the first episode will be very self-contained at the same time. So yes. Then on November 14th, we have former Polygon editor Matt Leone, who's going to come on and talk about his new site, Design Room, which is all about oral histories of different video games.
His first oral history is about, for me, for me to await is Shadow of the Colossus and has an interview with Awada and a bunch of different people who are kind of orbiting the development of that game. Looking forward to speaking to Matt, you know, a rare American on The Back Page. Doesn't happen very often, but yes, it's not not on purpose.
But you know, that's for whatever reason, that does seem to be the case. Then we got the 16-bit games mega-draft with Dave Scarborough and Ashley Day November 21st. Looking forward to that and litigating which Sonic game is the one that Matthew will politely tolerate.
We'll see, if any, to be honest.
Ash pick 10 Amiga games.
And Dave picking Ghostbusters and automatically removing himself from the running, because it's like a fucking four out of ten piece of shit from years ago. Yes, we'll see. I'm hoping that the two of them will compete a bit harder and go for the jugular little bit with Matthew.
And we'll bring back the old kill and steal rules as well from last time. So looking forward to that, Matthew. And then the other Patreon episode we're doing, it's actually the five year anniversary of the podcast next month.
And I do wonder if we... I go overboard with these anniversaries, Matthew, because we do episode 100 and 200, and now the fifth anniversary. Maybe it's too many, but this is what magazines do to you, isn't it?
Everything gets turned into a fucking themed issue, you know?
If there's an event issue, you'll always do one.
Exactly, yes. So for the second Patreon pod next month, we're doing 50 fundamental truths about games journalism. This is inspired by a recent Blue Sky thread of people saying, what's something that only people in your job would understand, what that thing means?
And I've kind of derived it from that. There may not even be 50, we'll see. Some of them will definitely be daft.
So be prepared for that. And the final episode of the month is, I mean, this is where the podcast eats itself, the five year anniversary pod, The Back Page episode of The Back Page, an episode all about the back pages of magazines featuring returning guest, Phil Savage from PC Gamer, November 28th. So that's quite a packed month, Matthew.
And yeah, should be a good little November. I think I've correctly counted the days in November there. So good, we'll see how that goes.
But this episode, Matthew, what we've been playing, and it's a little bit lighter than one of these episodes might normally be, where we end up playing 100 hours of games each somehow for a two hour podcast. And that just keeps happening for whatever reason. A bit lighter this week.
So first up, we have the game Dispatch, which is a superhero workplace comedy with a lot of choices in the somewhat telltale style sense of picking a certain dialogue option, characters remember certain things. But it's not actually that similar in style to a telltale game. It's even more automated, a storytelling experience than that.
You manage a dysfunctional team of misfit heroes and strategize who to send to emergencies around the city. And it's very much a post invincible superhero story, I would say. It's pretty vulgar.
It's definitely adult. It just definitely feels like the people making this re-got into that kind of like a sort of non-Marvel, non-DC superhero space. And I think that does set it apart a bit tonally.
And if you were worried this is going to be a telltale sort of like retread, it's got really, really nice animations. It could easily be an animated series, really, in terms of how good the visuals look. But I was curious what you made of it, Matthew, because I think this is closer to a visual novel than what even Telltale's games were.
What do you think?
Very much an interactive movie, even more so than Telltale. I think there's so few dialogue choices or action choices that you do find yourself just occasionally sitting back and just watching it play out for five minutes. The fact that it doesn't have subtitles on by default, I think you're just meant to watch it like you would a cartoon and there are bits where I'm like is this a video game engine?
Is this happening in engine? These scenes have they been animated or is it actually just clips of an animated show that they've made? I can't really tell because the only compliment to the animation I guess is it looks good enough to be on TV.
I mean I think it's invincible I'm thinking of but that's got quite a rudimentary animation style right?
I think so yeah it's certainly not not handsome by you know compared to something like the Batman animated series for example.
I think this is better looking than that invincible series. I think that's probably true actually yeah right yeah it almost hasn't bits of it have almost like a like a rotoscoped vibe to them like the human performances like the little movements are quite nuanced but obviously it's got this animated sort of veneer over it. When you are reliant on just sitting back and watching the story I guess like this lives or dies by being an entertaining story and having good jokes and having interesting characters which it does I've played through three episodes of this I had a pretty good time like I went in not necessarily on its side because I thought oh is this gonna be like another one of these like knowing superhero things like Invincible or The Boys.
Actually I think it has got its own kind of humour and there's like a sweetness to it. I think it's got some absolutely amazing voice performances which really kind of pull you through and carry it. The main character is played by Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad Fame and he's got this believably tired, exhausted persona of someone who's sort of not a superhero but has had a bit of a superhero life due to a piece of technology they have and is now sort of facing up to not having that piece of technology and just being a regular person again.
It's just interesting seeing him interact with these superhero. Feels less cynical than something like The Boys I think.
Yeah, I think so. I think that I was worried about that as well because it's not just a self-referential superhero thing or commentary on superhero thing. It's more superheroes in general.
In any shape or form. I think you have to work quite hard to make them seem fresh these days. And I've only played one episode of this.
I've got a long, much longer to go with it. I think four out of the time we're talking about it. And then I think, are they releasing two a week?
Is that how they're doing it, Matthew?
Yeah, that's it. They're only about an hour each or something.
Yeah, they're very snackable. And I would say it's notable how successful this game has been. It's been top of the Steam charts, like around that top five.
Those spots for the entire time it's been out. I think it's really taken off, which is good because I felt like with every Telltale game, it was complete diminishing returns, wasn't it? It was just people just seemed to get quite tired of them.
But it helps that this is a little bit different. I will say, not terribly impressed by the actual game part of it, like when you have to do little minigames and stuff. That's where it seems a little bit weak from what I've played.
What do you make of that?
I'd agree with that because you play this superhero dispatcher sending heroes out to deal with problems and those sections, it's like a little kind of resource management game where you have these eight heroes who will have specific skills. You get given emergencies, you're told the rough shape of them and from that you have to deduce, oh, I need a strong superhero or a charismatic superhero. There's almost a world where this is a little bit like a promised mascot agency in terms of matching the right superhero to the thing that they have to go and do and then they kind of often go wrong.
This is all done through a kind of interactive map screen and bits of text. You're not actually seeing them going out and fighting crime. But as you're sending them out and completing jobs, you're also leveling them up and improving their stats, which I guess you'll kind of carry through the episodes, but maybe by the end you'll have a sense more ownership over this.
Certainly in the three episodes I've played, I'd say it's like 70% cutscene to like 30% that minigame. It really is just fine. It's not particularly difficult.
I was worried I was just going to be shit at it because it's a strategy game, sort of, but I can scrape through. It throws in some wrinkles. Like sometimes there'll be like some narrative stuff going on in the episode, which will like impact it mechanically.
Like certain characters will start misbehaving because you're having a bad time with them in the story and things like that. So there's like a little bit of kind of interesting narrative design happening there. Not stellar but also inoffensive and certainly not a hurdle.
Like you can just play it and do it.
Yeah I think this game really, even better than Telltale Games, just because of how short the episodes are, emulates that a weekly TV show feel like incredibly well. I mean I think the first reaction of anyone learning that oh yeah we're going to roll out new episodes every week was probably to be a groan, because I think we all kind of got a bit sick of that model when Telltale were doing it originally. But they're just, it's so, it feels so calibrated for the attention span of a modern player.
Like it feels bang up to date in that respect. And so it's hard to hold that against it. I think I can see the reason they've done that.
Is it six episode total they're doing Matthew? I think it's something like that. Eight.
Oh, there you go. So, you know, it's a 25 quid game. You'll get about eight hours of game out of your time there.
But I think that's pretty much a perfect marriage of price and length, to be honest. I'm definitely going to play through the rest of them. So yeah, pretty impressive.
It's good. I wondered if the... Because at the start it sort of says, oh, it's in association with Critical Role.
I don't really know what that relationship is other than a lot of the Critical Role cast members turn up in this, or voices that you'll be familiar with. Are we attributing its success to that? Like, is it just part of that monstrously successful thing that they've got going on that all their super fans have signed up for this?
Do we think?
Yeah, I wonder if this is like the sort of inverse of Date Everything, where it's like, you know, this is the other big voice actors get behind the game kind of thing, where maybe the association just brings it loads of attention that otherwise wouldn't get. Maybe that's part of the reason it's got 8,000 Steam reviews already and it's been out for just over a week or whatever. I do wonder if the sort of band of misfits played by loads of different actors is the critical role aspect there, because there's a slight sort of like, the whole thing is like D&D adventures, right?
And richly drawn universes and characters. So it would, it kind of makes sense. There's a, I think there's a bit of a easy comparison there you can make with a superhero team.
So I assume that is the, without actually reading what the real reason is, that's what I assume it is based on what I detect from the game itself, you know?
There's an element of like improvised comedy too. I need to, it's all scripted, I'm sure. But the number of variations you can get in the minigame segment particularly, because you're sending out different heroes to different situations, sometimes you pair them up and the heroes will kind of like chatter to each other.
So there are so many variables of the different teams you can come out and you can almost imagine them having got all these quite funny people to play these eight heroes and just said, you know, imagine the two of you are going to a dogpam that's on fire, what would you say in two lines and they can just sort of like come up with something funny like they would in their kind of tabletop sessions or whatever. I'd be curious to know how they did do it because employing that particular talent, you know, that is like a superpower of theirs and you know, pardon the pun, and you think you could put that to good use here.
How do you feel about the presence of adult content in it? Because pretty early on in this game you will see a dick and you actually get asked earlier on if you want to even see nudity, nudity in the game or like to censor that side of it. But I wondered what your first response was to encountering that stuff in the game.
I mean, not the dick specifically, I just mean the adult content.
I didn't get the feeling when you saw that. It's a therapy.
It's a pillion all over again, Matthew.
Yeah, I must admit, it was... The fact that it had that warning at the start, and I thought, oh, okay, this is going to just be like mega sort of edgelordy, like the boys just from the start. And actually it isn't.
I think that seeing that probably is the first moment in the game where you're like, oh, this is actually going to like there's something else going on here tone wise. The fact that you can censor it out, I think proves that it's not like integral to it. You know, it's probably just there to make people laugh, probably try and get people to write about it, to talk about it on podcasts like we are right now.
We've fallen right into their trap. We saw a green glowing guy's penis and here we are giving it at least two minutes of podcast.
Yeah, it does feel like streamers will react to this game. Do you know what I mean? It feels like that sort of experience.
Yeah, there is something like a little bit deliberately outrageous about it. But the jokes that have landed, they're just good joke craft like you would get in a sitcom. You're like, yeah, that's a good set up.
That's a good line delivery. I tell you, he's really good value for money. It doesn't come into episode two is...
Geoffrey Wright?
He's great. Like a really good character, a really good voice performance just fits right in and everything he says is just great. It really, really works for me.
So I picked this up this morning thinking, no, no chance this is going to be good. And quite happily spent a morning playing through three episodes and was like, yes, that's pretty great.
Oh, nice. I'm glad you had that response to it because I was pleasantly surprised by it too. And it's sort of like, it's actually really good counter programming for all the big blockbuster things that are going on right now.
It's actually like a bit of an easier choice versus a lot of those games. So yeah, before the next 50 hour RPG begins, this is like, this will do the trick. Thank you very much.
So yes. Okay, Matthew. So next up, what do you want to chat about next?
Absolum or The Séance of Blake Manor? Your choice.
Let's do a bit of Absolum.
Okay. So I started playing this game after you recommended it. You said that you and Katherine had played through this in Co-op and had a really good time.
And it is a hack and slash, it's actually more in the 90s arcade beat-em-up mold, actually, in hack and slash. But it's structured as a rogue-like, it's from the developers of Streets of Rage 4, I believe, which is a well-regarded modern version of one of these games. And Hot on the Heels of Shinobi, Art of Vengeance, a game I enjoyed.
Another strong 90s riff with a big emphasis on intricate combat system. And you have four different characters to choose from, at least where I am, there are four different characters, Matthew. And yes, one is like a frog man, one is like a sword lady, one is a dwarf from Northern Ireland, I believe.
Just a Belfast kind of accent I'm getting, I'm getting a vibe from there. I may be wrong. And the other character is like a sort of ninja lady.
Is that right? Sort of. Yeah, she's slightly mechanical.
Yeah, she sort of like uses this grappling hook to attach to enemies and then chucks little knives at them and such. And yeah, they're all quite distinctive in how they control. But they have like some continuous progression aspects too.
So you can flip between the different characters as you're trying to make your way across this map bit by bit. Matthew did talk about this game a couple of weeks ago. And I'm very impressed by it.
It's, yeah, it's, I'm at the point though, where I've been playing it for 10 hours. And I think there's probably another 10 hours to go till I finish it with each character, which is I see what you need to do to beat it. And in that sort of like head space where I'm like, I think I understand how every part of this game's combat works as well as I'm going to.
But I'm waiting for the game to sort of roll the dice and say, here's the stuff you need to build a really, to create a really sick build and break the game a little bit. And I do find that roguelike games have this kind of moment in them normally, where it's like a sort of waiting zone between the beginning and end, where you're waiting for the game to allow you to progress, but you don't necessarily feel like you're getting any better at it at a certain point. I don't know if you actually got to that point with this game, but that's where I'm at now.
I just unlocked, there are like two different islands you can go to after you complete the first area, and I just unlocked the second island, Matthew, the misty secret island in the north. I've made some progress, but I don't feel like I'm anywhere near the end just yet. But I was wondering how you found the progression of this game, because I do think it's smart, like the initial hours are peeling back the layers of what you can do, and then it feels like it turns into a game of, like I say, get the right build.
When you get to a point where you can add an ability, choose the right ability, choose the right ability that complements that ability, and hoping that it falls in your favour to get the things you need to create that build. Is that the experience you had as well?
Yeah, kinda. I guess, I think something it does do really well is it plants new schools of magic along the way, right up until just before the end of the game, and each of those introduces new spells and powers and abilities that can go into that randomised pool that you're pulling from on each run. Just the arrival of those can refresh the game enough that you aren't necessarily thinking, oh I need this.
I think the schools of magic actually get a bit more powerful as they go on, so just having them there, you start feeling naturally powerful. There's also permanent upgrades that you're buying, and I think there just comes a point where it tips the scales in your favour with those. At least for the initial run, which is getting to the end and fighting the bad guy at the top of this big tower, I think there's a point where it's willing you on.
I didn't feel like we ever had to rely on incredibly lucky pools. Along the way, you have these campfires where you can restock your health. But as you go on, and I don't know if this has happened for you yet, you can buy other things that can happen at those campfires.
Instead of a health regen, you can get a trinket or a boon or some kind of passive. And we found it was actually those that absolutely flipped it in our favour. I think the first run we had once we unlocked those was the run that took us to the end, because all of a sudden, on top of the powers we were getting, we just had this extra layer of mystical trinkets which were amplifying all those moves and we just went absolutely tore through it.
What I do think happens in this game is I think there's a point, whether it's a specific geographic point on the map or maybe just in the general kind of like looping structure where skill can only get you so far, it's just throwing so much at you that the nuts and bolts mastery of the combat, unless you were like an incredibly gifted person and player, I think you just need some quite spectacular moves to start clearing the screen because there's loads of enemies, it just comes quite hard to read. Part of the thrill of it is there is so much stuff there and when all the big moves are kicking off and like tens of goblins are getting paffed out the window, that stuff is absolutely brilliant. We just kept taking little video clips on the PS5 because we were like, I can't believe it just got as hectic as that.
But I have seen it said and definitely felt in places like, well if I got into this room with this many enemies and I didn't have these powers, I don't think I'm good enough at blocking, evading and parrying to get through this. Yes, certainly the end boss, that felt a bit more rogue like than beat them up in terms of the tipping of the scales. But I do think that compared to a lot of other games in this genre, I mean, I guess like Hades is the obvious, like easiest comparison.
I do think getting your head around the combat system and mastering the basics can actually get you pretty far and can tip the runs in your favor, like maybe earlier on in the game, which I do like.
That's true. I think that it's generally speaking, it threads the balance quite well for a genre that you might not necessarily think is the best fit for a roguelike. Just in terms of, I think of these as very, well, actually, it's a genre I actually associate as being a bit of a like arcade quarter kind of racket genre really, because you play games like the X-Men, Konami game or The Simpsons arcade game, and the difficulty on those games gets absolutely out of control, and to see it through to completion, it's always about just putting in more and more money and chucking yourself at it.
This isn't that kind of game. You do feel like you're making gentle progress, and even when you're not necessarily making forward progress, you can make sideways progress and unlock secret areas that you didn't know existed before, or passageways that become open and available, which is a really nice touch. So it sort of mitigates the repetition of it a little bit, or the potential repetition of it.
Yeah, I'm really enjoying it. I hit a tiny bit of a kind of like, I could do with this moving forward a little bit faster than it is, and I'll go back to it. But I actually think that part of this is tied to the fact that I've just played Ball X Pit through to completion, which is another game that's about chucking yourself at the same levels over and over again until you kind of progress.
So it might be that I just needed a little break in pace from that kind of experience, and playing two back to back just highlights the different foibles of games that are built on that leaping structure. So yeah, that might be Matthew. Something else I said on social media, if you agree with this, this feels like a game that is pitching its own Netflix animated series to you while it's going.
It's got not one, but two muscle mommy characters, and those are so hot right now. In general, it feels like it's going for a bit of a Avatar The Last Airbender, sort of like there's all these different factions and they have this pre-existing history and they were coexisting peacefully, but now things have gone a bit wrong. It just feels very well thought out as a world and the characters and all that stuff, right?
Yeah. I think the way that on those repeat trips, if you take different characters through, you might learn different information about the environment. There's different little battle cries.
In just a couple of lines, I think they establish a huge amount of law without this being a game where you ever have to go and read a document. It's very sly narrative layering. Very well judged for co-op play particularly, because when there are two people, they're probably gabbing away on the sofa.
They're not really going to listen to it. But I still think me and Catherine picked up the general gist of it.
Yeah, I played with a stranger online actually, because I had this theory that the game was chucking more of the jewels currency at me when I was playing online. I don't actually know if that's true or not. But when I played it with Wes on PCG, I felt like we were making so much progress as a pair.
I was like, maybe I'm missing out by not doing a little bit more of this in co-op. That was quite fun because I think they'd clearly finished it. I think they were trying to work out if I knew what I was doing.
So I'd occasionally just stop and watch what I was doing to see if I'd steal both the items that come out of the end of a level or whatever. Or they'd leave a certain item because they think that was the item for me or whatever. Then yes, it was just funny watching.
Just roast chickens for days. They're like, this guy is a roast chicken guy. I'll just let him have all of those.
The really confusing thing is that I met the lady with the grappling hook. I met her canonically as part of the story while Wes was playing her in our co-op game. She was like, oh, I've never met you before.
It's like she was literally on screen elsewhere helping me fight all these hordes of monsters.
Instant 5 out of 10.
The game is definitely doing what it can to bridge that gap for sure. To keep the narrative elements, but to also support it being a pretty slick co-op game. It does that well.
But yeah, that particular example did just make me laugh. Okay, so Matthew, let's move on to The Séance of Blake Manor. Yet another game that Matthew Castle has made happen in the culture.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
No, but you were a tiny bit ahead of the curve on this. You played all those shite detective games during Steam Next Fest and found one good one. And you were like, this is the one.
You anointed it. And here we are, got five stars on The Guardian. And I think now people and critics are paying a bit of attention to it.
So, you know, give you a little bit of credit, pal. But do you want to take it from there?
Yeah, I mean, if I discovered it, it was only five days before it was due to come out. But yeah, I got onto the PR after playing the demo straight away and was like, you know, I just have to play more of this game. If you didn't listen to our Steam Next Fest episode, where I talked about the opening couple of hours of this, it's a detective game set in 1897, I think.
Halloween weekend, that's October the 31st, Samuel. In Connemara, Western Ireland, you go to this place called Blake Manor, you're a detective called Declan Ward, and you've been invited there by someone to search for a missing guest called Evelyn Deane. What's going on at the hotel is on the 31st, they're planning on having a huge séance.
They've got this world famous spirit medium. And as a result, the hotel has attracted other believers, it's attracted sceptics who are there to sort of disapprove it. There are locals, there's a like a manor house attached to the hotel.
So there's, you know, the family from that. There's loads of people, you know, 20 to 30 people are in this house. Your job is just to go in there.
And before you get to this séance on Sunday evening is to work out what happened to this disappeared woman. It's a detective game in that you play a detective and you're investigating crimes. What's interesting about this and what didn't really emerge until playing the full game is I don't think it's necessarily a detective game in the sense of Obra Dinn or Golden Idol where you're doing a lot of deduction by bringing together information.
There are some deductions, you know, there's bits where you learn a code and then you realise oh I need to put it in here to open this particular safe or using some like environmental cues to follow a particular route or something, but a lot of the game is more about just sort of submerging yourself in the mystery. Going around this hotel and collecting hundreds if not thousands of clues and bits of evidence and then talking to people about them. And as you learn the connections there's nothing to like test you, which is what happens in Obeddin and Golden Idol.
That's a game about testing your ability to make the connections. Here the connections are kind of made for you by the interface, so you end up with this big sort of neural network of clues that is kind of filled in without with, you know, just by finding them. You know, it'll be like there was a bloody handkerchief and this person was coughing up blood.
So my brain has connected that this handkerchief belonged to that person. So you're never really sitting there stumped. You're more just trying to sort of push the investigation in the right direction.
You know, I wouldn't even call it a deduction game at all, really. I'd say it's a giant piece of interactive detective fiction, which is thrilling in itself. Like there's something about being in that particular location with this many people, with this many mysteries, that it's just exciting to wade in that and find out what happens.
I just don't think you necessarily do much of the heavy lifting yourself. It's quite handholdy, it's quite accessible as a result.
That makes sense, and actually sounds more enticing to me than playing another Obra Dinn.
Right.
Where it felt like it was made by a man who's perhaps got like an unreal sense of recall of what like one sailor dude's face looks like. And, you know, he's maybe he's just expecting the players to have the same kind of like level of information retention that he does. And that's why I don't think I quite got on with it.
The idea of the game drawing links for you sounds quite enticing. Can I like as a complete crime fiction amateur, Matthew, can I ask with the number of characters and the sort of name of the character and the way that the story unfolds, is there a bit of a Seven Lives of Evelyn Hardcastle element to this of like the overall tapestry being drawn? Because you know, you had Stu Turton on the podcast.
There is an unusually gamey aspect to that book in that there's just fucking loads of things going on. And yeah, it's like, it's just, it's giving you more and more information to try and draw your own conclusions.
I guess that's something you'd have to put to the team themselves. It's funny, I actually messaged Stu about this saying, oh, you've got to try this. You know, weirdly it actually focuses on a character called Evelyn as well.
So it's right up your street. I think in that book, you know, Stu himself was was trying to riff and do something with the classic country manor murder mystery, like in the Agatha Christie mold.
Yeah.
Both the book and this game are like working from the same inspiration. Like there is just something very enticing about a massive building full of loads of quite suspicious people.
Yeah.
The job they've done and it is pretty amazing. If not for its actual like deductive systems, for the actual like shape of the story and keeping you guessing a lot about a lot of people. You know, every character has their own mystery attached to them that you have to solve.
Early on, it suggests you'll sort of see, oh, okay, every person I help in some way, that will feed into the larger story. Then above that, you have the central mystery of this, this missing lady and that sort of broken down into sort of subtasks which kind of unfold as the story go on. They're really the backbone.
I can see a version where like, if you just absolutely shit at this game, you'd probably just follow that backbone and get to the end. And I imagine it's designed that it's pretty hard to get to the end without getting an answer. But if you want to go in there and work out everything, you know, you've got your work cut out for you because you've got to investigate every single room.
Like, every person has their own room in this hotel, so it's about like, can I get into their room somehow to start investigating them? And then it's about asking the right people are at the right pieces of evidence, because the big system this has that those other detective games don't is it's governed by time, and every action you do in the hotel costs one minute of in-game time. Obviously, you arrive on Friday evening, you have the Séance on Sunday evening, there's some sleeping time as well, so that removes some hours, but you have a finite amount of time to actually kind of collect this information and make all those connections.
If you want to spend a whole hour talking to one person and asking them 60 questions about every piece of evidence and every other guest in the hotel, you can do that, but you may only get like five or six actually useful pieces of information out of that. That is the challenge of the game. If there is a detective part, it's working out how not to waste time.
If someone raises a piece of information about a particular piece of Irish folklore, and you've already clocked a character who's an expert in that, you go, well, I'll talk to them about that, and lo and behold, they will probably be the person who can cast some light on it. That time thing, which I think has maybe scared some people off, or I've seen some people go, I don't really know if that's quite my cup of tea. You'd really have to burn time to not make headway in this game.
You would have to ask thousands of stupid questions, which I just don't think people will do. I think people will lock in to what the game's asking them. Navigating this huge network and just being surprised where it takes you.
That is the pleasure of this game. There's some people I thought, I've got them bang to write so I know exactly what this person's deal is. And then I'd go into someone else's room and find a piece of evidence.
And all of a sudden it would flip that whole character on their head. The writing structurally is really well done for you to not be able to get ahead of it too much. If it was a book, I'd be so impressed by how they juggle all those plot lines.
It's just brilliantly written. And that isn't something that's necessarily true. You know, like writing isn't what sells Obradyn or Golden Idol, you know?
No. This is a piece of very complicated interactive mystery fiction. And I think that's what's so cool about it.
That's interesting. I think it's like a good move in the sense that, you know, when playing the Dark Side Detective games, the writing really was the reason to play it and not the the trad, you know, sort of like point and click adventure bits. I like the idea that they've gone with a bolder game type, but the writing is still the highlight of the experience to some extent.
That and the voice acting, I mean, just the the fact that you're in like a, you know, a fully 3D environment that you can walk around, and it has this sort of great autumnal atmosphere. It's a building with all these interesting sound effects, you know, the fireplace is crackling, the kind of squeak of floorboards, doors closing. Even when you're outside, the gravel and the kind of eerie still of like an autumn sky, like it's like a perfect like autumn winter game.
I've been playing it in the evenings, you know, it's been getting darker quicker, hunkered down in this cold little world. It so captures that flavor of mystery. I said this on Blue Sky and actually one of the people involved in the game responded to it.
I said it actually reminded me of Hotel Dusk. Like Hotel Dusk is more mood piece than it is detective game. It's about getting to know a place intimately and all the characters inside it.
A major set piece in Hotel Dusk and in this is just getting to go into a room you could never go into before. Like what the hell is in there? What the hell happened in these 21 bedrooms?
And every time you do make a bit of progress or you suddenly get like the skeleton key that opens a certain wing of the house, your brain just lights up. You're like, oh shit, this is it. This is it.
We're going to find all these missing puzzle pieces. He did say Hotel Dusk was a bit of inspiration. I think maybe more on the art side, but they are clearly incredibly well read in everything that's happened in the detective space and have come up with probably one of the better stories in a detective game and certainly a brilliant mood piece, if not maybe a sort of men's level detective activity.
Well, some of us are simply not of men's level Matthew. So that's fine by me, brother. Yeah, I kind of prefer that approach, honestly.
I do wonder if not being on consoles has maybe hurt them a little bit, because only on Steam, right?
You'd think it's got to come there eventually, because it's got really nice controls for console controllers. I've been playing it on a DualSense and that stuff feels really thought out. There's absolutely no reason this wouldn't bang.
I imagine it's been a bit of a pig to test, because you can go in so many different directions. So many things can happen in any order. The early version of it, pre-release, was a little bit buggy.
I mean, since the release patch, I've not had any problems with it. You could just get the game to wig out by finding something a little bit quicker than maybe it wanted you to. And how do you test every route through a game where you can literally interact with 400 items at any time?
It's kind of wild. It's a modest sized team, I'm led to believe. Yeah, I just loved it.
I can't believe I wasn't more aware of this in advance. I'd seen it. I'd seen tweets about it.
And I'd seen it pop up on Steam even. But I don't know if it was like the name or the art. I just never clicked on it and looked into it.
I had no idea that this is what it is. Like I thought it was going to be a horror game or I actually think originally I thought it was a board game adaptation. So I was like, that's obviously not for me.
So I'm not particularly interested in that. But yeah, it isn't that. It's actually brilliant.
It's one of my games of the year. Easy.
Well, I'll definitely play this and we can talk about it again before the end of the year, because that'd be good, especially if they've made it Dunderhead-friendly. Yeah. Certainly what I need after the week off that went wrong with Obradin.
That was not ideal for your boy. Okay. Great stuff, Matthew.
We said we say the game names more, didn't we? That was The Séance of Blake Manor.
Blake Manor.
Yeah. And the game before that was Absolum. The game before that was Dispatch.
There you go. Dispatch was the superhero one that had a wheelie in it. And now we move on to Ninja Gaiden 4, Matthew, which I played for a couple of hours.
And it's interesting because it's Platinum taking over someone else's hack-and-slash, you know, adjacent, sort of like a similar type of game, but made by a totally different developer, which is an interesting mix because, you know, it's now been a few years since there's even been a Platinum game, right? Bayonetta 3 was the last one. What was that?
2022? Something like that. So it's been a few years.
And obviously there's been some reported behind the scenes. I mean, we know that, you know, some team members have exited including Hideki Kamiya, you know, and he is one of the people who created the combat, this kind of combat system really, that, you know, sort of became a big deal with Devil May Cry, but then Ninja Gaiden was kind of a parallel track sort of of this kind of combat system with a little bit of stealth as well. I'm going to be completely honest with you, Ninja Gaiden is a bit of a blind spot for me.
I did play Ninja Gaiden Black a couple of years ago, a little bit actually, I'm backwards compatible on Xbox, just to sort of like get familiar with it. It did seem super cool and it feels like a series I know I would love if I go back and play it properly. So, thought I'd jump into this one because you're not even playing as the main character from those games that Ryu Hayabusa, is that right Matthew?
I think that's right. And so they got a totally different sort of main character in this game and it really does feel like a platinum game through and through. Except that maybe they've layered the platinum combat style, that style of combat system on top of what Ninja Gaiden already was.
And it means there's like quite a lot going on in this combat system. But I will say on a core level, there's sort of that responsiveness and the just like joy of seeing these animations play out where dudes get turned into like, you know, a load of like spraying blood basically, and like limbs fly off and all this stuff. It's so, so gratifying.
And when you realize when you've not had it in your hands for a while, that 3D hack and slash thing that platinum was so well known for, like it still feels magic in the hands when they do it properly. I think they have done it properly here. I think it's, you know, it's got a very, very high skill ceiling.
There are like quite a lot of finger gymnastics involved with some of the combos in this game, to the point where I was like, am I too old to play this now? Do I no longer have the muscle memory to do this kind of thing? And the truth is, you can kind of just about make your way through it even without that.
But I'm pretty impressed by it. It's got the old classic platinum games. The budget for the environments was 40 quid.
That's still in there.
But they also run like butter.
Well, that's it. It's very well optimized. So I'm enjoying it so far.
The story, I can't say what's going on. Sorry. I'm having this more and more lately where I'm just like, no, I don't know what's going on.
I don't massively engage with what it is. But I do think that it's well worth a try just to be reminded of why the platinum name really means something when it comes to this kind of combat system. So yeah, I don't think I'm going to get anywhere near perfecting this.
There are some of the old optional challenges when you go off the beaten path. Again like Devil May Cry style. I'm not sure if Ninja Gaiden also did this.
But then you do these optional wave challenges and you realise that when it's hard it's basically impossible. And that's what I always heard about the difficulty of these games. But otherwise, pretty impressed Matthew.
You played a bit of this, is that right?
I played a little bit. I mean not long enough to properly get my arms around it. I was struggling maybe to pin down what the central idea of the combat actually was.
Is this like a game where evasive dodging is king? Is it a game where parrying is king? You've got this weird sort of super powered moveset on one of the triggers.
You can almost like trigger these like bigger versions of your regular attacks, which can sort of stun enemies and parry them if you use those. And I was like, is this the central idea? And in the way that, in Bayonetta, arguably, the central idea is witch time, right?
You're like, if you kind of get your head around that, you can kind of get your head around this game. Here, I felt like there were so many things going on right from the start, I couldn't tell you like, oh, this is the thing you really need to master. Which I guess is true of Platinum games.
I get the feeling from some reviews that Ninja Gaiden, which I like with you, is not a thing I'm hugely familiar with. I've played a little bit of them all. But I always got the idea that they were slightly more stripped back, simpler and purer for it.
People who are big Ninja Gaiden fans often think Platinum games are a bit overstuffed and over the top and lack that. They're trying to distract you from that purity by just throwing so much stuff at you. And so I couldn't quite tell, should you just take this as, wow, another brilliant, overstuffed, really silly, really fun Platinum game, or should you take this as a Ninja Gaiden, which is maybe a little unfocused compared to the others?
Yeah, it's a very interesting, I think it's a very accurate distillation of maybe the what Platinum represents versus what Ninja Gaiden represents. There is, like I say, a lot going on with this combat system. So yeah, I think that the enhanced version of regular attacks and then the screen goes red and then there's white text on it.
Those attacks, I think, are the thing you're meant to be building up to basically, like doing these really big finishes and keeping the bar charged up that gives you those finishes, is like a key part of it as well. But I'd be lying if I said those were the only parts of the combat system because, like you say, parrying ends up being a pretty big part of it too. And yeah, there's just a lot here.
It feels a bit like two games' combat systems combined. It's got two games' worth of stuff combined. But yeah, maybe like you say, there is like a focus to the way that these games normally do it.
There's perhaps lost in kind of like Platinum's way of doing things. Maybe that is where you see the... I don't want to ascribe too much to individuals here, but like the lack of a core idea at the center of it is maybe where it's like current Platinum versus old Platinum.
But I will say that when it sings, it really sings and if you are a fan of this kind of combat system then I think this game is capable of giving you the joy that those combat systems always did. And I find that of great comfort because there still aren't that many games that are made really in this mold, right? And there's still not many places I would go to besides Platinum to get that kind of experience, you know, even if it's like not necessarily the best version of it.
Oh, yeah, absolutely. And I've seen clips online of like some of the later weapons in the game. And it seems like, as in all Platinum games, your central character ends up being like, you know, basically eight action games worth of characters in one, you know, you could master one move set or work out how to string it all together into some, you know, mad sort of dance of destruction.
The weapons certainly go to some mad places, which I don't know if that is true of Ninja Gaiden again. I kind of need to sit down and play Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, which has been on my to-do list since it came out earlier in the year. But at the same time, yeah, I mean, I do like Platinum games and I will happily take it.
You know, I didn't play this and think, oh, there's something seriously wrong here or seriously missing. You know, whoever is at Platinum still has, you know, they've still got some juice.
Yeah, definitely, it's, you know, it's also like a return of like a, you know, an Xbox legacy series, you know, and the idea they've done it with the people who know what they're doing around the genre is like, it's pretty cool. So, yeah, I've got, I've definitely got more to play with this one. But first impressions are good, but I do wonder if at a certain point it's going to like, get out of my hands a little bit.
I just feel like I won't totally grasp it. But, you know, in what I played of Bayonetta 3, there were parts of that where I felt so watered down from what Bayonetta originally was that it just bummed me out just how different some of the gameplay styles could be. Whereas, you know, certainly compared to the first two, I think it's just a little bit of a, it's a bit more frivolous a game, Bayonetta 3, you know?
It's a bit less focused. So here you just see a little bit of that class platinum stuff come back, I think.
It's quite funny because I've seen Cameo say in some interview since leaving platinum that, not that Bayonetta 3 is misunderstood, but that he, I think he really thought that's what people wanted. Even though he didn't direct it, I think he was still quite involved with it and seemed quite surprised that people didn't get on as well with it as they did. So yeah, who knows what makes them tick.
Yeah. I think this is just, they just, the sickos who like their games just want the best possible version of that hardcore hack and slash experience and for it to feel to get to that point where you've got that one-to-one connection between what your brain wants to do and what's happening on screen, which is what these games can do when they're at their very best. So, yeah, I'll keep going and see if I reach that point with Ninja Gaiden 4, Matthew.
So, there you go, I've mentioned the name of the game again. So even more elegantly done. We have one more game to discuss, Matthew, another game that I've played a little bit of, but curious to hear more about it.
Because I feel like this is one of the truly missed games from this year. At the end of the year, there'll be a list features to say, these are 10 great games you didn't play this year, and this will be number one on that list, I think. What is the game?
This is Hell is Us, which is the third person action RPG from a new studio, Rogue Factor, directed by Jonathan Jacques Beltette, who was the art director on the Eidos Montreal Deus Ex games, Human Revolution, Mankind Divided. So, you know off the bat, it's going to be visually very stylish. I think the talking point with this game, I should say, I played the meat of this some time ago, about two months ago, and I picked it up to get back into it and actually struggled for reasons that I'll explain, but this is a roundabout endorsement.
Like I say, it's a third person action RPG, but it's big hook and something it advertises right from the start with almost like a content warning. Is that the game doesn't really give you any direction, mission objectives, there's not a traditional map with map markers. You have to deduce what you need to be doing and work out what you need to be doing.
So it's almost pitching a version of an action RPG that is tapping into some of that sort of deductive reasoning of a Obra Dinn or Outer Wilds or something and you think, oh, that's interesting, how is this going to work? I'd say it pulls out pretty well. It's not a massive open world game which helps it.
It's a series of quite large but self-contained areas that you sort of drive between on a map screen. So that naturally limits the actual kind of like how truly lost and confused you can get. Like even if you just walked around the whole map, it wouldn't take you that long and you would eventually find something you could kind of interact and progress with.
A lot of working out what you need to do in this game revolves around talking to NPCs and just taking the hint. They'll say, oh, that thing you're looking for, it went west down a road. So if you follow the road that is to the west, you will get to something which will kind of trigger a cut scene and the next part of the story.
So I wouldn't say it's like rocket science. I wouldn't even say that that sort of shapelessness is what's most interesting about this. And I guess it gets you to lean in, which is more than most games do.
But I wouldn't say you have to make any great mental leaps to kind of get through this game. Again, no Mensa membership game, which you'll be glad to hear. But what I do really like about it is the way that intertwines with world building, because you're looking for someone, that's all you know from the outset, is you're looking for someone who's important to you, someone from your life, but you don't really know where you are, you don't really know what the political situation, what's actually happening.
There seems to be demons, there seem to be some sort of military men. And you soon just sort of learn by exploring and talking to people that you're in a country in the middle of quite a violent, but also like recognizable civil war. There's like a big religious dispute and basically one half of the country is violently putting down another half.
And this is happening simultaneously with a sort of demonic invasion, which may have some kind of connection to this wider political situation. But what I really like about it is it's got this sort of like fantasy horror side, where you're fighting these sort of pale demons in sort of demonic monasteries and twisted facilities and all this kind of stuff. You know, quite, quite sort of hackneyed modern grimdark horror fantasy.
But the civil war itself and the repercussions of that are a bit more realistically rendered. Like they're actually things more familiar from like, you know, the real life news stories and I wouldn't say it's like beautifully depicted or anything. It's still, you know, the whole game is quite cartoonish.
But I do like the idea that you have to make sense of this political situation and the ramifications on the people who live there. And at the same time you have to deal with this. All these like demons have turned up and it's like what happens when this like completely made up thing and this very real thing kind of collide and I've just not really seen that done before.
That's what's like held my attention. Like I like finding out how this world works. At the start you're in like a village and you can see how this situation has played out and affected people on like quite a local level.
But later on you get to go into like government buildings and like capital cities and see how some of these decisions were made or see what's happening like at the top of the power chart and it really sells you on the whole thing. And I wonder if that's something that he bought across from having worked on Deus Ex and that being like a very complete bit of world building that really thinks about how, you know, how does this city work? How does this world actually work and function?
And that's the discovery part of this that's really worked for me.
The actual sort of like we leave it to the player to figure it out element of it is also quite, you know, it's maybe slightly overblown the way they discussed it because it will often come down to a guy telling you, oh, you know, look out for like these wind chimes along this path, and that will tell you where to go. And so, but it won't be like a marquee just follow, you know, without really thinking about it. That is the difference.
So I think it's just trying to get a bit more, a bit back, back more to like games, how they were maybe like 25 years ago in terms of how much information they gave you to figure out the thing you were looking for. And then walking around endless kind of like maps in Jedi Knight or Quake or whatever it might be to just try and find the key you needed to progress or whatever it might be. So I think that part of it works.
But I think what really helps is it is a rock-solid, Souls-like game as well in terms of the combat. It's really, it's an Unreal Engine 5 game. I say it's like one of the nicer looking games of the year.
It runs really, really well on PS5, like a base PS5. And yeah, like the combat side of it, like the enemies look cool and kind of weird. Like you say, it's like the mix of demonic and realistic stuff does create like quite a cool contrast.
But I also think it's a kind of setting that in screenshot form looks kind of like grayish and muddyish and might make you think it's got a bit of Xbox 360 energy. And like it, and it perhaps does on some level, but it is a, when it's like moving, it's a very nice looking game. And yes, it's actually a bit strange that it's been kind of ignored.
But I do think it sort of lacks one really big hook to sell the game around. It's sort of like, it's quite, it feels like some quite smart people came up with it, but it's not like the game really rubs in your face right away what's going on. It's not like in the very opening, there's like a crawl where it's like, this set of people has been killing this people, and now the demonic invasion is here.
It's much vaguer than that. It's much more, but there are like NPCs who will explain things to you that give you more context, but you are already really slowly piecing together what's actually going on in this world. It takes a few hours to really give you the full context of what's going on.
In some ways, I wonder if it's like over trusted the player, at least from a marketing perspective, like it's hung too much on the idea that people might engage with it for what it is, or it's just released in a really busy year where it hasn't found the audience that it deserves. Either way, it's a cool game.
Yeah. It feels like one of those seven out of 10s.
Yeah, I can see that.
It definitely has a bit of that magic. I'd say the big flaw with the combat, which will soon dawn on you, is there's only four enemy types in the whole game. It just never ever evolves to that.
Maybe it's more like six, but either way, it just gets to a point where you're like, oh, what's going on down in Hell? Why have we only got these guys? It has this system where they're like, they've got their slightly different colours, which reflects their emotional state or something along those lines.
But it does boil down to four or five character models, just each with a different colour glow. That doesn't make a roster of 20 enemies. That's a lighting effect attached to four.
So that's a bit of a bummer and a very valid criticism against it. But at the same time, it's a sort of souls-adjacent thing which I can play and isn't too difficult for me. I've been decently challenged by it, I'd say, and have managed to make it about two thirds of the way through.
But yeah, what I was going to say actually is going back to it, it's quite hard to pick up what I was doing, because it doesn't have any of that guidance. I played it originally for like three days straight, and my head was just in a place where it completely understood this world and what was going on, and actually getting back into it because it doesn't give you any pointers is very, very hard. So if you are going to play this game, just try and give it a good old run.
I think it's meant to be about like 30 hours long. It's not like mega, mega big. I'm not starting it again.
I'm too far into it, but I also just don't know who anyone is or where I am or what anything means. So yeah, that's a bummer.
Hell is question mark. That's the game to Matthew.
Hell is us.
Yes. Yeah. So that is funny.
The idea that you've been bamboozled by the very conceit that was designed to sell the game.
Yeah.
I love that that's happened to you. You did it previously on Hell is Us. And then a guy goes, This lot are killing this lot.
And these demons came out of this door. And you fought these same four guys 85 times. So you really need that kind of function in this game.
So yeah, it's tough when you're not from software and you don't have like something like 12 games worth of enemy sort of types that you've built up at this point. And animation that you can recycle and all that stuff. You really need to make a few games to build up that kind of library.
So that's tough, Matthew. Okay, well that was Hell is Us. Hopefully you got some value out of that little what we've been playing chatter there.
We're gonna end with some mailbag questions, Matthew.
Did I read out this first one?
I had a daft draft idea that you can use or lose. Demo discs. Each takes a turn choosing a specific level, area or mission of a game to feature on a demo disc.
Drafts could be limited by console, like the Mag 3Bs of old, or theme, e.g. the ultimate stealth game demo disc. That's a suggestion from Matt D.
Yeah, so the reason I put this in here, Matthew, is that we did take this idea and come up with our next draft off the back of it. So I did think this is a nice idea. The problem with doing the demo disc thing, which does sound cool on paper, that's pretty similar to the drafts we already do.
It's not, you know, a demo disc of PS2 games would probably just be what we all picked in the PS2 redraft. You know, it wouldn't largely be different, unless you had like a shy sort of midway sports game category and like a NAF license game category by design. And so you made the games deliberately worse on purpose.
It's kind of funny, but probably don't need to do a whole draft just around that. It's quite hard to catch the essence of a demo disc. It's sort of, you know it when you see it, but it's really like three great games, then like two to three middling games, then like four things that are pretty rubbish we only play for like two minutes.
But weirdly, it's the middling games that will become a cornerstone of your personality 20 years later. You'll be like, oh yeah, I played so much hurdy-gurdy on that demo disc.
Yeah, I was a huge Cooler World guy. Cooler World was like the ultimate game everyone played on a demo disc they never owned. That and Medieval.
Yeah, those takes on Endless Mode. That's what I say.
So yeah, so we have taken this week. We're doing like a best levels Megadraft basically. So the categories I suggested were along the likes of like a first person shooter map or like a like a boss battle will be one of them as well.
And that is kind of like the vibe we're probably going to go for instead. So multiplayer level, platforming level, mission and open world game or larger game, a bonus level and like a racing track will do as well. Ash suggested like a light gun stage.
So that is like a draft will do that. That's got a lot of different directions you could go in. But, you know, there are some first person shooter levels, I would say, for example, that are pretty obvious what the like really hot ones will be.
So I think that's going to be a fun draft. We'll probably do that early next year, Matthew, like January or February. I just want to say thank you for the suggestion, really, from Matt Day.
It was pretty solid, so yes. Next question then, Matthew, is from Kurt. Hi chaps, are there any games that you both fundamentally disagree on, like one of you loves, but the other cannot stand, but love for in any way?
So not a Tears the Kingdom or Hotel Dust situation, which I know Samuel wasn't as into as Matthew, but I got the impression he still appreciates what those games are doing. I mean, a fundamental difference of opinion. So Matthew, was Assassin's Creed Shadows one of these?
I feel like that kind of happened this year.
I think I've got a fondness for 100 hour open world, action RPGs in the modern mold that you don't have for sure. I just don't feel like you don't have 100 hours in your life for any one game. One game like that, you've played 100 hours of a great multiplayer game that you love.
I guess so. I mean, I finished a Valve this year. That was like 50, 60 hours, which is pretty sizable.
I think that when it comes to these kind of open world games, I'm a bit more selective. And even when I do play them, I try to knock through them while only doing some of the side content, so it doesn't take up too much time. Yeah, I do like these games when they're done well, but there's now just so many other games asking for your attention.
It is hard to commit, and if I'm going to commit, it needs to feel like it's got the stuff out of the gates, you know, and didn't quite fill that with shadows, unfortunately. But I was wondering if any other examples came to mind of things we fundamentally disagreed on.
I think there are things which we may be like politely, not agree to disagree on, but we may be like pull punches on, or we're just sort of like, yeah, that's fine, you know, we just don't really dwell on it. I don't think there's anything we're like violently disagree on. Like, unless this whole time you've been, you know, holding your tongue on a particular Castle favourite, you know, now would be the time to say.
No, not really. I think we tend to end up playing, you know, games that like have a pretty good reputation on the podcast so that we've got a pretty good idea of going to be good before we start talking about them. So it's rare to really encounter anything where I'm like, this is terrible, you know, that's not happened much in the last few years, you know.
Broadly speaking, I just don't like real time strategy games. I'm not interested in them. And whenever you talk about them, I'm just like, hmm, yeah, that sounds interesting.
But I'm also, there's no part of me that's going to play Command and Conquer Remastered or Age of Empires or Tempest Rising.
Not a big Tempest Rising guy, Matthew.
No, no, this isn't going to happen. I wouldn't say I hate them. I just have no interest.
I think there have been things where I think you like them a lot more than I do. And so I just sort of, it's not like I go along with it. I have no real passion in me for like Halo, for example.
Yeah, that's true.
Which I think, you know, for lots of people, it is a formative game. Like for me, Halo 1 and 2, I'm like, yeah, they're fine. Like I've got no excitement for that remake at all.
That does nothing for me. But then I think maybe you just had to be there and have those experiences early on. You know, like Halo 3 is the one you can probably make the best case for because I did have like a true playing experience with friends.
But again, I wouldn't say I hate them. I just, they're just, you know, I'm just not really interested in them.
Yeah. I would admit that there is a thrill on this podcast when we do disagree on something, even in like a tiny way. So, you know, Astrobot last year, that was genuinely great podcasting to hear, you know, where the bits that Matthew was down on and, you know, the parts where I was like, surely you can't hate this side of it.
And like, yeah, that's interesting because of your Nintendo sort of like, you know, your love of Nintendo coming to the fore in some ways of that.
I think the flip of that last year, Astrobot, was me really quite liking Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and you having quite a few problems with it.
That's true, actually, yeah.
That is probably one where, you know, because I think you are quite sort of resolute in your thinking that that is an overscored game and doesn't deserve it. It's like Metacritic's score where I think it is really excellent. I really like it.
Well, I just think there's some parts of that game that are indisputably bad. This is it.
I'm fine with it.
But my sort of thinking on it is that, did they all need to be part of the game? When you do the Cat Sheath mansion bit, which everyone says is the worst bit of that game, that could easily have just been side content, couldn't it? It's like, oh, by the way, Cat Sheath, by the way, Reve, we need you to go into this mansion and do some bullshit.
There's so many bits in this game where someone asks you to do something like that. I just feel like if you slice 20 hours out of the game, it probably comes closer to what I felt like people were saying about it. But yes, I appreciate, I think what you really respond to is when someone spent absolutely fucking mega bucks making something look amazing.
That will still dazzle you, absolutely. I do like that about you because it means you've got this childlike wonder of blockbuster games, man. They're really doing it for me.
I feel like you have that sort of response to a lot of games. Actually, I think you're quite selective with the ones that you say are the good ones, but it's true, isn't it?
There is definitely that street to me. It isn't equal like mega budget equals game I will love. I just love it when someone's clearly gone mad, which is definitely what the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director did.
It's got a bit of the Resident Evil 6 energy. It's just so needlessly big. He just went for it.
I like that he's been doing the interview rounds these last couple of weeks. He must have been over for something. It's just really unapologetic about it.
He's just like, no, it's just what we wanted to do and that's what we did.
That dude seems sound as well. He seems like such a cool dude. He's talking to the media way more than Katase ever did or Nomura ever did.
It's really cool to have someone out there rep in the game and being so obviously passionate about the thing they've made. I shared the slight bummer of it not selling as well as they wanted it to. I want these games to sell well because I like Final Fantasy and I like them spending loads of money on Final Fantasy.
The thing about Rebirth is a lot of the time, it was the game I wanted it to be. It was the game that I wanted Remake to be. From certain angles, for about 60 percent of the time, it was doing everything I wanted it to.
But then the rest of it I just found so objectionable. It did color my feeling. So you're right, that is an interesting recent example of this.
I relish them when they come out, to be honest, because I know it's good podcasting. So I look forward to see what the next one is. I think I really curdled on Echoes of Wisdom, but you quite like that game, but not strongly enough to really make a big deal about it.
Yeah, I'm curious to see if there's one this year in this year's Game of the Year chat. But I guess we'll find out in December.
We will indeed. Do you want to read the next question, Matthew?
Dear big men, which one of the two heads do you associate yourself with on The Back Page podcast artwork? Despite them being identical, I always imagine Sam is the left head and Matthew is the right head. There is no reason for this, that's from ChronoFirm.
Yeah I mean the logo is an ongoing sort of baffling sort of thing. I mean it's really stuck, like when you see it on the Apple podcast charts it really does its job of, you know what it is as soon as you see it. It's great designed by the legendary John Strike.
So I don't, but at the same time I think I've got a bit of right sky energy in that to be honest. No? Okay.
So I always see it as the left head, because you like lead it and sort of host it at the start. In my head the dialogue moves from left to right. You're talking to me on the right.
Right. I guess so. But it is an equal partnership isn't it?
It is. But you do say hello at the start. If it was music you'd hear the music on the left first and that's what your head is.
It's the musical note that says hello, welcome to The Back Page Podcast. Then my head is the note that goes hello.
I can't quite explain it but when I look at the artwork, the right guy, even though it's the same face, I can just see the rest of my face just emerging on the side of the artwork. Really? That could be my nose and that could be my mouth.
I could just see it the tiniest bit.
Do you see my face emerging from the left or am I just not on there?
No, I guess you're not on there in my head.
This is where you're like, I see the other lips as like Dave Scarborough.
No, not at all. But it's more like, it feels like a bit like a Rorschach test, you know what I mean? Where it'll be like, here's a picture of a puppy being beaten to death and if you point that out they're like, you're going to, you know, it's the mental health institution for the next 40 years of your life.
And so I feel a bit like that where I'm like, I don't know man, I'm just trying my best here. The guy on the right, I don't know, the guy on the right, let me go. So yeah, that's, but fair enough.
I didn't even really think of either of them as talking, to be honest. They're both patiently watching this weird CRT monitor that's got The Back Page A Video Games Podcast on it.
No, the lips are sealed. They're not talking, but I would expect the one on the left to talk first to the one on the right.
I think it's maybe also because the one on the right is in shadow more. And so I don't know, for whatever reason, I just identify with the guy on the right. That's probably enough discussion of this one, Matthew, but moving on.
Okay, next podcast is from Andy Judson. Hi, reasonably sized gentleman. A question for the next mail bag.
I'm getting a switch to for Christmas for the family in inverted commas and intend to use it to introduce my five-year-old son to video games properly, hopefully steering him away from Roblox-esque shite. Good luck with that. It's a generational battle, that one you've got in your hands.
What do you reckon are the best games to introduce a young impressionable child to the hobby? Bonus question, what's the best way to present the gift on Xmas Day? Just dominating space under the tree or something smarter?
Wow, really, we're getting into like gift delivery now, Matthew. This is really not our wheelhouse. But you know, you're a Switch 2 guy.
I think it's pretty self-evident what the great games are on Switch, but anything you would change to appeal to a very small child.
In terms of like really simple, safe, colourful games, I still think Kirby in the Forgotten Land is maybe more accessible than any 3D Mario on Switch.
Yeah, or even Mario Wonder, I'd say it's more accessible than that, because that game is almost a little bit like… It plays on your knowledge of these 2D Mario games. And so if your first game to this kid is like, here's all these level designers going, I'm going to make it so it feels like you've lost your fucking mind when you go into another level and there's all these ideas being blasted at you.
That's maybe less appropriate than something as gentle as Kirby, you know?
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, so it's hard because getting your head around 3D games, that's like a huge hurdle for any person playing games. Part of me is like, wow, that's the wanton destruction of Donkey Kong.
But then you also have to be really in control of quite complicated 3D camera. So that's like an absolute no-no. Donkey Kong, I think, is bad for children, putting out there.
It's super obvious. Like Mario Kart World, just from the perspective of just being able to aimlessly drive around a really colourful place and see funny little characters and hear nice music. And you've got the races if you want to go in and get smashed by all the maniacs online.
But for a kid, I mean, I remember my little brother loving open world games. Like my very little brother, William, like when he was a toddler or whatever. Like the idea of like a Lego city, just a space to drive around in.
That's all he was really interested in. So in my head, that's what a five year old wants. Just something colourful and safe.
But they've got like the illusion of like freedom.
Yeah, I don't know if you'll agree with this, but I wondered if Splatoon was a good match because I imagine that the interaction of like just firing paint in that game and paint appearing on a surface is probably, that basic interaction is probably quite exciting to you if you're really young.
Yeah.
And the multiplayer part of it will probably matchmake you to be with some, you know, it's probably some other kids playing that game because it is a competitive game, but it is quite gentle.
So yeah, there's a lot of monsters in those lobbies, like no scoping you with a paint bazooka. And you're just like, what the fuck? It's terrifying.
Even when I played it for a review, we were getting monstered and you're like, no one's even got this game yet. And there are people who are this good at it.
Yeah.
But you're right. I'm from, yeah, I was trying to think of like, yeah, games where you could like, that's what I was thinking about Donkey Kong in terms of a game you could make mess. But I think the camera in Donkey Kong is just a bit of a no-no.
Yeah, Splatoon is quite hard, but it is fun. Like the paint, like I keep just blasting paint everywhere. I can see that.
Well, I guess along similar lines, I'm trying to think if, what about that? I think that little kitty big city game, when they market that, there's loads of like, videos of kids like enjoying it and stuff. And I think it is an open world game where it's like not, it's not like stray where it's like really sort of, it's quite meticulous in terms of mechanics.
It's like, enjoy this cat, basically, and that's the game. And so I wonder if that's, and also that game is sold. I always see that in the top sellers on Switch, which makes me think that it is actually finding a young audience and that maybe makes it appropriate for that.
Yeah, and so if anything to keep away from Bluey, the video game, which I assume is like Naffa's shit, and the Mario Party games, which obviously we did not endorse whatsoever. Yeah, I don't know, this is surprisingly hard.
And of course, by Christmas, that Simogo collection will be out.
Perfect, Matthew. I think that's-
We need to start raising like someone with incredibly good taste this early on.
That's it, you just make a genius out of them by giving them a Laurel and the laser eyes to play and nothing else for like a three month period after Christmas. Perfect. One of that Nintendo Switch sports game might be quite good as well, Matthew.
That's like basically Wii Sports, isn't it? But modernized. No one really talks about that, but I assume it's quite good.
It seems to sell quite well. I feel like Animal Crossing is probably too abstract for a really little kid to understand even though I know that. What the actual mechanics of it are quite intricate really, but maybe you would delight at just living next to an elephant.
I don't know. That could be fun, perhaps. That's surprisingly tricky.
There are not many games made for kids. If you do go for the classic Lego option, Matthew, what would you recommend as a good Lego game starting point? The last Star Wars, well, that's fairly solid.
I don't think it was remarkable, but it was all right. Yeah.
They're all kind of fine, aren't they?
Indiana Jones.
Yeah. I guess it depends if he's like Marvel, Super Marvel one is quite good.
Yeah. That first Marvel Super Heroes one is pretty solid, isn't it? It's got a fun Avengers and loads of other characters kind of storyline to it.
It's Spider-Man. That's what kids like, isn't it? Being Spider-Man.
Yeah. I would say if it's going to be a Mario, Mario 3D World would be the one, I think. It's got that sort of like broad, colorful style to it.
It's not overly hard in the first few worlds, but then I'm always banging on about that game, aren't I, Matthew?
Yeah, that's fair. Definitely the co-op element. There's no camera control in that one either.
That helps.
That is true, actually. Absolutely do not give them the Super Mario Galaxy collection, but I will save further observations for that later on. It's simply too complicated for a small child.
Have you got a fun way to present a gift on Christmas Day?
Just sort of like crash your car through the side of your house and then just like the airbag goes off and you sort of tumble sideways out of it. And then you go, Happy Birthday Jimmy. I mean, sorry, Happy Christmas, Jimmy.
But you've had a head injury, so you say, Happy Birthday. And then you go, Happy Christmas, Jimmy. I don't really know otherwise.
It's sort of like, my parents never really did anything hugely surprising. It's like a treasure hunt. It's the sort of thing that my parents might do.
And then you hide the switch too in a really complicated place. They definitely get it last.
I think five is maybe, it's too young to maybe like appreciate the theatre of a reveal.
That's true actually, yeah.
I think when you're five, you just want to see big ass boxes under the tree.
That is true. Like you can't do the thing of like, oh, it's a copy of Donkey Kong Bonanza, son. And a five year old is not going to go, but I don't have anything to play it on.
No, they won't get that.
No, they'll just be like, you know, what's that?
They'll just eat the cartridge and go off on their way, you know? That's what a five year old does, goes and eats some Haribo and forgets what happened 10 seconds ago.
Yeah, save the theater for like 8, 9, 10, I reckon. That's my tip to you, Andy Judson.
I always remember my little brother getting his subscription to Official PlayStation 2 magazine, being like, but we don't have a PlayStation 2. Oh, and then just the mic drop. Well, what about this present?
Amazing.
And then it was a subscription to Edge magazine. Are you like, that still doesn't solve the problem. Are you like, oh, never mind.
Okay, Matthew.
That's if you've been naughty. That's the coal in the stocking version.
That's really funny. I had a further joke to make there, but I'm not going to make it. Let's move on.
Okay, a question from Ian. Do you want to read this one out, Matthew?
Hello gents, lesser question than a suggestion, I guess. But if he hasn't seen the clip episode already and is up for it, I thought it might be fun for Samuel to challenge Matthew with the Mastermind Zelda question someone posted the video of. Oh, I heard about this.
Yes, so I've dialed up this video, Matthew, and there was a guy who looks like modern day Hayley Joel Osment in the spotlight, and so I'm going to read out these questions for you as I go. So it might be a bit staggered and I'll try and cut this together in the edit a little bit. OK.
There is a golden artifact at the heart of the series comprising three gold triangles. What is the name of that object?
Oh, Triforce.
Yeah, very easy. Throughout the game, the Minish Cap, Link is accompanied by Witchwise, but Sarcastic Sage, who's been transformed into a sarcastic hat.
Oh, fuck. It's called something like Ezio.
Something like that. Hang on.
It's great. If you were hosting Mastermind like this, that show would not have been on there all these years.
I'm trying to hear. I should have just written these questions out, to be honest. There's a guy reading them out and I'm reading them out.
I feel like I'm listing in on some fucking Cold War tape or something like that.
Are you doing this by listening to it live and repeating it?
I am. I thought this would be a bit easier than it was.
I would assume you would have written these down.
I know. I really fucked this. I'm sorry.
Next question. Hang on. No, this is not worth it.
I'll just cut out the episode.
Jesus.
I'll just do this again. We'll do another mail bag in December and I'll do this again then. In the meantime, Matthew, just avoid this clip from six months ago at all costs.
Okay. Yeah, okay. I really fucked that.
Sorry.
We're going to cut that entire bit out or we're going to keep it in so people know what you did.
What do you think? What makes better podcasting? I thought this would be a lot easier for some reason.
You thought it would be easier to life repeat what someone was saying in your ear?
Yeah, I did. Oh dear. I really fucked it.
No, that isn't the way this works.
Oh, here we go. Nintendo Live has done it themselves already. So they turned this into a...
Yeah, they turned this into... In fact, you know what? I even got the first question completely wrong.
It was like... The gold triangles comprise power, wisdom and what other quality?
Oh, power, courage.
Yes, that's correct. Okay, so... And then, yes, question two.
You were correct. It was Ezio.
Oh, Ezio. I said Ezio.
Yeah, that's fine. You were just thinking of Assassin's Creed. In the game of Link to the Past, Link must travel to the Dark World where he'll be turned into a rabbit unless he's carrying what object?
Uh... It's like a pearl. The witch's pearl?
No. You're close, though, I think.
Uh, I don't know. Like, the magic pearl? It's a pearl.
It's a pearl.
It's the moon pearl.
Oh, do I get half a point for pearl?
Uh, I mean, by what criteria? There's no prize at the end of this, you know what I mean? Like, it's half a point if you wish.
That's fine. Um, in Oracle of Ages, Link restores harmony to Symmetry Village by repairing a sacred treasure by what palindromic two-word name?
Oh, what the fuck?
In Oracle of Ages, Link restores harmony...
No, I heard the question. I have no idea. I have no idea.
Okay, uh...
Wait, the fourth question on Mastermind was about a bit of a niche Oracle of Ages more.
Yeah, it's 2D Nut. Does that ring a bell? The 2D Nut?
No, not 2D Nut. Sounds like a joke from Dispatch, that. No, T-U-N-I Nut.
Toony Nut? No. What are they doing asking questions like that?
The question should be like, what are the Rock People called?
But it's Mastermind, didn't it? That's not very stimulating.
Yeah, but there's no Zelda fan would know that. Oh yeah, of course, it's the classic Toony Nut that we all talk about as a fandom.
Well, I guess Symmetry Village, the clue is like it's a palindrome, right?
Yeah, but he says that, but you can't just imagine a palindrome. Fucking rubbish, that question.
This section's gone so horribly wrong and then so horribly right. It's really good. Tetra, the seafaring alter-ego of Princess Zelda in the game The Wind Waker, can communicate with Link through the magic of a bluestone with what two-word name?
Pirate Necklace?
You're very close. Pirate's Charm.
Oh, okay. I'll take it. Yeah.
I don't think that's how my stormline works. The person answering the question can't be like, yeah, I'll take that. That's a good point.
What's the name of the dungeon, the second of eight that Link must explore in the game Link's Awakening, that lies in the depths of the Gaponga Swamp and is inhabited by a clown-like genie.
Clown? Is it like the lamp cave or something?
No. I actually remembered this when I saw it written down, but I would never have got it out of nowhere. It's Bottle Grotto.
Oh, but that rings a bell, but I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was the second one. Who remembers the order of Link's Awakening levels?
No, I'm just like, it's the dog one, where the dog eats the plant and then you go inside.
So that one with that big worm that everyone's terrified of with the crazy eyes. The worm whose movement can never be predicted. How did they program?
That's the only bit of truly living AI.
I love that as a theory. That's really good. We should do a truth set of been established in the Back Page podcast and then it's just a series of completely ludicrous statements.
We've said over the past five years. Perfect, Matthew. In the adventure of Link, what is the name of the hidden town which Link can find by clearing a patch of forest?
It's residents having fled another town of the same name that was attacked by monsters.
Oh, no idea. Unless this is like, it's just like a town which is in lots of... Kakariko Village, I don't know.
No, you got the first two letters right though. Oh, uh, Ka... Kasuto?
Does that ring a bell?
No.
Yeah, well that's not one of your Zelda games though, really, is it?
No, it's one of Catherine's.
Exactly, it was discussed on this podcast on the XL episode we did about the best Zelda moments I believe. It was good. What's the subtitle of the Legend of Zelda game in which Link gains an ability known as Ultra Hand, which allows him to move objects telekinetically?
That's a really easy one.
How can you have a question like that in the same question as the one without that fucking Toonie Nut? Oh, it's like Tears of the Kingdom. I thought they were all going to be like that, Tears of the Kingdom.
Every time you say Toonie Nut now that's just going to kill me. Anyway, which character in the game Twilight Princess who describes herself as the Princess of the Insect Kingdom asks Link to bring her golden bugs in exchange for rewards?
It's something like Tabitha.
You're very close, Agatha.
Okay.
At the start of the game, Triforce Heroes, oh god, Link reads a notice appealing for heroes to help defeat an evil witch specifying that such heroes should possess side-parted hair, truly epic side-burns and what other feature?
They're quizzing you on one signpost.
In this shite spinoff that no one played that was sold by Argos for 4 quid for about 9 years because no one bloody bought this game.
I mean, that is niche as hell. I don't know, it's got like a hat or a tunic probably.
No, it was pointy ears. That was the other feature.
Absolute horse shit.
We're on the penultimate question here. Going well so far as a podcast bit despite me going into it and turning it into a car crash from the off. Which Legend of Zelda game originally sold alongside a re-release of A Link to the Past was the first in the series designed to be played by several people simultaneously?
Fuck sake, so easy. I mean, it's really weird to go from here's a very granular detail of a spinoff game no one remembers to can you name one of the most beloved Zelda games of all time? It's like, yes, dog, I can.
In the game Ocarina of Time, what's the name of the enormous parasite described as a bioelectric anemone? Anemone? I don't know.
Anemone? There you go. Is that a film with Daniel Day-Lewis?
Which Link fights while inside the belly of the fish, Jabu Jabu.
It's not. Morpher is like the water tentacle one, but I don't think it's that. There's the one.
It's got a name. It's like Barnacle, but it's not quite Barnacle.
Yeah, you're pretty close. It's Baronade.
Baronade. That's it.
Yeah. There you go. Fuck it now.
That was... Well, actually, I did terribly there because I don't think you get points on Mastermind for going. It's sort of like Tabitha.
I wonder how the guy did, but I won't find out now because that's just watching Telly on a podcast, which, as we've learned, does not work. I've learned in the last five minutes, does not work.
I just don't think you can use audio as an auto key.
No, that was foolish. And I've learned my lesson, and thank you to Nintendo Live for putting those questions up on the internet. It was much appreciated.
Okay, big boys, a suspiciously flushed Bath Tourist Board wants to pay each of you to lead competing, walking, okay, segue tours of games journalism in the city. To which offbeat places or locations of earth-shattering events do you guide your punters? Yujin Naka is first in the queue, obviously, beeping his little horn impatiently.
That's a reference to a very old podcast bit where Yujin Naka comes to Bath for reasons I cannot recall at this time. Matthew, what would be on your tour?
For games journalism tours.
Yeah, it's tough. It's just a series of sandwich shops and the future office, isn't it?
Maybe you could point out things that were future offices when future was a bigger print operation.
Oh yeah, Monmouth Street.
Or that one next to Sports Direct that Guy Ramrey did.
Oh yeah, that was a really good office for a while.
That's where they used to record the DVDs and podcasts.
Yeah, it's like massive space over a Tesco basically.
Yeah. That closed pubs that we used to go to.
Yeah, I had the Hobgoblin down.
Gascoigne Place, Delft.
Yeah, the Hobgoblin was a very grungy, gothy kind of bar where a lot of teenagers and people who were much older than teenagers but still dressed like teenagers went on Friday nights. And also the PC Gamer team. So yeah, but it's now a very gentrified pub called The Black Fox where lots of like finance looking assholes drink at.
It's actually quite a nice little pub as well.
But I think it smells rank in there.
It smells of piss, doesn't it? Definitely.
I think it's haunted by the piss of Hobgoblin.
Yeah, that piss does not want to die basically. I do agree. There's something about the spirit of the Hobgoblin that's somehow clinging in there.
Like people are supposed to be drinking beesting and listening to Limp Bizkit here. This is like somehow immoral and wrong.
The rumour was that Johnny Depp had been seen in there quite a bit in the early noughties. And this was back when pre-cancelled Johnny Depp. So that would have been slightly cool, I guess.
Yeah, he's no Anthony Stewart head, but yeah. Obviously, Jaycee's Kitchen, we go there. But again, it's like old sites of like restaurants.
I'd go to where the grill stock used to be, which was the meat restaurant that the PC Gamer team went to after every deadline. And I think pretty much every Friday for a little while there. It was like a...
Where was that?
That was where Franco Manker is now by the station. Do you not remember grill stock, where it had the little brisket burnt ends served in that little cup. And it was amazing.
There must have been about 800 calories a bite.
I didn't have friends to eat meat with clearly back then.
Well, but you had like Kate and Emma on O&M. You had people.
Oh, that era of future.
Yeah, it was like 2014, 15 kind of time. But yeah, but anyway. Otherwise, I don't know.
I'd get Nathan Brown to tell me where that arcade used to be and say, hey, there used to be an arcade there, point of that.
Oh yeah, I'd point out where there used to be a game station.
Oh yeah, that little street that's got that weird lobster and chips place that you and I can't quite figure out if it's like the front to some other business.
I just don't think anyone is getting an 18 quid lobster lunch to take away.
That is a true curio, that place, because there's always people in there and I'm just like, what the hell? It makes no sense to me. Yeah, otherwise, I think that's it.
I kind of envy the guys who do the bath walking tours as a job. It looks like it'd be a fun little job to do, you know? Goes around with a little flag and then goes, oh yeah, Jane Austen was allegedly here or whatever and then you just kind of keep walking.
I assume it's more informative than that, but you know. Same ballpark. Anything else Matthew, or is that it?
I could own, if they were NGamer readers and really wanted to get niche about it, I could take them to all the places we had our team photos around Bath.
Oh yeah. Would you take them to any of your old flats where you used to live Matthew?
Oh yeah, I could take them to the flat where someone got stabbed on my doorstep. I was absolutely terrified to live there, where I used to live with Leon Hurley on GamesRadar and his demented cat. So that was fun.
I could point out the church I used to live in with Rich Stanton.
Oh yeah, that's wild that that happened. Wild days to late noughties. Okay, next question Matthew.
My lads are nice too.
It will be shut down within a month basically, and it will be attended entirely by people who listen to this podcast. Hello large lads, based on the latest Mailbag episode, it sounds like the Games Court format is in rude health, but have you ever considered having a guest judge on the show? So, by modest proposal, you could toss a coin to decide who takes on the role of prosecutor and who is the defense for the entire episode.
You put your respective cases to the judge for each game and at the end, the least successful lawyer would then be put on trial for their performance. The twist is, you keep your role as either prosecution or defense. This could lead to a hilarious conclusion in which the prosecutor ends up having to prosecute themselves and argue why they should be subject to novelty execution.
Apologies if this idea has been suggested before and cheers. That's from Captain Obnoxious. Now I include this question Matthew because I think this is more complicated than like any Ace Attorney storyline I can name.
Like it's, there's a lot of back and forth here. I do quite like the conclusion of somebody arguing for their own prosecution and then being executed. That's a great punchline but...
Someone who's so dedicated to the act of prosecution that they're like, I will see this through even though it spells my own doom. That's quite Ace Attorney-ish.
Yeah, it's a great bit but I feel like it's a lot of logistical hoops to get there. But yeah, in general I want to just put out another call for Games Court entries really. Like it's backpagegames.gmail.com if you want to email us some and the Games Court Submissions channel.
Reminder, it can be either pre-owned game purchasers or a situation involving video games where you want to decide who is in the right or the wrong. Because we want to do both types of Games Courts next year.
More of a Judge Judy kind of deal.
Exactly. Did this guy was using a sort of like odd job in GoldenEye at this particular, in this particular instance legit? Was it okay that they used odd job while I had a Mad Catz N64 pad?
These are the kind of situations that were after.
I was playing as Mad Catz Natalia.
Next question Matthew, do you want to read this out?
After that great bit in the Best Games of 2017 episode, can you go into more detail about the next Persona game being based in Bath?
Yeah, so…
Can I?
Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, Freshers Week and all the students coming back has been particularly bad in Bath this year. I don't know about you, but like, fucking Sainsbury's is absolutely just hell on earth basically.
Like, it's been rough. So, I don't know, like the students all go to the fucking brew house. That place is massively over-subscribed.
A massive queue outside for a place that I think does like 6 pound 50 pints. Like, how can any of those kids even afford it? So, I don't know.
I feel like in some ways you'd have to really expand it to like Bristol, but then at that point you're kind of cheating because Bristol is basically a whole different city. Bath is actually a place that you would go to for a one-off quest in a Persona game. And then, you don't think so?
No, I was saying that is the problem. Bristol is where Persona is and Bath is the DLC.
Exactly. When they add that to the Royal Edition, you have to spend another 50 quid and everyone grumbles about it but buys it anyway. It's like, yeah, but they added the Roman Baths this time and J.C.'s kitchens in it.
It's kind of tricky. So, it has to be Bristol really. And then from Bristol, you could kind of do...
You might have like a... Cardiff might be where they go out for the day with like, you know, away from the school or something. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure we've quite got the material for this one.
So, I'll simply move on to the next question, Matthew. You don't have anything more to add on that.
No, that sounds great. Sometimes you just gotta let these riffs happen and they just... They reach their natural length.
They do. And then it's the end.
I'm glad you liked it. I'm glad you enjoyed it enough that you asked for more. But sometimes there is no more.
Maybe we'll wrap up on this question, Matthew. What would be the Large Lads game, food or culture related red flags in a date situation? EG doesn't like coriander, does like Kingdom Hearts.
That's from Zach.
It feels weird to talk about dating red flags when you're married.
Yeah, that is odd actually. It's not like you're...
I'd say like a major marriage red flag for Catherine is me talking about dating red flags.
That's a great answer. I met someone recently who wouldn't eat shellfish or beef that's too fatty. You might have some religious reasons or you don't eat shellfish or that you're like pregnant.
Which case I respect.
Exactly. To be very clear, that's absolutely fine. But like, if you don't have those and you're like, no, I won't have a battered prawn.
I'm like, you're missing out on one of life's great pleasures. So that would be a red flag unless it was for religious reasons as previously established. But the main one would be if someone didn't like cheeseburgers or chicken, I just don't think it's going to work out.
Like it's, I just like, you know, when the Joker in The Dark Knight talks about, he likes things that are cheap, like dynamite, gunpowder and gasoline. To me, that is like cheeseburgers and fried chicken. Like if we can't enjoy those things, I'm not sure it's going to totally work.
But yeah, I don't know. Like it's, I'm even prepared to try substitutes for those things to like cross the bridge, you know, to cross the divide. But that's what came to my mind.
You're more likely to run into the broader, I don't like video games, or I think people who like video games are childish, as you know, if they're into games, you're probably going to have a good chat. That's like a great, I mean, like I was incredibly lucky to have met Catherine, who also really likes games, and they can continue to be like a major part of my life. I would say like that, I don't know.
To be honest, even if I rewind the clock back 15 years, to pretend that I had like any red flags, because you're just so desperate for company, you can fucking punch me in the face and it wouldn't be a red flag. Just thank you for going out for a pizza with me.
That is a red flag when someone says, I don't even mind if you punch me in the face, I'll be fine with that. That is a red flag, folks. If you have a boyfriend who says that on your first date, don't go on a second date is my advice.
I've got big pillion energy.
Treat me terrible. But without some of the other events that occur in that film, Matthew, no forest-related mishaps in there. Ideally.
Yes. The only other thing I was going to mention was the video games thing. I sometimes think it's refreshing to date someone who doesn't have that interest necessarily.
Someone who I dated last year actually messaged me out of nowhere going, is Claire Obscure, I've not played a game in ages, but I just saw some screenshots and video of it and it looks beautiful. Is it anything like Sonic the Hedgehog? I was like, oh yeah, if you're totally out of games, and you suddenly encounter something like Claire Obscure out of nowhere, and you don't have a frame of reference, you probably like what the hell happened to video games basically.
But anyway. Well, okay, that's the podcast very much done. Don't know how that one lasted two hours, but here we are.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both those platforms, the podcast is at BackpagePod on both Twitter, where things are not good, and Blue Sky, where things are okay, but not many people are there. And that's social media these days, really.
The podcast is also patreon.com/backpagepod, if you'd like to support us, or even just sign up to the £1 tip jar tier, you don't get the extra podcast or anything, but you just want to say, well done lads on making a podcast that I thought was ruddy good, even if Samuel could have planned the Zelda Mastermind a bit better. That would be very welcome. But the podcast will be back next week with Two Giant Men Plays Super Mario Galaxy, which I look forward to immensely.
Let's go, I'll see you, goodbye.
Goodbye.
