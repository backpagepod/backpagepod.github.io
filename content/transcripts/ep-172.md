Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, it's a pleasure to be podcasting with you again. I've been on the move for four days, non-stop, and it is nice to finally be sat back in my little clean flat and bath. It is not always clean, but it is today, and be podcasting with you about The Best Games of 2003.
So, yes, the small things in life, not that you're small or anything, but-
No, I'm the exact opposite.
Suddenly seem very appealing to me being back in my space. That's quite nice. I'm quite comforted by that.
How are you doing?
Yes, good. Recovering from a cold. And I've kind of broken, I was gonna say broken the curse of playing all these video games, but I haven't played a lot of video games for the last few days.
I wasn't really in the mood for it when I was ill. And I wonder if that's finally broken my feverish 100-hour game addiction that I had going.
Yeah, I think your body is trying to tell you something, basically. It's like, don't do this anymore, or we will die, essentially. I guess it helps as well that the game stopped coming out, you know, that's a little bit of mercy for you.
You know, like, you know, as I'm in the end game of Dragon's Dogma 2, but there's a little voice in the back of my head going, well, now is the time for Unicorn Overlord. And I'm like, I just don't think we should be, we should be doing this to ourselves. Because it was my birthday and I got a load of books.
I want to read those books. You know, I want to watch some TV. I want to watch some films.
I think maybe The Fever Has Broken is the best way of describing it.
Yeah, yeah. It's funny, I was with Catherine, you know, very recently and asking her a bit about your gaming habits. I'm not sure how much of it I should reveal on air.
You can redact any parts you're not happy with.
No, this is fine, this is fine.
But she said that basically any time there was like 20 minutes, you would just boot a game, you'd be playing something. And that's like the sort of defining theme of the last three months. It's like not a minute wasted for you.
You're always got the telly on, you're always playing something.
Not a minute wasted. I mean, I don't know if that's entirely true. On Saturday, when I was at my, my literally at my most fevered because I was poorly, for some reason I went down a YouTube rabbit hole of old Oscar opening monologues from Billy Crystal.
Right.
I was watching all of those and then that got me into, oh, I want to see the winner speeches from the same year. I basically spent like five straight hours watching Oscar speeches from the nineties.
You know what though, that is the kind of thing that I do with my spare time. It's funny that it takes, it takes you being ill for this.
Yeah. It's because it's a sickness behaving like that.
But that's like a normal day for me. It's like, I'll waste three hours. No, you're correct.
But I will waste three hours doing that kind of thing, or reading op-eds about the end of Kirby Enthusiasts, which I've not seen yet. And then like, and then play one hour of a video game, then disappoint you when I turn up to the Dragon Stockmore podcast, having only played 10 hours of it, and 15 hours of Command and Conquer remastered. So that's, you just, all you did was get ill and live my life temporarily, my friend.
So I'm sorry to hear that.
I like that you are just me but frail.
Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's a better distillation, really. I can't remember the last time I was able to focus on one thing unbroken for a long period of time in my own flat. That's the problem.
At least in the cinema, you can go to the cinema. You have to turn your phone off. Have you seen The Zone of Interest yet?
Are you still put off by it being a tough guy?
I've seen it. Like the optimal time to see it, like the screening, which was most perfectly aligned with our lives, fell on my birthday. And I was like, I do not want that on my birthday.
Yeah, I went to see some National Theatre Live productions instead. I'm currently going through a big theatrical phase, albeit at the cinema. Actually like the best way of seeing some of these plays, because you can get like a huge fuck off cup of Fanta and a large sweet popcorn, which you definitely couldn't do at the National Theatre.
That would be so frowned upon by people who paid a hundred quid to see whatever play. But in the Odeon cinema, though, I am munching away. And it feels illicit, because I've got the best seat in the house.
You're so close to the actors, but they can't hear me munching away. They would be able to if I was in the auditorium with them. It's great.
It's a revolutionary way to consume plays and popcorn.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you've revealed a lot about yourself there, but none of it's a massive surprise to our listeners.
Well, it's like high culture and total junk at the same time.
Speaking of that, I actually was tempted to go and watch the National Theatre Live thing for that England football team play they did.
I really wanted to see that.
See, I was worried that if I saw it and told you I saw that, you'd be like, oh, of course the one fucking play you see is the one that's about a football team.
No, I'd been like that. I would have said, great. Good for you.
So, yes, good for you, Matthew. You're going to see Vanya with Andrew Watts' face.
I saw that on my birthday.
I like how you thought that was a good hang versus a zone of interest.
That is a good hang. Uncle Vanya is slightly funny in his own way, and he was funny in it because he did it all himself.
God, that's such a you thing to see on your birthday. I saw that Little Thit had Battle Royale. It might even be this evening or tomorrow night that we're recording this.
We attempted to go watch that in the cinema, being a big Japanese cinema head.
Yeah, I'm not a huge Battle Royale guy, to tell you the truth. There was so much buzz around it. I've only seen it the one time, years and years and years ago.
But I remember thinking, I don't really see what the big deal is. Yeah, which is maybe a good reason to re-watch it.
Okay then. Best Games of 2003 then, now that we've moved on from why Matthew hasn't seen The Zone of Interest yet. Just to clarify, it's a bad hang.
That's everyone's new favourite repeated segment.
It's a bad hang, just to underline the reasoning there.
We call it Zone of Disinterest, that's the name of that segment.
Oh dear, yeah, fair enough. And so, yes, 2003, so we've done 2001 and 2002. I would say there were some of our most well-received episodes in recent times, Matthew, do you think that's fair?
I think people are really getting buzz out of hearing about this particular era of games, which is more detached from our games media years. We have slightly different insights. It seems comically sort of like long ago in terms of the things that were occurring and just the overall vibe of the E3, which you talk about at the time.
The types of games are completely different. I enjoy doing these. Do you enjoy doing these, Matthew?
I do, yeah. They're kind of punter memories, like you say. It's nice to talk about games and think about games from a time when, you know, you engaged with them in a probably a healthier, more natural way than you do when it's your job, a much more limited way.
Yeah, it's a weird one. I sometimes worry that, like, there's quite a lot of stuff from this period that I just haven't gone back to experience. So I've got a lot of holes in my knowledge, like the stuff I played, you know, the stuff that I bought and played back then, I really, really loved.
But I'm, you know, whenever I'm looking through the lists, I'm just aware of all the things I haven't played. And like, you feel like, is it your job, as someone who writes about games, to go back and inform yourself on this stuff? I mean, there's only so much you can do.
And I think you're a little bit more retro minded than I am. So like, I don't remember, like, any of the stuff around this. Like, I don't even really know if I was religiously reading games magazines this year, but it's definitely a period where I begin to get a bit patchy with NGC and only have it like every other month.
So you know, like the E3s, when I was reading the, you know, we'll get to in a bit, but the reading a little recaps of them, I was like, I don't think I watched any of this, like at the time. Like I don't think I was engaged enough with games. So that's what I'm never getting.
All I remember from 2003 in terms of like how I was engaging with games is being obsessed with, well, a couple of games. So Final Fantasy X-2, I had to know what was going on with that. So I remember buying an issue of CVG, it must have been very late in the day one for how much longer the mag went on for, they had Yuna on the cover from X-2, I think that was this year.
And then it like released, I think, in, definitely released in Japan in 2003, but it was in Europe. And I was following that kind of religiously. There were some big licensed games at the time that were huge, like Lord of the Rings game and Enter the Matrix, we'll talk a little bit about that shortly, I think.
And so those were, those were big, but I would generally agree, actually, like there's actually some quite big gaps from my knowledge this year, or some games I've played, but not definitively enough to put them in in my list, so I guess I'll spoil some of those now. Original Call of Duty, Prince of Persia, Sands of Time, never played that, sorry about that. Silent Hill 3, haven't played that.
I will play that at some point for this podcast, I think. And one I've like, I've definitely played, but I don't have enough sustained memories to put in my top 10, Beyond Good and Evil, which is a lot of people's favourite game from this year. But those are just some of the games from this year I didn't play.
So it actually is a bit of a, it probably has the most knowledge gaps of one of my lists from this period that we've done so far, Matthew. So plenty of great games, but yeah, my focus is maybe elsewhere as well, for whatever reason. So is it similar for you then in terms of like, there are just obvious omissions as a result of that?
Yeah, I think so. I think I hit the biggies. It's just there's not a lot around the outside of that.
You know, like Game Boy Advance, huge blind spot for me, you know, like a lot of that comes after the fact, so that's that's one. And this is a year where Game Boy Advance gets gets quite good, I think, obviously, you know, what's going on outside of GameCube is, you know, PlayStation, a couple of PlayStation games on my list. But yeah, Xbox stuff, nothing, because, you know, no one had one in the UK.
Shocking. Yeah. Shocking revelation that is.
I was going to ask you actually, I was going to ask you later, but I'll bring this forward because it makes sense to discuss it now. Out of the years we've done so far from this period, along with 02 and 01, how do you think this ranks in terms of games? You know, this is like the one year that doesn't have a GTA in this four-year block, and GTA to me felt like it was really driving that generation for, you know, for that sort of like middle chunk of it.
And this year, I think, is a tiny bit undercooked compared to the other years, just not quite as many all-time classics coming out of it, but, you know, it's stiff competition because those years were amazing. What did you make of it?
I think if you were solely a Nintendo person, this year has got some pretty special and important stuff, which elevates it in my mind. Like, I had a great GameCube year this year, but, yeah, taking a step back from personal taste, you know, arguably what was happening with PS2 was a lot more exciting elsewhere in other years, for sure, but, I don't know, I kind of probably liked these years equally as a gamer.
Yeah, okay, fair enough.
But that, I think, will be evident from my list of like, oh yeah, I can see why you'd think this was a good year.
Yeah, I think that probably makes sense. The Nintendo thing is true. I didn't have a GameCube, so, you know, one major thing that happens on GameCube this year, I missed out on, I have discovered since then, but never finished it, so I didn't want to talk about it, I won't step on what that is.
There is only one, oh wait, no, there's two games that were released exclusively on Nintendo platforms from this year in my list, so not too many on that front, but they did both rank incredibly highly, so that would be interesting to unpick, Matthew. So yes, yes, I'm excited to talk about that. But in the meantime, Matthew, the most important thing is what were you doing in 2003?
We always waffle on about what we were up to in our lives. People seem to enjoy these bits more than the games discussion, I fear, which makes me wonder what sort of like hell kind of cultish podcast we've created. But what was Matthew Castle doing in 2003?
So I was 18 in 2003 and for my 18th birthday party, can you guess what I did to celebrate being 18?
Uh, Randy Newman karaoke, sorry, that's a really like basic sort of like, you know, sort of lowest hanging fruit.
Just aim for yourself in that one.
Just aim for myself, for you, for the listeners. I just like everyone gets catches some stories there.
The Randy Newman thing was a bit more of a slow burp, you know, like I'd annoy people about it, but I'm, I think I'm a bit more open and vocal about Randy Newman now.
Yeah, Ben Folds then?
No, I rented a cinema to have a screening of Pulp Fiction.
That's actually awesome. So you don't have to be ashamed of that.
Yeah. Well, my mom rented a cinema. It was my mom's excellent idea, because I think, as I've said in, when we've done the 2001, 2002, I think at this time, I was probably like more associated with liking film by my friends, and so doing something very filmy for my birthday was the obvious thing to do.
And you can rent out a screen, you know, the cinema in Winchester is called The Screen, had two screens. So, or did it? Yes, it did.
No, it didn't.
Okay, which one was it, Matthew?
I actually can't remember. No, I think it had one. Yeah, it's right.
It's fine. Anyway. Stepping on this anecdote.
Well, actually, I say stepping on this anecdote, we hired out a cinema and played pole fiction.
The anecdote is over, everyone, please leave.
Yeah, it was good. It was really fun because obviously, like cinema, you can sit lots of people so I could invite loads of people and make it look like I had probably more friends than I did. Because if you're in Winchester and someone's like, do you just want to go to a free screening of Pulp Fiction on Saturday morning?
It's like, yeah, sure. Why not? So I got a pretty good present haul out of it.
A little bit sheepish afterwards because you're like, well, that's that. Me and my close friends, we're all going back to our house to sort of hang out and have some food and drinks, but everyone else can just sort of go.
Second and third tiers of friends, please leave. Yes, that's it. The party is over.
If you are given a green armband, you are one of the chosen few and are allowed to come back to Bishop Sutton. If you do not have a green armband, this birthday party is over.
It's like the polite British version of Bruce Wayne throwing everyone out of his manner in Batman Begins. To all you phonies, you sycophants, what's your version of that speech basically?
Yeah. So that was great watching Pulp Fiction, which is one of my favorite films, so that was a big thing. A levels, which sort of explains probably why I was less clued up on games because I was like, oh, I've actually got to do well in my A level so I can get my university place, which was super important to me.
It's the kind of person I am, which irritatingly coincided with Metroid Prime and Wind Waker were both like earlier released in the year and you're like, just revision kryptonite. The idea of, I shouldn't buy that thing, I shouldn't have that. That will be very dangerous.
That could be the thing, which screws me up. So, you know, you've just got to, yeah, that was quite tough to try to juggle the hobby and that.
Can I ask what is the state of the fridge in 2003?
It's well stocked. You know, like I've got all that revision to do. I want to make sure I've got my chilled Kit Kats and my little apple juice cartons.
Very grown up young man.
You know, to look back on those days where I could drink that much apple juice without having to like follow each one with like a Renny is a good time. I was made of sturdier stuff then. My body was capable of dealing with acids in a way that it simply isn't now.
Yeah, it was great. That got me through some got me through some hard times. I mean, I'm the dry listen.
I've talked about this mini fridge a lot on this podcast and the situation of the mini fridge doesn't really evolve or change like but playing Wind Waker sitting back looking at that lush, you know, lush paradise and, you know, getting a cool, cool carton of apple juice out the fridge.
Surely, surely Rio would be perfect for Wind Waker, Matthew.
Oh, yeah, but I couldn't fill that thing with like grown like adult sized cans. It was so many, you know, it's tiny like little cartons of apple juice. That's how that's how it worked.
And the cool snap of a refrigerated Kit Kat. Yeah, it was, that was pretty good days.
Great days. Yeah. Okay.
That's, that's pretty funny. So you did, you did your A levels. You went to university.
So we have talked about this before. You are, as mentioned, the least kind of like, you'll never go out of your way to talk about going to Oxford. In fact, I think I've said this before, but I wasn't even aware you'd been to Oxford when I got invited to your stag party in Oxford.
And that's how little you talk about it. You are just very, very modest about it, which, as I've said before, people who go to Oxbridge are not modest. They will tell you about it within the first five minutes of meeting them.
I've experienced that multiple times. And let me just tell you, it's very endearing when people do that. I'm always extremely impressed with someone who never went to university, but you don't do that.
So do you want to talk a bit about it a bit here? Yeah.
I mean, you know, it was, you know, it was, it was pretty, it's hard to talk about without sounding smug. Yeah. I thought I had a shot at it because I was, you know, pretty good academically.
That's pretty much all I had going for me. I didn't have much of a social life. Yeah.
Applied quite carefully. Like I kind of played a bit of a numbers game because I think a lot of people don't really understand that, you know, Oxford is made up of loads of colleges and some of the colleges are very famous and look like the more famous or academically renowned your colleges, like the higher chance that person will be the kind of person who talks about going to Oxford. But as you go down the list, you get into like, I don't want to say they're like scuzzy colleges, like they're still, they're still like pretty, pretty legit.
Like Mad Cat's controller, sort of like Oxford colleges.
The Mad Cat's version of, if college made it to university challenge, they're one of the famous ones. So like Merton, Christchurch, Mordland, these kind of things. Mad Cat's Merton, that's Mansfield, which is where I went.
Thank you for describing it in terms I can understand.
College, it's actually been in the news recently, because it's quite vocal about pushing for it. It's got the highest proportion of state school students to private school students, and draws a lot from state schools, and has had a lot of academic success doing that. And so it champions sort of accessibility, social accessibility, I guess, is like its whole deal, and so coming from a state school, I thought, well, that sounds good, I'll go for that.
You can also, when you apply for each course, you can see how many people apply for each course at each college, because some colleges are famous for certain subjects. You know, like, you might want to go to X College, because it's got a famous author is the tutor of English there, or whatever. And Mansfield's quite, like, not as bad, but it's quite low down for English, which is what I applied to do, so, yeah, I kind of played a numbers game, I thought I'll go to the college most likely to accept me, and where there's the least amount of competition per place, and see if that works out.
I was incredibly ill when I applied, because you have to go there and you do, like, quite infamous interviews, where, if you ever look these up online, people have all these horror stories, where they come in into some stuffy, like, Don's office, they've never met this kind of level of academic before, and then they get asked questions like, you know, why is my coat green? Or like, how did this chair come to be here? And things like, and you know, just meant to be like, er, but, you know, you've just been fucking studying, like, one book for a whole year at A-level English, so you shit your pants the second anyone asks you about anything that isn't that one book.
Like, that's how these things happen. I was sick. I was so sick during the interviews.
I don't really remember what I got asked. I just remember coming out going, well, I was really ill. And I probably said some really dumb stuff.
So I have, I don't really know how I got in, but I did.
Well, I think we've explained it here. So you're, you played the numbers game because you're watching a lot of Alias at the time and Jack Bristow is famous for using game theory and Matthew, I think you were just looking up to your hero, Jack Bristow there. Would you say that's accurate?
Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah, I mean, I will say in one of, we had a lot of like end of term evaluations and I didn't do brilliantly well at Oxford. And I had some up and down terms.
I had some tutors who were like, this kind of is, you know, you're not very good at this. You know, they'd be quite frank about it going, you know, you're in for the long haul, like you're here. But, you know, this isn't great.
I remember one person saying, like, you know, we took a bit of a punt on you and they don't always work out. Yeah, but then you were like, well, that's kind of OK. But, you know, that's fine.
Whatever.
Did that galvanise you to try harder? Did that make you think, well, I couldn't get it because what would why is telling you that a good idea? It's not going to is like, is that only hope that they're thinking, oh, well, if I criticise him, he'll try harder.
Is that literally all they can do? That's not how you give freelancers feedback. You know?
Yeah, I don't think so. I think it probably came from like, they're just grown ups being frank, not treating me like children and going like, you know, I sort of read it as. You know, we're not, you know, we don't know if you're particularly feeling this, but we're not particularly feeling this.
And that was fair. Like I had some terms where just the subjects, you know, we did a different subject term to term and different area of literature and some things I got, I had a pretty good grip on some things I was just very, very shit at and never really got my arms around some things. There was just so much reading involved.
I could never really keep up because you just had to be so well read for some of it. I just still to this day don't really know how some people do those courses unless they've just had an upbringing in classic literature, which I didn't. You know, I arrived there and, you know, sure, I'd read 20 Terry Pratchett books, but I hadn't read like any Dickens or whatever.
And like my first essay in my first term, one of like five books was Our Mutual Friend which is like fucking 800 pages long. And it was like, ah, shit, like, what am I meant to do? You know?
Yeah, but that's the sort of thing that private school kids will have been like primed to like, you know, you have to do this when you get to uni because it's systematically rigged in their favour and against you. So you know, no one at your state school is going to tell you to read to read that. You know what I mean?
Yeah, I don't know. Listen, I want to sort of pass the buck, a lot of it was on me for like, you know, not always, you know, you get sent like reading lists in the summer and things like that. And you know, I just I came in greatly underestimating how much work it was going to be.
Yeah, which was which was a bummer because I didn't love it there. And I love the atmosphere and I love the tutorial system. And I love the people that I met.
I really feel like I kind of came into my own and kind of became kind of who I am now there specifically. And yeah, just I know I kind of attribute that to you know, there are only 60 people in our year. So sub 200 across the three years.
So it's a very small college, you got to know everyone and you were just around such confident interesting people that kind of lifted you up in that and you know, it's mad now that I look around and often I'll see names of people in the news who I'm like, oh, that person was in the year above me, they seemed really nice, you know, and here they are. It's like, I remember the guy. I think it was the guy who was like one of the key policy advisors when Ed Miliband's labor was was running in the elections, right, like the guy who was behind that terrible Ed Miliband's stone of promises.
Do you remember that?
Oh, it rings a bell, actually.
The labor stone. They pull out this like biblical tablet of like, we're going to do this stuff. And it was just a PR disaster.
Like, I'm pretty sure like the guy who did that was in the year above me.
Did he also hand Miliband that sandwich back to you?
Everything with that guy was giant stones. That was like his whole shtick at university was just wheeling out giant tablets. And I was like, oh, no way, he's not still doing the tablet bit.
So, yeah, just, I don't know, like, just go from being in a secondary school in the countryside where it's all very sheltered to like college in Winchester where you're like, wow, the world is so rich. It's fucking Winchester. I mean, this is not like a good cross section of what the world is.
And here again, like, I get it. It's a load of hocks of people, but still I felt like I felt like every step of education was just like blowing things wide open in terms of like, holy shit, everyone's interesting. And like, there's all these people from like, they got these like mad life stories and mad experiences.
And yeah, it was kind of yeah, it was great, like I loved, you know, I really, I really loved it. I just just not very good at writing about our mutual friend, unfortunately.
That's tough, but you know, you got really good at podcasting about that Seven Mysteries of Honjo or whatever.
One thing that did happen there that is relevant is I started reviewing films in student paper, which was like my first sort of published criticism, I guess. And that's really all I had when I eventually applied for NGamer was a backlog of film reviews that I'd done for the Oxford student. The first film I reviewed, do you remember, have you ever heard of Second Hand Lions?
Oh yeah, is that Hayley Joel Osmond?
Yeah, that was the first film I reviewed. And you know, these were proper, like you go and see a film and then write 150 words about them. But I remember thinking like, I've made it.
This is it. This is my ticket to the big leagues. Here I am.
Everyone at Oxford University is going to have read my review of Secondhand Lions.
And sort of, um, do Kane and is it is it the guy from Babe as well? I thought it was Robert DeValle. Robert DeValle.
Do they play like, sort of, is sort of like gay dads or something? Haley Joel Usman.
Isn't it gay grand dads?
Okay, is that what the deal is?
Are they gay? Are they lived together? They might just be friends.
Okay, let me, I'll just Google it.
Michael Kane Gay Grandad Films.
Bachelor Uncles. Sorry, I regret the error and retracted it.
Bachelor Uncles. That sounds like code.
Yeah, I was still closely following the career of Haley Joel Usman at this point, being a big Kingdom Hearts fan, of course. So yeah.
He was one of the Oscar, well, he didn't win at the Oscars, but Michael Kane in his best actor speech for Cider House Rules did a whole bit about like, you know, oh, Haley, you're so amazing. I can't believe what you've done.
Do you think that Michael Kane has turned in a performance that's as good as Haley Joel Usman in the Sixth Sense? Because that's like one of the most perfect performances as like a young person, like with a character made for that person.
Yeah, it is a tough break for Haley Joel Usman.
Yeah, that's like a lightning in a bottle performance. Has Michael Kane ever been that good? Because I think he won for Hannah and Her Sisters, which is a really good film.
But he's not better in that than Haley Joel Usman is in the Sixth Sense, a ridiculous false equivalent.
He's more of a star than an actor, isn't he? He's just got incredible charisma.
Presence and that.
I think he does do some pretty great work in some of the Nolan films. I think Nolan brings out the best in him.
When he's eating his dinner during tenet, for example.
More just being very sincerely disappointed in the prestige.
Yeah, the prestige is probably his picture.
I know that everyone jokes about that. I can't bury another Batman kind of stuff that he was doing in Batman. But he was fucking good as Alfred.
Yeah, he was. He was good. Yeah.
But anyway, second hand lines, you reviewed that.
Second hand lines. So that was, yeah, without that, there would have been none of this NGamer business.
Do you remember being daunted when you moved out, by the way, of your parents' house? Because first of all, did the fridge go with you? I think we do need to know that.
Yeah, the fridge did, because I thought, well, everyone's going to be really impressed with this mini fridge.
Were they really impressed by the mini fridge back you?
Not really. The university is so weird, because everyone there has moved out of home for the first time, probably, and they're trying to really leave their mark and show who they are. I remember I went out and spent fresh as week trying to find old film posters to put up in my room, just because I needed people to know that I was a cool film liking person.
But, in hindsight, you look at them and think, did I send some weird messages for some of these things? I think the poster that had pride of place in my room was Edward Scissorhands.
That's not too bad. I think you're going to say, last time going Paris or something.
It's a bit like, hmm, who's really into Edward Scissorhands?
No, I think that's a pretty safe kind of cult, quote unquote, film to have, you know.
Yeah, but then it's also, you don't want people to go like, oh, you know. It was the one which is like a story of an uncommonly gentle man. It's got slightly like, don't fear me vibes.
It's got like, oh, I'm just this nice, I'm nice like Edward Scissorhands, which is like a weird thing.
That was like your sort of friend zone RPG perk, that poster.
I'm the gentle sort, just back away kind of thing. You've got nothing to fear here, ladies.
Yeah, I mean, that is kind of the undercurrent of it. I also remember I had bright yellow walls in my room at college, and I stuck up all these posters, and then I was reading the student's guide, and it said, don't blue tack any posters to the wall, because if any marks you leave on the walls, you'll be fined per mark on the wall at the end of term. I took down these posters and they all ripped off the yellow paint underneath the blue tack, and I spent a considerable amount of time on my last day while moving out with a yellow colouring pencil colouring in all the bits on the wall which had ripped off.
Amazing. See, and here you thought you'd have no observations to share from.
That was my, yeah, that was my obsession. Here's a little fun film fact. The film, oh god, I've completely forgotten its name.
The guy who made The Deer Hunter, he then made a film, a huge flop.
Heaven's Gate.
Heaven's Gate. Heaven's Gate starts off at Harvard or Yale, an American college, but it's actually filmed in Mansfield where I went to university. You can see, not my bedroom, it was filmed 30 years before I was there, but you can see the window I used to look out of onto the college green.
In that film, like John Hurt's dancing around it and stuff.
You can see the wall that Matthew would later desecrate and then have to colour in with a pencil.
Yeah, I'd say who caused more damage to their long-term career in Mansfield? Me or Michael Cimino?
Arthur, are you going to tell me that the other poster you had was Heaven's Gate then?
I thought, wow, that's a deep pull. No, that would have been... No, I definitely had a Pulp Fiction poster.
And obviously your second-hand lines poster you had in your final year just to, you know, review it.
Yeah, I was like, just think of me as your bachelor uncle.
With another mysterious bachelor uncle.
He lives with another mysterious bachelor uncle. I was like, okay.
Okay, well, that was suitably deranged.
What was your 2003? That was very indulgent. Thank you for indulging me, listeners.
I enjoyed it a great deal and I always do. Yeah, this was probably a slightly... You know what?
Actually, for people who listen to The Best Games of 2002 episode, the funniest anecdote I have, which is probably from this year and not that year, was the World War II drama production we put on where we formed a swastika on stage. I mean, let me just make it very clear. You need the context there for that and why you shouldn't cancel me over that.
So I will just encourage you to go back and listen to that. I guess a bunch of stuff did happen still. So this is my penultimate year before leaving school.
So I was in year end of year 10, beginning of year 11. I did work experience for the first time. I did a weird thing where I did a week at my parents, both my parents' workplaces.
So I didn't really have any good ideas for this because I wanted to be a journalist. You couldn't just go and get work experience for the exact time our school had given us for our local newspaper, which was the Portsmouth News, which used to have an office in our hometown of Gosport, which is opposite Portsmouth, but no longer exists now, of course, because local news has been gutted over the last few years. So I couldn't do that.
So I decided to go work at a college for a week, not teaching, I should point out, doing boring admin. At one point, I complained to my mom that I'm only doing boring admin. She was like, well, what are you going to do?
You teach, you're 15, what are you talking about? That was fair. But going to the fire station where my dad worked was a bit more fun.
It was like his previous watch he was with basically. So I spent a bunch of days there. For the first day, they put up a ladder and let me climb on top of the fire station.
That was fun. At one point, I went with them while they went on a call. That was quite interesting.
Zooming along, there was someone trapped in their flat or something. Then afterwards, I saw this.
If my house was burning down, the last thing I'd want to see when a fire engine turns up and everyone gets out, is you sitting inside the fire engine looking out the window. I'd be like, who's that boy? Who's that boy watching my house burn down?
Yeah. He's the reason we're five minutes late and your bathroom no longer exists basically. That was the vibe there.
I think that there was like an emergency one sent first, and then we were like the backup one basically, so it's okay that we turned up late with the teenage boy basically. The funniest thing that happened there was they would often do personal errands in the fire engine. So there was a point where they were-
For each other or them as a community?
Well, for themselves. So one guy pulled up a spice shop in the fire engine, got out and bought a load of bags of chilies or something. Then climbed back in and went, all right, let's keep going.
That happened, there's probably about an hour they were driving around doing little bits and pieces.
What about you, Sam? Anything you want us to get? You want us to stop at the game for you?
Yeah, I could do a training in this copy of The Sims on PS2. So that was probably the most interesting thing that happened there, which is watching them do various errands. But yeah.
Did you get to use the pole?
Yeah, I got to do that. The other thing they let me do is they did a simulated smoke in a room, trying to find a body exercise. So put on these goggles with this.
I can't remember what it was. There's something stuck in front of the goggles. It might have literally just been bubble wrap or something.
They were like, this is what it's like when it's smoke in the building, and you've got to basically feel along for the person. See if you can do it in a certain amount of time or whatever. It'd be a cracking VR game, that wouldn't it?
Did you break the record and get a trophy for it?
Yeah, I've insisted on speed riding it afterwards.
Beat your dad's smoke room, chucked out at her time.
Yeah, they were very nice gentlemen, but it was also one of the funny things they did. So they have one of those, you know, in the bathrooms, you sometimes have proper jobs. You sometimes see, as opposed to the comical video games jobs that you and I have been doing over the years, you sometimes see a sort of color of piss charts, you know what I mean, where it's like, you are dehydrated if your piss looks like this, it's basically like the color of earth, and you're like, that's bad, that's not good.
And then like to the other end of the scale. And someone for a joke at this fire station, which I guess tells you a little bit about the sense of humor of the people here, had made a poo version of this, and like with the accompanying illustrations and shades of color. So that was the kind of hilarious banter.
I thought you were gonna say it was the piss chart, but at one end it had just piss that was on fire, and it's like you are too close to a fire, my friend. But it shouldn't be on fire like that. What I don't understand is having had this experience, why you didn't choose to become a hero like them and did this instead?
Do you know what, though? I did apply for it, and yeah, it was like at the time, there was a time where it's like, it's like 06 or something, and there was something they were, there was something that was going on maybe to do with the labor government, where they were cutting money towards public services, so they weren't recruiting as readily. And I did apply, and because I had already fucked up my A levels at this point, and I was like, well, okay, well, I know this pays well, and it's actually quite enjoyable, and some decent sorts of people seem to go into it, and I can stop off and collect spices whenever I want in my fire engine, so that's ideal.
But yeah, I didn't get it. My dad said afterwards I should have lied about some of the community work that I'd been doing, because he said that successful applicants basically said a load of bullshit about how they went around cleaning graffiti off of walls and stuff like that, and things that just clearly weren't true. But apparently things like that suggest they're beacons of the community, and therefore they're good hires.
And I'm mine with just like, oh, help some old lady fetch some gin from the top shelf in one stop, but it wasn't quite the same.
See, I did apply for it. I asked you that in a facetious manner, and it sounded like you did apply for it.
Obviously, my whole perception of firemen is from pop culture, films and TV and stuff. And like, they always present it as, you know, there is this like undercurrent of danger, of like, it can go horribly, horribly wrong. Like, do you think that's true?
Like in like a coastal town fire station, or is that something else?
No, it can definitely happen. I think my dad had something like five fatalities his entire career.
Oh, wow, shit.
That was something like 25 years, something like that. So, yeah, so that does happen. I think it's probably more frequent if you're working in London.
I would imagine that's very different to working in, yeah, working in Gosport, Hampshire. But yeah, I think he had his share of it. And also he did work in Portsmouth for a big good chunk of it.
So that's where this fire station was. This is like right in sort of like residential area of Portsmouth. So yeah, I think he definitely...
Famously next to a lot of water, which is always good.
Yeah, that is how that works.
Very hard for beaches to set on fire.
Good observation, yeah.
I would have written that in my application.
So yeah, it was sort of like, I think there was sort of like a good sort of doing it. What I always found quite funny was quite a lot of them were out of shape. And I thought, surely you have to be in shape to do this.
Because apparently when you go through like the opening, the entrance exam for it, you have to do some exercises that are like, you have to carry and like roll out a hose in like 20 seconds or something. It's really heavy. And you got to move it really quickly.
And my dad said he barely was able to like do that to even get in. But I get the impression that once people have done that, they're like, right, time to eat like shepherd's pie for like 18 years, basically. And then keeping in shape is kind of optional.
They're just quite, they weren't like, they were gruffer than you'd get in games journalism. But I'd say body shape wise, they were quite similar. So yeah, yeah, it was just a bit of context there for you, Matthew.
Imagine if there was any physical test to become a gaming journalist. It would just be such a different like industry. Like no one, no one who'd have had on this podcast would have made the cut, I don't think.
Brutal. Tomo was in good shape, isn't he? He's sort of like, yeah.
He's sort of like, he got famously, as he told in the podcast, he was not in shape then got in shape.
So yeah, he was on the Batman diet.
Yeah, the rest of us, not so much, but yeah, shots fired at all of our previous guests there.
Kez is not fit, yeah.
Kez is in good shape as well, actually. Kez's Instagram is like a tribute to basically her going to the gym, so yeah. Anyway.
She could do two hoses.
Anything, everything else that was happening this year. I know it was like, honestly, a lot of this year I remember from pop culture, but I do remember the bits and pieces I was studying. So I was doing, I think everyone in the UK, GCSE literature, I have to study Of Mice and Men, right?
John Steinbeck, I was doing a bit of that. And that means I can now enjoy the memes about the tragic death of Lenny.
I like that. That's what this led into. Like, I'm glad that I studied Steinbeck, so I can enjoy the memes, you know.
Speaking of overrated Michael Caine performances, actually, I watched Educating Rita, because we were studying that play this year. That was really boring, actually.
So, him and Julie Walters?
Yeah, yeah, I'm not really interested in, like, one working class woman becoming, I don't know, educated. You know, my mum literally did that. Well, my mum literally did that in real time.
I was like, this is like a busman's holiday for me, studying this, do you know what I mean? Sort of like... Do you think that's the wrong take, Matthew?
No, no, I just... Is that why you also don't like watching Backdraft? Because you're just like, oh, I've seen Kurt Russell eating a shepherd's pie, you know, he needs it.
Yeah, so, yeah, there was that going on in drama, apart from the aforementioned swastika nonsense. We also studied Blue Remembered Hills, which I've taken shots at before on this podcast. Basically just a play where children are played by adults and one of them dies at the end, again, spoiler alert.
So there's a lot of doing bad West Country accents this year, doing that. Can't really remember much else. So sort of like we talked to us before, but I was not as academically successful as you.
I think they always saw it as a bit of a like, well, he'll get a few A's in something, but he'll probably be B's and C's and everything else. Basically things I wasn't interested in, I didn't try at. How did you overcome that as someone who like, I can't imagine you ever gave a shit about maths or science.
How did you get the grades to get into, I guess you only had to get to A-level with the grades, didn't you? So it's not that bad. But I never could have concentrated enough to get an A in maths, for example.
How did you do it?
My dad's quite good at maths, so I've got an okay maths brain, actually. I've got a little bit of that. Science was a bit of a, I just memorized a lot of it.
I didn't really understand it. My grasp of a lot of scientific principles, particularly chemistry, I was fucking terrible at chemistry. I didn't take any of that stuff on at A level at all.
I did English, history, geography, and film studies. You just play to your strengths, basically.
Fair enough. I don't think I was prepared to put the work in. In contrast to Matthew, as previously discussed on this podcast, when it was my time to study for my A levels, instead of putting the games away, I played Dynasty Warriors 3 so much that completely tanked my grades.
If only you had been studying that period of history in one of your exams.
Exactly.
To be open the paper and it's like, please talk about the strategic weaknesses of Lou Bu and you're just like fuck, yes.
Yeah, that's it. It's like who's your favorite steward and I'm like Guan Yu. You know what I mean?
I just wasn't quite there.
You've got it in for the stewards. Stewards come up on this podcast more than any other dynasty.
It's true. They definitely catch some strays. Other things that happened this year, I downloaded MSN Messenger for the first time.
Is that ever a big part of your social life, Matthew? This is my first taste of a social media kind of thing where I'd add like my friend Andrew and then realize that all my other friends were on there. So you could in theory talk to anyone from your school at any time when they're online.
Most of them were online like weeknights. This is where I felt like this year is kind of where that started to happen more. Maybe for other people it was a bit sooner.
But for me, this is where I remember MSN Messenger being a thing people were talking about at school as like an online thing people were all part of. Did that happen to you?
Not really. I was never, no, never. I don't know.
Maybe it's just like a younger person's thing. I've done some sort of form of online chatting, but never as a lifestyle. It was more of a, hey, should we go online and like fuck with some people in a chat room?
Should we pretend to be someone else? That kind of stuff. I think everyone, that's just a routine everyone goes through.
I definitely remember at university, I had a laptop and all the rooms had internet access for the first time. Like, my own internet access. That was pretty rad, because you're just like, holy shit, I, you know, all this internet, I have all the internet finally.
Like, I can't believe it.
Mr. Skin Traffic just fucking skyrocketed. Sorry, that's very vulgar for this podcast.
I actually don't know, like, if, I think people probably lived in fear of the college tracking what you were looking at.
Yeah.
I mean, you'd be like, no chance would you look at something ropey, because just in case, just in case some like ancient Nobel Prize winning professor somehow saw it on a printout.
Yeah, you can only make porn that was produced by alumni of the university.
That look of horror on Oppenheimer's face at the end of Oppenheimer, except he's just looking at all the websites his students have been going to. That's very much the vibe.
Oh, that's so much better response than I could have hoped for from that.
One thing I did have, which was incredibly cursed, was for my laptop, I had this plug-in device, which I could plug a TV aerial in, and then like tune my laptop. My laptop basically double as a TV, but it was like a really old, you know, like having to aim the aerial in different directions to kind of firm up the picture on different channels, terrestrial channels. I guess this is like pre-Freeview and all that kind of stuff, I don't really remember.
I remember thinking this was the coolest thing, I thought, yeah, I'm going to have like TV in my room, you know, people are going to want to like hang out with me because I've got access to TV, but it was just the worst TV experience ever. I don't know if I ever managed to tune in to anything other than Channel 5, so it was just like, do you want to come and watch a really bad reception of Channel 5? That was like my sales pitch under the creepy glare of Edwin's hands.
But with easy access to small cartons of apple juice, Matthew.
Oh yeah.
So, you know, swings and roundabouts.
I definitely gave up on the small cartons of apple juice because college had vending machines, which were like, just to walk across the college quad, you could get there and then, you know, I, yes, I just, I sort of gave up on like individual portions of tiny drinks and just started wolfing down stuff from a vending machine.
A powerful analogy for your blossoming sort of like male sort of like. I don't know where I'll go with this actually. That's powerful stuff, Matthew.
So, yes, I remember actually this was a bit more of a computer year for me, too, because I remember going, I think I was big into emulators around this time because I'd had my sort of like I've become a huge Final Fantasy person over this period of time. So in fact, actually, the best games 2003, the most significant thing I played this year was Final Fantasy VII. This was the year that I played it.
So that was, you know, so that that was happening. I was playing seven, eight and a bit of six as well. I think that was around this time that I got that on PS1 in the background.
So you know, I was shoring up my knowledge to basically to become the future Final Fantasy head that I will become. So that was going on. That was significant.
Downloaded a GBA emulator so I could catch up with some of those games. I remember thinking that was like massive that you could just do that on a computer. Obviously I don't think it's okay.
Just to be clear to emulate, you know, existing sort of like hardware that you can buy software for. I don't think that's what that is for. But you know, at the time I was certainly grateful for it as someone who made 10 pounds a week from his paper round.
And I was also doing a bit of SNES emulation as well. It's the first year I played Chrono Trigger. So I was sort of like becoming aware of what all these Final Fantasy developers had made previously and going down these four and rabbit holes of have you played this?
Did you know that, you know, Sakaguchi made this or, you know, you know what I mean, that kind of thing. So sort of learning about Japanese RPGs, getting more into that. So yeah, start to become a big deal.
I think it's probably a good time to talk about pop culture from this year, Matthew, because this is quite a significant year for a few reasons. So the first two things I'll talk about Return of the King came out this year. So end of Lord of the Rings, which had been the last three episodes we've done in this vein.
Lord of the Rings was to kind of like constant across all of them. And, you know, I think just just from the meme sphere these days, the meme economy of Lord of the Rings, it shows how like it was very much our generation Star Wars in terms of its impact and its lasting impact. Right.
And do you have memories of Return of the King coming out and it being a big deal to you, Matthew? Because I guess you're at Oxford when this happened, right?
Yeah. Yeah. I remember going.
Yeah. Did I go and see it? I must have seen it at university for sure.
I was very like overly invested in it. And I think it does deliver. I think it's an amazing film, but I can remember being very put out by anyone who was sniffy about it in any way, or like joked about how many endings it had and have drawn out at the end because I felt like it undermined what I thought was a really like crucial piece of work.
So that's kind of an indicator of the kind of person I was. I sort of leave Peter Jackson alone, he's entitled to do whatever he wants with it. Yeah, that's me.
Yeah, I mean, I thought it was absolutely amazing. It is Return of the King where they light the beacons across the mountains, right?
I think it is, yeah. Yeah, it must be because that's how the Iskandar are asking for help from romance.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's rad. That's rad as shit that bit.
That's just like, you know, one of a handful of cinema memories of an image where I remember sitting there thinking, this is just absolutely unbelievable. This is so good. That music playing and those torches lighting across the mountains, thinking like, it doesn't get any better than this.
I don't know what it is about that particular image that gets me. It is probably the music, which was just so superb.
What do you make of the Ghost Army and stuff? Do you think that's a little bit sort of like, I feel like that's sort of like a DLC adventure that happens within the film. I know it's in the book, but it's sort of like, it's a bit of a Day Sex Machina kind of thing, isn't it?
Where they're like, oh yeah, I've just bought my Ghost Army tail. But I guess Yen Tsar too as well, in a sense then, you know what I mean?
Yeah, it's just part of it. I mean, you know, I'm not a big Tolkien guy, so I'm not particularly connected to any of it. But I just, yeah, like what a thing, will we ever see the likes of it again?
Just the kind of quality of it and the sort of sincerity of it I really loved. Yeah, it actually reminded me, just mentioning films actually, something else that happened at university. You get, you can join the Oxford Union, which is like the terrible kind of breeding ground for future prime ministers, and the reason a lot of, you know, regular, you know, normal, decent people sign up is because they have excellent guest speakers and you get to see some like just incredible, like big famous talent come there and they tend to kick the ear off with some biggies to kind of get you to sign up and get you invested.
And I remember at the end of our freshers week, so you've, you know, you're away from home and you're just like, Oh my God, life's, you know, this is crazy. You know, this is just so different. You know, it's such a, already such a rich experience.
And the guest speaker was Clint Eastwood. And yeah, right. So I remember sitting there, you know, as being as obsessed with film as I was, we got to watch, yeah, like an early screening of Mystic River.
And then Clint Eastwood was interviewed by Barry Norman. And we're just sitting there thinking like, holy shit, it's Clint Eastwood. And desperately trying to pluck up the courage to ask him a question about working with that orangutan.
Because I thought, oh, that would get a big laugh, you know.
He just goes, sit down, son, or something like that, do you know what I mean? Yeah.
Well, what I do remember about it, and this is an apology to anyone who likes Barry Norman. But this guy stood up to ask a question, and he had a terrible stutter, like he was, I don't know if he was like nervous, but he was really struggling to get his question out to Clint Eastwood. And I remember Barry Norman said, oh, well, I'd, I think if you'd gotten into Oxford University, you'd be able to speak properly.
And everyone was like, boom.
What a thing to say, Barry Norman.
Bloody hell. That's just someone nervous. That'll be what our live show is like.
I'll say something like that and everyone will be like, I'm just nervous.
Barry Norman will stand up and be like, laying into us.
That's amazing.
They're random. I'll just keep dotting these as when they come to me.
No, I do enjoy them. Was that leading to a Oxford Union Lord of the Rings related thing, Matthew?
Well, yeah, it reminded me because I don't think it was 2003. I think this was actually in 2004, but yeah, Sean Astin came and did a talk and we saw him there and then we lined up to get his autograph afterwards and I knocked over his baby daughter with my rucksack. She was just running around the room and I didn't see her and I turned around and it had a bit of swing on it and I just heard this sort of child falling over and was like, Oh God, what have I done?
And then desperately trying to make it look like it wasn't me and anything to do with me. I didn't get into any trouble or anything, but I remember thinking like, please don't let me get thrown out of this signing for knocking over Sean Astin's daughter.
Yeah, when you look her up on Instagram now, she does have like a small Reebok logo sort of pressed on the side of her face.
Well, you see, if you'd been on top of it, Sam, you would have said National Back Pain Association.
Oh yeah, shit! Failed at my own podcast, Lord.
Oh dear.
We have Sean Astin in, that has slightly more sort of like Birmingham Comic Con vibes, do you know what I mean? Like it's sort of like Clint Eastwood and Sean Astin, I would say. I mean, I guess you've got to fill the whole year with stuff, right?
So I mean, I'm not complaining.
Yeah, I mean, Clint Eastwood was probably the most famous person we saw. I think like the week after that it was Chris Eubank.
Real variety there. It's like, yeah, yeah. It's like Jonathan Ross or something, you know what I mean?
The worst one was you get a big book of them at the start of term and you basically flick through and go, oh, yeah, I'm going to see that, that and that. And there was one and it was, it was Damien Lewis. And everyone was, he must have been in something big at the time, maybe Band of Brothers?
Just after Band of Brothers, I think. I think that was O2, maybe?
Yeah, so he was known from this thing and, you know, but maybe it must have been Band of Brothers was the reason we were excited. And so we were like, yes, it's going to be Damien Lewis. And everyone got there and realized it was a different Damien.
It was the author Damien Lewis, who is a historian. And as we were queuing up and it became apparent it wasn't the right Damien Lewis, just loads of us just fucked off out of a queue. Two horrible, rude bastards.
It's like no fame, not interested.
That's amazing. Well, you know what? That was a rich, rich vein of anecdotes, the Oxford Union.
No doubt we'll revisit for more comedy down the line where we get to the 2004 episode. So The Return of the King, Matthew, which was obviously a huge deal. We did a whole Lord of the Rings episode, actually, if you want to hear us talk about that, at the end of 2021, I think it was.
And that includes, I think, Matthew talking about how emotional the flames being lit made him at the time. A beautiful thing. And no doubt we'll end up doing more Lord of the Rings nonsense at some point, maybe on the XL tier.
But so two Matrix sequels came up this year, Matthew. So Wachowski's revisited the universe they created in the, you know, which was already kind of like a classic 1999 sci-fi film, The Matrix. They came back to it and sort of constructed this very elaborate story that built on the original in some ways and was kind of about the idea of the Matrix experiencing this this bug and then uncovering more lore about the Matrix itself and how this is not the first Matrix so have been several before and here's the guy who's or slash program who's actually in charge of the the Matrix being created and all this very complicated stuff which was wrapped up inside some very exciting looking fight scenes, including the burly brawl, which is I think still my favorite hand-to-hand sort of combat sequence from any any film.
I think it's an absolutely amazing creation even if you can really tell where the CG bits are these days. I think the music and the imagery of like a hundred Hugo Weavings swarming on Keanu Reeves. That's like early noughties king shit so I definitely appreciate that.
Was that a huge deal to you? Because I went all in on the Matrix this year that was that was huge. But even though I think Revolutions is massively disappointing and like honestly was so disappointing it just sort of like made my interest in it completely fall out of the bottom and that was kind of the end of it.
But there was a hot moment where Reloaded was coming out, Enter the Matrix is coming out which slotted you know in the middle of these films basically with footage shot just for the game where this was like the biggest thing happening in pop culture. Were you swept up in that as well?
Yeah, definitely to the point where definitely for Reloaded, you know, I thought I liked it a lot more. I saw it like three times at the cinema in about a week. I just kept going back to see it because I really liked it.
I remember we saw it with some friends and then we were at a friend's birthday party the you know the that weekend and halfway through the birthday party I remember a couple of us just going like oh man we really should be rewatching The Matrix Reloaded right now so we just left the party and got on a bus and went to watch it with just the left of those non-plus friends behind. You know in hindsight I would not upset any friends for The Matrix Reloaded or Revolutions. But yeah it was pure hype.
There are good bits in both of them but particularly Reloaded's got so much good stuff in it. The action set piece is just, it wasn't, you could tell that something had like changed for the worst in them though. You know like they were just different moving, different sounding kind of stories.
The first film is just so kind of sort of coherent and contained as a sort of thriller and it's just really clear what's going on and this was just so instantly up its own lore hole that you were like, you know, and it's a real bummer really but...
Yeah, it is, I think that the thing is it just, I think that The Reloaded would be remembered as a good film if Revolutions had paid it off better. I think Reloaded is quite inconsistent, it has that very long sequence of people dancing and lots of nipples being on show which is quite bizarre and a rewatch cut to Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss shagging that might be in there too, there's a lot of very self-indulgent bits whereas, like you say, The Matrix was so, so tight and then it just completely just derailed in Revolutions. But yeah, I mean, that was the thing, the action was consistently great, right?
Like the Shato fight as well, the Shato fight might actually be the best fight in all of those films because I don't think there's any CG in that, I think that is all just practical like, Keanu Reeves with a sword and then like loads of other people attacking him kind of shit, and it's just so, so good. So, okay, so other stuff happened this year, the OC started, huge deal for me, although I didn't watch that till 2004, so didn't happen there, a tiny bit of irony to be saying that. Buffy the Vampire Slayer ended, that was a big moment for me, it was one of the first sort of like proper, I don't know, I don't want to say adult, but you know, like more mature shows I got into, certainly felt more adult by the end of it.
Futurama was cancelled, a bit of a tragedy, I was hugely into Futurama, then they brought it back twice and I started hating it because it got so, so bad. The Last Samurai, I imagine that was your shit, Matthew, I imagine you're a big Last Samurai guy.
Yeah, I like that, you know, always enjoy a bit of cruise.
Yeah, exactly. Part of the Caribbean, that happened this year, that was a huge deal, maybe more, slightly more cursed in retrospect, but that first film is pretty fun, I think it's like a three star fun film, but people lost their minds about it at the time. And speaking of blokes on boats with fake wigs, Master and Commander, which I've never seen, but a lot of dads I know really like it, I'm guessing you like it, Matthew.
Peter Weir doesn't miss, does he?
Oh, you'd like it, it's good. I thought I wouldn't like it because I'm not really into, you know, naval history stuff, but actually it's great, great characters, him and Paul Bettany, a brilliant combo, and it's just really, really coherent, some of it, you know, just makes you really care about it, makes you understand what's going on, you know, what's going on in all those shit battling scenes. It's cool.
Damn, yeah, I got to watch that at some point. I think I've seen so many of Peter Weir's other films and he is just like probably the most underrated of that sort of generation of filmmakers.
I can imagine it really holding up well as well because of the kind of practical nature of like, you know, they had a big boat that they were filming on, you know, it would still look pretty good, I would think.
Which of the Hobbits is in that one? One of them is in it, right? Is it Pippin?
But one of them made it in there, right?
So it's Sean Astin with his daughter running all over the ship while people accidentally conquer her on the head with cannonballs and things.
Yeah, first mate Castle just accidentally bashes her with his satchel, you know, like knocks her off the plank.
Do naval ships have a plank?
Amazing. I wanted to shout out three albums that came out this year, Matthew, that I listened to loads.
Pretend that we're cool enough to talk about music, aren't we?
Oh, I'm definitely not. But this would just tell that this is more about who we are, I guess. But Meteora by Linkin Park came out this year.
Listen to that loads. Not sure that's like a truly great album, but the singles on it were fucking amazing. Numb, for example, Somewhere I Belong, Faint, all very good.
Fallen by Evanescence came out this year. Discussed that before because as mentioned, Hideo Kojima was listening to the 20th anniversary version of this album on his iPhone recently, so great, a big deal. And which tied into the Daredevil movie, a favorite of Matthew's.
And In Time, the best of REM, which is a bit like saying the best of the Beatles, Alan Partridge, kind of favorite album thing. But I had a big REM moment this year because they were on top of the pops too with loads of their live performances. And I just remember having this revelation of, I think I'm like an REM person.
I think this is like really my shit. And it was my shit, Matthew. So that happened.
I think Smallville had a good season this year as well. I think it's a season three year, Matthew. And that was probably as good as Smallville ever got.
So shout out to one of your faves there.
Yeah, well, I was very late to Smallville. You've got to remember. So I watched it.
I watched it in real time.
I watched it all in 2006. When I left university and didn't have a job. I sat at home, oh no, I'm going to save that story for 2006.
We did 2006. Yeah, we did that one. We got 04 and 05 and then we've done this batch basically.
But hey, I mean, that is the story, right? You watch Smallville and we're eating snacks. That's pretty much it.
Yeah. I ate like a huge sack of chocolate fountain chocolate pellets.
Like a like a industrial sack of chocolate pellets. That was intended for a piece of machinery for chocolate fountain and I just it was like, I'll just have a pellet and then you have two pellets and the next thing you know, over the course of the summer, you've watched five seasons of Smallville and eaten like 10 kilogram sack of pellets.
A very glamorous story there. This podcast is basically doubles as a kind of like record of all the damage we've done to our bodies over the years, so I'm glad that sort of sustained somewhere that information. We finally come to some games then, an hour into the podcast, one hour plus.
Basically I've got a rundown of the E3 stuff that's happening this year. Some key events that happen in games straight away. Game Boy Advance SP launches this year, clamshell design, backlight, basically all the things that the original GBA needed.
The original GBA has a great form factor to it. I think everyone agrees on that, but it was so fucking dark. Everyone had that ridiculous light stuck to it so they could even see what was going on.
Needed sorting out and here came the GBA SP, also rechargeable, that's the only thing I've got to say. So huge deal. Still, I think it still really holds up all these years later.
Beautiful looking thing, the GBA SP. Apart from maybe the Mike Tyson version of it they did, Matthew, whatever that was, sort of like the tribal version, whatever that was, less convinced by that. The iToy also happens on PS2 this year and I imagine that sort of thing that our listeners will be like, ah, whatever.
But I mentioned it because I think a lot of the games for this were made in the UK. I think this is quite an important sort of Sony Europe innovation. So I mean, this probably paves the way for the Wii as well.
What do you think about that, Matthew? Is that the chicken and egg situation there?
I don't know. Well, that's giving me a bit too much credit.
I mean, it's a similar thing. It's like simple interactions with quite rudimentary games. That's kind of like what the Wii Sports foundations are.
I mean, like, what is the precursor to Wii Sports if it's not this? I'm genuinely curious.
It has no precursor. It's just a genius. It's a spark of genius in Iwata's head.
Well, it's interesting you say that actually, because the Nintendo at E3 is one of their years where they caught the most criticism. So I don't know if you know this photo that I linked in our document here, Matthew, but there is quite an extended bit of Nintendo's E3 conference where Pac-Man is being played and that Pac-Man that you can connect your GBAs to your GameCube to play was the big announcement from Nintendo that year. Did you know this photo of these games journalist gentlemen reacting in real time to Pac-Man?
Yeah, because it's the pair of photos, right? It's that they're really excited and then they're really non-plussed, right?
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.
And they're like memes now.
Yeah, yeah. I can't remember what they're excited about, but I think the infamous like sad photo is caused by Pac-Man. I will say having watched all three of these conferences back to back, Nintendo's one isn't really any worse than Xbox or Sony's one.
I think actually the funniest thing that happens in Nintendo's one by far is that George Harrison, not that one, from Nintendo of America comes on stage to Beautiful by Snoop Dogg and Pharrell, which is so not his vibe as a middle aged guy in a suit, like sales guy basically. That was so, so funny watching that.
That's what I was going to come on to if we ever do a live podcast.
So that happens. And I think the problem they had is that all their stuff, all their hot stuff had already been revealed ahead of the show, so they had no big new announcements. They had a lot of deep dives on things that already existed.
So that's why this was slammed as a famously bad E3 conference. But like I say, I don't think this is any worse than Sony or Xboxes. I think it's firmly, firmly on a par.
So Wind Waker had given them a boost before this. It released slightly earlier in the year. And I think it powered Nintendo to like the...
I think Game Keep had its best market share in ages. But they don't even compare how the Game Keep is doing with Sony. They just compare it with Xbox.
They know now that that's the kind of plane they're fighting on. And it's quite interesting because there's a Q&A section at the end. And they get some quite spicy questions about, do you think you're still competing on the same plane in terms of mainstream video game consoles?
Or are you content to be a more niche kind of concern? I'm paraphrasing. That's one of the questions they're asked.
And it's just interesting knowing that. And also some of the things that Iwata says about innovation. He just talks a lot about our goal is to innovate in the spaces that we're in.
And that is always our goal. He talks about that in relation to the PSP, which Sony announces at this conference. He talks about innovation in relation to the handheld market.
And we know where that leads. And it leads to a massive success for Nintendo. So that's interesting in retrospect.
I'll fire through this quickly, though. So there was a bit where George Harrison, this is dated. I'm not giving him a hard time because there's genuinely no point trying to cancel people for things that are said in video games two decades ago.
It's just like another country, basically. Donkey Kong will always remain a lovable aid. Link will never lose hope and, of course, Mario will never start shooting hookers.
That's the thing that's said on stage at this conference. Again, not making a big deal about it, but it properly pulls you back in time to hear that. It's like, wow.
That's a record scratch on Beautiful by Snoop Dogg and Pharrell.
That's the kind of thing that they would sing about at this point in time, to be honest. So that's not, well, maybe not Mario specifically. So you have this compilation of Double Dash being there, Pikmin 2, Pokemon Pinball, Ruby and Sapphire, which I played last year.
It was pretty decent, actually. Quite good, those Pokemon Pinball games. WarioWare, Pokemon Colosseum, Mario Advance 4, Billy Hatcher, Matthew's favorite game of all time.
Donkey Kong Country on GBA, which is just a port, obviously. Wario World on GameCube. I'm not really familiar with that game.
Maybe Matthew is. Star Fox Assault. And then there's a massive spotlight for Rebel Strike, which, as established in this podcast previously, is ass because of the on-foot sections.
That's definitive. There's a Resi 4 bit where Shinji Mikami gives a video message wearing sunglasses, followed by one of the various Resi 4 demos. This is the hook hand guy demo.
Do you remember this one, Matthew?
I think you had to have followed the Resi 4 demo scene quite closely to remember all of these bits and pieces. I think I studied them maybe for the Resi episode that we did. This sticks in the memory.
They're getting closer here to Resi 4 being a thing, but obviously it's taking its time. Soul Calibur 2 is here. Obviously that would have a huge Nintendo tie-up with Link appearing in the cast.
There's a really boring bit where EA is on stage talking about The Sims, because there's a GBA GameCube interaction thing. That hijacks the second half of this conference. It's tough.
Then Pac-Man is along. The crowds sound like they're up for it, to be honest, but it's not very exciting, Pac-Man, is it? It definitely wasn't in 2003.
I don't find it exciting now. No offence to you, the listeners, if you do. Twin Snakes is here, and Dennis Dyack, who I know Matthew looks up to a great deal, was here.
The games are good, but they get a lot of flak for them all being announced prior to the show. I think Owata talking about the PSP is a nice bit of foreboding for what would happen between the PS and the PSP. That was good, Matthew.
Any thoughts on Nintendo at this E3?
No, I think one of the reasons I'd slightly tuned out was that at this point I had all the big GameCube games that I had been anticipating. For so long it was Smash Bros, Sunshine, Wind Waker and Metroid Prime, and once you had those there was definitely... Resident Evil 4 was still really exciting, but there was a bit of a small step down in terms of excitement.
So I had less reason to keep on top of it, I think.
Yeah, I think that's fair. I watched it and I thought there was a bunch of decent stuff here. But yeah, I think that it's quite front loaded for GameCube era a little bit.
It's a weird one. I think some of the less expected favourites come towards the end of the generation. But once you get that first blast of Mario, Zelda, Smash Bros out of the way, it's sort of like there's a couple of quiet years there where it almost completely dies off basically as a going concern.
So that happens. But yes. Okay, so Xbox then.
Some really good games, but there's not much that really drives this. I think at this time, Xbox and Sony were very much in the headspace of we push online. Online is our big thing and Xbox were ahead of the game on this, obviously, with Xbox Live.
So there was a lot of pushing that. Doom 3 kicks things off. In general, actually, Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 loomed quite large over the C3.
Both are just sort of shown with real-time demos and shown to the public for the first time. And people are very, very impressed by it. Obviously, that's a kind of like sign that the next generation of something is happening.
So a big deal. And Xbox make a big deal about the fact they have the only console that Doom 3 will run on, because obviously it was a slightly more powerful machine. Project Gotham Racing 2 was there.
Republic Commando was there. Star Wars game that I thought came out in 2005, actually. So there's a little bit of a wait for that one.
A really interesting hero, True Fantasy Online, a doomed MMO from Level 5 that looked really, really cool. To my eye, it looks a bit more like a kind of four-player co-op game or something, but it had the similar sort of like cell-shaded graphics to Dark Chronicle and Dark... Well, not Dark Cloud, but Dark Chronicle and Rogue Galaxy.
So a bit of a parallel track here of where things could have gone for Level 5, Matthew. Were you ever aware of this game?
No, not really. I might, you know, I'm a bit of a late-to-the-party with Level 5. They became exciting for me on DS and that run they had, so I'm not hugely clued into their...
the stuff which kind of kicked them off.
Okay, fair enough. So there's also Breakdown from Namco, which I've talked about on, I think, the XL episode with the backwards compatibility. I think that's actually quite a horrible game, personally.
Like, it is interesting, but a first-person, sort of like, combat game. But it's like... I just play Mirror's Edge.
It's like, if you want that kind of thing, Mirror's Edge is the game you want, basically, I think.
Some people try and convince you it's one of those sevens, but I'm afraid it's one of those fours.
Hard agree, Matthew. Grounded by the Ghoulies, which is one of those very hyped rare games that I don't think totally lived up to people's expectations. I don't actually think it's that bad.
It looked really nice, but it's not really that memorable either. It was quite hard to control because you had to do two sticks combat, if I recall, Matthew. Did you play this a bit when they did the Rare collection?
Yeah. For years, I'd only ever known it as a few static images in the magazine, the reviews of it in Games Master or whatever. It didn't review particularly well.
I remember just thinking, like, oh, well, Rare have kind of biffed it a bit. And then when I finally played it, I didn't really get the appeal. I know that I follow a few people on Twitter who are big Rare heads who will speak very fondly of this and are kind of, you know, think it is a...
I guess it's an example of it. It sort of feels like old Rare. You know, it looks like it could be sort of N64 era Rare, but obviously on better tech and whatnot.
So I can see why there is a nostalgia for it, but I think it's pretty average.
Yeah, I'm just surprised that those people who like Rare haven't been muted by you on Twitter, Matthew. That seems like something you would do, but...
Well, you know, I can't mute everyone. It would just be you and the Back Page pod account.
Yeah, and Catherine and no one else.
No, I'm muted, Catherine. Xbox Music Mixer is there. Jay Allard says something about how the music they played at the head of the conference is made using this music mixing thing.
I think this is like around the time, I forgot this happened. There was a big sort of like, look what else your console can do push going on with the various sort of manufacturers that obviously led to the PS3 era being what it was in some respects. And it ends with the most famous slice of Halo gameplay in the series history, the E3 2003 Halo 2 demo, a real time demo set in the new Mombasa city in Kenya in basically like this vast metropolis.
People who know Halo will remember this really well. Have you seen this at some point, Matthew? We've definitely talked about this in the pod before, probably on that Halo episode we did.
Yeah, I've definitely seen it. But yeah, were you instantly excited?
I never saw this until after the fact. And then I ended up reading about how it was basically a bullshit demo because they were so far behind on developing Halo, but Microsoft really wanted something there. And apparently they did some stream a few years ago where they saw if they could break it.
What's interesting about it is how it's very guided in the way that games like Call of Duty would become sort of like guided, these more cinematic FPS where like people are talking to you and the cameras resting on them and that sort of thing. It's like that, but Halo is not like that. So in some ways, I think it's like this Call of Duty-esque slice of what Halo could have been.
And so it means you get these very dazzling set pieces, but they're not set pieces you have a huge role in necessarily. It's sort of like it's just, yeah, it's a very guided hand, very un-Halo. So it's an interesting artifact in retrospect.
And I don't know, I don't think it's like, I don't think this casts as long of a shadow as some of the YouTube commenters think it does. I think Halo 2, the beginning of the campaign, is perfectly fine. So yes.
Sony then. I thought this was quite a boring conference, honestly. I think it's just that thing of they know they've won.
And Kata Rai even says that basically. He dunks on Xbox and GameCube and says, There's a place you can find the other video games consoles, and that's in the rearview mirror. I think that's a reference to some ad campaign that was going on at the time.
51 million PS2 sold, so massive deal. To be honest, they probably won it with these two beats at the start. The next instalment of GTA was revealed as a PS2 exclusive, and the same was true for MGS3.
Obviously, that GTA would be San Andreas. I'm sure we'll talk about that in a future episode. Then it's time for Sony to shine with Rise to Honor starring Jet Li, which some people might tell you is one of those Sixers.
I think this is like a third-person fighting game. It used Jet Li's likeness, and it was like a, I guess, martial arts action you might expect with a character based on him. Then I think it had 360-degree analog stick combat control, something like that.
It's a nice looking thing, but I think a lot of these Sony in-house games from the PS2 era just weren't that memorable. Sony were driven just so much by the platforming icons they had, definitely, like Jack and Ratchet, fine. The rest of the stuff they had was not really like classic material, so yeah, it was a lot of GTA, MGS driving things.
That said, Gran Turismo 4 is here. That is a huge deal for Sony, obviously. There's a bunch of Itoy demo stuff here, which I skipped past quite quickly, as you might expect.
Lots of PS2 online stuff, including FF11, which you'd need a hard drive to play on your PS2, but did come out in North America. Syphon Filter and Megastring, which was hated by critics. There's another really boring EA bit.
Just a bit of a snooze from me, honestly. Not my sort of thing. So it's like 10 minutes of GT4 cars and 15 minutes of sports chat.
I don't know who that's for, honestly. It's just not the same thing as having Kojima come on stage and delivering the most preposterous MGS2 trailer you've ever seen that goes on for 14 minutes.
Yeah, but all the sports guys are watching that going like, what's this boring shit in the jungle? Show us a football.
Show us a football. Yeah, so it does end with something good though. This is like a big revelation at the time.
Ken Kutaragi is unleashed to sell the PSP. He also unveils the UMD. They don't actually show the PSP, they just talk about it.
The goal of the UMD was to prevent piracy. Shame that didn't really work out the way they wanted it to. Kind of the opposite, unfortunately.
And they call the PSP the Walkman of the 21st century, which is a great tagline. I don't know how true that is. It's more like the mini disc of the 21st century, really, wasn't it?
The PSP.
It was sort of like, that's probably slightly more comparable. Maybe the Vita is the mini disc, but either way. So that was that, Matthew.
Any thoughts on the Sony or Xbox presences there?
No, a lot of this sort of passed me by, like I said, absorbed it via osmosis or maybe like picking up my brother's official PlayStation 2 magazines. Yeah, kind of a weird period. I'm beginning to wonder if actually like tuning out of games a little bit this year is less to do with A levels and going to university and more just games.
Games didn't really have the stuff at this particular point in time or what was coming down the line and what was next wasn't quite as appealing. You know, GTA and MGS3 aside.
Yeah, that is the thing that's worth saying actually is that MGS3 did have a presence here. It just wasn't at Sony's conference. At least I don't believe it was.
It wasn't in the live stream I watched, but this is quite a cool trailer. Like it's a lot of snake not really saying anything and then lots of rad shit happening in a jungle. And then there's like the bit we talked about in this podcast before or I've talked about.
There's like a GTA reference where snakes in the jungle is going to take this bike from this guy and the bloke goes, this is no Vice City. It's quite good. It's sort of like sells MGS3 as something it's not really, which is kind of like a bit more of a survival game where you make your way through the jungle and stuff.
And even though it does have many of the environments that you'd know from the game, it sort of sells something slightly different to what you get from MGS3, I think, which, as we discussed on that pod we did, it's kind of the version of it you really want, you know what I mean? You get as much of that as you really need, and it doesn't overpower the game. It still remains MGS, so they found the right balance in the end, but that was another notable trailer.
I wanted a name check there, Matthew. So, after all that waffle, we can finally take a break, Matthew, and come back with our two top 10 lists of the best games from 2003. So let's take a quick break.
So, The Best Games of 2003. If you are listening to this now and you skipped the previous bit because you didn't want to load a waffle, then welcome to the list. This is a perfectly normal podcast that you're listening to.
Yeah, for once, I'm going to put a timestamp in the description for people to skip the preamble if they don't fancy it. So yes, we'll see how that goes down. Yes, okay.
So Matthew, we've got two top 10 lists here. As ever, we count down from 10 to one. Whoever's got a game, if we have two people who...
Oh my God, every time.
I struggle with this every time. If two people have picked the same game, if we've both picked the same game, two people, what the fuck am I talking about? We both picked the same game.
Talk about it when we get to its highest placement in the list. Did it, finally got there. Matthew, what's your number 10?
My number 10 is Call of Duty.
Ah, not on my list.
It's kind of hard to rewind the clock to when Call of Duty wasn't what it is now, which is this just vast thing and was the kind of strange almost spin-off of Medal of Honor. Allied Assault, the kind of team behind that, famously left EA to make this and covers a lot of the same ground. That was the quite strange thing about this.
Like both games leaned quite heavily into like D-Day landings. What I loved about Call of Duty and I think what it had back then, which it kind of continues to have now, or maybe to a lesser degree, is a real eye for just the extreme kind of messy chaos, violence of war. You know, Medal of Honor Allied Assault had some of that too, but they're always sort of tinged, a lot of these World War II games are sort of tinged with the nostalgia of like, we're honouring this by showing you this.
And some of that comes from like, the Band of Brothers saving Private Ryan kind of thing of like, you know, these are true stories. There's something very kind of respectful about it. And I completely get that.
And, you know, Call of Duty has a little bit of that too. But I always thought Call of Duty's main thing was like, holy shit, isn't this terrifying? This is like a nightmare, very visceral experience.
And was slightly less rose tinted about the whole thing. And has been that with the kind of ugly side of some of the things you see in their games. I thought it felt really dynamic back then, what they were doing with other sort of AI companions, just the illusion that you were with people and moving as a group, which is, you know, continues to be a big Call of Duty thing.
The kind of very sort of scripted set pieces where you feel like all this stuff is happening, you know, together. You know, I think they often get not enough love for, you know, how difficult it is to kind of have people behave like that and have all these kind of clockwork sequences work the way they do. Also, the kind of shifting perspectives was already there.
This jump between American, British and Russian campaign. There were three kind of campaigns either way, and it showed you the very different battlefields and the different experiences of war that different levels of technology would have. And that's kind of also true of Call of Duty all the way through.
Like, it's always been a game which will jump to the most exciting perspective at any given time. Like, that is one of its big cinematic tricks. And I just thought there was a lot of that here already from day one.
Maybe it doesn't have the real obnoxious excesses of it. And you know, maybe it is as the series slips into modern warfare that some of those excesses become more questionable because, you know, you're glamourising something which is just so relevant and prevalent on TV. But here, I thought they struck that tone quite well.
And I thought it was just really, really exciting and looked fucking great on PC, really.
Yeah, I think that my memories of this game are overpowered by Call of Duty 2. I think that, so I think I only played this for the first time when they launched it as Call of Duty Classic on the PS3 and 360. So that was when I first came to it.
I think there's something very specific to this World War II era of this series, you know, pre the sort of explosive success of this series, that is like has one foot in like Medal of Honor and then one foot in the future, which is that, you know, that step forward towards like that more cinematic. That thing like you said, like you say about how cutting to the most exciting perspective at any one time, right, is the sort of like feeling of what a level is in an FPS. It's sort of like is changing with this series, you know, and does change.
It's not just like a map. It's like it's a series of story moments and beats, right? It's just very carefully thought out.
And I think I agree that like the sheer population factor of COD was a massive part of its appeal early on, the idea that you were fighting with other people, that they were there with you. And it just felt quite obviously hugely significant. This starts this year.
This is the beginning of games changing forever. So an important moment. Yeah, so Call of Duty, good pick, Matthew.
Good pick. You're still playing PC games at this time, then?
Yeah, yeah, we still had a pretty good PC. Yeah, I think I probably played this over the summer holidays. It still coincides with working at home base and having a bit of money to spend on video games.
I mean, that would quickly dry up when you go to university and realize you suddenly have like your whole life to take care of. So I kind of stopped buying games as much once I was at university.
Okay, from dizzing highs to terrifying lows, we come to my number 10, which is True Crime Streets of LA.
Right.
Now, I can't tell the story of my 2003 in games without putting this here. So earlier when I mentioned there were two games I would read about in every single magazine that talked about them, True Crime was one of those games along with Final Fantasy X-2. I was fixated on it because, as previously discussed in the podcast, my parents would not buy me Vice City, but I knew this was rated 15 and therefore I could go and buy it myself.
And I did also like the idea that I think that my main problem with GTA, and I think a lot of people had this problem too, was just that the aiming, the shooting was just too haphazard and complicated and not up to scratch. And third-person combat in general at this time was a little bit shaky, but GTA was way off of where it needed to be. And obviously GTA would get better at that in the HD generation, but it was a lingering flaw.
True Crime promised to cross the combat of Max Payne with the kind of open-world action of GTA. And that seemed enormously appealing to me. A lot of kind of like slow-mo, you had sort of like shooting sequences, these kind of like martial arts, like melee combat sequences, and driving bits where you could shoot your guns out of the car as well.
So it was kind of doing this stuff that GTA wasn't doing yet. It was trying to sort of like push those things along. What I didn't count on when it released was how unvarnished an attempt at doing that it would be.
It was a proper sort of like, I guess a map is absolutely gigantic. It is, I think, it was faithful in theory to like what Los Angeles is like, but you have very few landmarks. It's this endless morass you're driving through.
It's not evocative in the way that a GTA open world is evocative. It's a bit like going through a really early version of like Google Earth, where there just isn't enough detail to really make it worth your while. Yet, I still found it incredibly appealing.
I still played a whole bunch of it. I did think that while they were sort of like not perfect, the melee and gun combat was pretty decent for the time. It wasn't bad.
The story was quite naff despite them roping in some big voice talent like Christopher Walken to sort of like, I guess, give it a boost, a bit of a marketing push. But I must admit it was a fixation of mine at the time. I just love the idea of a game that was set in a city that GTA hadn't done yet, although would do the next year.
And they had an attempt. An attempt was made, Matthew, and at 15 I was exactly the right age for this game to hit me. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, any game that was GTA-esque or promising to bring more GTA-style, you know, fun into the world was an exciting thing. Just the most desirable genre around. And yeah, like, you know, magazines have a lot to answer for in building up to the hype for this one.
So remember, you know, when you look at just screenshots of it or you read about all the, you know, it's going to have the gunplay of Max Payne or whatever, it's going to be like playing The Matrix. You're like, well, obviously, that's going to be amazing GTA with the combat from The Matrix. Can't wait.
But I only played this very recently when we did the open world GTA clones trial with Jeremy. And it was like, it was pretty rough, pretty, pretty hard work, I thought. But then I kind of knew that because I remember it didn't review particularly well.
Like, this would have been one of those ones where the reviews were like, it wasn't so great. Like, high 67 maybe. And you're still like, well, maybe I will like it to the tune of 10 out of 10, so I'll still get it.
Yeah.
A classic kind of no, no, I believe in it.
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Like, that's sort of like, it's 77 on Metacritic, and so it got sevens of the time.
I think that's about right for the time, but with time, yeah, it's not like this is an open world game that's like a cult favourite or anything, you know? It's sort of like, you basically, you played this once, or you didn't play at all, and that's fine, you know? Like, no one out there, no one sensible is out there saying, oh, this is like, I bet there's a YouTube thumbnail that says this is like, GTA on PS2 but better, or like, the GTA you never played.
GTA Killer?
Yeah, exactly, something like that, but it definitely wasn't. The other game that came out this year in this vein was also The Simpsons Hit and Run, which is sort of a narrow gap between which 6 out of 10 open world games should go into this list, and the one that's got The Simpsons in it, you might argue, should be in there. But I actually think that game had more problems than this does.
So, yeah, but I did also, I want to be sincere with how we tell these, I don't want to just be very arranged depictions of the year that are just like, well, these were the definitive 10 best games of 2003, because that's a pointless exercise, you can just go read that anywhere, I'm sure. But, yeah, so I wanted to be truthful to myself. This is the only game that I know is bad that I've put on my list, but yeah.
It's a tribute to my 15 year old self, thinking, watching the DVD that came with the anniversary issue of Games Master that had some b-roll of this on it and thinking, that is the best looking thing I've ever seen. I've never been more excited about a piece of media. So there is Matthew.
What's your number nine?
My number nine is Castlevania, Aria of Sorrow, a GBA game that, again, kind of came to a bit later, the most, the time I properly played through it was actually when they released the Advanced Collection on Switch, whatever it is, a couple of years ago. This was the third and best of the GBA games. I think by this point they just ironed out the kinks.
The first one you couldn't see because it was too dark on the screen. The second one had this like dual castle setup which was just a bit of a bore. This one is a Igarashi produced Castlevania and it feels like they just kind of tap into what made Symphony of the Night great again.
And, you know, there are some people who would say this is like, you know, one of the best if not the best 2D Castlevanias. I think I slightly prefer Dawn of Sauron DS to it. But, yeah, like very Castle dense with secrets, slightly different settings, a little bit more set in the future with Soma Cruz, I think is the character, has this sort of soul system where all the enemies you kill, you can kind of absorb their souls and you get like a weapon or ability from them.
So it's got like a huge amount of like builds and attack variety and, you know, every bit of progress you make in this castle, you're unlocking stuff which can help change how the character behaves. So, you know, it's just constantly, constantly evolving, really fast moving for a Metroidvania, but full of like secrets to discover and walls to smash up and just to see how that map kind of connects is always really, really satisfying. So, you know, not a particularly kind of spicy take on Castlevania, but you know, it's sometimes hard to sort of see the divide between like the truly great ones and the just average ones.
But I just think that that like that soul system, that variety, that's something that they really kind of kept leaning into throughout the DS period was like, you know, the idea of a kind of character who could really make your own and sort of turn the enemies against them. And so all that enemy variety becomes kind of a customization promise, which is really exciting. Yes, just an extremely good hang in it and a good sign of like a series which was going to be pretty strong for the next few years.
Yeah, these are beautiful looking games as well. I'm sort of not massively familiar with the delineations between them until you discuss them on this podcast. Then I'm like, okay, I understand why that one's good or why that DS one is, you know, not high in your estimations, but yeah, it's cool that you've gone back and filled the gaps in this.
Do you think you're a bit of a Castlevania authority, Matthew? I feel like you've got...
No, absolutely not. No, like I'm okay on these, this particular, you know, like the naughties, I guess 2D Castlevania's, but like the NES ones are quite a bad hang to me and I'm not brilliantly clued in on all like the weird variations, like all the, you know, I can't even name them, but like all the things which aren't necessarily called Castlevania, but are Castlevania, I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on those, but in terms of like modern Castlevania's that you can kind of pick up and play now, I think I might, you know, I think I could give you a relatively good steer.
Yeah, there's that whole kind of like batch of things in the Castlevania series labeled other in my head where they have names like Dracula X Castle, Colognevania, and it's just on PC Engine. I know it's not a real game, but it's that kind of like vein of thing, you know what I mean? Like it's, yeah, there's, it's a vast series, there's a lot to it.
So let's say they were all on like, you know, PC Engine and things like that. And they're like, I'm not even gonna pretend, I'm not gonna pretend that I understand those things. I've definitely written Castlevania explainers for the Retro Section of NGamer, where I have picked all this stuff apart.
So at one point I understood it, but it has left my brain because, you know, I was like, do I remember Castlevania Rondo of Blood? Or do I remember the plot of Charles Dickens, our mutual friend? Like something has to go, you know?
Fair. Yeah, that is how this these things work. That's why I've deleted French from my memory, but retain GamesCourt related information.
So that's tough for me. OK, my number nine is Deus Ex Invisible War. Some might say a controversial pick because this is the most disliked Deus Ex game other than the mobile one they put on other platforms.
No one likes that one, I don't think. But yes, so put this here because this is my first Deus Ex based experience. I actually bought this in 2004.
So it's a slight slight fib on what I was playing at the time. I bought it when it was like 10 quid on play.com or something because it had reviewed well. It had scored very well from the same outlets who had praised the original, including PC Gamer.
It was another Kieran Gillum review from Invisible War. So it was on my radar as something that was worth checking out. I don't know if I was even really aware of the controversy about this at the time.
So original Deus Ex comes along in 2000. It's this vast immersive sim where each level is kind of a sandbox where you sort of like these huge environments built out of these very familiar, these tile sets you become very familiar with. And there's a lot of like possibility within that space and different ways the story can play out.
And they never bring it to console other than a PS2 port of the original Deus Ex that has loads and loads of loading screens to account for that that vast space. So what were like seamless spaces on PC in 2000 are spaces with loading screens on PS2. So quite a different experience.
It mostly retains like what is good about it. But it's just the original Deus Ex on PC is such a purely PC based experience that it was it feels like it was made with no compromises. Deus Ex Invisible War very much made with compromises, the scale of it is shrunk right down.
It's basically a world ball down to a series of corridors. That said, as a first taste of Deus Ex, it actually did pique my imagination. I think it was it was just I think the problem with this game is it if it was badged as a spinoff made for consoles, and it didn't come to PC, it would be received quite differently than it has been as basically like Deus Ex 2, which is how it was perceived.
I think this the difference in scale for PC players was just too much for them to really kind of put up with. But I think on console, it's at a scale that kind of makes sense. And because I played this on the original Xbox, I didn't really have a problem with the scale of it when I first played it.
Yeah, it boils down a few systems to make them a bit simpler for console players. But I found it still had a lot of the kind of like choice base sort of mechanics that made it significant or like ways in which you could like move a dumpster to climb across a fence and interact with the environment the way you want to. And even if they did boil down like the city of Cairo to like five rooms or whatever, which is kind of what they they end up doing with a lot of the settings in this game.
I still think it's still pretty good. I think the plot is a tiny bit straight to VHS because you don't play as JC. Denton in this.
You are kind of like following in the footsteps of of Denton. And then it kind of takes at the very end of the game, they take you back to the start of where Deus Ex is set on Liberty Island. So you have the statue and then you have these these different factions who are kind of like vying for your approval who you decide which one to help.
You can kind of hit all three in succession if you want to see the different endings. It's quite simple to do. But I sort of liked it as my first taste of what an immersive sim was.
That's really what this was for me other than a demo of Thief. The original Thief I played like years earlier was terrible at because I was 10 years old and that's not a game made for 10 year olds. This was absolutely fine.
And I think probably a necessary step towards these games coming to consoles eventually as they would. And you kind of need this and the original Deus Ex to exist to get to Human Revolution a bit, I think, because there are compromises in Human Revolution. They're definitely there.
They never do the scale of Deus Ex again. So yeah, a little bit of a ramble there, Matthew, but that's why I think Invisible War is still kind of worth discussing.
Yeah, I won't argue on that. I had this and played this on PC and thought it was not like a life changing thing. I wouldn't say I've had a life changing experience with the original Deus Ex either, particularly.
It's a thing I admire from afar rather than have a lived in obsession. But I think the original was better than this, I will say. But this is still clearly the work of very intelligent people with interesting ideas, whether that's story ideas, consequence ideas, the immersive sim ideas, or just some sort of quite radical design changes.
It's a game with a lot of decisions, not just like moral decisions, but like a lot of decisions have been made about direction, they want to take certain things. And yeah, like, it's nothing if not interesting.
Yeah, and like, I think it's not afraid to be quite narratively complex as well. It piles on like a load of like a load more conspiracy based stuff. And there is this sort of like push and pull between like, Majestic 12, this one organization, and they're in the original game as well.
And then like, yeah, then the Illuminati as well. And there's like this whole thing that JC Denton like basically caused at the end of the first game, and in one of the endings that is called like the collapse. And so that means that there's a little bit of like, I think like it starts with a terrorist attack this game.
And so it's quite off the off the time. Yeah, it's like a terrorist attack on Chicago by the Knights Templar. I do remember like there being a kind of like an explosion that kicks things off.
And so, yeah, it's, it's sort of like, it's not afraid to be complex in that respect. But I can see why if you played Deus Ex First, this would be really hard to kind of get on with as someone who played this first. It's sort of like, it was weirdly the right way to experience the series, I think.
So, yeah, that's where I'm at with that one. What's your number eight, Matthew?
My number eight is WarioWare Inc. for Game Boy Advance.
Higher on my list.
Oh.
Yep. So we come to my number eight, which is Star Wars Jedi Academy. Is this on your list?
It isn't.
Was Jedi Outcast on your list when we did that? Yeah, I can't remember.
That is the one I played and liked.
Yeah, so Jedi Academy is a weird one in the sense that, okay, first of all, I've not put Kotor on my list. Have you, Matthew?
I haven't, no.
No, and like, I respect Kotor, but I don't love it, I would say, is my stance with that one. Having played it more recently on Switch for about 25 hours or so, and getting further than I had done previously and properly getting into it, I still only really respect it rather than love it. That combat system is not my kind of combat, and even though I respect the way they've like captured that particular Star Wars era setting and the sort of like the stakes that they establish and some of the side characters being really good, I just don't love it.
But I love the fucking lightsaber combat in these this generation of Jedi games. So I still wanted to give this a shout out. I also think this has, despite having a worse storyline than Jedi Outcast, I think it does have slightly better levels overall in terms of how you can use the different force powers, like the scale of some of the levels is huge.
And it's, yeah, I think even though the story kind of like misfires a little bit by making you play as this player created character rather than Kyle Katarn like they did originally, I think that the idea being that they want to give you some flexibility on how the story plays out, it does branch based on what you do. And I think you can play any of the missions in order or something like that. It's a lot more free form.
I think that means it has a little bit less heft narratively to me, like I don't think it's particularly memorable, memorable story in Jedi Academy. The lightsaber and force power stuff just got pushed even further. And it was such a great formula that basically begins and ends with these two games that Jedi Academy is a Star Wars game from this year wanted to give a shout out and in general, just to flag that what an amazing year for Star Wars games to get these two in the same year, a year that has no Star Wars movies in it.
We were just swimming in them at some point at one point, Matthew. Thoughts on this pick?
Yeah, I haven't played it. So yeah, it kind of passed you by. I don't know why, because I loved the one before it.
And I think you're absolutely right about the lightsaber and force powers. You know, I've said this a billion times on this podcast, but there were just certain ideas you dreamed of games really nailing. And they were one of them.
And this was one of the games that did it. I did like Kotor. I'm not dismissing it.
It was on my long list, because because I played loads of it. But it was a little sort of finicky and I never truly loved it.
Yeah, I think that's fair. And like there's, I think it just takes it takes mass effect for me to fall in love with that kind of Bioware experience a bit more. I know that's a terrible unpurest thing to say.
Heathen rather. Heathen unpurest. Heathen makes more sense.
But I think it just, it just has a lot of the same stuff in it. But it's just packaged up in this way that was very playing with a controller kind of friendly. And Koto is not afraid to be quite hardcore, which is which is definitely one of its strengths.
But yeah, I don't know, it was.
It's Koto's opening stretch isn't particularly great, I don't think.
No, quite infamously so, right? I think there are lots that take out the Taris, the first planet. So yeah, and that other that first guy you get, I can't remember his name now.
The first companion is like the worst companion you get in the game as well, so.
Jin Rod Dongnax.
Yeah, it has a tough time. So yeah. Okay, so that's that is my number eight.
So what's your number seven, Matthew?
My number seven is Skies of Arcadia Legends.
Not on my list, but I don't think I realised you played this.
Yeah, I did play it. My great regret, GameCube regret, is that I had this game and then I traded it in for like fuck all without realising that it would become incredibly difficult to ever find again and basically never ever get released again. This is kind of it as far as I know for Skies of Arcadia.
Yeah. So that sucks. But this was the GameCube port of the Dreamcast JRPG.
Has like a little bit of the sort of sort of Xenoblade, sort of Xenoguise vibe to it in that I guess more Xenoguise in that you're sort of living in this sort of sky world and everyone's flying around in these sky ships with all these floating islands. You know, you get off your ship and you explore dungeons and you do this sort of turn based battling there which is all very trad. But then you also have battling between the flying naval ships and it's got like quite a unique system which is almost like it's almost a little bit like battleship seeing that you're kind of predict.
This is how I remember it because as I said, trade in haven't played in many, many years. You are trying to kind of guess how they were going to attack you and then kind of plan your attacks around that and you kind of place them on this grid. That's how I remember it.
If anyone out here listening to this is a huge Arcadia head and that's wrong, I apologize. But, you know, like Xenogears has the on foot stuff and then it also has the mechs, you know, that's I'm quite into that as a mechanic. I think that's fun.
I just thought it had a really like wide eyed sense of sort of daring do, you know, these three good kind of piratey chums going around, you know, racing against an evil empire to find six magical moonstones or something. You know, pretty, pretty broad stuff. I don't think this is like, you know, one of those JRPGs that like necessarily move the needle in terms of like very sophisticated storytelling, you know, or particularly like deep issues or deep psychologies.
But, you know, just a very fun, chunky, I mean, the kind of Sega JRPG, what you'd imagine that would be. It's like very bright and fun and playful and, yeah, just had an extremely good hang. And you feel like, will this ever come back?
Is there enough love for it? Is it well known enough for like Sega to ever throw, you know, money behind, like you see them doing this project where they're returning to all these other games and, you know, breaks your heart to see, yeah, another fucking shitty Golden Axe game when you're like, come on, just give us an HD port of this or remake this. This is more interesting.
Try and serve more of the audience rather than that kind of old crap.
Well, it is interesting because this, like the idea of Sega being synonymous with, but there's a particular strand of Sega RPG, right, that comes along. And it's like, it's so separate from everything else they make. Like, Overworks is the, I think, the part of AM1 that was working on this.
And I think Sakura Wars was also a series that was happening around this time. It's like basically like a mix of visual novel, dating sim and tactical role playing. So just the idea, I sort of like wish this side of Sega had survived the, survived the transition from, you know, Dreamcast to them becoming a third party publisher.
Maybe like Valkyria Chronicles is arguably where that DNA sort of ends up. But, you know, either way, this is, you know, like you say, there's something so specifically Dreamcast era about the way this looks.
It's very breezy. That's the thing. It looks like it's made out of, you know, like power stone assets or something, you know, it's kind of those chunky little like blocky arms.
Yeah, this was like once intended to be like a light gun game in like Japanese arcades, kind of like a vibe.
Yeah, I think the best we can hope for is that one day this will be, the whole of this game will be playable as a mini game in a Yakuza game. Like fucking Ichiban in Like a Dragon 3 will be, oh guys, I've got a Dreamcast or even better Gamecube because this version is like the definitive version. And come round to my house and then you and Namba can play all of Skies of Arcadia Legends.
What is the most RPG like game they've put into one of those games of them games in the Like a Dragon series?
Are there any RPGs on the Master System in Judgment? I didn't really get too deep into the Master System stuff because I'm not a... it would surprise you to hear this that I'm not a Master System guy.
Probably the main reason Ash buys those games, I would imagine, is to experience those.
They have some like... I don't know, it feels like they dig into the kind of arcades more, but like the Judgment definitely had the home console element of it. You know, you feel like one of these days they'll just go, ah, what the hell, this should really have this in it.
Yeah, maybe there's some other reason they can't bring this out though, like how it's speculated that Jet Set Radio Future has music licensing stuff that stops it from being re-released, because Sega seem pretty good about getting this stuff back onto the market. That's it, this generation of stuff.
Yeah, but what could possibly be in this that like ties to... you know, it's a fantasy thing. Oh, sorry, I forgot, one of the party members is Sarah Michelle Geller.
It's just her as herself.
Yeah, it's a good point, actually, because I mean, you wouldn't think these are harder to unpick than Shenmue, for example, and they managed to do that. So, yeah, I don't know, it's a weird one. But yeah, this game's reputation has remained evergreen.
There's still that portion of like deranged internet person who talks about Skies of Arcadia whenever a Nintendo Direct happens. And it's like, what are you talking about? But I wish you the best, you know?
Yeah, it is mad that like, you know, you can play Bat and Kytos again, but not like this, you know?
Well, that's because that's Namco, right?
Oh, yeah, but in terms of like levels of fame, I'd say Skies of Arcadia, you know, I would have thought would have had the similar level of pool. It's fair.
Like, if Clanoa can come back and, you know, Bat and Kytos can, then yeah, I kind of agree with you there. Okay, Matthew, that's a good pick though. I may play it on my HDMI equipped Dreamcast and talk about it in a future episode.
Okay, so my number seven is Panzer Dragoon Auto on Xbox, the only Panzer Dragoon game I've played. You're on a big dragon, you're on rails, and you point the stick from side to side, shooting lots of enemies that come towards you while going through these very gorgeous looking levels. So that is basically all you do in this game.
There's not loads more to it than that, but it is a gorgeous looking shooter that I think is a few years ahead of what Xbox games from the time looked like at this point. It is a very, very shiny looking thing. You can play it on Xbox Series X and S as well, so it's been future-proofed, which is great.
A really nice, I guess a bit like Skies of Arcadia Legends, a bit of a positive gains, I guess, out of what happened to Sega at the end of that Dreamcast generation, is that you end up with these quite exquisite versions of different Sega games landing on different platforms. I don't think the Xbox got a good blast of those. This is probably the peak of that.
So yeah, Panzer Dragoon Auto. I don't have loads more to say about it, because it is just so simple. You really are on rails, on a dragon, shooting down successively larger and larger enemies.
And it just looks amazing unleashing a variety of dazzling looking attacks. Thoughts on this one, Matthew?
Yeah, have I played this? I think I may have just played that slightly rubbish Kinect one.
Oh, that's actually way worse than this. Crimson Dragon. I reviewed that as well, and it's pretty poor.
This is several steps ahead. I guess the Kinect part of it is probably part of why that doesn't work quite as well. Either way, this is a pretty dyed-in-the-wall, hardcore shooter that happened to be available for Xbox.
One of the more unusual bits and pieces in the Xbox back catalog that's worth checking out.
Did you say you can play it now?
Yeah, so you can just buy it for like 10 quid or something. You can play it on any of the modern Xboxes. It's nice that it's been salvaged.
I think it runs at 60 FPS. I think it did at the time.
I wouldn't play it otherwise.
It's a very swish looking game anyway. I recommend it at some point. I think this is your best shot at understanding why people go bananas over this series.
Because otherwise it's a bit trapped on the Saturn as a series. This is kind of like its one touch point to the modern age. So yeah, we're still recommended.
What's your number six, Matthew?
Manhunt.
Not on my list. Never played it.
It's really grotty, this game. You know, famously people aren't familiar with it. Because there was a time this was like all anyone really talked about in games magazines, it felt like, because it was so shocking.
But now it seems to have disappeared a bit. Rockstar game, a kind of survival horror of a sorts. You're a convict who's meant to be put to death, but instead of being executed, you wake up and you're in this kind of evil game show run by Brian Cox, of succession fame rather than BBC Physics fame.
And he's kind of telling you to kill people in these dilapidated arenas. It's kind of a snuff film game show that you're part of, where you're rewarded for executing people as horribly as possible. This isn't like a zany mad world, if that's how it sounds from that description.
It's more about, you're creeping around, these people are just there to murder you. You're trying to sneak up behind them and kill them with various bricks and shopping bags and baseball bats, hammers, whatever you've got to hand. And it has this mechanic where the longer you hold an attack before you unleash it on these unsuspecting guards, the more violent the move is.
So the risk reward mechanic is to get the kind of bloodlust of the audience going and to succeed at the sort of snuff film element of it. You want to try and kill these people as violently as possible, but that means holding your nerve. Like, are they going to turn around and see you standing there with this carrier bag?
But it was the, I would say the realism, but the more kind of like domestic element of its arsenal, I think got this sort of notoriety because, you know, the image of it, the famous image of it is like strangling a man in a plastic carrier bag and his face straining against it. And the idea that the better you were at the game, the more violent, the more unpleasant, like the nastiest death animations were the reward for like holding your nerve. And it just has the, has the feel and vibe of something illicit, or, you know, of a video and nasty.
I think Rockstar were probably delighted that it got, like the mainstream presses sort of heckles up about like, oh my God, this thing is, you know, so sordid, so unpleasant. Like it was, you know, about as bad an advert for like what video games were. Or it's exactly what people, you know, kind of pearl clutching Daily Mail readers thought video games were.
And it really let into that. But the shock factor of it aside, and like with Rockstar, there's always that sense of they kind of gleefully leaning into it. And there's, there's a slight kind of silly, you know, there's like a dumb element to a lot of the shock in their games.
I think this is one of the only times they've really landed something that felt like truly dark and horrible. You know, I think there's stuff, you know, there's stuff people complain about in like GTA V with like the FBI torture or the CIA torture or whatever it is. That's incredibly cartoonish to this game about smashing people's heads in with bricks in quite a frightening manner presented in this like slight CCTV haze.
So there's this slight smeary kind of unreadable nature to it. I wouldn't say it looks like real, obviously you're playing a video game, but there is slight blurring to it, which lets your brain kind of fill in the gaps and imagine worse stuff. I think it's a, I don't know, I think it's like a brilliantly horrible, horrible game.
You know, probably one of the more artistic things Rockstar have made, albeit like with a very dark purpose. It just really stuck with me and I bought it because I wanted to see all the violent stuff because I was a teenager and I'm an idiot. I thought, oh yeah, of course I want to see that.
It's probably like one of the first 18 rated games I was able to buy. But you play it and it's an incredibly tense stealth game and a point comes in the story where you kind of break out of the game show and it becomes about like getting revenge on the people who put you there. And it has great momentum to it and you want to get Brian Cox.
He's a brilliant villain in it, purring at you and goading you. And I just think it's a really effective, nasty game that you probably shouldn't play because you think less of me.
I mean, genuinely hanging on your every word there because I've never played this. And I don't know why I've never ended. I remember at some point Steve Burns let me a copy of this.
I never gave back to him, so I apologize for that to him. And I think I just always knew it for its reputation. And then maybe just assumed it was sordid and lacked kind of like intellectual justification for being as sordid as it was.
But, you know, the smart people have said that's not the case, including you. So, you know, it's like I think it's backwards compatible on Xbox. I'm pretty sure I have it on there.
It is something I'll play at some point because, you know, it's probably, you know, like sort of like bullying warriors. It'd be nice to have every one of those knowledge gaps ticked off from that particular era of Rockstar.
It's just there's nothing else like it in their, in their, their collection, you know?
Yeah.
That's that's the weird thing. Like it's so, it's so genuinely toxic compared to the kind of throwaway silliness of everything else. It just makes it reveals how like throwaway and sort of harmless GTA actually is.
Because you're like, this is actually nasty, you know? This is what nasty looks like.
Yeah. I wonder if this is this kind of a game inspired like the likes of Puppet Combo and the way that sort of like those kind of that video nasty element to them, the use of filters, that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, because that's the kind of filter thing was a little bit more of an unusual touch at the time, wasn't it? That's not that's a more kind of like modern presentational sort of tool people use. So, yeah, I don't know.
Interesting. Do you think it would still be as controversial if it had this exactly the same premise and gameplay, but it was released now? Do you think people would still talk about like, I mean, if Rockstar made it, it would be a massive surprise.
Like, you know, you have to see how they did it visually, because the temptation, you know, the more photorealistic this thing gets, I think the... I mean, you're saying like the stuff you do in this is, you know, if you went back and played it now, I imagine it pales in comparison to the violence in like The Last of Us Part 2.
Right.
Like that game is like photorealistic, shocking, like, you know, arteries getting punctured and slowly bleeding. Like it is... it's fucking unreal how violent that game is.
And it's just presented so differently, you know, this was presented as something which was like bad and sordid and nasty, and that's presented as something that's like highbrow and meaningful and just how that framing kind of changes everyone's perception of the two things. I haven't played this since. I played it back on on PS2 in the day, and I would imagine it's like probably a little bit quaint now and almost too abstract in its animations.
Truly shock. But yeah, I don't know. It's just impossible to see this, you know, Rockstar are never going to make games like this ever again.
No, like it's it's 10 year open world projects from now on, baby.
Yeah, till we die. That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah. You know, and those are very ambitious and interesting in themselves. But yeah, it's a it's a you want both, right?
That's like, yeah, it would be nice to have both, wouldn't it? So, yeah, I'm with you on that one. Okay.
That's a good pick, Matthew. A really good choice from this year. And I know we talked about Manhunt 2 before on the podcast when the version of it.
That was not released to the public was played by one of your colleagues, I believe. That was very exciting. My number six is Crimson Skies High Road to Revenge.
This is a very recent recent play for me. I did play this for the Excel episode we did on the best backwards compatible games. This is a game that had a huge reputation.
It's a sequel to a PC game with a kind of like fly like kind of old school types of aircraft around shooting up down other enemy aircraft in this. In these environments are kind of like not quite open world, but they're fairly they are fairly open. You get some like wide open spaces in this game.
So the sequel was made for Xbox. It's really, really good. It does have a slightly kind of like, I guess, sort of serial kind of like Indiana Jones ish, daring do kind of like vibe to it.
Just sort of like a good hearted doesn't take itself that seriously sense of adventure to it. With these lovely looking graphics for the time. I think it just sort of like captures sort of like dogfighting really nicely.
It feels the missions are like stimulating. None of them like really drag on too long or are like overtly complicated. There's probably slightly better on a one to one basis than any of the Rogue League Rogue Squadron games are.
Like it doesn't have horrendous difficulty spikes. It's probably the thing that's the easiest to compare it to because that has similarly structured levels. I think where the spaces feel open, but it's not an open world.
It is about guiding objectives. Is that fair, Matthew? Is that fair?
I would say, yeah, absolutely that or like Jedi Starfighter or something.
Yeah, that's it. And so it's cool because there are there are layers to it that kind of like peel back. You get sort of like these quite sort of vast city feeling environments a bit deeper into the game and it just it feels like a big budget Xbox sort of first party thing of the time.
And I think it holds up really well because people don't really make these kinds of games anymore. But what do you make of this bit, Matthew?
Yeah, I played this on when it became backwards compatible. Like we did it as a list feature on Xbox on and covered it in some and I was I was just really taken back by just how how instantly enjoyable it still is in the hands. You know, it's just just a real pick up a play pleasure.
Yeah, that that pulpy Indiana Jones sense of fun is really, really works for me. Yeah, I kind of like why not more of this? Why isn't this the thing they revive?
More of this, please.
Just going back and playing it is a treat. I think it's a really nice thing to discover in the back catalogue. Yeah, I think it really holds up, particularly just think that I think it's when you get to that that city a bit deeper into the game.
It just you realize that it's just it just feels quite big budget. I think for the time, it's an impressive thing. So yeah, I rate this.
I listen to I listen to loads of episodes of 60 songs that explain the 90s while playing this and had a very good time. So that was good for me. So Crimson Skies, High Road to Revenge was my number six.
What's your number five, Matthew?
My number five is Viewtiful Joe.
Higher on my list. Oh, yep. My number five, I suspect is higher on your list.
It's Metroid Prime.
Yes. Okay.
Then we come to your number four.
Max Payne 2.
Higher on my list.
Oh, holy shit. This episode's moving.
Yeah. Finally, Matthew's like, dinner is in sight. So that's Matthew Castle right now.
My number four is Zone of the Enders, the second runner. Not on your list, Matthew.
It is not on my list, but I did play it and like it.
Yeah. So did you play and like it more recently with the PS4 version?
No, I played, maybe I just played it. Maybe I just had a demo of this from OPM that I played a lot because it had like one very cool mission that I played several times.
Yeah. So this is the game that got me my job in games media. It was the game I wrote a review sample, attached it to my CV and sent it to Bournemouth and they liked it and Play Magazine hired me off the back of that.
So I owe this game that I suppose. Yeah, I think it's a lot better than the first one for a few reasons. The first one was this mech game with a little bit of Evangelion DNA.
As an action game, I don't think it was really up to much. It's a little bit low key. This game has a slightly different structure to it.
It's basically like kind of like going through these very arcade-y third-person shooter levels and just fighting loads and loads of robots in this extremely athletic flying robot called Jehuty. And you are grabbing robot enemies, throwing them into other enemies and just sort of like picking up a massive steel beam, ripping it out of the ground and battering a mech with it. You are activating these really powerful forward lasers and these sort of missiles that rain down from the sky on your enemies and all kinds of rad special attacks that they give you.
And it gives the game, the rhythm of the action, just so much more momentum than the first game had. The first game is very pared down compared to this. I think that was why it was always rough that this game was undersold.
It was always, no one really bought it. It didn't come with an MGS3 demo or anything. It might have sold quite well if they did that.
But that's why Zone of the Enders will forever be associated, I think, with MGS2, the demo of MGS2, because that's the one that people know. But this game is way better. Also, it has upgraded graphics as well.
I think it might be the best-looking PS2 game overall, because it has this cell-shaded tinge to it, where you have these anime explosions, but the mechs are pure Shinkawa designs. You have those MGS2-style smooth robot paneling to them, where they're just really ornate-looking practical things. There's such a magic to that combination.
Why don't you jump in, Matthew? I was just going to say, my very specific memory of playing a demo of this was thinking, oh, I played Zone of Enders one and quite liked it. And I think very early on in this demo, I fired off just like a volley of missiles, almost like a lock-on from like REZ.
You kind of painted a lock-on on an enemy, and it was targeted on like eight different parts. And then these eight things arced out with smoke and the explosions on them. And I can remember thinking, oh, that's like one of the best looking games I've ever seen.
Like the style of it, the mech design, just the technical heft behind like the explosions and the smoke and the particle effects. Whatever it was doing, I've long associated this game with just in credit graphics. So I'm glad that you say it's one of the best looking games on PS2.
I'm glad I wasn't just going mad, because it's never really an opinion I voiced to anyone. But I just remember thinking it.
Well, I don't think enough people played it in order to praise it. All the weapons have these rad names as well, like Howlbird and Javelin and Geyser. Zero Shift is like the...
Zero Shift you get late into the game. It's basically like the... Excuse me, I'm burping, which is very rude to do on a podcast.
So Zero Shift is this ability you get late into the game. Essentially, you are... There's like this link between Jehuty and Anubis, this other mech, basically.
And you fight Anubis unsuccessfully earlier in the game, and then basically go back with Zero Shift to fuck it up towards the end. And in that very last boss fight with Anubis, there's so much like random sci-fi debris flashing around on screen around you. It's one of the most like incredible looking things.
The fact they did it on PS2, while this action was just so incredibly smooth is... It's really remarkable. And the zero shift pad just lets you zoom across the...
It basically lets you teleport from one side of the environment towards the enemy you're targeting. And that again just gives it this like much, much faster pace. So I really recommend this, and you can play on PS4.
And it's sort of like... What it outputs at 1080p, I don't think they messed with the graphics in any other way. I think it just looks this good, and they realized it looks this good.
You can just put it on PS4, and it will still look not like a contemporary game, necessarily, but pretty close. So, yeah, love this game. Other cool things I like about it, it has very nice anime cutscenes for its very confusing story.
And the other thing is that you play as an old guy in a mech, which I quite like. It's basically a former soldier who walked away from Baran, which is basically Mars' evil army. And then his old boss came and fucked him up because he refused to come back and fight.
And then you basically get this old dude, Dingo Egret, classic Kojima name there, gets basically like fused to Jehuty to keep him alive. It's like his life support. I don't think I've necessarily seen like older dudes in mechs kind of stories before in sort of like anime and manga.
It's a lot more of a kind of like shounen kind of concern, I think, like young teenage boys and girls.
Shounen concern.
Well, you know what I mean? Like, have you seen anything like, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, so I think it stands out for that reason.
But really, man, if you just want to see some rad sci-fi action and robots fighting each other, this is so cool. It has a great level with a moving train that you're fighting like above the moving train, essentially. And yeah, it's just really, really good set pieces in there.
They really found their footing with it. And no one bought it, but it is one of the PS2's clear highlights to me, so.
What I'm hearing is armoured core, but actually good.
Yeah, if that's what you want to hear, then I'm not going to talk about it.
It's armoured core for actual cool dudes.
Yeah, I honestly, it's so, so good. I'll say this about the PC version, right? I can't work out how to turn off Japanese in the PC version.
I've tried and I can't do it. So if you can, like great, good for you. But I failed to do it on both Steam Deck and my PC.
So PS4 is the way I've gone. Okay, that was fun to talk about, Matthew, because I love that game. That's an all-timer for me.
So what's your number three?
My number three is Prince of Persia, Sands of Time.
Not on my list.
Yeah. This is high. Is this too high?
Maybe.
No, this is one of the signature big games for this year, for sure. Yeah.
Yeah. And again, I probably cheated. I think I probably played it 2004 in GameCube, to be honest.
But didn't we have it on PS2? Anyway, just to see people doing 3D platforming at this time is probably still associated with the post Mario 64 world of big worlds, big exploration. That's the direction you're still getting that in.
Jack and Baxter is probably the newer example of that in this generation. And so to have someone come back and pair it back and have a 3D platformer but in a more linear space, like this is something that happens in 3D platforming kind of post Mario 64, like, you know, Nintendo start pairing Mario back itself. And I, you know, as listeners of this podcast will know, I am just a, I am a big fan of 3D platforming challenges and not just games where you explore and occasionally jump.
And this is like platforming, platforming, platforming, amazing acrobatics in a really dreamy, Arabian setting has that brilliant camera trick where you press a button and the camera kind of pulls out to show you the kind of the whole area to give you a slightly different view on it. And does some sort of camera perspective tricks, which are constantly kind of reframing the space you're in, in a really cinematic way, which I thought was very striking, you know, on top of the obviously genius storytelling, time rewinding technique, in that the whole game is being relayed by the prince at a later point. So whenever he dies, he kind of corrects himself, can kind of rewind out of it and go, no, no, no, that's not how it happened.
And that, you know, that was incredibly cute at the time and is still pretty neat. The idea of like correcting yourself mid flow and having combat challenges. You know, some people would say like, does that lack some purity because you can kind of fix it?
I'd say giving people the ability to fix their runs means you can ask them to perform things which would be impossible for most people to perform with a controller. And there's just some amazingly satisfying tricks in this, like moves, which are more commonplace now, the whole kind of like a bit more parkour. I mean, this was before I think I'd ever heard the word parkour, but like wall running and shimmying down and some of the tricks you're doing with poles and things, you know, seems a lot more commonplace when there are 8000 Assassin's Creed games.
But once upon a time, this seemed really refreshing and this thing just arrived so fully formed. Like he was such a pleasure to play as, such a pleasure to watch. The only mark I could say against it, I was never particularly into the combat in this game or the subsequent ones where combat became like more of a concern.
Just I always found it a little bit like a little bit too prolonged. You know, they were trying to kind of do this dance of blades and the kind of back and forth. I think they were trying to tap into the kind of cut and thrust of the original Prince of Persia.
But I always found it a little bit drawn out and like tiring on the thumbs. I much preferred this as a platforming game. And yeah, this was probably my...
Yeah, this was my favorite of the original trilogy. I actually really rate the one that they did on 360. Was that Forgotten Sands?
No.
Yeah, Forgotten Sands.
Yeah, not the reboot, but the one which was like this. Yeah, I've just got a lot of time for it. And, you know, I would, you know, I hope they do work out whatever's going on with that alleged, you know, the remake, which seems to have had a very, very pained development period because, yeah, it's a cool thing, cool vibe, cool character, cool controls.
Please, please give me more.
There's always a place for Prince of Persia in the gaming landscape, you know, like the, you know, this year's, this year's one, Lost Crown, just really, really strong. And like it's sort of like builds on the DNA of the original games, but it's not the same thing as well. I think there's just always space for it.
And this is a really interesting period of Ubisoft as well. So you have these quite, these really textured feeling games in terms of their, their worlds and their presentation. And like the gameplay mechanics is just sort of like, it feels like there's a tiny bit more of an artist's hand to it than there is when you've got like, actually that's not the right way of putting it, but they're just, they're just much more precise attempts to do something than these like all encompassing historical epics in the Assassin's Creed series are, you know what I mean?
It just, Ubisoft is very different by the time you get to the HDH. And yeah, so you got like this, Beyond Good and Evil in the same year, really interesting. Always meant to play this because people would just swear by these platforming mechanics.
They're just like, that's some of the best 3D platforming you'll do essentially. It's, you know, it tests you, but it is fair and it does, it feels good in the hands. Always meant to play it.
And haven't, that's on me.
It's got a really nice sense of the way he begins movements, almost like quite slow. There is something like tentative about it. And you almost sort of feel once he's once he's going and he's built up a bit of speed, like it just feels a bit more like confident as a kind of platforming thing.
It's got a really nice weight to it of like, you know, almost sense the inner monologue of like, oh shit, shit, shit. Oh, fuck it. I've got to do it.
That's why I'm committing to it. I've got to commit to it. I'm just going to do this stuff or I'm going to end up on a spike.
And I always love that about it.
This is a game I want to try and fit in before this episode, but I just ran out of time because I was in Amsterdam for four days. But that will happen.
This has got big. If I play it for that episode where we reevaluate our top 10 lists from the past, that I may question it. This and Manhunt have like the biggest question marks over them, but I know that at the time I liked them.
Well, the thing is, I don't think there are question marks over my ones apart from True Crime Streets of LA. But I know that game itself is more of an exclamation mark than a question mark. So that's fine.
Yeah, okay. Fair enough, Matthew. That's a good way of putting it.
So we're at my number three. Is that right?
Yes.
Yeah, my number three is Beautiful Joe. So this is also on your list. Definitely didn't play this this year.
I played this in 2006 when for some reason, Woolworths was selling copies of this on PS2 for £2.99. Which is an amazing, what a steal that was. I think I bought three copies and gave one to my brother and then gave one to a friend.
I was like, this game rules and Woolworths is burning through all their copies of it. So feel your boots. So side scrolling, French comic book art inspired action platforming game.
Is that the way to describe it, Matthew? Side scrolling is basically the key term. And you have a series of powers that affect the environment in different ways.
So you can slow things down, speed things up. These affect the way enemies behave, the way projectiles move, that sort of thing. How capable your main character, Joe, this little Power Rangers looking lad, is at like a sort of dodging enemy attacks or performing certain moves.
And the entire soundscape slows down as well. In some ways, it feels like the kind of Capcom answer to the big sort of like push towards slow-mo that was happening off the back of Matrix and Max Payne. But it's just such an amazing looking thing.
Absolute blast to play. In some ways, I think as well, never really got as good again as it was in this first entry. It's such a refreshing feeling thing.
It also has artwork that was like, it stood the test of time because it's this really stylish and beautiful, credible attempt to do cell shading at a time where there was a lot of crap cell shading games around. This is the real deal. This is it done with such a degree of taste and care.
And some of the same artistic touches pop up in Akami later on as well, which is from some of the same developers. It gets really, really hard towards the end, but it's actually like it's really hard from the start.
I'd say I was bad at this.
It's tough. I don't I'd never finish this. I got to the last mission, but I just couldn't couldn't finish it.
It was just too difficult, but I did love it. And I did play through those first few missions loads and loads. I love the way Joe says yummy when he eats any food, a piece of food that's on the ground.
It's low key one of like the best superhero games ever. Just really like the kind of like bits of the bits of Joe's personality that are in there. It's a Hideki Kamiya classic, Matthew.
Thoughts? Yeah, I like the bit where the boss sings, Davidson is in the house. And you keep hearing him singing that as you're making your way towards him.
That's what first comes into my head when I think of Eatable Joe. Yeah, I think everything you said there was spot on, particularly like their attempts at wrestling with the kind of coolness of bullet time, but also wanting to marry it to an absolutely lethal gameplay mechanic rather than just have it as a style choice by making this very precision bullet dodges part of your repertoire and all that kind of stuff. I did love this game.
I was really anticipating. I felt so lucky to have a GameCube because it was going to be a GameCube thing. And I bought it pretty much on release.
I was really in there day one. And it took me quite a long time to get my head around it. Weirdly, I think the kind of appreciation and understanding of kind of cameos games and how those kind of games work, I feel has only...
I have a much better grasp of them now thanks to other journalists who are really good at writing about them and thinking about them. I'm not saying at the time this game wasn't properly explained by journalists or was misunderstood or disrespected and it was critically acclaimed. But I do feel like this as a genre only gets the kind of critical love it truly deserves after the fact a little bit.
I feel like there's a lot more... People know what makes these things tick. At the time, people might be like, it's got a short campaign, but now you understand that you play it like a hundred times over, making it look beautiful and that that is a valid aim for a game.
I'm not explaining this particularly well, but that kind of appreciation of this genre feels like maybe A Beautiful Joe was maybe a few years ahead of its time.
Yeah, I think the thing is, I wouldn't say it's as intricate an action experience as Devil May Cry is, for example. There's a level of precision to Devil May Cry that I think this being 2D and sometimes you being swarmed with enemies can be a tiny bit incoherent sometimes.
I don't think it's the way where it derails the game and I think the game is very good at zooming in and making sure you know when a projectile is about to hit you and therefore you have the information you need to hit it and turn it back towards the enemy, that sort of thing. But I do think that otherwise is true though. I think there are still layers to it in a way that you might not necessarily get from a side-scrolling game like this.
It is designed to be mastered on that same level. I think the cult of Kamea thing has only really grown with time as well. I think Bayonetta is when the appreciation for that kind of design really started to make itself known.
Yeah, I think maybe that's kind of what I'm getting at. I felt like other people kind of cracked the Kamea code for me a bit after the fact. I kind of understand them and appreciate them a bit more now.
Same with Devil May Cry, I guess, and things like that. It's just a weird genre which was maybe hard to perfectly convey at the time.
Yeah, this is the best result, the best non-Resident Evil result that comes out of the Capcom 5 initiative, right? Is this as good as it gets on GameCube apart from Resi? It is, right?
Yeah, I would say so. I know PNO3 has its fans, but come on.
Yeah, and Killer 7, I guess, as well.
But that's just so out there.
It's more pseudo than Capcom, isn't it?
Yeah.
Okay, interesting stuff, Matthew. So yeah, what a great game. This is a game that loads of people will say all kinds of crap deserves a remaster.
This is a game that actually does. This would still be good if you could play it now and would still look good as well, importantly. But its graphics were very nicely calibrated for standard deaf TVs at the time, I would say.
It was a beautiful looking thing. So there it is, Matthew. What's your number two?
My number two is Metroid Prime, which was your number... Yeah. What can you say about Metroid Prime?
It hasn't been said, like, a million times before. I mean, this was... In terms of, like, a mad genre leap, seeing the first person perspective used so differently in such a...
You know, for exploration, um, platforming, you know, that's been done to death, the whole... Metroid Prime is the game that made platforming actually, like, a pleasure in first person. But it is true.
And it's, it's, like, easy to forget that... You get to platforming some of your favourite first person games, and you'd be like, oh, god, you know, I am in for such a rough time, but just the sense of, like, placement of this character, and, like, where she exists in the world, what she can do in the world, just made her so much fun to move around. The translation of 2D Metroidvania techniques to 3D is weird.
Like, I feel like you can see through a lot of Metroidvania design. Like, you get to the things, and you can see the artificiality of the barriers and how it's all going to work. You can start kind of planning them out, you know, in your head, like, oh, okay, well, I'll be obviously coming back here later with something that's going to do that, and then that will take me around here, and da-da-da-da.
But what I loved about this world was, like, just the, at the time, the fidelity of seeing it in first person and how organic it felt. It was quite hard to see that design. Like, it often felt like I was...
It didn't feel like an artificial space, which I guess is what I'm getting at, and a lot of metroidvanias do. You know, it really did feel like this world that I was, like, gradually kind of picking apart and working out how it works. And, you know, when you suddenly realize that this corridor you've been walking through, like, ten times before, you know, oh, it becomes a whole different thing if you're the spider ball.
Suddenly it's like a huge half pipe and it kind of reveals all this kind of hidden stuff up above, like, this game just felt like just pure magic in terms of that discovery and constantly, like, happening upon things and, like, really, like, having to figure it out, like, it's not any, like, I don't think it's a very easy game. You know, my memory of it is being a very, very difficult game and really, really struggling with it and bashing my head against it and fearing, like, you know, I was really having to go some to kind of work out its secrets and get ahead and work out where I needed to be. But I thought that was perfect for the kind of hostile world it was meant to be.
And, you know, I've definitely said this before about Metrovanias, but I find that a lot of their rhythms of, like, unlocks and improving yourself and the fact that you're rewarded for exploring with improvements yourself, I think that stuff only makes sense if a game is very difficult. You know, like, you have to have, you know, a challenge that you need an advantage to overcome for those rewards to feel valid. And Metroid Prime just has that in spades.
Like, the boss fights I thought were so hard that, like, every, you know, missile upgrade or energy tank I got, I just thought, oh, thank God, I actually have a chance of getting through this, and that only, like, supercharged the satisfaction of actually finding those secrets. I just, I thought this was just absolutely amazing and, like, visually just, you know, stunning. One of those GameCube games that just completely punched above its weight, where you were like, this machine can do anything.
Oh, so fucking good. Like, the in-visor experience, the way they sold you on, like, things, touching the visor or lighting up or whatever, it's, oh, really good.
There's not loads to add. That's comprehensively what it is. It does punch above its weight.
It's, like, it is amazing at creating the same feeling of discovering secrets. It is a phenomenal 3D translation of a very 2D idea, executed perfectly. It was such an unexpected success because there was so much doubt hovering around this for so long because no one knew who the fuck the developers were.
Some ex-Turok people, I think, were the sort of assumption at the time. They were some former acclaimed people. And, yeah, it just completely surpasses your expectations.
I think because it hasn't inspired that many games, there aren't many 3D games that are really like this. It remains very... It's still great to play now.
And, you know, you've talked about this before, Matthew, but it kind of peaks here as well. Like, it never really gets better after this. So this is the perfect encapsulation of 3D Metroid right here.
So when they did the remaster last year in the critical reception there, it shows that it stood the test of time. Yeah, I love the way it sort of peels back the layers of its world. And I also like the fact that it's a first-person game where the combat is neither the focus nor the best thing about it, you know, the exploration is.
So yeah, still so, so good. And I have nothing more to add than that because you nailed it perfectly. And yes, just a note to the listeners there, that is a game that released in 03 in the UK and 02 in the US and elsewhere.
So we were late to the party because it had to be translated into German, French and Spanish. So that was our little treat.
What had to be translated? There's barely anything in it.
There's a text where you scan stuff.
Oh, yeah, that's a scan visor. Yeah, I guess maybe like one ongoing curse of this game is the love of scan visors in all games to tell all kinds of stories. Like, hmm, this scientist seems to have been peppered with energy bolts.
Like, we now very much live in the age of detective vision. Metro Prime has to be part of that.
Yeah, it's true. Definitely. I think like the other sort of magic trick this game does in its looks is how fucking good that armor looks.
Even now, it's like the sort of fake lighting or whatever they do to make it seem like there's real light reflecting off of it is it just looks so, so nice. Even after all this time, just turning into the morph ball, just sort of like you see that sort of like glimmer on it. And it just, yeah, they just get it all right, man.
I will always be a sucker for games where you can radically change perspective. Like games where they have its first person, but then you're in third person cover or you turn into a morph ball or you see Riddick shimming up a pipe. That is just, that is the good shit.
Morph ball, Vin Diesel, these were great days of video games.
Indiana Jones, he's gonna be doing that, isn't he? That's his thing.
Yep, absolutely, and I have no more comments to make on that subject. Okay, so then, my number two is, was earlier on Matthew's list, Max Payne 2, The Fall of Max Payne. Really close to being number one, this one.
Did weigh up a lot. Played it after a fact.
Trying to calculate your number one, and I think it's an interesting one.
Yeah, yeah, I'm excited to talk about it, but I'm also really certain it's the number one to pick from this year. So yeah, so built on so much of what Max Payne did well, but pushed things along in terms of narrative. We discussed this game a few times now.
We did a Max Payne episode. We did the Remedy episode with Simon, Simon Cardy last year. That was really good as well.
So pushes along the presentation of it in a few ways. The writing is a lot better. There is a love interest, Mona Saks, for Max in this.
And the story is very much about the sort of like the bad shit he falls into as a result of his sort of like his romance with Mona. It's a classic noir love story, as the tagline puts it. It's also just pushes things ahead in terms of the combat as well.
So the presentation of Bullet Time would have this 360 degree camera when Max reloads sometimes, which just looks fantastic. There's a lot of havoc physics stuff in this as well. So you see bits of the environment crumbling apart, that sort of thing, a bit like Half-Life in that respect, where physics just play a slightly unnatural part of their experience relative to what they would play in modern games.
But it's quite novel. Yeah, really sort of like from the original Max Payne's PC as fuck for the time tile sets of how the environments were constructed. Just you get a bit further along in terms of that remedy, attention to detail in creating a place thing where they have much more lived in detail.
They feel much more like real places basically. So we talked about the theme park level previously, but they do that a couple of times in this. But theme park based on a fictional TV show from within the game.
Really nice kind of like choice of choice of setting. But it's a classic sort of sequel that pushes things further much more and was surprisingly a commercial failure for the time relative to the first game, which is a phenomenal success. And I can only assume that people just thought it was more of the same.
And it is kind of more of the same, but just elevated in every single way. I think the story works tons better. The combat is builds on the foundations of the original, but is better.
I think this is actually like one of the most replayable Remedy games. Still so, so good and not that long. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I agree with all that. I think the maybe the challenge of seeing Max Payne 2 as it was now is that so much of what it does well has just been kind of co-opted by so many third person action games, you know, like its storytelling techniques. You know, the sudden surprise of being in someone else's shoes when you're suddenly playing as Mona for a bit, or the fact that it has this sort of like, you know, jumbled up timeline, or the kind of, you know, the meta in world fictional products, you know, this fictional TV show, then having like an impact on, you know, you're going to a theme park of something which exists in world and that sort of sense of world building and lore.
And these are things which all the absolutely lauded storytellers of today, you know, I'm mainly thinking of like Naughty Dog. You can see so many of their techniques and ideas kind of here already, like years before anyone else was doing it. It just felt really cutting edge, really grown up.
Like narrative just wasn't as sophisticated, the telling of the story. There were good stories, but the actual storytelling techniques in this were just felt like a step ahead. And maybe some of that stuff's lost a bit if you play it now.
But like you say, it's still a really enjoyable action game. I played it when we did the Simon episode and, you know, it really, really holds up and like shooting people in slow motion is always fun, particularly when kudlums are deliberately placed next to piles of like paint cans that they're going to knock over with physics. And so it's a little bit like artificial in that there's lots of people standing next to things, which will look fucking awesome if you've got shotgun someone into them.
But that's the lesson. That's what it was to be, you know, living in the post John Woo Matrix world, you know?
Yeah, that's the thing. They had to kind of reckon with that. And, you know, it's the thing.
It's like it's the game built on the most the most novel ripped off conceit of the time. And yet it's just so it's classy in a way that none of those other games were. That's what's great about Max Payne is the series, I think.
So, yeah, and Late Goodbye by Poets to Fall. What a banger and probably the best of the poets to fall in different games, songs. The control one's pretty good, actually.
So I don't know. That's a list feature for another time in a future episode, Matthew. So what's your number one, Matthew?
My number one is Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
Of course, of course.
Of course, which, you know, another one. The peril of doing these flashback top ten lists is that we're covering ground that we've covered about five times in other episodes, particularly with Zelda.
But I would say most of what we talked about in this episode, I don't think we have talked about much before.
No, well, I kind of tried to pick things which I haven't talked about a huge amount.
You're feeling a lot there about the making of the podcast.
Yeah, there was a little bit of that. I thought, well, I should probably have some new observations. But Wind Waker, I have definitely talked a lot about.
You know, there's not much else that looks like it. I only say how Beautiful Joe really nailed the cell shading. That's true, but this game as well just was so complete and coherent as an artistic vision.
Nothing else looked like it. You know, you watch the trailers of it and think, how could a game look that good? And then you played it and it just delivered in every way.
Like, it's so, so goddamn beautiful to look at. And that carries you so far, but for me it was always the exploration of the ocean and the promise of discovering islands and the idea that every little dot on the horizon kind of hit the promise of something. Would it end up being a big dungeon key to the story?
Would it be a town full of interesting characters? Would it just be a strange island with a shopkeeper on it or a tingle on it or a minigame on it? And, you know, long been a series which has traded on the kind of potential of something on the horizon, you know, often in quite artificial ways in the older games, you know, it's very sort of segmented world.
This was one of the first times where it really felt like, well, you can go anywhere and you're in a huge body of water. And with that comes, you know, a fair amount of boredom from going around that empty body of water. But for the most part, like, you know, what was going to happen next and what you might find, like that is such a core part of the Magic of Zelda and obviously like the whole thing behind Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
But, you know, this this isn't quite as freeform in that way because, you know, you are tied to this boat and that's a very kind of fixed method of moving between these things. But in terms of having a world that just opened up and really let you kind of make your make your own kind of journey around it and tell your own story and find your own pace, it just really, really spoke to me. And, you know, yeah, I really loved it.
And when I when I returned to it on when they did the Wii U version for O&M, you know, I was I was just as charmed by it. And it has it has big flaws as Zelda's go, you know, it's it's quite thin in terms of like the big dungeon content. It's very, very easy.
It's very, very child friendly. But, you know, it's so sort of magic and entertaining. Like, who really cares about that?
Like, there's other Zeldas offering more of that if you want it. And there's not many Zeldas doing what this Zelda specifically does. Also, like one of the all time great end end boss fights and and killing blows, which we've talked about on the boss fights Excel, I think.
Yeah, it's a good episode.
Just just really, really good. What I would love is for this to this to eventually come out again, you know, for them to re-release the Wii U version as everyone's been rumored they were going to do. But I'd love them to do a fully orchestrated soundtrack.
It's one of my favorite Zelda soundtracks, but the kind of like weird sort of synthy kind of MIDI instruments don't necessarily do it for me anymore. And the Wii U didn't didn't really update it in any sense like that. So, yes, that's what I would like.
I would like Wind Waker with a fully orchestral score. That doesn't sound like too much to ask.
I don't think so.
That's easy. They're gonna be taking like a week.
Yeah, there is the piano sort of like cover guy TPR on Spotify, who I used to work with at Imagine, weirdly. He sort of did this in his spare time and I think it's like his full-time job. He's incredibly talented at it, has done loads of Final Fantasy.
I think, gosh, is it him? Maybe it's not him, actually. I've got this completely wrong.
There's a cover of Dragon Roost Island I've heard live from somewhere that was just incredible. In fact, I have got this wrong. This is from a Video Games live album that I had ages ago, but you should still listen to his cover.
He does like mournful piano covers of Zelda tracks. I think he's done Wind Waker. He's definitely done Ocarina of Time.
That album is amazing. I strongly recommend that. It turns some quite rudimentary jolly tracks into these really sad, just zoned out, make you think about your life sort of covers, but they're really tastefully done.
I really respect his work, even if I fail to identify correctly on this podcast. The Dragon Re-Sylent is an example of the kind of track you're talking about, Matthew. It's just like amazing, like underlining the sense of place and having its own sort of flavor.
But yeah, also, yeah, definitely due a kind of like orchestral sort of version of it. Yeah, good pick. And I do think, I mean, it is high time this comes back.
I'm sure it will at some point. Maybe it's a proper sort of saving it for a rainy day thing. You know, maybe we'll get this at the end of this year where everyone's like, where is the Switch 2 and Switch 2 fever is getting like scary, they'll just have to release this.
It's like throwing meat to a crowd of zombies. Just like, yeah, just fucking get away from our doors. This is the tont.
This is meat, you bastards.
Yeah, here's the tont from Nintendo. Yeah, so it is like you say, it is kind of like, it is a little bit boring sometimes because of like the gentle pace, the exploration, but the Wii U version addresses that and gives you the faster sails. You have less of that sort of downtime.
Yeah, it's still some repetition in the latter side quest, sorry, the latter quest, but I mean, man, this is like fucking all-timer looking and feeling thing. Like what a great realization of a very specific idea and, you know, arguably a step in the road towards Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom as well. So yeah, and very important.
I don't think you talked about it that much, Matthew. That end boss I might be discussing, but otherwise I think it was just that Zelda Games episode it came up on. Probably the Gamecube draft as well, I guess it came up on there.
But yeah, anyway. All right. That was your number one.
Anything else to add, Matthew? Or should we move on to mine?
No, I'm like, I'm kind of thrilled by your number one pick, but I'm also intrigued.
Yeah, so WarioWare Inc. Mega Micro Games is my number one, and it was not even really a competition because I think this is so perfectly formed an idea out of the gate and so replayable, so compulsive that it's like my number one Game Boy Advance game for sure. And yeah, it's definitely my best game of this year.
I think that in terms of games that were never this good again, it's, I mean, actually, you might have a different perspective on this, but out of the gate, it's like this is a game of five second micro games. It's a tie that you do one thing, it tells you what to do, you either do it or you fail, and then it's on to the next game. And doing that, but also pulling from this vast array of mini games that range from Nintendo references, like move Link into a cave with like original Legend of Zelda NES graphics, or make Mario jump on these two Goombas, to like bizarre sort of like a sides like catch the toast when it pops out of the toaster or make this woman sniffle to snort up the snot, which is one of like the, I think that mini game is a defining Game Boy Advance image in terms of like what you can achieve with the hardware, but also just like what embodies the ethos of the game that is part of.
And the fact that you don't know what it's going to fire at you next, even if you played it loads of times and you understand comprehensively what the range of mini games are, the micro games are they're pulling from, it will still surprise you and delight you. And I've returned to this so many times over the years, and it's so good out of the gate that it just like, you know, it bursts a series because it is that good. So yeah, that's essentially it.
The micro games are so well conceived. It's just got such a powerful sense of fun to it. I love doing the kind of like, I don't know if it's endless, but you definitely does like a hundred mini games in a row.
You just keep going. It just gives you more and more and more. And I played a bit of WarioWare Gold last year, and I still just prefer this.
I prefer this in its purest, original form. It's just right there. Everything it needs to be is in that first game.
What do you think, Matthew? Yeah, that's all spot on. Yeah, like the low-finess of the looks means it didn't really ever need to be anything more than a GBA game, you know?
And every generation of Nintendo hardware has these games. They always try and do something to sort of spruce it up or make more of it or add like 3D elements or whatever. But the charm and the kind of hackneyed nature of it is in those more kind of 8-bit, 16-bit looks.
It always just... What I like about WarioWare is it really looks like a game like Wario would like, you know? Which is the concept of it.
But it is, right? It's as sort of fucked up and lazy as he is. Like it's weird off-key music.
It's kind of honking, sort of farting soundtrack.
It's a sound game. So sound down game for me, dog. I've got to be honest.
Only after a little while because otherwise the sound effects will drive you completely mad, I think.
Oh, I just... Yeah, I just love how the range the whole package is. I think it all kind of feeds into the same thing.
You know, I definitely had like a newfound appreciation of it when they did the WarioWare DIY on DS, where you could make your own WarioWare games. And you actually realize the kind of... the challenge of making something like truly, truly pure and surreal and beautiful.
You're like, oh, anyone could make those. And it's just not true. You know, it takes a certain deranged talent.
And I like the fact that there's still a group of people at Nintendo somewhere who every couple of years get to take another swing at this, even though, like I say, I feel like they're just adding extra kind of extra kind of crap on top, which kind of gets in the way of the purity of the idea. Maybe WarioWare was never meant to be more than just this, this WarioWare. But it makes me laugh that, you know, there are like eight WarioWare games and, you know, compared to some of the franchises people really, really adore and would like more of.
That again feels like a classic Wario dick move. Yeah, just extremely good. I also really love the GameCube version that they made of this.
I love the multiplayer element and how they reuse those games. I think that is one of the times where actually they, they, they managed to do a little bit more with it. But, you know, everything good about WarioWare is here.
So, yeah, I can, I can understand, like, you know, I can understand why it would be so high. I feel bad for not putting it high now.
No, not at all. I mean, the thing is, it was, it was definitely between this and Max Payne 2. But Max Payne 2 would be easy to put here because you could say, like, the narrative niceties of it are, you know, very, are a significant, essential part of the way games have evolved and Remedy were so good at it and deserve the credit for it, you know, that they do get.
But there's something about the fact that this is so pure. It's just pure game design is all it is. And it is like the ultimate test of that.
Nintendo, every interaction has to feel good thing that you hear sort of like, you know, that me and Moto talking about. And here it is in like this, in this, in the most sort of like boiled down possible form it can be. And it's still, it still succeeds.
That's, that's why that's a formula in my head for how it ended up at number one, basically. So, yeah, yeah, it does seem like it does seem unexpected for me. Maybe I don't make a big enough deal about how much this game, how much I do love this game.
But it's one of the first games I emulated back on my PC. It's a game I've played just because I had it on the, it was part of the 3DS, the ones I gave away on 3DS when, if you bought it before the price cut, I believe as well. So I played it then.
I played it various means throughout. And now it's on Nintendo Switch Online, right, as well. So, yeah, so you can go, so I've been, I play it, dabble with it on there as well.
I'll just always play it wherever it is. So, so good. So, yeah, that's my number one, Matthew.
So we come to the end of list.
They were really good. Yeah, some, some top choices in there, I thought. So, yeah, thank you so much for sharing.
That's a weird thing to say, isn't it? But it's always a pleasure, Matthew. You deserve your, you deserve your dinner now, I think.
