Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Our guest canceled. That's good, isn't it, that that happened?
So here we are without an episode, and two days to plan what we would do instead. Yes, our guest did cancel. It was someone we really wanted.
Didn't quite have enough time to get anyone else to this episode, so.
It was Shigeru Miyamoto, if you're wondering.
He had some other things lined up instead.
It's canceled on us twice now.
Yeah, exactly. But next time, Shigzee, fingers crossed. Okay, so what we're doing instead then is, I guess a little bit for those who have subscribed to the Patreon and know that last year we did a kind of best TV shows and films of the year so far in June time.
I saw that PC Gamer were doing a poll of like, oh no, it's more like a list of the games they've given the highest scores the year so far and thought, hmm, we can rip that off, do something kind of similar. I'd kind of like to do a recap of where we're at as we near the halfway point for the end of year. Technically, we're just over a third of the way through the year, but because of the way that the video game release schedule works, I think we've kind of got, once we have like Doom in a few weeks and the Switch 2, we'll basically have our first half of the year wrapped up.
So we're nearing completion on the Q's one and two, Matthew. A little bit tenuous, but-
I think that's all right.
I think that's okay. I think we also have a bit of a fun format for how we're gonna discuss these games without necessarily locking our lists down now and keeping a few surprises for end of year. Would you say that's fair, Matthew?
Yeah, I think so.
So yeah, pull this out of our arse, but you know, not the first time and definitely won't be the last time.
We've pulled some good things out of our arses before.
Definitely, collective arses. Yes, that's definitely, yeah, it's been okay before. We also thought it would be the worst thing in the world to do a slightly shorter episode between Best Games of 2005 and The Games Court from last week, which ended up being two hours long.
Even the mailbag this month was two hours, so we thought a slightly shorter episode couldn't hurt a little bit, just to help us top up the tank. Also, once I've done this job, I have to go back to play Metro Prime Remastered for our XL episode. So, it's a whole Friday evening of Back Page work.
This is not a job, this is pleasure.
This is fun. I enjoy this part of working. I'm just saying that I take it very seriously.
I take it as like we are being paid, so we have to do it properly. We both do that really, right? That's kind of our ethos of the podcast.
Yeah, absolutely. I have enjoyed. I don't know what the right way of describing it is.
Not sort of growing pressure or panic as such, but hearing your little Metroid Prime updates throughout the week, I think there was like big Tuesday energy to, I've just done Thardus.
I think I messaged you at 7.30am because I had woken up at 6.30am unable to sleep and thought, right, I'll just kill Thardus and then go back to bed, which is exactly what I did and not normal behaviour, not something I necessarily recommend. The thing is though Matthew, I think I can finish it at the time I've got left, like this evening and basically all of tomorrow morning and then all of Sunday morning as well. I think that's enough time.
What's the last thing you did in the game?
There's some bullshit where some Chozo ghosts start attacking you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And like this, there's like a bloke with some hands that light up and he fires you off into different parts of the room.
And I got the ice blast power. So I think, is that halfway? It feels halfway-ish.
It feels like more than halfway to me.
Well we'll see. It's, the big thing is going to be getting all those fucking artifacts at the end of the game. So we'll see.
Yeah, there's going to be a lot to dig into. I think it's going to be a fun episode. I don't hate it at all.
I like it, definitely. It's just that, yeah, it's an interesting game to try and race through because there are some points of friction that are very of its time. So, yeah, we can talk about that later anyway.
But yeah, this episode, the format, very much inspired by my old local newspaper in Portsmouth, the Portsmouth Evening News, which I'm sure about five of our listeners will recognize. When I used to deliver this paper as a paperboy, I used to look at The Back Page all the time because it had like a winners and losers section which would just be, whatever's going on in sport that day, there'd be three winners, three losers. It'd be like, Robert Prozuniecki scored three goals.
It's like, oh, losers, like Peter Crouch is going to a better football team because Portsmouth is slightly shit. That was basically the vibe of the winners and losers. It was the only part of the paper I read because I didn't give a fuck about, I don't know, local bookstore gets robbed or whatever the hell happens in Gospel of Portsmouth circa 2002.
Yeah, you know, or like school opens or whatever it might be. So yeah, but that I always read. And when I worked on PC Gamer, Tim Clark also liked that format, not specifically inspired by the Portsmouth Evening News, but I think it's quite a common sports thing to just have like winners and losers based on current form.
So I thought I'd apply that to games, Matthew. You think that's a good approach for this exercise?
I must admit when I read these notes for this episode, I didn't read the word sports. I just read Portsmouth News Back Page and I thought they were just sort of ranking things that had happened in Portsmouth or people of Portsmouth as winner or losers. Which I thought was a slightly spicier take on it.
This post office was held up. They're the losers. This person won a giant Marrow competition.
They're a winner. I don't know what the fuck goes down in Portsmouth.
This lorry driver bought a pork pie. He's a winner, but he's not like the top winner. He's like the bottom winner, you know?
That's, yeah. No, it wasn't that pointed. It was always sports related.
It was normally football related and normally related to local sports. If you like Portsmouth Football Club, you're quite well catered to in that city. They made quite a lot of content for you in print media for you.
You can read about Portsmouth every single day, even though they weren't objectively that interesting a club, you know? But if you're obsessed with something, then yeah, yeah.
Weirdly, in my secondary school, there was like one notable Portsmouth fan in an ocean of Southampton fans, because I think Winchester just fell more under the sort of Southampton's purview, I guess. One of my very close friends, Craig, was massively into Southampton, and he was really tall, massively tall as like a 14 year old. And the guy who liked Portsmouth was called Mark, and he was also massively tall.
And so it was kind of like each side had its like titan to kind of represent it. Like if they would ever, they never fought. But if they ever did have a fight, it would have been incredible because they were just, they were literally, I know there were two giant boys.
So yeah, there you go. That's all I've got on Portsmouth Football Club.
Great stuff. They were kind of, they actually were quite an interesting team to support because they went through big money problems and like borderline relegations and then became a premier league club at a certain point.
Right.
You were kind of wondering, was there a kind of a, it felt like there's a bit of a grift going on with the sort of like behind the scenes of Portsmouth because they suddenly got loads of money to buy new players and then the guy had given them the money kind of demanded it back and then the club went almost went bankrupt and it was a bit like, is football just organized crime? It feels like it is a little bit.
Hey, you said it, not me.
So that was like, well, it's a bit like that fucking Chelsea guy who just didn't have all his boats sanctioned when the Russian Ukraine water kicked off and it's like, why the fuck was he allowed to buy a football club here in the first place? I mean, but it's just all this stuff where you're like, this feels like people are just washing dirty money in this industry and it's a bit dismaying if you're only just a fan of the actual sport itself.
You should have the decency to do it in the Ozarks, like in Ozark, rather than rub it in everyone's faces and do it through a football club.
But anyway, yes, the highs and lows format, the winners and losers format, I did quite like. And so it's a very simple five games that are kind of rising in our game of the year estimations and five games that are falling. Five losers, you might say.
Not necessarily losers, though, but I think basically a temperature check of where we're at. That's essentially the exercise, Matthew. So I don't know how you want to do it.
Do you want to start with the five winners and then do the five losers? Or do you want to alternate between winners and losers?
That might be confusing. Should we maybe do our five winners, alternate those and then alternate our losers?
Sounds good. And so an important thing to point out is that this is where we're at now in terms of our headspace. This does not represent where our final list will end up, but yeah, just a sort of a check in as the title of the podcast says.
So Matthew, why don't you go with one of your rising games first?
Well, I'll start with the one which I spoke about most recently. On the podcast, because a lot of mine actually I haven't talked about before for various reasons. So it's Promise Mascot Agency.
Yes, also on my list. So we can talk about the same time.
I say it's rising. I have finished this game now. So I kind of like I feel like I know 100% how I feel about it.
Yeah.
Obviously, when we talked about it in the last, what we've been playing, you know, I was saying that I was really enjoying the constant kind of drip feed of little collectibles and how everything you do in that game levels you up or powers you up in some way. So it's just an endlessly rewarding game, you know, in quite a sort of superficial and simple way, but a way that tickled my brain nonetheless. Obviously, I've now sort of seen it through, seen the story out.
I kind of like that on top of being this weird collectathon, swerves into this Yakuza-y thriller, and the story around the central quest line is kind of surprisingly complicated, in a way which I think is sort of indebted to the Yakuza games, because those are also very naughty criminal conspiracies, obviously. They've got, you know, they've got almost more in common with like mystery fiction, I guess. And there is a bit of that here, except all filtered through the lens of this ridiculous mascot company.
So the situation that arises, the only way you've got to deal with it is through the power of running a successful mascot agency. And that takes you to a conclusion which we may differ on. We can get to that, but I enjoyed and thought it was tied quite a neat bow on it.
All the characters, you sort of saw through their little individual arcs. It's a world of lots of good hangs. And you know, I enjoyed fulfilling all their little side quests just to get the end of their little stories.
I thought it was very much inspired by lots of things I liked, but at the end of the day, very much its own thing. Very, very refreshing and enjoyable.
Yeah, I really like this as well. I think that one thing I came to realise about it is I don't think it's outstanding at any one individual thing. There's a point where I think in the later part of the game where the visual novel stuff becomes, the balance of it becomes a bit too heavy.
So I think you noticed a sheer amount of talking and character interactions you're having about, particularly, I feel like about 18 conversations about the mines as a location in this game. Not a big mine head. Well, it's more just that you go to the mines, you drive through it.
It's basically a tunnel, basically. And then you just hear about all these things that happen there over the course of many different conversations. And I think that it goes from being a bit of a kind of like sort of light touch visual novel element to the visual novel kind of becoming a bit more of a focus in the management sim stuff or the open world stuff in the later part of the game.
And I think that what I came to the I came to the conclusion of thinking that the management sim stuff, open world sim, open world stuff, visual novel stuff, none of that is like exceptional, but combined it is exceptional. It's definitely more than the some of its parts kind of game.
Yeah.
Because like you say, good hangs. And the open world I did really like. I think that when you have to go back around the open world collecting new bits that they've added to the game, I was a little bit like, I felt like I was a little bit done with the open world at that point where it was like, you have to go and collect some merchandise for the different mascots.
By the time that bit came up in the game I had already done most of the other open world stuff and so it's a bit more rinse and repeat.
Oh, I see.
But I think that's something that doesn't necessarily happen to you structurally depending on how you play it.
Apart from that mascot merchandise, I think most of the collectibles for the whole game are there. I quite like that you can pick up something and it says, oh this is important and it's going to be important to someone you haven't met yet, rather than you have to meet the character for the world to populate with their side quest things. So the game is quite generous and easy going in how you progress through it.
I also like the fact that your little lorry that you drive around, I think that the way that levels up is quite meaningful and does kind of recontextualise the island a couple of times for you. You get like a cannon and then you're suddenly like shooting stuff and that makes collecting quite a lot faster I found. And then, you know, you can go in the sea and fly around.
And again, it just with each of those things, the map is sort of seen afresh, which, you know, all within like, I don't know, 12, 14 hours or something, which I thought was just the right amount of time for it. Like another five hours, maybe not, you know?
Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah, I think it's yeah, it's generous to that stuff. I do like that it allows you to bend the structure of different things.
I like that you can kind of break the money management and sim element of it by just, there's like a regional contractor mascots element to it, like a meta game management thing. I tripled down on early on and that made the, that meant that the money kind of like wobbles you might have in the early game went away really fast. And then I think the management sim stuff sort of becomes a bit more of a background thing.
You can either engage with it or you don't, you don't actually need to make a certain amount of money to finish the game even though it might seem like you do. So that once you kind of unlocked everything, that's basically that part of the game done. I do like that it's full of collectibles but also doesn't force you to do all the collectibles.
I got my first ever platinum trophy playing this, Matthew. I've never ever bothered with any of that kind of stuff but it made it quite easy to do. Like I mostly wrapped it up in playing the story.
Yeah, it's cool. I did think it was just so, so funny as well. Like the writing of Pinky the character is just constantly surprised and delighted me.
No way that fucking finger should be mayor of that town. That's what I was thinking. Like this car crash.
A very like funny and like chaotic kind of character, but should not be in office was my firm take on Pinky. And that's my...
Yeah.
How do you feel about Pinky as mayor? Were you pro?
I kind of wish that the mayor that he's running against, like the incumbent, wasn't like such a shit bag. I think it would be quite funny if you were doing everything in your power to dethrone like a more reasonable man and he just gets more frustrated. But there is something very funny about like the debates they have where you're just sort of like shouting kind of dumb slogans at him and it plays this really great bit of music whenever you debate the mayor.
Yeah, the music in this is really top notch as well. So I did actually have a question for you. When you employ the mascots in this game, you basically have to like decide their contracts and I was curious about what kind of employer you were, whether you were like generous or whether you were like lowballing them.
When you sign them up, you can give some of them options to have like contract renewals and you basically have to like increase their share of the pay every time their contracts up for renewal. And I just didn't want to do that process because I'm lazy. So I did everything my power to never give them a bonus and to never renegotiate how much money they were making.
I was curious what your approach was.
Yeah, I did it once for that ghost lady.
Right.
Like I allowed the renegotiate once and she made me regret it so much. I was like, fuck this is a bit of admin handing over an extra 50k. I decided just to be generous upfront.
So I basically always did. I think it was like 15 percent, five percent and then like a holiday. Yes.
Yes. Time off. I did that for every single one.
Now you could argue that makes it quite a shallow management sin, which it kind of is this game. It's more about the vibes than the actual like money making. Yeah, but I was just like, I'll get to that because it's like two settings you can reach in order to basically do the contract.
It's like an upper setting and a lower setting. You like me just calculated, right, I'll just do the bare minimum to get to the upper setting and then never think about this again.
When you recruit them at the lower setting, they always have a line grumbling about it like, well, this isn't a great start or I feel like I'm worth a bit more than this. I'm just a really shitty boss.
I was going to ask you, so we got a question that pod questions from Coyk, which I'll just chuck in now while we're talking about this game. What mascot and promise mascot agency do the lads most relate to? Matthew, do you have an answer to this?
Because I know what mine is straight away. It's Tamageta, the slightly half-boiled egg that wears a pair of pants. That's me, that is.
I've got a bit of that energy. It's probably the initial sad tofu.
Yeah. The honest truth is the tofu is a little bit me as well. There's something about the energy of the egg where the yolk's spilling over and his pair of pants.
I thought, there's a little bit of me too. That's me recording the podcast basically on Sunday mornings, Matthew. Okay.
That's Promise Mask Agency. I'm glad we're both enjoying it. I don't want to sound like I'm down there at all.
I genuinely mean what I say. Like it's more than some of its parts kind of game. By the time it was done, I just felt like I was done with it.
But there was, I would say, the first 75 percent of playing through it was firmly like, I will give every spare minute I've got of my time to this game because it makes me feel so good. It makes you think about how much other open world games just waste your time and don't respect your time. Okay, good.
That's your first rising of one of mine, Matthew. Okay, my first one here is Avald. Finished this game when I was unemployed.
More like fun employed because I had a great time. I really did. It was so good being unemployed.
Honestly, it was amazing. If I could live off this podcast and just do that all day. It's addictive, man.
I had such a good time that I now mourn it. It was like a period of my life that's over.
It's bad.
Yeah, it is. I went to Starbucks and had a big coffee at about 3 p.m. I came back and just played computer games all day, and then watched a film in the evening. It was so good.
Anyway, working in the games industry, I'm sure I'll be unemployed again at some point. Something to look forward to.
Fingers crossed.
So, yeah, avowed. I did play all of this, which I got into this a lot more than I expected because when I played Outer Worlds, Matthew's favorite game, as we know, as discussed on previous podcasts, I did think that Obsidian's approach to making RP, kind of like AA, slightly 360-era energy RPGs was a little bit too familiar. I'd seen it before and they didn't do anything sort of new with it and felt like I'd seen a lot of what it was doing before.
And so I played through all of the first world of Outer Worlds and then just noped out of it. As the game stretched into the distance, I just thought, these companion characters aren't exactly lighting a flame within me. And I feel like I've played this game before.
And they're kind of like anti-capitalist, sort of like Fallout style gags. I think there's a certain type of player that they would appeal to but wasn't quite ticking my boxes. So I played this and was surprised how much I got into it.
It being a kind of like parkour based RPG is like a key part of that. It is just a game where you're sort of like hopping and jumping around the entire world where you think, oh, what's up that tower? Then going to look up that tower and then being rewarded for it.
Really enjoyed exploring the maps in that regard. I think it's a game of slight diminishing returns. You get to its final map, which is basically this big volcanic area where some sad dwarves live.
They fell out and they've gone to different towers to hang out, and resources there are tough. There's some kind of religious dogma reason that all these dwarves are trapped near this shitty volcano, which all of that was quite good.
That's how this podcast ends. You can be living in separate towers near a grim volcano.
It's basically like they all live in... Where is it in Lord of the Rings where they're all stuck? Where the big fiery monster gets them.
The mines of Moria?
It's like they're all stuck in Moria, but none of them actually want to live there. They're core religionists telling them they have to live there. There's a little bit of an element of you can tell them to leave basically before it consumes them or you can tell them to stay.
It's quite a nice bit of RPG storytelling. This game doesn't try and do the obsidian thing of criss-crossing loads of different possibilities in order to get you an outcome. It is more binary than that, but it's not totally binary though.
There's some situations that might have four or five different outcomes depending on how things might overlap, but generally speaking, it's a bit more of a linear choice-based sort of RPG, but I really liked that about it. I thought it looked fantastic as well. It's a bit of a step up, I think, visually from Outer Worlds, though I did play that on Xbox One rather than the modern format versions.
Just yet, I felt like it had just the right amount of money behind it. I thought that the three worlds before that final volcanic map were actually really, really great and all had a slightly different flavor. You really felt like you're in different areas of a world that had its own distinct identity.
It felt like they'd really gained from having Pillars of Eternity as a basis to build on. I found myself being much more impressed by this than I thought it would be, Matthew. I imagine you played a bit of this and probably floated away when other things came along, right?
I haven't gone back to it. I was playing this alongside some other big map clearing games like Assassin's Creed. I think I just got burnt out a little bit from what's inside that cave, which is very much a big part of this game's appeal.
Maybe with a bit of distance from that genre in the latter half of the year, maybe I can go back to it, but I liked what I played. I needed to not explore something for a bit.
That's fair enough. I was surprised I gave this as much time as I did. I think it was ultimately 50 hours all in that I played this.
This feels like it was a big surprise. It was as good as it was. We talked about it off air as a bit of a…
More me. Every time we saw anything about this, I would be giving you some kind of remark about it being absolutely doomed or like 6 out of 10 fodder or whatever. So for it to be more of an 8, maybe even a 9 to some people, that's not how I thought this story was going to end.
Yeah, it also has, I would say, two fantastic companion characters. One kind of good companion character and one fucking terrible companion character. Which is quite a funny mix.
The guy you meet straight away, Blue Lad, who is voiced by Garrison Masvet, I can't remember his name now, Kai, that's it. Kai. He's fantastic.
There's also a dwarf chap that you meet later on who is basically dreading going back to his home, which is the last map you go to. That whole arc is really, really good. That character is great.
Him and Kai's interactions are just fantastic. Then the third character is all right. She arrives a bit later in the story and feels a little less clearly defined to me.
Then you basically have this horny pink demon lady going around with you, a bit of furry energy. It's just the vibes are off. Annoyingly, there's a couple of bits of the map that you need to have her along as a companion for.
You can only have two companions at a time, but she's going to be-
I will tolerate your horniness for 10 minutes and 10 minutes only.
I don't want to spoil the alternative game of the year awards, but worst hang, it might end up being her, so that's something to look forward to, listeners. Okay, so that's my first pick, Matthew. What's your second pick?
My second pick is the 100 Line Last Defense Academy. I probably will talk about this a bit more on what we've been playing, because I'll have played more of it by then. But this is Mr. Danganronpa, Kazutaka Kadaka.
I'm very satisfied to say that. Only he's made lots of games since Danganronpa, but it felt like this was the one he felt really had the juice. He's been pushing it, talking about it a lot.
I feel like they brought their A game to this particular one, and it is quite like Danganronpa in that it's about a load of quite characterful students with very clear special abilities, one's an amazing mechanic. They all have skills, and they find themselves locked in this school which is under constant siege by these kind of monsters that come in various waves. The overarching idea is that if they can defend the school for a hundred days, they'll be freed from the school by this weird little mascot who's quite similar to the bear from Danganronpa who heads that up.
So it's a very, very similar kind of set up. It isn't a detective game, however. It is a strategy RPG because when the monsters attack, it becomes a sort of fire emblem-y thing.
You know, grid based combat. You're trying to fight off these monsters who are coming towards the school. The unique kind of spin on it is that all their moves are sort of spatial.
Like they take out a certain number of squares or squares in a certain formation, or formation was maybe a better word than spatial. And so it's about using their moves, almost like tetris blocks, to try and take out as many of these monsters as once. So it isn't a, you know, a rock paper scissors system like Fire Emblem.
It's this weird kind of witch move can hit the most people at once. You know, and as the game goes on, all those powers begin to interlock in an interesting way. I really wasn't, like, particularly excited about this because of that strategy thing.
Like, you know, I thought he really only had good detective games in him. But the story side of it is a great mystery. It's really got its hooks into me.
And when the strategy comes, which isn't like every day, it's not like every day there's a fight. It's like every, you know, five to ten days or something. I've only done a couple of them so far, but they're good.
Like, it's very, very solid. The character abilities are fun. You get a good sense of, you know, I really want to level this person up because I've got a good sense of how to get them to do more damage for me.
And you begin picking favourites, which is quite an important part in a Fire Emblem-ish game. Yeah, and it's just very solidly done. And I haven't even got to the really interesting bit of it myself, which is you play through it and it allegedly has a hundred endings, this game, and about a branching plot line, which I haven't read too much about it because I'm trying to avoid spoilers, but I get the sense that there might be a little bit of like Zero Escape to it, because Mr. Zero Escape also co-wrote or co-directed this.
And by playing the game multiple times, you'll sort of fill out the whole story. So it's not just like different choices will give you different goofy endings for the fun of it. It's like there is a bigger narrative project here to play like once you've got your head around this strategy game.
And it's really got its hooks into me. Like, I want to know why they're there. I'm quite invested in some of the characters.
You know, I want to see if they make it. You know, it throws in some little quirky things. It's like a bit where you go out and explore the game, explore the world and it plays out a bit like Mario Party.
That's quite quirky. And I just have the sense that there's more surprises in store. It's been quite fun, which is why it's rising on the list.
If it can deliver on all that promise and really land the story at the end and maybe even on this grander structure. I'm really into it. It's probably the game I've got on at the moment that I want to play the most of.
That makes sense. You know what, this is a game that was not even vaguely on my radar and now I feel like there's a bit of a grassroots movement around this is actually really special. What was the guy's previous thing that didn't?
Was it RainCode, Matthew?
He did RainCode, which was very much like a new Danganronpa. I didn't particularly like the trial system. I really struggled with the character on a bit of a boring, prudish level, I'm afraid.
I found your sidekick in it quite objectionable. Other people had less of a problem and enjoyed the game a lot more than me, but I just thought it was a bit too crass for even my tastes.
Yeah, fair enough. Okay, so that's a game that I've kind of got in the sort of like, well, maybe if there's time bracket, because it's got the profile of something that I hoover up on Switch then never play.
Yeah, I'm playing it on Switch.
Yeah, it's just on Switch and PC.
I mean, I hear that to see the story out in full, to do all those different branches, it's like a 100 plus hours.
Fucking hell!
But then he himself, he's been very like, if you play it through once, honestly, that's enough. But then you've got the super fans going, actually, there's the way more to this game. What is it with this year being the year of games that secretly take 150 hours to see them?
There's a bit of that going about.
Definitely. In fact, I'm going to talk about one now, Matthew, which is Dynasty Warriors Origins, a game that...
That is not what I thought you were going to say.
I really liked, and then got to the point in the story where it wouldn't fucking end. I somehow went on for like 40 more hours, and then it did finally end and thought, thank God that's out of my life. But now I'm kind of contemplating, did I actually really get quite a lot of pleasure from playing this?
So it's a sort of like bubbling under in contention thing. I didn't want to totally fill this with really obvious things, and I will have like two more really obvious things after this. So, Dynasty Warriors Origins, yeah, I've talked about this in our first, what we've been playing of the year, very much kind of like January or SoRan kind of game, just in the sense of you knew that blockbusters were coming, but this is not Doom, The Dark Ages, this was not one of the bigger things that people were pumped about this year.
But they did a really solid job with the combat. It's definitely the best combat this series has ever had. It ends up being somewhere between classic Dynasty Warriors play and taking from the kind of like, I guess, like Nioh, a little bit of Ninja Gaiden sort of mentality of adding a slightly secure-ish but a bit easier parry to the game and that kind of thing.
It does like a split sort of like faction thing where you side with one faction and the story plays out differently. The weakness of that system in this game is that it finds different arbitrary ways to bring all the factions back together. So there's constantly bits where they're forming alliances against one another or they have a larger enemy to beat and so what feels like a really significant choice in the moment of, oh, I just turned against my friends and then there's no going back, ends up being quite inconsequential because the story is going to play out the way it is anyway.
When you do finally get to the end of the game, it does make it feel like you've made a sort of, you've made an alliance and that's it, the different factions will go their own different ways. But I think it's going to be down to the next game to really deliver on that. If the game starts by saying pick one of your three factions and then it properly goes down the route of, it's an alternate history timeline where your green losers beat the shit out of Cao Cao.
That's what I want to see in the next game because my green losers got to overcome Cao Cao a little bit, but there was a lot of my leader doubting himself and it being like, come on man, we're just, you got me on your side. I can beat the shit out of all these guys, have a bit more self-confidence. But the game is a bit too cowardly to fully commit to that.
But there's so many moments of this I thought were really good. When you finally do the Lubu boss encounter, that is about as Sekiro as it gets because first he's on horseback, and then in phase two he jumps off of his horse and then you're fighting him on the ground, which is very Sekiro coded I would say. Easily the hardest fight in the game.
There's loads of really mega precise powering and dodging you need to do in that fight, but it really gets the blood pumping in a way that I think sort of properly delivers on the game's promise. It's just too fucking long, but it might be a contender for a ninth or tenth place in the list depending on how the rest of the year goes Matthews. That's why I put it here.
Any thoughts?
Yeah, I really like this. I haven't carried on playing it only because it was giving me RSI a little bit. These days any action game does.
I don't know what's going on with my hands, but yeah, it was just getting a little painful to play. But my only thing and I've not played it through, but I know from talking to you and reading others about how long it is, is that that is a huge turn off for exploring alternate paths. Is anyone really going to do all three paths and see it through?
Is that really the aim or do you think it's designed to do one path only really?
I think it's one path only, just because a lot of the different deviations, it's the same level, but you're seeing it from a different perspective. It's the same battle, but you're just like... Because they formed a sort of fragile alliance to take on a larger enemy, you're basically just in one part of the field, whereas if you were in the other sort of timeline, you'd be in yet another part of the field in the same place.
So yeah, like I say, not hugely consequential.
Okay.
Those big battles really do...
I shouldn't get too hung up on that then.
No, I think it's a flawed implementation. I think it could have been properly amazing if they were really brave and they were like, right, time to slice down these guys who historically actually killed your guys. But the game is not bold enough to do that.
And I wonder if TetmoKo is not really the developer to take a punt like that. Might just be a bit too much, oh, we don't want to rock the boat too much. Which at that point you ask, should you have even done a choose your own fashion kind of like alternate split story sort of thing.
But like I say, it depends on how bold they are with it next time. Too long, but the fundamentals of these kinds of games in this series have never been this strong. I was quite impressed by it.
Even if like some of the cut scenes look like they cost like five pence to make, just the same. There's a lot of very consequential moments that happen in the same tent in this game, I would say. So yeah, I can't remember.
If these tent walls could talk.
Yeah, I can't remember if I made that gag last time I talked about it, but good Lord. It's a lot that happens around one table in a single tent basically. So that's my game, Matthew.
What's your next one?
My next one is Old Skies.
Oh yeah, of course, point and click thing.
Yeah, point and click, which I finished last weekend and I've really, really enjoyed. This is by Wodgett I, who have made... It's Dave Gilbert, something like that.
Anyway, he's been making these sort of indie point and click games and keeping more traditional kind of LucasArts, Sierra, whatever. The style of the game going with like beautiful pixel arts, Unavald, the Blackwell series, probably like two best known ones. This one is a time travel adventure, perfectly self-contained.
You don't have to have played their other things. What I like about it, I like time travel stories, you know, as a rule. I will always watch any TV show or film that's about time travel.
I love time travel books. The gimmick in this is that it's set in the future where time travel is almost like a sort of tourist attraction and very rich people can pay to go back to any period in time, for whatever reason. Like maybe they want to witness something, maybe they want to meet like a hero, maybe they want to solve a mystery in their own life and they team up with a time traveler from the company that runs this thing called ChronoZen and that time traveler goes back with you and basically makes sure you don't like fuck up all history and so you play the time traveler so each chapter of this is like a different person going to a different period in time who's got like a little story to tell and I think that's really what worked for me is that you know each chunk of the game is a very self-contained story there are links between them and ties that that emerge as you play it in quite an elegant way but you know crucially you know there's a beginning a middle and an end each one takes you know an hour and a half to two hours maybe and they dip into all different kinds of time travel tropes like there's a very good little story set in like a time loop where you basically have to keep going back to the same moment with different people and trying to like unfuck it for them and you know you're then competing with your previous self who's already there with like a previous client that that was really fun.
In quite a risky move, one of the stories revolves around going back to New York on September the 10th before the Twin Towers come down and it just struck me that I hadn't seen much culture deal with it directly. It isn't a September 11th story I should say. It is about something that happens the day before but gets kind of lost in the chaos of September the 11th but it is about that very particular moment in time and I think that the chap who made the game is a New Yorker and it just feels very lived in.
There's these quite weird observations about the weather and the vibe of that day and I kind of like that it was sort of about September 11th but definitely not about it in a direct way. I just thought I would just enjoy that reading that as a short story in an anthology and so, you know, to play it, it just worked really, really well for me. Not a hugely complicated point and click game.
It's not like a game where you've got like a hundred items in inventory, like it's more of a narrative engine. Like there's a couple of sort of signature puzzles in each chapter, but really it's about talking to people, the story always moving forward, not losing track of it. I thought this was great.
I've played some of their games before, but I thought the subject matter of this one and the execution of this one was just kind of like next level really. Really, really liked it.
I did hear about the... I know that basically Wadjet Eye has been putting out very solid games in the genre for a while and I know that Unavowed is a game that people really like from... Yeah.
I think that's been called quite Mass Effective in the past. So they've always sort of been on my radar. I was meant to play those Blackwell games.
They sounded pretty cool, quite an unusual protagonist situation. I thought it sounded pretty interesting. With this one, yeah, I will say that when I heard about the 9-11 thing, it did jump out to me.
I was like, oh, I want to see what that looks like because, like you say, not many media really deal with it because they're either quite conscious of seeming insensitive or like the World Trade Center film that Oliver Stone did, for example.
Yeah, I mean, because what they've obviously done is like, you know, they've accelerated because the story is set in the future. And 9-11 now has like, it has a slightly different meaning in a world with time travel. Time travel became quite regulated because there were like, you know, there was a period where it wasn't policed and it was total chaos.
And like 9-11 became a bit of a, it became like a messy point because obviously loads of people were traveling back to that period. Yeah. And I kind of like that.
Yeah, it just, it just fit very naturally into this game's own kind of chronological, you know, fictional chronology. Like it isn't schmaltzy at all. And it isn't like, oh, let's, let's take a moment here.
We're dealing with September 11th people, like check us out. It's just very like grown up. It treats it in exactly the same way that it does.
Like you sort of go to New York, kind of like Gangs of New York style, like time period. And you go to it in like the 70s and the 90s. And it draws on lots of different like, like films.
You have a sort of sense of the place from other pop culture. But I just thought it was a really grown up way of just talking about the silly concept of time travel, basically.
Yeah, that's cool. All right. Well, my last two games, I'm just going to bundle together because I've talked about them plenty.
And I don't think they need much more discussion. And I want to get to my games dropping in my estimations. That should be more interesting.
So blueprints come up loads already. No need to keep talking about that, but definitely in Game of the Year contention for me. And Split Fiction, which I'm more than halfway through now, Matthew.
I just got to the second set of sci-fi stuff in that game, where you drop from the sky at the start of the chapter. That's so fucking good. And I'm kind of relieved, because I think all the sci-fi bits are slightly better than the fantasy bits in this so far.
I don't know if that's a consensus, or maybe it's just like a subjective thing. But I think that I just really like the way it does the sci-fi stuff in this game. But generally speaking, such a high quality Split Fiction.
I mean, what's not to like, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, out of control. And some of the side stuff, we just did that, what the side mission where there's like the blast of heat from the dying sun.
Oh, yeah, that's great.
That's like as good as any Naughty Dog set piece. And it's one one-off bit in a game that's got loads of... I mean, we talked about this before, the idea overload in this game, and the very high quality of the execution.
Games don't really need to be better than this, but it feels like they need to take eight years and cost hundreds of millions of quid to be this good somehow. That's what's happened. That dichotomy is doing my head in a little bit, you know what I mean?
It's like, just how do we make more of this happen? You know, that's how it feels playing this game. So those are my two Matthew.
I'm guessing they're not on your list. I feel like you've kind of gone a slightly different route with this, which is fine by me.
I mean, again, like just for the sake of having, you know, slightly different things to talk about. I'd say Split Fiction is absolutely locked in for my top ten. I'd be very surprised, you know, if that wasn't like a top five game at the end of the year.
Yeah, I'm just curious to see what it's like, I don't know, what the half life on that game is like almost because it is so round with ideas. It does run the risk of being not forgettable, but like you can only hold so much of the game in your head. So you maybe actually forget like how brilliant it all is, if that makes sense.
That's possible. I think that it will, I think it'll be sticky enough to kind of make a load of it in the year list, but I take your point. Well, those are my games, Matthew.
So you got a couple more, is that right?
No, I've only got one more. Oh, perfect. And it's a bit of a cheaty one, but it is currently in the Game of the Year conversation for me.
It is the suite of DLC that they're putting out for Rise of the Golden Idol. Oh, right. The Detective Pass, which is you pay like 18 quid and then they've promised four bundles of DLC throughout the year.
I've played the first, I'm playing the second at the moment. It came out on the 13th, so after we're recording this. Based on the size of these first two DLCs, it's like another Golden Idol game.
There's that much of it. That's kind of exciting. Builds on the stuff that was in Rise of the Golden Idol.
Difficulty wise, kind of picks up from the end. Like it doesn't have the gradual kind of like, you know, easing you in. So it's quite satisfying if you are into that particular brand of detective game just to have these new scenarios to kind of jump straight into.
Yeah, the two they've put out so far were The Sins of New Wells, which had a really fun set of puzzles tied to Hallucinations, which I won't spoil, but people should definitely definitely play. It's all about trying to work out what Hallucinations might actually mean in real life, which I really, really enjoyed. And this second one, The Lemurian Phoenix, is set in a different country and so far seems to be about understanding the rituals and the weird kind of political situation there.
Again, has a slight different flavour to anything that's in the main game, maybe a little bit more like some of the stuff in the first Golden Idol game in terms of it feeling a bit sort of political and historical. And yeah, I'm having a great time with it. If the other two DLCs are as good as this, this is just an incredible thing that people should buy into, I think.
So yes, the Detective Pass, thumbs up from Castle.
Nice, it's cool that they've basically just outfitted this game with more and more stuff. They're like, we've got a formula for how we build these things and we're just going to go weapons free with them. I did dip into the first one a bit at Christmas, actually, and I did really like it.
I just didn't go back to it. I think it was because I could see the difficulty curve arcing up and my own mental failings, basically being the obstacle to solving these cases, Matthew. That's cool.
I'm interviewing the CEO of Playstack next Friday, actually, but Friday tries to let people listen to this. I'll ask about Bellatro and this. I'll ask, obviously, if he's heard our comedy, Sean Connery voice talking about Bellatro.
That would be my first question, Matthew, but I look forward to that. Okay. Well, those are the ones rising then.
I did want to get to the ones dropping. So actually, this is a bit more interesting because I think people could probably guess. Not your games, admittedly.
You've talked about a lot of new stuff there. As ever, I admire your ability to chew through content in lieu of other activities. It's very impressive, Matthew, but always good for this podcast.
So the one's dropping. Do you want to start with one of yours?
Maybe I'll start with my most controversial one.
I think we're going to have the same one. Let's do it.
Well, I don't know, actually.
Oh, maybe not then. Go with your most controversial one. We'll go from there.
Well, I'd say my most controversial one currently is Monster Hunter Wilds.
No, that's exactly what I was thinking of. Oh, exactly. It's also on my list, Matthew.
I really like this game. Do not get me wrong. I think I think it is like a really fun Monster Hunter.
But I worry that the tweaked and easier campaign and the fact that it's slightly easier to play it by yourself, that it rips you through its core monster roster quickly, has maybe broken the spell a little bit on Monster Hunter. I'm not saying it's too easy, so I'm not interested, but I feel like the other Monster Hunters treat you mean to keep you keen. That didn't happen here.
That's what I'm pinning it on anyway. I think I kind of enjoyed it as a more self-contained thing, and it just hasn't blossomed into any kind of obsession for me. It sort of feels a little bit over for me, even though I recognize that thing as being a lot of fun.
And maybe that's enough. Maybe this will still make the top ten. But I just don't feel like there's much conversation about this game.
How... Where are you with it?
So I don't think I ever liked anything about this game except the environments and the monsters and the animations, which I thought were all fantastic. But I found it super simple, and the more I played it after we did the episode with Joe, the more I thought, I'm not stimulated by this. I don't think the fiddly menus add up to much in game.
I feel like it's... Every character is a bad hang in this. You got universally.
I'm sure... Yeah, yeah, definitely. And I know people really like that blonde lady in it.
I mean, obviously they do. Capcom characters just always look like the most beautiful people you've ever seen, you know, without exception. And I just thought it was, like, miles, miles worse than Dragon's Dogma 2.
And I thought... And I know that they are not that similar in terms of types of games. But they are Capcom games where you deal with big monsters.
But it's just that it's too easy to, like, you know, find the weak spot and then just stab the weak spot. And that was what the entire game was. And when your entire campaign is that, and it's not particularly stimulating to the player, I don't think it's like...
I think it's actually quite a lot to ask for them to keep coming back because they'll add more complicated stuff in the game, in the post-launch update. So actually, I think that's a good... I can see why they did that in terms of, like, they thought that's the thing.
You get people through the door, you educate them, and then later on you properly challenge them. But I think in a landscape that's got quite a lot of interesting games coming out around it, it's quite easy to drop away from it without feeling like you've necessarily had an amazing time or, like, really sort of got taken out of your comfort zone in an interesting way. I've changed my stance on this slightly, I will say, from when we did that Monster Hunter pod.
I've just, I've curdled on it a little bit as time's gone on. And you know what? I'm happy to be honest about that being part of how I think about games.
Like, my perception of these things does change, it does evolve. I think this is a bust from this year, an overhyped bust. That's what I think about this game.
It's not like, it's by no means bad, it's just too straightforward.
I wouldn't say I feel that the sort of same extreme. I think for me, a huge part of the buy-in with any Monster Hunter is this much-talked-about sense of reward and ownership over what you've achieved, and I just think it gives it up a little too easy to get you through its story and to feel more like a traditional single-player game. And I don't know if there just needed to be a little bit more kind of friction in that initial run to keep the idea in the dream alive.
Like, I know it goes to harder places in the higher ranks, but, yeah, I just don't particularly have the urge to dig into it too much. I'd be interested to hear from people who have carried on playing it, like, if they think it actually does have the legs. I know my brother played it a lot more than I did, and that would suggest maybe it has still got the stuff.
I don't know, what I liked about it originally was that it gave me everything up front, and I was just like, cool, all these amazing monsters, but over time that's actually, I think, the reason it hasn't stuck, dems the breaks.
Yeah, it's weird. It's like, I've never really played a Capcom game like this, where it's actually, like, babying you. It's quite a, like, I hope they don't do it again.
Like, I hope there's a Resident Evil game that does this either. Like, I want these games to have frictions to them. I think Capcom games historically do have frictions to them.
And so I think the idea of this gating the sort of, like, what the supposedly hardcore center of it so far beyond, like, 10, beyond, like, tens of hours of play, not that many hours, like, about 20 hours of play, is just a, yeah, it was a gamble, probably based on the fact that the series has become so huge. But it just means that to me this was, like, a bit of a non-event from this year. A bust is too hard, too harsh.
Like, but Dragon's Dogma 2 took me out of my comfort zone in a way that I really liked. And this just felt like the opposite, kind of, like, game development philosophy to it.
Yeah, but I feel you had a particularly special time with Dragon's Dogma 2.
Yeah, but I think anyone who reaches that end game will have a similar time with it, personally. But, you know, to each their own, it's clearly very lavish. Clearly, they went all out with it, but just needed a little bit more to it, I think, in the first instance.
Okay, interesting that we agreed on that, though, Matthew. Atomfall is my first one here, Matthew.
Oh, that's also on my list.
Yeah, nice. A game I do quite like and enjoyed more as I played a further four hours of it, and I keep dipping in every now and then. And by the way, it has fucking great DualShock feedback on using a metal detector in the game.
That's maybe the best thing about it, is how it feels to use a metal detector in that game. Has some cool stuff if you go off the beaten path and find different story threads to put on, like different NPCs who take you on different paths in the game. I think it is a good setting that could have delivered a little bit more in terms of depth and detail and types of things that you're doing.
It's ultimately a game about information accumulation, a lot of it done through notes as we discussed in that first What We've Been Playing episode. There are some cool areas and buildings and stuff to find by going exploring in the different bits of the world. In terms of combat and as a survival game, it's fairly straightforward.
I think though that this game is definitely resonating with the audience that we anticipated, Matthew, that people who are about 40 to 45, who are familiar with fiction that includes blokes in army uniforms on British TV from the 70s or 80s, or people who read John Wyndham books or whatever and really dig that kind of thing. I did read a bit of Day of the Triffids, actually, about 10 percent through it. That is a really good book, actually.
It's really vivid. The idea of waking up and you can't see anything, but you can hear what's happened in the aftermath of something terrible. It's actually fucking great idea for a bit of fiction.
There's actually something 28 days later about takes a lot from the beginning of just stepping into this world from a hospital and being like, where the fuck am I?
Yeah, definitely. It's really good. But the game is probably like a seven that's not one of those sevens.
What do you think?
I found it mechanically quite one note. I didn't think the self was particularly interesting or the enemy behavior was very interesting. I didn't really like the weapons.
Everything you actually do in the game was a bit of a bust for me, ultimately. And also the whole kind of information management thing and the idea that you can join a quest line at all these different points based on what you find. It's like neat, but I don't see it as anything more than a convenience.
Like I don't think it's actually interesting that it does that. Yeah, okay. Well, we're just doing this quest from here instead.
You know, when people say information management, like to me that brings to mind, you know, like in Outer Wilds, where as you understand something, it changes how you approach something. We're actually here, you know, all you ever learn is what an objective is. It's like a place you've got to go next.
It's not like, oh, I learned a bit of information that if I do this with the cricket bat, something crazy happens or whatever, you know, that's more how those other games to do it. Maybe that's unfair asking it to do that. But I saw so many reviews talking about this objective, with, you know, malleable missions, and I actually kind of think it's for nothing.
But I feel that about lots of games which try and do, oh, instead of map markers, you have to read some clues, or you have to look at, you know, there was that awful, Lovecrafty game, what was it called? The people who made the Sherlock Holmes game, they made this Lovecrafty game. Oh, Sinking City?
Sinking City, yeah, where it's like, well, we won't show you where anything is on the map, we'll just give you the address, which you just have to look up on a map, and you're like, that isn't using my fucking brain, that's just, that is an equally mechanical thing, and there's quite a bit of that in this, you know, it's kind of a map marker or map coordinates. Aren't they really the same thing? But when you get to those coordinates, you do get to whip out the metal detector often, and I will agree with you, that's great.
Yeah, well done.
They should have built the game around that metal detector and just made it like a detectorist tie-in. I would be way more interested if I came out of that first vault and instead of a telephone box as Toby Jones, I'd be like, yes.
Someone at Rebellion just really went to town with that mechanic. They were like, this is going to be the best feeling thing. On a PS5 controller with the triggers, it's like the adaptive triggers.
It's great stuff. Well done. Yeah, it's funny actually because a friend of mine, James Peckham, listens to the podcast and he said that our enthusiasm for Atomfall made him buy the game.
I thought we were quite measured in our enthusiasm. I think we were like, it's just fine. That was our take on it.
If you're on Game Pass, then fine. But he went and bought it on PS5 off the back of our discussion. So I felt so guilty about that.
I felt like I need to come back.
Did he like it?
No, he didn't. I felt like I need to come back on and just say, you know what, we were trying to be measured, but it's maybe like a bit more of an update on how it's going wouldn't hurt. But I think I like this game slightly more than you do.
But it's not...
Yeah, I think it's a reverse of The Monster Hunter.
But yeah, like a kind of mutual friend of ours said they really fucking liked it. And they're about maybe like four to five years older than us. So I think that's maybe the difference there.
Just again, having that kind of interest in this type of British fiction thing. Anyway, in it goes to the dropping in your estimation, highs and lows, winners and losers format. Matthew, what is your next one?
Assassin's Creed Shadows.
It's also in here. We just, maybe we're not as different from each other as I think.
I played this all the way to the end. I played like 70 or 80 hours of this thing.
Fucking hell.
And you know what, I guess it did hold my attention to that point, but I just had a sense constantly it was going to become like something a little different.
Yeah.
I was quite excited about that, enough that I played it all the way to the end. But then once I had seen the, what is the kind of core story of the thing through, it like instantly deflated for me. And I've seen people say this about a lot of Assassin's Creed over the times.
I saw loads of people say about Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which is actually a game I really, really liked and played loads of. Like I'm a secret Assassin's Creed Valhalla head for whatever reason. I liked that little Viking fantasy and I liked rainy old Britain.
This one here, I was mesmerised by the world and how good it looks. I think it is one of the best looking games of the generation. Like when the weather kicks off, it is just astonishingly detailed and hectic with the wind ripping around you.
But by the end of the game, I was just so burnt out on the single stealth loop with Naoe or the single action loop with Yasuke. I felt like I had just seen everything those characters had to do. I don't think they could go in particularly interesting directions.
It really did bum me out by the end. I mentioned this in the episode that having set up this sort of mysterious shadow council of masked figures to uncover. None of them were interesting to uncover.
There were no narrative surprises. Not once was I was like, holy shit, it was that guy. And every one of those arcs ended in like a one on one boss fight.
I like bar maybe two. Like there was never a chance to assassinate any of them. So all the stealthy stuff felt particularly bogus by the end of it.
And it's just a bummer. So they are, you know, I did like the setting. I do quite like the characters.
I like the idea of two characters who have very distinct move sets to them. But they, I don't know, they didn't kind of come up with missions that made them feel that different or tapped into those differences. And it just took me a long, long time to realize that.
So yeah, sorry, Assassin's Creed Shadows.
Well, I think it's another game like Monster Hunter Wilds, where it seemed like a big deal in the moment and then the moment passed and then I thought no one's talking about it now. This was just way too familiar. And I think that I reiterate the thing I said before, which is that I think that Outlaws is a more interesting Ubisoft open world game than this is.
And I think that Ghost of Yate will be better than this game and by the end of the year will be completely deleted from the cultural memory. I mean, I'm kind of glad in a way that Ubisoft kind of needed a win and this seemed to at least appease the people who buy Assassin's Creed games and enjoy those games to the extent that it was a modest success, which I'm glad for the developers at those studios that it maybe takes the heat off a little bit because it did seem like they were really in need of something like this. However, yeah, I just think that in a kind of like a post Elden Ring Age and that there have been so many Assassin's Creed games, there needs to be a bit more a bit more in something interesting, some larger interesting hook.
The two characters thing is just not that interesting. You kind of split what Assassin's Creed characters already do into two characters.
Yeah, that's true.
And I just don't think that's necessarily adds up to much, especially when it takes so long to give you control back of the other one. I think the next game that they make has to do something a bit different in this series, but we'll see.
Well, that should be the Clint Hocking one, right?
Yeah, which you would think, if anyone's going to do that, it would be him.
Which they say is going to be a bit horrorish.
Something like that. I won't get my hopes up too much until I see what form that takes, because I feel like they're just increasingly... I feel like these games are pandering to a sense of who the mass market is that maybe no longer makes sense in an age where Elden Ring has outsold this game by double or whatever.
I think you can make something that's a bit more out there now, and I think people would actually go for it more than something that feels quite safe, which I think maybe this game does. So yeah, we'll see. Yeah, okay.
But we both got it in there though, that's quite funny. Even though you played about ten times more of it than I did and came to the same conclusion. Matthew, you do the work, no one could doubt that.
My next game, a bit controversial this, because I only played the alpha of it, right? But was not feeling marathon whatsoever when I played it. So this is a game from Bungie.
It is an entry in a genre that is apparently going to save multiplayer games called The Extraction Shooter. But unlike the Battle Royale, which was the last great genre that took over, well, the last great sort of like hype train for FPS games or competitive games, where I felt the appeal of it was very easy to understand. A couple of games of PUBG, you'll get exactly why.
That ring closing in and the tension it creates is super exciting. The Extraction Shooter feels like more of a niche concern to me. I thought this was the first one of these I played, but then a friend said to me, oh no, if you've played The Divisions, sort of like whatever it's called, when you go into that zone and extract weapons from there and like face off against other players, that is basically what an Extraction Shooter is.
I was like, oh yeah, I guess I have played that and I did enjoy that. This is a game where you can, at the moment, go into like two different environments and you go around finding different loot and then basically getting to a kind of extraction point and trying to escape with your loot. And if you die, there is permanence.
You lose the loot you came into the level with, as well as the loot that you were trying to escape with. So the stakes are quite high, quite punishing. What is distinctly bungee about this?
The shooting is good. It feels good to fire guns. Even though the guns I tried in this Alpha are very conservative, just your classic shotguns and stuff.
A little bit of vanilla compared to maybe what was expecting from bungee who have created some of the greatest guns ever, put in a first-person shooter in Destiny. Some absolutely amazing concoctions they've come up with. And the environments are like colorful, a lot of like prefab feeling areas.
Feels a bit Apex Legends in that respect, but it's quite a stark color palette that perhaps looks better in trailers and screenshots than it maybe looked to me on my PC. I don't want to be too harsh on this because it is, I'm pretty sure I can talk about this. Like I think they raised the NDA for the Alpha.
And I don't know if it's really had the impact they wanted it to or not. But we were there a bit nonplussed about what is the point of playing it in terms of, we'd occasionally come across human players, we were deep enough into the Alpha that human players were just completely destroying us. Or you could sort of like mooch around, find a bit of loot, deliberately avoid human players, then leave.
And that seemed to be the entire game. And I feel like there's going to be a cult of extraction shoot of people who could be like, oh yeah, but when you get to the point where you're like, you're so good at it, you can blah, blah, blah, you'll really get into it. And I was like, well, yeah, but it doesn't have that immediate hook of like a battle royale where you're like, I know what gets the blood pumping, I know what's exciting about this.
I feel like it's a bit more of a niche concern. So the idea that loads of different publishers are chasing this because Escape from Tarkov got big, is actually a bit perplexing to me. It's like maybe you should come up with a different kind of way to play an FPS dog, because I'm not sure this has really got the juice in the way that the classic King of the Hill and Deathmatch kind of stuff does.
I really just did not get this. So I will play it when it comes out and give it a chance. I hear there's some more interesting map types that they may be going to roll out after launch.
But yeah, firmly did not understand this and neither did the two people I played with, Matthew. Any thoughts?
It's not really on my radar. You know, I know it exists. I don't think I've played an extraction shooter.
I'm just not particularly interested in those sort of very intense online experiences. Actually, is The Hunt an extraction shooter?
I don't know.
Does that count?
I think maybe.
It's got kind of got PvE and PvP mixed together. I'm really out of my depth on that stuff. I can't say anything I've read about it has made me want to jump in.
And I think you're right about something a little bit depressing about Bungie chasing a fad when in their past have invented what multiplayer shooters look like for a while and then what console kind of MMO-y type open world games would look like and behave like, you know, I feel like they have written the rules for a genre several times. So there is a bit of a bummer about like someone else has done it. Here's our version of it.
Old Bungie just didn't do that.
Yeah, that's very true. And yeah, I get I assume there's some diehards who really dig this, like the pretty active subreddit. I don't think this is like a Concord situation, but this is like an example of something that I just didn't feel like I really, I didn't really get it.
But yeah, there is a bit of debate about whether the Bungie should delay it and maybe get into a better shape or going on the subreddit. So yeah, it does. I don't know.
It feels like maybe the stakes are quite high for this being successful as well. So yeah, I don't know. Like I say, though, this is, you know, we're in an alpha situation here.
It could be a very different experience. There's a lot of fighting identical robots and occasionally getting shot by lads and or games where nothing happens at all. And then you leave.
And that seemed to be like my entire experience of Marathon after giving it a whole evening.
So they should take a beat, come back and rename it Snickers.
Oh, God. OK. And on that note, Matthew, we move on to your next next loser game.
My next loser game. I mean, it feels a bit rough to dunk on this one. I've not talked about it on the podcast.
It's not I don't feel like there was a huge amount of excitement about it, but I was interested to see how it turned out. And that's Commando's Origins.
Oh, yeah, that did happen.
You know, the interesting thing about this is first Commando's to come out in a post-Mimimi world. Mimimi made Shadow Tactics, Desperados were very influenced by the original kind of real time tactics games, Commando's 1 and 2 that fit into that. And this is kind of Commando's not made by Mimimi, they sadly don't exist anymore, but by another studio whose name I forget.
Sorry. But it's very much like made in the mold of Mimimi. So you know, fully 3D maps, you can rotate around a lot of the interface, a lot of the kind of behaviour of the characters.
Some of the skills, while they are skills from the older games, like how they behave seems to me quite modelled on Mimimi games. And if I can't have real Mimimi, I will happily have someone else doing a good impression of it. But it's another game that doesn't quite get there for me.
Last year, this was a Sumerian 6, which I didn't really think had the stuff. This one, it's really hard to kind of put your finger on, but like Mimimi's gift wasn't just creating an amazing power set that interacted in all these amazing kind of interlocking ways. It was creating levels that were kind of so locked down in terms of like enemy placement and enemy formations that you had to use all these skills in a really interesting way to kind of find a kind of chink in the armour.
I just felt like Mimimi levels from the first game, from Shadow Tactics, just felt like play tested with an inch of their life, like they tightened and tightened and tightened to create these locations where you just had really had to kind of like bring your A-game in a really exciting way. And they're games, I think, that speak to people who want that experience. And this just doesn't have that, you know, it's very, very easy to manipulate people.
You can just do the same trick over and over again. There's a lot of, I've only played like three or four missions of this, but, four missions of this. But there's a lot of lure someone out of an area, bump them off, lure the next person out of the area, bump them off, lure the next person.
And it doesn't have the wrinkles or the enemy density or whatever the secret Mimimi source was. And because of that, it just never really takes off. It's like constantly nice, it's like, yeah, this is well made, looks quite nice.
It's quite fun to be doing this in, you know, the World War II setting rather than like the ninjas or the cowboy. That's slightly different. There's a bit of military hardware involved, which gives it a different flavor.
But the core power fantasy of running circles around like a really deadly enemy, it's just not there. And that's, that's like a huge, huge bust for this genre. I need, I just need like a proper spiritual successor to Mimimi to come along.
Or I feel like this genre is going to like sort of shrivel up again. A bit of a bummer, that one.
Yeah. Okay. That's interesting.
Yeah, it's Claymore Game Studios who made this, by the way. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny that those Sumerian 6 really did come and go without any kind of like fanfare.
And this like looks all right, but it seems like it's not really set the world on fire either. A bit of a mixed response on Steam.
Yeah, I think it launched super buggy as well. Like I'm playing it now. I don't know.
I can't remember when it came out, but I've been playing on Game Pass on PC and it seems fine. Like nothing too heinous on a tech level. Not quite what I was looking for.
Yeah, that makes sense. So Matthew, just to wrap up then, having documented the highs and lows in a way that would make the probably dwindling star for the Portsmouth News delighted. I even remember that format.
They've probably got like mad SEO. They probably come up as the number one site for like Persona 5. That's what the Internet's like now.
Yeah, definitely. Like, like how if whenever you Google something, but the Hindu stand times is like the main Google News box. And you're like, don't know who this outlet is.
I wish them well. I'm sure the Google algorithm is doing its job. By making sure that-
These are my number one guys for Bong Joon Ho films. So I'll believe when I see it.
Yeah. Bong Joon Ho films, amazingly specific. So yeah, I do think that even though GTA 6 has vacated this year, which I think we all thought it was going to anyway, this is shaping up to be a pretty decent year.
You've been playing Doom the Dark Ages, we're going to talk about that more in our What We've Been Playing episode. Seems like it's got mostly eights that one, a few nines and a one seven. I was like, wow, okay, I wasn't expecting that.
But yeah, there's still plenty to come later this year. The new Mafia game just got a trailer and a £50 price point, £45 price point.
And it's an open world?
It's an open world. No, it sounds like it's linear. Looks like a bit like Uncharted or a stealth game.
Pretty straightforward looking thing. Got driving sections though, they're still in the game. But yeah, what do you think is going to be sort of bubbling up to grab our attention between now and the end of the year, Matthew?
The Switch 2 overall is the big question over the next six months. Mario Kart, I think we all have a pretty good idea of how that's going to be. I mean, really the mystery is Donkey Kong.
Is Donkey Kong Bonanza going to be a 10 out of 10 Mario Odyssey worthy game or is it going to be something that lots of people disagree over? Because I feel like there is a hint of that. It isn't a slam dunk in the previews so far anyway, and not everyone knows what the heart of that game is.
So that's one I've got a lot of like, it could do me a huge amount of psychic damage if it's bad. So I'm like, really, I'm quite nervous about that. Because normally I'd be quite cocky about that team, be like, well, you know, here comes the game of the year.
But I'm like, let's wait and see. I'm really excited for Death Stranding 2, based off the back of the last round of previews where all those poor bastards had to play 30 hours of it that they're going to have to play again.
Terrible. I bet one of them gives the game a six off the back of that.
But they did get a photo with Kojima next to the astronaut.
Yeah, I guess that was worth it, worth a trip for that.
I just think that looks amazing from the little snippets I've allowed myself to watch. Sounds like they just get into it as well, a bit more action-y. It sounds like they want to say it's a bit more like The Phantom Pain, but they obviously can't talk about Metal Gear Solid without getting probably sued to shit by Konami.
I imagine it's the vibe.
Yeah, that's interesting. I want to get through the first one so I can play this one, because it feels like it's going to be a major player in the end-of-year discussions. So it's like once we get the Metroid episode done and the San Andreas episode done, Matthew, that's when I'll get my desk.
But you put it like that.
Quite deranged.
Why don't we just delay the San Andreas episode? We can do that, can't we? They've fucking moved GTA 6 back.
We can delay that episode, can't we? That'd be right. Should we do that?
We've got time. You will have retrospectives on all the major GTAs by the time GTA 6 arrives.
Yeah, that will happen.
That's our only pledge.
Yeah, fair enough. Let's move that one to July then. We'll move the GTA 4 one to October or September or something.
That might be good. All right, we'll do that. Then I can play Death Stranding some more.
Talk about that because I'd be nice to have a grounding in it because you're going to play it and probably talk about it, right?
Yeah, the idea that I was going to have to tear myself away from Switch 2 to play Loads of San Andreas was... It wasn't making me feel particularly great.
The problem with that as well is it's another game that I finished half of it in one day. I just know it's going to take you two weeks and drive you completely fucking... It's like the Metro Prime thing in reverse, basically.
Yeah, that's okay. We both got to suffer for the art.
Yeah, it's true, the art, quote, unquote. Yeah, going to the rest of the year, I've got a few things. So Ghost of Yete obviously is like the big non-Death Stranding Sony thing this year.
Kind of curious about that game Demon's School. It might be a bit lowercase tweet, but the idea of an indie game riffing on Persona is still exciting to me. Hyper Light Breaker is in early access.
I don't know if that's coming out this year, but certainly something I'm keeping an eye on. Obviously, at some point Hollow Knight, Silksong is going to happen this year probably, so might need to play that first one and get used to that whole thing, because that's probably going to be a game of the year contender as well. We're not going to be short of them.
What the other big indie things are this year, it's hard to really tell. It seems like Deltarune might be a thing, Matthew, coming up. I played a bit of Undertale and I could see the appeal, but wonder if I missed a boat on that a little bit, and now I'm a 37-year-old man, and wonder if I've really missed a boat on it.
Curious Sea of Metroid Prime 4 ends up being a game of the year contender. I wonder how similar it will be to the first one, actually, having played that.
My big Metroid replay has left me jonesing for Metroid Prime 4. I'm really up for it. All they've got to do is take it back a little bit from the character overload of Metroid Prime 3, and I just think everyone will be really, really happy.
But we can get into that in the Metroid Prime retrospective.
Definitely. No doubt, we'll learn about a lot more games in the summer showcase season coming up, so bound to be some surprises in there. Well, that's a little bit of a check up on where we're at with Game of the Year.
Not bad for an impromptu pod pulled out of our collective arses at the last minute, Matthew. I enjoyed discussing those games with you as ever. Some nice surprises in there.
Keep me updated on 100 Line. I'm definitely curious to hear more about that one. It's definitely the kind of game I rely on you to talk about, so I'm pleased that you're in deep with that one.
I had a DM through on Discord while we were recording this from Ash Day going, have me on the podcast to talk about 100 Line.
Please, should we do that? Should we have him on on what we've been playing next month? That might be good.
Could do. Yeah?
I'll give that some thought. Okay, well, we'll talk about that with Ash and see how that goes. We'll keep you updated on those conversations.
Where can people find you in the meantime on social media, Matthew?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. I watched one film in April, so that's really dried up.
I'm waiting. Once Andor's done and once I've finished fucking Dead or Born Again, I'll be back on the films. In the meantime, it's slow going for your boy.
I do about two films a week at the moment. It's...
I can't play Doom and 100 Line and watch films.
Yeah, it's a bit of a bottleneck for content creators. It's just literally how much time you have on this planet to do things. So what can you do?
I think you're doing fine, Matthew. You don't have to be posting on Letterboxd all the time. You could just have your off period and come back to it, it's all good.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on those platforms as well. And the podcast, The Back Page Pod.
If you'd like to hear the Metroid episode we talked loads about, it'll be available and not too long after this episode. Go wait, it'll be out already by the time you're listening to this. Get my timelines mixed up.
So, backpagepod, patreon.com/backpagepod, four-pound-fifty tier, Excel tier, you can listen to that. And there'll be a Mission Impossible pod later this month too. And we do two additional podcasts a month for our listeners.
Matthew, let's get out of here, goodbye.
Goodbye.
