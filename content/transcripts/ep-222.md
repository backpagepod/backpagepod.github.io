Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Have you remortgaged your house yet to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 and all the relevant peripherals and games? That's a facetious remark, of course.
Remortgaging my house only gets me a Switch 2 Pro Controller.
Yes, so price has definitely been one thing that's been discussed with the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, which happened this week, and we thought we'd just do an episode reacting to that. I will point out, though, that Matthew is fortunate enough to go to a Nintendo event next Friday to play the Nintendo Switch 2 video game lineup. So in that episode, which will go up a little bit later to accommodate Matthew actually going on the day, coming back and recording it on the evening, Matthew would have played a bunch of the games that we're going to discuss in this episode.
So that's very exciting that Matthew was able to get into that. That's cool. Definitely a win for the podcast.
In the meantime, we thought we'd react to the stream itself. There's a few things to point out with this episode. So we recorded this fairly hot, and we don't have the time to do the usual edits that we normally do.
So you'll hear a few more erms. You'll hear a little bit more of my dinner coming up while I'm trying to talk. That's always something that happens on these podcasts.
I'll try and mute myself when that inevitably happens. But I always crush like 1200 calories before we do these pods. Then I'm like, let's go.
Whereas Matthew always waits to have dinner until afterwards. So yeah.
So you might hear my cat, Maple, mournfully mewing outside the door because Catherine is away today. So the cats just want to be in here with me.
Yeah, indeed. So you've got all that to look forward to. I mean, nothing can compare to the actual barking dogs outside in that episode where we discussed barking dogs never bite the film.
So that was truly an unparalleled moment of weird podcasting. So that's something out of a Paul Thomas Anderson film that was really strange. So yes, Nintendo Switch 2 revealed this week then, it will cost 396 pounds to the base unit.
There will also be a bundle for 450 pounds that includes Mario Kart World, the previously teased and now fully unveiled larger interconnected Mario Kart game that allows you to play with 23 other players, so 24 players in total, and features a classic Grand Prix. But we'll come back to some of the details on that one shortly. But I thought we should talk about the hardware first, Matthew, and some of these other factors.
It was really interesting because I think my overall larger takeaway was that they didn't quite have a hook for the Switch 2, but tried to make the new social features added to the unit, to the hardware. They're like star of the show, so they had this thing called Game Chat, using the C button, newly added C button on the Joy-Con 2 controllers. You basically bring up this chat interface, and it allows you to do basically party chat, but without having to have a headset.
You just talk into the microphone, and then the other people speaking come out your speakers. It's either in handheld or when it's docked with the TV. Pretty impressive, but a little bit of a seen it before feature, and then there was a camera peripheral that will be available on day one with the console alongside this, day one being June 5th, I should point out.
It is fifth, right, not sixth. I should have wrote that down. All good so far.
I think they were generally trying to maybe lean on a couple of things that were not USPs in the way that the original Switch, with it being a handheld home console hybrid. It doesn't have anything quite as hooky as that. It feels a little bit iterative as a console, but I think we were all expecting that anyway.
On a hardware side, Matthew, what did you make of it?
I would agree with all that. I think the iterative thing makes sense from a perspective of, when you've just had the generation you've had, you don't really want to kind of fuck with it. I read this morning the developer interview with the hardware team.
So they've put up this four-part interview, kind of like in the mould of a Whatta Asks. Which is quite interesting, because I think I've said on the podcast before, they never did this kind of behind the scenes interview for the Switch one. One of the recent generations we don't know as much about in terms of like, you know, the core moment of magic.
And reading this one, a couple of things jumped out. One, it was headed up by the three people who headed up the Nintendo Direct, who were kind of like a younger, newer generation of Nintendo faces, which, for people who care about these things, that's kind of interesting to see Nintendo putting forwards new people. And the way they talked about it was quite un-Nintendo-like.
And all day I've been thinking about whether this is a marketing ploy or a genuine shift in philosophy. So basically, what it boils down to, they talked about it as a hardware upgrade, it's more powerful, and the big thing we wanted to do was make a really attractive development ecosystem for developers, in-house and third parties. We just wanted it to be a platform where people who looked at all the platforms available to them would see the worth of putting their games on here.
So, a bit more kind of parity with some higher tech stuff, the kind of tech upgrade. And they very much downplayed idiosyncrasies of the Switch 2. We didn't want to have a gimmick, because we think that scares developers off, because people think they have to develop for the gimmick.
And I've never really heard them talk like that. They've taken such pride in the weirdness of their hardware. And that to me felt like are these younger people who are just more kind of aware of the way the world is now?
You know, is this a more open Nintendo, but like a Nintendo that acknowledges that they are sitting alongside a Steam Deck, and presumably other handhelds to come, and they just want this to sit neatly alongside those. They would never have talked about that before. You know, they almost took it as a point of shame if they followed in anyone's footsteps.
So that was like quite an eye-opening read, not like mega depressing or anything, just like a, you know, what is this about? And it was echoed in the presentation with the amount of third party stuff, I thought. You know, I felt like, you know, they were...
I felt like the pitch they were making was kind of all welcome. We've got the modern games too now, you know?
Yeah, it's true. It's... I believe the quote is from Kauchi...
Wait, I've probably said that wrong. Kauchi Kawamoto, who is the producer of the Switch 2. And yeah, you're right, that very specifically makes reference to, you know, to the way in which that, you know, Nintendo used to make a novel way to interface with the game as part of the proposition.
So, Kawamoto says, from Nintendo DS to Wii U, we offered new ways to play by implementing hardware features that weren't typical for game consoles at the time, and asked software developers to take advantage of them. However, with Switch, we made that less of a priority. With Switch, we prioritized implementing something that could be used with any kind of software, such as the ability to play in both TV and handheld mode, rather than tasking software developers to create gameplay experiences that incorporate the hardware's unique features.
So, yes, they say that they considered various ideas, but they felt that even if an idea worked well with some games, there would be a lot of games where it would not work, which is quite, like you say, quite intriguingly candid when it comes to talking about the philosophy of the hardware. The thing is, though, they still have got a kind of novel interface as part of the pitch for the Switch 2.
Yes.
It just happens to be that it's turning the Joy-Cons into a mouse interface, so basically detaching them, turning them on their side, so the side facing there, the screen is basically face down and then using them as a, yeah, like a mouse interface based on that. And some games will take advantage of that, but that very much felt like a secondary feature rather than a primary feature, right?
Yeah, though, you know, apparently from what they've shown at the initial hands-on, which has been going on the last couple of days, you know, they were showing off Metroid, you know, and very much encouraging people to play it with the mouse setup. Apparently, there's a lot of mouse minigames in the little tutorial thing, which is called, god damn, Switch 2 Welcome Tour and Mario Party and whatnot. So I wonder if deep down, the mouse is quite a big deal to them, but they don't want everyone to go, oh, it's the weird mouse console.
Right, yeah. That's probably true, because it did feel like it wasn't center stage for either Mario Kart World or Donkey Kong Bonanza. They were not using their games to sell that.
It's the packaged-in software that was taking advantage of it. Then I think Civ 7 as well. They were like, oh, yeah, if you've got the paid upgrade for Civ 7 on Switch 2, you can use the mouse pointer.
I get why they're trying to sell it based on that, but again, secondary feature comes to mind. Although, I did not make a note of the name of the game, the basketball game with the wheelchairs, Matthew.
Yeah, they made a wheelchair basketball game. It looks like wheelchair basketball meets Rocket League in terms of execution.
Yeah.
Drag, drag X drive or drag times drive, where the control gimmick is using both joy cons in the mouse configuration. Imagine your hands on the top of wheels on wheelchair wheels. So you're pulling the mice back to pull the wheels back and go forward and then one mouse forward to turn.
Apparently, it works absolutely fine. I've seen people say it feels quite tech demo. It doesn't feel like there's a huge amount of game to it.
Like certainly in the presentation, you know, I went in hoping that they would have a new IP. Sorry to use the grim terminology, you know, in the way that they had arms when they announced the Switch. I thought this seemed quite paired back, like artistically, like I didn't really get like a big creative vision from it.
Apart from like, this is what the game is. This is the interesting control scheme. You know, it seemed to be sort of slightly futuristic looking characters in a monochrome core.
It looked quite dull to me, visually, compared to arms, which looked like an attempt at these could be new Nintendo mascots. I wish them well, but I don't see those guys being like mascots necessarily. They didn't jump out at me as I want to know what that character's name is.
But, I mean, interesting, certainly like an interesting concept. And if you think of all the things that don't make it out of Nintendo and, you know, the millions of prototypes that don't get turned into full games, it has to have some kind of juice to get this far, I'd say.
Yeah. I think that it was the lack of inspired art direction that did make it seem a bit like, a bit Wii-ware-ish as I described it to you last night in the pub.
Yeah. It had the air of, on 3DS, when they did Steel Diver, the submarine game, which was more of a touch screen demonstration, but it was like, oh, me and Moto's got this great idea for how to use the touch screen, or the various game pad extra modes in like Star Fox.
Yeah.
It's almost like you're going to be so wowed by this one interaction that that's going to sustain a whole game, and you're like, you've got to build out more than that, I think. If you sell it for like 20 quid or 10 quid, that's one thing. But if that thing's 60 quid, that's probably a no from me, dog.
Unless, I don't know, or maybe I'll play it next week and think it's sensationally clever. Who knows?
Yeah, that's it's possible. But yeah, like I agree, if you think about something like Splatoon, which I suppose is comparable to this, right, because it's a competitive game and a new thing, or it was a new thing 10 years ago when they made it, you know, it was, it definitely had that feel about it. And, you know, they have found all these ways to build on it and expand on it.
You know, admittedly, you know, maybe you felt like the third one had sort of run its course a little bit or didn't have more to say, but certainly when you first played it, it felt very suitable.
It's settled into a routine for sure.
Yeah, it's certainly, but it's that sort of, the shock of the new of it was very exciting. And this looked very, like, if someone told me, there's nothing really distinguishing about it in terms of it being a Nintendo game. If someone told me this was going to be the next free game on the Epic Games Store, I think I'd believe them, do you know what I mean?
It's Scott. Which sounds quite brutal. It's not meant to sound quite as cold as that did, but...
No, and it's, you know, it's particularly annoying. It's so, kind of, leaden looking, you know, given to a wheelchair sport. That's a thing to celebrate, you know, that's cool.
That's a nice, sort of, progressive move on Nintendo's part. Probably open people up to a sport that they maybe didn't think much about before. But, I don't know, it doesn't look like they're doing much to sell it as an idea.
Right. Yeah, it's, again, like, it has a bit of the air of a pack in about it. So, yeah, in terms of, yeah, actual hardware functionality, then there's a few other bits and pieces.
So, the screen, I believe, is capable of 1080p in handheld mode and 120 frames per second, which I imagine three games will get to that by the end of the generation. I mean, you know, I have a 144hz monitor and, you know, never really pushed it that far, and I very much doubt we'll see that much of it during this generation.
It's like balloon fight on the NES. That little guy, you've never seen him flap his arms so smoothly.
And then when docked, I believe, it goes up to 4K resolution. Again, I'm like, hmm, okay, we'll see. We'll see how that goes.
And then, yeah, it gets up to 60fps. And I was certainly, it sounded to me like the hardware was sensibly pitched in terms of, you know, it's not, you can see it being, I think they've revealed the battery life already. It's like slightly less than the original Switch, but, you know, it's gonna be last for longer than the Steam Deck typically does, where some games just really drain it in like an hour or whatever.
To me, the level of graphics they were showing looked about right to me. It was definitely a steps forward from the Switch. But yeah, also not, you know, it doesn't look like it.
They're gonna lose loads of money on each unit sold, which I think is the case with the Steam Deck. You know, it's a bit of a loss leader to kind of grow Steam. What did you make of it in terms of the iterative parts of it, how, you know, the games looked generally, and also things like the fact the dock has like internal cooling in it, and they've redone the stand and the Joy-Con 2s generally.
Do you think they've made sensible decisions on that front?
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing looks a little like heftier. People have said it feels a bit more premium, and that the Joy-Cons feel a bit heavier in the hand, just have a bit more sort of substance to them. Never underestimate what a slightly bigger, nicer screen does.
Like when I got the OLED switch, that really transformed it again for me, you know, it was like a real shot in the arm for the console, and I was suddenly replaying everything, really excited about it again. You know, I know some people are disappointed that this doesn't have an OLED screen on it. You know, I've read plenty of people saying that, you know, what they have, you know, can still be very attractive and, you know, has its own version of doing HDR, lighting and all that kind of stuff.
So, I mean, I imagine it will be a kind of, you've got to get it in your hands to sort of see to have that kind of impact. But, you know, I've not seen a single write up from today, for example, saying, oh, this felt budget to me, you know, lots of people are like, yeah, I kind of see the price of it. Like, the price of it sort of makes sense once you've got it in your hands.
Yeah. And that's, you know, that's really, that's the battle, isn't it? It's like whether or not people think it's worth it.
I actually, just to go back to the game chat thing, I think that is kind of interesting. I've seen like some people snarkily dismiss it as, oh, it's just Nintendo doing party chat, which everyone else has been doing for like 15 years, so he gives a shit. But, like how you frame something, particularly when you are in the business of speaking to non-gamers or gamers with less experience, like that is part of Nintendo's whole deal, like how they dress these things up, getting out of the shitty terminology.
Like everyone may sort of like, you know, make snide remarks about it, but I find it a fucking nightmare figuring out like party chat on my PS5. I just don't understand it. Like all the game base and all that stuff, you know, if you can simplify stuff, that's always good.
You know, I don't think they're claiming they've invented party chat. Again, like, and maybe this comes from reading that interview, I felt like hearing their justification about it, about the prevalence of screen video conferencing during COVID, having like a big impact on how they thought about communication and how that thing should work, and functions, particularly the game-sharing functions, which when you watch the demo, you're like, yikes, I can't wait to see like a three frames a second feed of four other games. You know, it doesn't really make any sense where, you know, they say, oh, there's a certain thrill in kind of showing off what you're doing.
And like, they seem incredibly confident and sold on that idea as like, this was a good experience we had, we really went out of our way to make this work. You know, we feel this, this function is important. You know, maybe it's a try it and see.
I mean, for a lot of people, I imagine their relationship with Nintendo games is as a solo player. Like mine mostly is 90% of what I love about Nintendo is not their multiplayer games. And so they won't connect with any of that stuff.
But I would just recommend people read that interview before they completely dismiss it because there's like an interesting philosophy behind it.
Yeah, it is very insightful, that interview. It's very, like I say, more honest maybe than you're used to. I would say the questions are answered in quite straightforward fashion, like the thinking is really clear.
And there's nothing really cute about the answers. It's very much like what, I think a lot of it is what press would ask, and what the press would want to hear from the interview. It is, Frank, and it is right there on the nintendo.co.uk home page.
You can just go click on it. It's three parts already available. So yeah, I agree.
I try not to be too cynical about it. And I did think watching the game chat thing, I knew you would like it. I knew even if it was something that you've seen before, you would like to see Nintendo's version of it.
And I'm not saying that as criticism. I'm saying that as like, oh, that's what I like about your perspective on these things because you don't write them off. You do try and meet them halfway.
I know I am a bit of a Nintendo apologist. I know I'm a huge Nintendo apologist, but I do think it's interesting to see them actually just look at something that is standard and say, is this behaving in the right way? Can we do this in a slightly different way?
Even if it's just calling a different name. Like, honestly, people being like game chat, you know, it's just party chat. But like, if I say to my mom, you know, multiplayer party chat, does that mean anything to you?
Like, of course it doesn't, you know? And that's who Nintendo are thinking about. They're not thinking about, you know, probably the people who listen to this podcast.
They're not thinking about framing the technology for that crowd. It's the same thing with the game sharing. Everyone's like, great, Nintendo have invented what we've been able to do on our accounts for the last 10 years.
And you're like, they're trying to kind of explain the idea of, you know, this is a digital game. It kind of behaves like a cartridge. You can move it between these machines.
Like, I just think it's kind of bad faith to sneer at some of stuff. I'm not saying you have to be excited about it, but I don't know, maybe I'm being overly defensive.
No, that's fine. I think that's actually one of the... The thing is, right, the question at the heart of all of this is, what the fuck would you do if you were Nintendo?
Because they make a really good point. It's onerous to add hardware features that, you know, in such a standardized world of things being ported between platforms. It's like, no one's fucking got time for the Wii U controller.
They learn that lesson, and to ask them to do something as bold as that is just, you know, the recent history would show that that was not the right path for them. And so they've got a winning formula on their hands, and, you know, and they've given it more power. And of course, they're using their Nintendo director to draw attention to the new things they have out of, the quality of life features.
I think there's nothing wrong with that. And I thought in the presentation that was a perfectly fine tact to take.
Maybe there's a case to be made that, you know, in the construction of that presentation, they could have maybe put things in a different order. So I think you had this rush of Mario Kart at the start, which was really exciting. And then all of a sudden, you were into...
I almost said to Catherine, went, well, this feels like it's going a bit Wii U. You know, they're talking about some quite, not strange online features, but they're going big on this. They think this is really important for some reason.
And I could sense that fear in other people. I think people carried that fear with them, even though the presentation went to some more gamer-friendly places. I don't know if it was their best direct, not that I want to get necessarily into all that, but it was no way near as effective as the Switch 1 announcement, which was just like all first party, because third parties had deserted them at this point, remember?
Because the Wii U is a fucking nightmare.
Oh yeah, that was a good direct, that one.
It was great, because it was like ARMS and Xenoblade and Zelda and Mario Odyssey. It was just like bang, bang, bang, really charismatic hosts, like they were a lot more playful with all the clicking and all that. These three guys, I thought they did a good job, they didn't quite have the juice.
Brutal. I actually didn't, I didn't mind, I don't really think it comes down to the charisma of the presenters and these things. Because so much of it is driven by the video segments that play in between.
It's very different to Jim Ryan talking about the PS5, I think.
I thought there was something quite modest about it. They weren't really going big, they weren't hyping it up. Where actually the Switch 1 was very like, this is a party, we're really excited to show you all these games.
There was a sense of, oh, we've got something really, really fucking cool to show you.
I can sense there's a nervousness of like, we don't want to fuck it. We fucked a transition from like a mega selling console before and we can't do it again.
Yeah, I think they're quite damned if you do, damned if you don't with this stuff. Because the other thing is that they are going to have a lot of sales scrutiny. I think we should come back to Price's own thing at the end, because I think there's a lot to wrap up in that conversation.
But I do think that they are hopefully not going to be another pandemic, the app spikes animal crossing sales and creates a huge moment where the console was sold out for about a year. That's not going to happen again, and it's more expensive than the previous iteration was. But the PS5 Pro's price and the price of games hardware more generally, the fact that it's not dropped for the PS5 and Series X across the generation in any meaningful way, shows that that price is not dropping in the way that it used to, the way that the next thing that you make costs what the previous generation basically costs.
That principle is gone, and now it's like we're basically looking at incremental price upgrades for all future hardware. They're in a tricky position because, like I said, what else would you do? It makes sense to be an iterative console.
Okay, Matthew, anything more you want to say on the hardware before we move on to the games?
Obviously, I'll be playing it next week, and I'd rather offer my own first-hand comments rather than just regurgitating what the largely positive hands-on have been today. So, let's see. I hope my hand's not too big for the mouse mode.
Like, I don't want to be like giant manned out of enjoying the Nintendo console, because however much weight you lose, your hands are getting smaller.
Yeah. That's funny. It's true.
It's very much a principle of the thing. Okay, so, video games then. I mean, so, Mario Kart World was up first, and I think it was largely speculated there'd be some kind of open-world elements to the newest Mario Kart game.
Much like the console itself, what on earth do you even do with Mario Kart? It's like a tricky question, because they made the perfect Mario Kart game in Mario Kart 8. So obviously, it was probably had to be something like this in order to really push things forward.
So what they've basically got is 24-racer Mario Kart World, like I said earlier, and a vast interconnected world, and the classic Grand Prix experience is still in there. It's four courses, but they are connected courses, so you even drive in the bits between the actual race. So it's bold in that sense, and then some of the other modes make more use of the new way they've done the tracks, and the fact that you can drive anywhere and between all these different places, even adding a free-roam mode.
So it's quite bold in some ways, and I think the main takeaway I saw on social media is that you can drive around as a cow. So that's good too.
Yeah, all that frog purse thing that pukes up coins when you hit it. Because they're like, oh shit, we've got to fill this racing grid out, and we've only got so many multicolored Yoshi's.
And I think it's sort of, you can see how they're using the improved processing power to actually do the open world element of this. And I think maybe superficially, you wouldn't think that it looks better than Mario Kart 8 in some ways, but obviously it's doing more. So that makes sense.
I thought generally this looked like loads of fun. I really wanted to play it, Matthew. What did you think?
Definitely into the big interconnected world thing, like Mario Kart does Forza Horizon. It's kind of how I've imagined this in my head. I am intrigued to see what there is outside of the courses, like in all that land.
Like if it's just driving around it, it's fun for the sake of driving around it. You know, whether they be little time trials or stunt challenges or what, who knows? But I'd be interested to see what they do there.
But I think the mode they were showing off, and I was watching a bit of the Nintendo Treehouse today, is there's almost like a mode like, it almost sounds like Outrun, in that it stitches like four lengths of track together. And it's like a big long marathon knockout race. So like every leg of it, you know, half the grid is being lost.
And you've got like, you know, only the next, you know, 20 people through the next gate, 18 people, 16 people. It's got a bit of a battle royale energy to it apparently. And people say it really locks into the item set of like that kind of, that sort of tug of war to kind of pull yourself to the front of the pack.
It really works well when you're like, I'm gonna loot, I'm out if I don't hit this next gate in time. And that I was like, I could see that being gold. That sounds great.
That is a cool idea. That is a good sort of contemporary spin on how you do, you know, give a bit of a freshening up to Mario Kart. So that makes sense as a kind of multiplayer mode.
That is cool actually, I like that. So yeah, I like the Forza Horizon pitch, very you way of...
Yeah, I'd say the only thing that gave me like a slight sort of shudder of fear was, because of the huge player count, they've made the tracks really wide, like Super Mario Wii again. And I thought that game was, like it didn't really feel like it had tracks. Like there were so few bends on them, so they were so wide.
And in a lot of what they've shown, I'm like, is this really a track? It just feels like 24 people careening around in like a big open corridor. I'm sure it won't feel like that in the moment, but like that's my only fear.
When the player count goes up, things get a little shaky in Mario Kart.
I think that's fair. I think they, my sort of interpretation is they probably saw the increased player count as look what we can do with the Switch 2 hardware. It's definitely part of it.
And you know, as an online experience, maybe that would be quite exhilarating as well with all those people in that race. But I agree, it's like less is more a little bit with Mario Kart. You know, like it's, yeah.
That's what I liked about it. Here are the courses and they all bang.
Yeah, exactly. So I agree. There are definitely some very, very wide tracks in there.
And I did sort of I think there is something they said quite early on in that presentation where they were like, oh, you can you can drive you can drive anywhere. And I was like, well, I don't want to drive anywhere. I just want to drive to like the, you know, through the allocated shortcuts that are in the track and to skillfully drive around the bits that you designed for the track.
I don't, it's actually very, very close to being like a pitch for something I don't want. But then when you see the different modes and like how nice the tracks look and that kind of stuff, it's hard. You can't not be excited by this, you know?
Yeah. One question I did have for you, Mario Kart as the main launch game, how are you feeling about that? Does that speak to you?
Well, it's interesting because I, I really do put Mario Kart in that bracket of old dependable, you know? It's like, I don't know if I ever would buy a console specifically for it. However, there is a game I really want to play that is out just a month later.
And so I think that's where I landed with that. I was like, oh, that's, I'm really glad, it makes sense to me they've got that out at launch, but it's, and I will definitely play it, but is it the thing that gets my pulse racing the most? Not necessarily, but as launch games go, a new Mario Kart is really up there.
How do you feel about that?
I associate Mario Kart and multiplayer Nintendo a bit more with my youth and certainly working on magazines where I was in a building of people who were always up for playing Mario Kart. Like Mario Kart 8, when it came out on Wii U, many happy lunchtimes playing that with Scribs and Kate and other people in the office. In my head, getting this on launch day, like me and Catherine having a bit of a head-to-head, it wouldn't have me counting down the days necessarily.
But then I understand why they've done it, because it's the best-selling Switch game, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Yeah, they haven't made one in 10 years, right?
So it's- Yeah, they have it. So they're obviously like, well, the figures tell us this is the main event.
I did wonder if it- maybe this is a broader point, but between this being a launch game, the game chat, the sharing stuff, some of the other announcements, I thought there was a big multiplayer bent to it, and I did wonder if secretly there is a- this isn't Nintendo's live service thing, but I do wonder if they've got the same online bug that everyone seems to have this generation, particularly Sony, you know, trying to turn everything into a multiplayer game.
Like the fact that, you know, we've got From Software, but they're making an online game for us. And the fact that, you know, the new thing we show off, the basketball game, that's a multiplayer game. Kirby's Air Riders, multiplayer game.
You know, I was like, is this like, is this like a stealth online console? Like, is that what they're going all in on this generation? But, I mean, dumb calling that when they've only announced five games for the thing, I know, but...
Well, that's, I think that is an interesting thought. I mean, my immediate reaction to seeing that it was Mario Kart was, oh, much like the console itself, this is a pragmatic pick, you know? This is the, we won't fuck it, like the Wii U pick, you know?
This is like the, straight away, we know this is the thing that will get people, you know, interested in it. So, yeah, I suppose I probably saw it more like that. But it's a good point.
That's a lot of multiplayer, particularly local multiplayer-oriented experiences, right? I mean, that is still how I, I think, I see, certainly how I see Mario Kart and, you know, when I played online, sorry, when I played multiplayer for Mario Kart 8, it was all completely on, yeah, like locally and with family members and friends and things like that. Very good memories of being in a brightened pub and popping the screen up playing with my girlfriend.
That was fun. Yeah. So, yeah.
Very nice.
Yeah, it's interesting. I hadn't really thought about that. It's an interesting angle.
But everyone wants a piece of that, right? And Game Chat as well is only free for a year, and then it's part of the Nintendo Switch Online thing. And Switch Online actually had a quite a, you know, it was quite prominent throughout this presentation.
It always felt a little bit like they did it ass backwards on the original Switch. Like they launched the console and then kind of came up with what the online service was meant to do and then added features as they went, added tiers as they went. Here, they kind of know what it is, and they know which parts of the Switch to experience they wants to sell to you as part of that subscription.
And yeah, Game Chat is one of those. So, you know, it's definitely not out of the question that some kind of focus on multiplayer is a financial play, you know? And there's a philosophy behind that.
Should we move on to Donkey Kong Bonanza, Matthew? Because this, I think we were... I mean, there's a lot of people online who were like, well, I thought this would be Mario Odyssey 2 when they first started showing it off.
The levels certainly have that energy. And I think immediately the feeling you get as someone who pays a lot of attention to Nintendo games is, oh, I guess this is the EAD Tokyo's game then, so the Mario 3D team. And I thought it looked fantastic and it sold me on the console more than anything else.
I will say it came right towards the end of the presentation, right? It was close to like, it was one of the, one of the, you know, certainly the second half. Was it the last thing or...?
I think it was the last thing. Yeah, I think they couldn't let like, From Software have the final moment.
No, exactly. So, yeah, it was, it felt like they're one more big thing. And I saw, actually, you know what?
This is localized completely to our Discord. Some people are bit down that it was a Donkey Kong game and not a Mario game, but I thought it looked fantastic. And the hands-on impressions that went up today as we're recording this, made me really optimistic about it.
And that's the game where I'm like, ah, I do got, I've got to get one and play that. I'm guessing this got your pulse racing as well.
Absolutely. I mean, they still haven't said whether or not who's actually making it. But no, it is definitely EAT Tokyo for sure.
Got to be, got to be.
Like, yeah, even just like the font on that sign of like Ingot Island or whatever, you're like, that is just, that's the same person who designed the hat shop in Odyssey, designed that sign. I just know it in my bones. I'm really, really excited about this.
Obviously, this team has been doing astonishing work with Mario, with Galaxy 1, Galaxy 2, 3D Land, World, Odyssey. We know that they can do that. And I think the idea of them applying all that know-how and skill to a, not a new character, but a character who arguably doesn't like own a genre or like have a game really associated with them anymore.
And thinking about like, what makes this character tick? What are they going to do? How are they going to move?
Like, how do we kind of draw out the power of Donkey Kong in the way that we draw out the acrobatics of Mario? That's a really great challenge to set yourselves. It's quite a risky challenge to set a team who could otherwise be, you know, let's face it, phoning in like another 10 out of 10 Mario game.
We know that they can do Odyssey 2 if they wanted to, and it would be great. There are no games that feel better to me than the 3D Mario games that EAD Tokyo have made, and the idea of them applying that sense of feel to a character who's about power and destruction. I think that's like a...
You don't want to be academic about it, but it's just fascinating to see what they're going to do. They're going to have come up with so many challenges. I was watching the tree house thing today, and I kind of didn't want to, because I want to go into the demos fresh, if I get a chance.
But I just wanted to have a little look of like a minute of it, to see how it was moving and working. And if you just think about it from the perspective of like, here's a character who can basically, it seems, destroy any bit of the terrain and tunnel like anywhere in into that terrain of these levels. How do you design levels which are still interesting or challenging?
How do you make that a mechanic when you can basically go anywhere? But from a technical perspective, the thing that really jumped out was how they were framing the action, where he was drilling himself into quite tight holes, which is normally where 3D platforming cameras shit the bed. They had this solution, one part of the part I was watching, where almost like all the rock around him was invisible, so he was sort of floating in a void, but as he was punching the walls, he was creating the space which became the room and he was like building the room around him on screen out of this like invisible rot matter.
And even that, you were like, someone has spent years working out how to frame this and make this happen, and this is like a minute that I've randomly happened upon. Like this is gonna be, like it's gotta be amazing, right?
Yeah, this is the most, ooh, ah, sort of like response I had to anything in this presentation. It's like, ah, it looks, you know, it's that, again, that 3D Mario thing of every interaction of this looks fun from pulling a rock out of the ground to like, yeah, burrowing underground and, you know, and then wrecking a cliff or whatever, and then climbing up it. Like it just, the physicality of the character is just, it just seems spot on.
So yeah, I agree. This is really, really good. This looked like a classic sort of nine or 10 elite Nintendo game, and that's what you need on a new hardware like this.
And it's nice to have to wait till Christmas for it. You get them out, you get this in July. I think that's pretty amazing, you know?
That's really healthy. I like that a lot. On the pre-order front, if I don't get one for launch, I would hope I can hopefully figure it out in that month and get it for it.
This will be the one I'd be sad if I missed out on.
I think it's going to be more attainable at launch than it seems. I think they're going to have loads of stock, and it's not the pandemic, and it's not the PS5, and PS5 just absolutely massive UK audience. I think it will be manageable, we'll see.
But I've put myself down on the Amazon list. I couldn't be bothered to do all the Argos stuff today. I was like, oh, fuck you, Argos.
Why don't you just start what everyone else did? You know, just make it very annoying.
I felt genuinely wounded not to receive an invite from Nintendo to pre-order from their store. If it's based on playtime, it's like them implicitly saying, you know, you're not a good enough fan. You're not a good enough fan to be up for this.
And I've seen like a few, you know, industry friends and peers who have got it, and you're like, what have they got that I don't got? You know?
Yeah, that's funny.
I mean, like, it should be, you have to have two years of online subscription, a decent playtime, you've signed in to promotional emails, or like you run a podcast where the majority of what you say is about Nintendo.
Or you can prove that you've finished Metroid Zero Mission in the last two weeks. Like if you can do that, then that'd be, that's good too.
Did you dedicate three episodes in a row to a Nintendo Top 50?
Yeah, much to the chagrin of your listeners, you know?
Even though everyone else said you shouldn't.
Yeah, I agree. That is strange actually, but I could be bothered to work all that out. And we talked about this, but I'm on your family Switch Online account, which has, that's definitely a bit of a sort of like mixed blessing based on how the presentation went down.
Some real plus points, but some negatives as well.
Yeah, that's bad. Catherine's on there as well, and she plays her Switch way more than I play mine. So like she was really robbed by that.
I feel bad. I feel like I owned a subscription and I blew it. Like I was the one who had the chance.
Yeah.
And I stood on everyone else's shoulders and I still couldn't make it. I feel like everyone else samourized me up Mount Doom, and I actually fucked it at the last minute.
That's an incredible analogy. Yeah. Okay.
Good. So that's Donkey Kong. We can't wait to play that.
I have to play that. I saw that and I was like, right, that's the game I have to finish before the end of the year pod then. Okay.
That's how I saw that.
That's the one that I won't be making my top 10 this year because I'm a good platforming contrarian now. Yeah.
The Pikmin 4 of this year's games. Okay. So, or the Mario Wonder rather.
That was more of a creature. So you've been enjoying that recently as well, haven't you, Mario Wonder?
I've been playing loads of Switch just because I'm pumped for Switch 2. I was going back and mopping up some of the bonus levels and what not I hadn't done in Wonder, and it was like, oh yeah, this is really, really good.
All right. So some more games then. I think we can get a bit brief on some of these because, for example, Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment, I believe it's called.
So like a prequel to Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, is that right? It goes really far back?
Yes, only in the same way that Age of Calamity kind of filled in a bit of preamble to Breath of the Wild. This will fill in some of the story elements from Tears of the Kingdom that you'll finally be able to experience and enjoy on Switch 2.
Yeah. I mean, I'm not aware of what those elements are. I was a bit like, who are these guys when I was watching it?
Because I only played 24 hours of Tears of the Kingdom. So that was my response to that. This game also, this looked like to me like it, I mean, I know what you said about Age of Calamity.
You wanted to see it on Switch 2 because it was running so jankily, but you kind of know what this game is, right? That's how I felt looking at it. I was like, at first I thought, oh, because I saw Koei Tecma, I was like, is this going to not be a Warriors game and be a Souls-like or something, where you play as Zelda, and then I saw all of the lads turn up on the screen and I was like, oh no, it's still, it's still a Warriors.
Oh, here are the lads.
Very much so. So yeah, I thought this looked all right though. What did you think?
The Age of Calamity was good, even through the technical woes. I'm a bit annoyed that they haven't announced that that's one of the games that will be massively improved on Switch 2, actually. Because I'd quite like to revisit that and play as the Great Fairy without my TV literally exploding.
Which is what happens in it. It's definitely got that core Dynasty Warriors, but you could just tell from the trailer that like Age of Calamity, it's got bigger boss fights. And I'd say it's probably the Dynasty Warriors adjacent game that works hardest to do other stuff and feel a bit more like the game it's based on.
Like there's a bit more Zelda stuff going on in it. It's certainly in Age of Calamity. So yeah, Age of Imprisonment.
I'm not quite excited for that. I quite like that story element of Tears of the Kingdom and would like to find out more what happened to all those goat-faced people.
Yeah, it definitely, it certainly could see the ways in which they will make more use of the hardware. And certainly, this has been pretty acclaimed, sort of subsection of Dinosaur Wars adjacent games, like you say. Okay, so Metro Prime 4 is coming to both the regular Switch and then the Switch 2, and on Switch 2, it has both a performance mode and quality mode as well.
So an option that you may be more used to from playing Xbox Series and PS5 games. So, a little bit different. I think there was a little bit of a sort of shrug at the previous week's direct and the Metro Prime 4 showing there.
I don't think it's the most visually spectacular game, but I thought it looked pretty good. I think you saw maybe some noticeable sheen bump when it came to the Switch 2 version, Matthew. Any thoughts on that?
Some nice big sort of vistas in the background, some very handsome skyboxes, as we call them. I think you can definitely see the switch bones under it, and that's a good thing. I've got no problem with Switch having a last hurrah, and Nintendo won't...
They're going to sell more copies of that on Switch than they are Switch 2, so that's kind of right to make that work there, and be a fitting farewell to that. I'm on a huge Metroid kick at the moment, again, as part of this Switch 2 mania. I just started playing the older ones on Switch Online again, and I'm just really, really up for it.
I'm suddenly all in on Metroid Prime 4, even though being reasonably cool on 2 and 3, I'm like, they're going to rediscover the juice. And I'm quite looking forward to those mouse controls. I think that sounds quite nice.
Yeah, that is a good addition, actually. That's exactly what those controls are for, and there aren't many first-person Nintendo games that really can make the most of that, right? So good to see them using it here.
It is a hard game to advertise and make trailers for, because if the game is getting it right in the way that Metroid Prime 1 got it right, a lot of it is just like vibing in environments with like a weird bit of synth music and looking at a waterfall, or like shooting a couple of bugs and then very meticulously picking over a room for like where you can do morph ball tricks or whatever. It's very rarely thrilling, you know, in a visually spectacular way, maybe outside of the boss fights, and you don't just want to show all those in a trailer. So I do get the dilemma of how do you advertise this thing, you know?
That's true. So I suppose that's probably...
That's the apologist mode again.
And another game that's coming to both platforms is the new Pokemon Legends game, which is obviously not our area, not our corner. We need that one alone. So that's fine.
But we will talk about the Switch 2 editions of existing Switch games. This is definitely tied up in the price conversation because there are substantial updates to existing Switch games, including Kirby and The Forgotten Land, and obviously the two Zelda games, Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and Matthew's favorite game of all time, Super Mario Party Jamboree.
Oh, that being so early in the presentation. That's when I was like, like proper alarm bells going off. Is this going to be a really bad time on my birthday?
It's funny that they used the meat cutting mini game almost straight away. I was like, oh, at least they showed the best bit of the game in there. That was that was something.
Yeah, so this was like an interesting one because the upgrades are paid. The two Zelda ones are free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Plus expansion pack tier of that service, which as mentioned, I'm on that for the Castle family. So all good there.
That's where Samwise gamjing Matthew up the mountain comes in handy, to be honest. I've got to say, seeing those games in action actually almost sold me more than anything else. I thought, these are two durable masterpieces.
They will still be masterpieces in 10 years. Look how fucking amazing they look with the increased improved resolution, visual effects and all that stuff. They basically look like new games to me, even though Breath of the Wild is obviously eight years old this year.
What did you make of this whole Switch 2 edition thing, Matthew? Where it does sound like they're going to charge some quite hefty prices, but we can kind of come back to that later.
I wish obviously there was just a suite of free upgrades. You know, I don't think anyone this generation got it right in the way Xbox got it right, where, you know, they were just like when it went to Xbox One X and then Series X, you know, they were very good on like Gears 5. It's just going to look fucking amazing for free.
And here's like a free campaign for it. Like that's still the gold standard. The Zelda ones, I'm less bothered about just because they're in the subscription.
I'm sort of fine with that. Like if I had to pay like 20 quid for that, I'd be a bit annoyed, but I would probably do it because I'm a freak. The other ones I think are, they're kind of interesting because I think what they're doing with these upgrades or how it feels to me is they're basically putting the games through the process that they've put several other games through in their porting to Switch.
So when they bought Xenoblade 1 and Xenoblade X recently to Switch, they obviously made them technically prettier, but they also tried to justify the second dip with a new campaign on the end. Each of them had like a 10 hour bit added to them. And I wonder if like they've just taken that philosophy of like, well that seems like a good deal.
People seem happy to have something that's prettier and like a bit more of the thing that they already liked. And you know, rather than just package, you know, rather than just launch it outright as here's Kirby Forgotten Land Plus, you have to buy it outright. They've given you a path to buy just the new bit, which I think is okay.
And it will come down to price. Like for me, like if they said like there's a new, like you get another third on top of the Kirby game for like 20 quid and it will run way better. I might be okay with that, you know?
If it's like 40 quid, I'd be like, yikes. But like you say, we can get into the price stuff. So the philosophy of runs a bit better and has something a bit extra going for it.
I'm into that. You just have to make sure the bit extra is like worthwhile. Like if it's like three extra levels for Kirby, I'd be like, that's not quite for me.
The other important thing is that those are all paid upgrades. I agree with something we talked about in the pub was the idea that did making some extra Kirby slow down the production of another Kirby game, we could just be playing instead on the system. That was something I was curious about.
I doubt that's the case for Zelda because the editions are all app-based and more like quality of life. But yeah, I don't know.
I'd almost, I mean, like, you know, any developers who listen to this podcast can definitely reach out and say this is wrong. But I did wonder if, you know, when you've got the bones of the game like that, the people who kind of lead development of that game are working on, you know, Kirby and The Forgotten Land 2. And what's the harm in these other departments making more levels?
Is it actually a good way of keeping certain departments busy who aren't as needed, very early on in a game's development, you know? In that kind of exploratory phase or prototyping phase. You know, they don't need them there to finish the game.
So why not make another chunk of the thing you just made? But maybe that's like massively wrong and those people have loads of stuff to do. That's proper like armchair.
I've no idea what the fuck I'm talking about stuff.
Well, it probably obviously depends on loads of different factors like how many people are at the developer, you know, how where is the next project at, et cetera. But, you know, I see what you're asking. I think in a lot of ways...
It's like a relay, right? I can see how you could make it work in my head where some people are just making a bit more while other people are kind of laying the foundations.
Yeah. Well, completely independent of the price conversation, which we'll come back to. I definitely see the logic of getting, of maybe, I feel like maybe they chose these games by design, Mario Party being the most recent in that series.
So you have that on the shelf for the Switch 2 at launch, because you can put it in a Switch 2 box and say, buy this, more multiplayer like you were saying. The Zelda games are obviously a perennial bestsellers. They're like signature Switch games.
So again, you're affording them more shelf space into the future, which is maybe not a bad thing because you can just keep selling these amazing games you made as opposed to them disappearing when Switch games come off the shelf and Switch 2 games replace them. I see the logic in that. At the same time, they're doing some free updates for games as well.
So Mario 3D World, one of my favorites, Mario Odyssey, Link's Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom, Captain Toad, Treasure Tracker, New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, Game Builder Garage, which I'm not familiar with, 51 Worldwide Games, ARMS, Big Brain, Academy Brain versus Brain. Not familiar with that one either, to be honest.
Didn't know that series was still going, but I wish it well. And Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, which I think were notoriously ran quite badly on the Switch when they launched. So some good free updates in there as well, but I must admit, when they first started showing this, I was a bit spooked of like, oh, how many of these are going to be paid?
Because I don't think anyone wants to spend an extra 15, 20 quid or whatever it ends up being on every Switch game in their library to give it that bump. So the idea that it's selective is wise, I think. Again, independent of the price conversation, which we'll come back to.
Yeah, I guess the annoying thing is that everyone's going to have a different dream list of the couple of things they'd like to have a pass on. You know, I personally would love to see Bayonetta 3 with a bit more power behind it, because it just had ambitions way beyond the Switch. But I don't think that that's enough of a going concern that that will happen.
It certainly not appeared in any of their messaging or whatever. I mean, they have said it again in that developer interview that some games will just organically run better, because I guess they're just so tied to the raw power of the hardware that if they're unlocked or whatever, they can run at slightly higher specs. I think I got my hopes up, because just a few weeks before people discovered there was a line of code or something in Xenoblade X that suggested it had a secret 60 frames mode, which everyone was like, oh, this is just going to unlock when you put it into the Switch 2.
And maybe that still will be announced as a thing, but I think people got it into their heads that everything was just instantly going to be magically improved. You know, that what you're paying to get extra in Zelda was just going to happen as a matter of course. And that is a cleaner sell.
It sucks that we've got like three tiers of games, like Switch games, Switch 2 editions and Switch 2 exclusives. That's kind of messy given how hard they're working to simplify other bits of the console experience. But, you know, I guess Nintendo always get a Nintendo.
Interestingly, some of those things that are going to be updated for free, I think are the games that are getting the Game Share mode added in, which is the one where one person has the game, and then it can stream versions out to people locally. So you can play like four player co-op from one copy of the game. Basically, the modern version of the download play function that used to have on the DS.
Except it's all done by streaming, apparently. It's not like downloading anything on to those consoles. It's the same technology that ran the Wii U gamepad.
It's that video streaming tech.
Oh, right. Well, that's pretty solid tech, so that makes sense.
But it's quite funny that they went, oh, yeah, well, we managed to make that work then. Let's crack that out. So Switch 2 will be streaming the game to three other Switches.
Yeah, that was an interesting little review. I like that. And that's like separate from the virtual game card thing that they revealed the week earlier.
So there's a lot of like, get more people to play the thing that you have going on.
Yeah, which is that like a tiny counter to the price? You know, like, yes, these things are like 75 quid, but you can share them more easily, so it's OK.
You know what, Matthew, let's come back to the third part of games later. Let's do price now, because it's such a big, it's the talking point, arguably, coming out of this, because the hardware, like I say, 396 quid, which we'll talk about, you know, how we both thought about that, but the games up to, is it 75 quid for Mario Kart World physically, and then about under 10 quid less than that for the digital version, is that right? There's a marked difference, a marked increase in physical.
Is it? Yes, it's...
Yeah, which I don't know if that's because of, like, the weird high-speed cartridge is slightly trickier, so it's going to be more expensive, but yeah, Mario Kart's like, is it like 66 quid?
That rings a bell, yeah, I think that is right, yeah.
Or is that Donkey Kong? One of them was cheaper. Yeah, but it's weird that they're cheaper digital, because normally digital is just like full whack.
It's, yes, that's right, 66.99. So yeah, but that is quite a difference, because I think a lot of people listening to this are like me and have probably bought most of their Switch library on Shop 2 where you got an endorphin rush from seeing a 3 at the start of the price for any Switch game that you bought, or most Switch games that you bought, give or take, tears of the kingdom, and then horded them that way. It was very satisfying in a generation where PS5 games started creeping up to 60 quid or whatever.
So we're in this weird position where Nintendo has leapt ahead of where everyone else is at price-wise. There's some Xbox games that retail for 70 quid on Steam and on Xbox, but yeah, they've pushed it higher than we used to. At the same time, there are tears of them as well.
So Donkey Kong Bonanza is 10 pounds less, I believe, Matthew, for the physical version, than I think it's like high 50s for the digital version. I was looking at these prices all day the last couple of days, but it's so confusing, because in America, they don't seem to have the price difference. I'm guessing that's because of a state sales tax for the physical version anyway.
But it's like a flat $80 for Mario Kart World, physically and digitally. So it's been, just getting my head around it, it's quite a lot, but it's not the only expense involved with the console, right? Because as mentioned, they are doing these Nintendo Switch 2 editions of existing Switch games.
They appear to be in more of the full price mode, although I'm curious to see what that looks like when we can actually buy the physical games everywhere, because a lot of stuff at the moment is based on what some retailers are saying.
Yeah. I saw today that I think it was, I was looking on, is it the Veri, the store?
Yeah.
They've got some physical games, and they're basically selling all of the physical games for 65 quid.
Yeah. So steep.
Whether that's undercutting Nintendo, I don't know, but.
Yeah. So I guess, how do you feel about the price of the hardware, and how do you feel about the price of the software?
Price of the hardware, I didn't think was outrageous, given the step up that they were pitching, the extra stuff it did, just the technology of the look of the thing. I feel a bit even more confident hearing people say that it does feel quite premium and nice. Again, I will have the Castle verdict next week.
Maybe I'll come back next week and be like, it's not worth 400 quid. You just don't know until you've got it in your hands. I mean, it feels like a slightly redundant question with me, because I'm so in on Nintendo, that I just know I have to pay it to pay the Nintendo tax.
Part of me thinks if they give me a console that gives me first-party games for another eight, nine years, the Switch has, then that's fine. In the context, the Switch, an amazing bargain in hindsight, based on the amount of entertainment it's given us all this time. But if it bums out after three years, I'd be pissed off again.
But I find the money issue is so difficult to talk about. I think it's a thing I don't mind spending money on.
I think the price of hardware is fine, but the price of the games is a bit egregious. I think the digital physical thing is confusing, and I think they should have explained that a bit. Why is it meaningfully different, the price?
Because it was always the other way around. I think people understood that there was a bit of retailer undercutting. It's called capitalism, it's called competition, it's always what retailers have done.
And it now feels a bit like it's either pushing people towards digital purchase by design, which is probably true, because they get to keep more of the money they're making. But maybe also factoring in the fact that there's always a bit of competition between retailers for the physical versions anyway and bringing them in line with the digital price. That was kind of my speculation of why they might have done it.
But either way, the 75 quid for Mario Kart just sounds like a lot. But I think it's actually it seems more egregious because there is such a big leap from the prices from the previous generation. Like they've gone further than Sony and Microsoft have, which I think is surprising.
And what people are reacting to the most. What do you make of all that?
They've always been very, very bullish on this stuff. I mean, people say it was a hubris, but part of it comes from we think we've got the goods. These things will never lose their value.
They will be this price for the whole generation, mostly. That's how these things stand at work. They hold their value.
They will always be good. They will always be worthwhile. So we think we should charge this.
Iwata was always very, very big back in the day, talking about, you know, the second you start devaluing your games, you know, and the second you start kind of the race to the bottom, when he was warning people off like apps and mobile gaming, basically. He was very, you know, he said, you can never come kind of come back from that. And so I sort of understand, you know, I understand where they're kind of coming from, sort of philosophically.
They think those games are worth that. If like Donkey Kong America are like 10 out of 10 best games of the year, then yeah, I probably would pay that much for them, you know, if they're that much better than other games. But you just don't know, you've got to take it on a case by case basis.
I think the thing that gives me pause or annoys me a bit more is at the lower end of things is it does feel a little scroungy to be selling those upgrades. I think the really egregious one to me isn't the higher end £75 for Mario Kart. It's the tech demo console explainer being sold.
For like a tenner in Japanese.
Yeah, and that's okay. It's only a tenner, but this is the company that gave us Wii Sports, the game that defined that console, packed in with it. You know, even 3DS, it came with so much like weird extra junk, all these like AR games.
It was really playful. You could just buy the console and something fun would happen before you even put a game in it. And that to me felt very Nintendo-y.
The idea of charging people for something, like no one is going to buy that. And something that probably is quite playful and fun and by all accounts from the hands on, has some, you know, quite nice little kind of tech demos in it. No one's going to play because you're just like, well, fuck that, especially a post Astro Bot and PS5.
Exactly.
It's that's really that's the bad bit of it. Like you're like, well, it's not what's happening at the higher end. It's the lack of generosity at the lower end.
Now, what does it cost you to advertise your console to the people who've already bought it? Like, come on, you know?
Yeah, it's a really good point. If it's like that cheap anyway, what is it to you to give that away? And it doesn't look like something that...
It just looks like something that's packed in anyway. It's not like there's anything visually spectacular about it. It's such a simple looking thing.
And I bet it's delightful to go through. But yeah, like you say, Astrobot, but also the thing that comes with the Steam Deck, the kind of like Portal-themed thing, like that sort of stuff. I mean, these are the things that straight away teach you about the potential of the console.
You're going to lock that out to everyone who won't pay the extra tax, the extra cost to get it. And it's just, yeah, I agree. A lack of generosity in that for sure.
And yeah, the upgrade editions, I mean, I did just look them up on Varian. Yeah, you got Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom there for 65 quid each. And it's just like, I don't know, man.
I mean, could those be 10 quid cheaper at this point? Like, what is it? What's it to you to do that, really, you know?
The other, like, weird part of this is, you know, in that Nintendo Direct last week, they're announcing Switch 1 games into 2026. That thing's got, like, a weird runway on it. They want to maintain things worth on that console.
And so they probably want, like, a point of differentiation between that and the Switch 2 to show that you're getting something more and that there is an upgrade. But it does create a sort of weird space where you're having to kind of, sort of, you know, behave in two different ways for two different audiences. You know, one audience you really want to be transitioning to the other machine.
Are they going to have Switch 2 versions of Rhythm Heaven and Tomodachi Life? It's just confusing. It is a bit of a bummer.
I'm not someone who's like, I'm going to protest this and not buy any of the games. Like, I'm going to buy them because I want to play Nintendo games. That's like the main heart of my hobby.
That's what you do.
That's your whole thing. Yeah. It's my whole deal.
I think I just thought that the contrast for me was, I had a pretty great collection of Switch games this generation. I bought loads of them because I think the price was a feature. But I was there thinking, I don't know, if a new Hyrule Warriors game is 65 quid, I think that might actually be where the price tests make my resolve, you know.
Whereas I don't mind spending 60 quid on digital Donkey Kong. That's all right. That's okay.
I don't mind paying that. And Mario Kart, I think, again, 75 quid, the 7 does just make me bristle in this very particular way. But I think, again, for the digital version, I wouldn't mind taking the plunge.
I'll probably just get the bundle anyway that comes with it. And yeah, I think it maybe makes it more likely I'll have a selective Switch 2 library, as opposed to a vast one, you know?
Yes, that is true. I keep taking case studies from the Switch and trying to imagine what will happen when, like, inevitable sequels happen. You know, like, what happens when they make another Famicom Detective Club on Switch 2?
You know, at what price does that thing become, like, absolutely no way? Because at the moment, they're, like, 30 quid or whatever. And that's sort of, you know, a little 10-hour story.
It's quite niche. But you pay it to sort of maintain your interest in that niche, if you are interested in that niche.
Yeah.
If you get into the realms where they're like, well, that, you know, in our new world order, that tier of 30-pound game is now a 50-pound game. You are right, like, that the... There has just been that middle, nice tier of first-party games on the Switch, which it's been very easy to, like, have a great Switch library.
It's been relatively affordable to buy all the good first-party games. It's not just that they've made loads of good first-party games, it's that you've been able to buy them without, like, breaking the bank. They helped...
You know, only Zelda was 60 quid. Is that right? Or was it 70 quid?
Yeah, it's... I think Zelda Tears of Kingdom got up to... I think it was 59.99.
Right, so that... But that was the high tier. Even Odyssey was, like, 10 quid cheaper.
You know, that... You've got to think it's going to top out at 75, but there has to be more tiers down. Like, there have to be 40-pound games for, like, lesser series.
Yeah, when you look on Very at the moment, the only one they've really got in that price range is Bravely Defaults Remaster, which is... That's, like, 34 quid. And Street Fighter 6 is 50 quid, but obviously that's been out for, like, two years now.
Right.
Yeah, it's... Yeah, so those games... Those are not Nintendo's games, though, which is maybe more of a question.
Also, those are the games that... Those two games don't actually come on the cartridge. They are game key cards that are basically downloads, and you just use the card to activate the download that you get later on.
So, yeah, you wonder how much the tech side of things is tied up in this price, how much it depends on the very specifics, you know, kind of like, yeah, sort of technical make-up of those game cards and whether that's got something to do with it, but, yeah. It's a weird situation. It just means that it's a bit more, I think it's made the reaction to the console a bit less of a celebration than it otherwise might be, you know?
Yeah, it's given everyone pause, and it's particularly annoying because if you actually, I'm not saying annoying, not annoying, but disappointing, or like a cell phone or shooting themselves in the foot, because if you look at the first party slate, you've got Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bonanza, Metroid Prime 4, Hyrule Warriors Age War of Thingy, Kirby Air Riders. You know, there's five first party games between June and Christmas. That cadence should have me really excited rather than looking down the barrel of like a 300 quid price tag or 350 quid price tag.
Yeah.
I'm going to pay the price of the console again, where actually the story should be, it looks like Nintendo are going to release a game every two months. That's good. That's exciting, you know.
That suggests that largely what's been speculated, they've been sat on basically a gold mine of great stuff, because thanks to a slightly slower few years of the Switch, or at least padded out years with the remasters and stuff.
They could have paid for a whole generation of games with just the profit from Mario Kart 8 on the Switch.
Yeah. I think if they'd just gone 50 quid and 60 quid is the tears. I think it would just be, I don't think people would blink because they're used to it.
It's the fact they've leapt ahead of Sony and Microsoft. That seems like such an obvious own goal to me. I do not mean this as disrespect.
Visually, they are not as spectacular as the games on those platforms because the hardware simply not as capable. So, what is it you're paying for? Like, it's because Nintendo decided you need to pay that.
So, it's, you know, it's definitely, yeah, it's... Like you say, you think about... You price it up that way, potentially 350 quid additionally.
That's not a great story necessarily.
The harder sell and the big test is what happens with the third party games, many of which are probably going to be, and this isn't like me just being cynical down on the Switch 2, but you can just see from the trailers in the presentation, they are not going to be the best technical versions of any of those games. Elden Ring I thought looked quite rough. Cyberpunk, amazingly got it working, but it's not going to be the all singing all dancing, it's not the PS5 version.
But if those things are coming out at 60 quid, that's what hobbled the Wii U. That was the tragedy of it, not that the games were super expensive, but that people were charging you 50 quid for Mass Effect 3, 50 quid for Arkham City like five years after it was out on 360. Third parties come, they give it a go, get burned by charging too much for old games.
That's where it gets messy. The conversation for first party is different because there is just, no one makes Nintendo hardware work better than a Nintendo, and that will be true of this generation. Is anyone going to pay 60 quid for Hitman on the Switch 2?
I don't know.
Yeah, my reaction was that should be the price it is in a Steam sale on day one. There should be a limited time, like you want to buy all three of the Hitman games, like 20 quid, and you can play them all.
Oh my God. I mean, if that's- No one would ever do it because the amount, I imagine it takes a considerable technical feat to get these things working well on the Switch 2.
Yeah. It costs them money to get it looking worse, so they don't want to then charge you nice prices for them.
Yeah. Hitman, also an all-time great Steam Deck game. Just fantastic.
I will admit, I thought about the Steam Deck a bit during this presentation, because I thought when it came to the third party stuff, which was in the middle, there were like two sections of it, I think. It was like a good chunk of stuff. There's a couple of things that Nintendo are collaborating on, including the Duskbirds from software, which I was so down on.
I just thought it looked so like their own stuff just welded together. There's a big bed in it or wherever. I was just very much a shrug from it.
And the dinosaur.
Yeah. I just thought it just looked just a bit. I just wasn't really interested in it.
Even compared to something like Elden Ring, I understand why that's exciting. I got excited about that game. This looked a little bit like, I don't know.
I'm not even sure this looks as nice as Bloodborne did. And that's a 10 year old game at this point. But anyway, like it was.
Yeah. So I just had this reaction with the third party stuff of just being a little bit like, well, if your games are all going to launch on Switch 2 and you're going to give them fancy upgrades like they say that they're going to with Civ, they're going to give it the paid upgrade, suggesting that developers are going to maybe have the option of whether they decide to charge that upgrade if you already own the game on Switch. It makes something like the Steam Deck seem, specifically for third party games, seem like quite a good proposition because those games are in Steam sales all the time and your Steam account will carry across to the next version of the Steam Deck whenever they make that.
And I don't know if like, yeah, like you say, maybe that is, I don't know, there's maybe some just sort of like rumblings of I'm not quite sure that third party wise, this feels like it's going to be a slam dunk in the way that the Switch was, even though they were pushing it so, so hard. What did you make of that, the whole third party side?
The thing with the Switch being like a third party slam dunk and it was definitely better than it was. It was great for Indies and they were obviously the kind of miracle ports that never should have worked, but they managed to get them working Doom Eternal, Witcher 3, games like that. Maybe, are we actually in all those trailers in this presentation, are we looking at miracle ports again?
Is it actually a minor miracle that they got Cyberpunk and Hitman and Elden Ring working on Switch 2? We're obviously not Digital Foundry, we can't get into all of that.
But people obviously feel there is an audience for it. I just live in constant fear that it's only there for one go, and then people are like, we only sold 10,000 copies of Elden Ring on the Switch, so fuck that.
But I don't know, but then maybe the handheld, maybe it's good enough. If Hitman runs well on Switch, maybe I'll play it again. I don't know.
Why don't you say why you wouldn't? It was a PS4 game as well as a PS4 game. But I think it's more just like whether that's as immediately appealing.
Because obviously when the Switch launched, it was the first of its kind, that very specific form factor.
Because now you can compare it to other things, and probably even more to come in the next couple of years. So all these years of working writing about Nintendo consoles, the third party bit of it has just been so strange. Like the third parties I admire are people who made interesting, bespoke games for the hardware, crashed and burned every single time pretty much doing it.
Some of them got to eventually make their money back by porting them to everything, like Capcom, with Ghost Trick. Maybe that is the model. It's like, well, down the line, you'll be able to have a second go at this and it'll be fine.
The stuff I admire is not necessarily like the stuff that they were showing in that presentation. I own too many machines that play those things better elsewhere to be interested.
Yeah. It's such a different world to 2017 where you'd never, Stardew Valley on the go was such a USP for the Switch, even though it wasn't like a game designed for the Switch. It was, but that happened with so many games in that early part of the, in the early run of the console's life cycle the first couple of years.
So many of them sold so well. And yeah, it's just, it's such a different era now that I think it would take a combination of like low, like sensible prices and like actually good ports to make me bite on any of those games, because I wasn't immediately taken by any of them as such. Something like Hades 2 is exactly the kind of game that, you know, it's not out yet.
It's not been released on, it's in early access, but it's not like out in full. That's a game that I would buy on the Switch 2 for sure. You know what I mean?
Yeah, that, I mean, not that it's our game, but like you can see the appeal of the silk song, you know. But then that's just repeating things which were big early indie successes on the Switch 1, so they're pretty safe.
Again, pragmatic.
Indies were quite underrepresented in that presentation. Like, I didn't really get a good sense of like, you know, how many people are working on this thing? Are Nintendo going to be a bit more controlling?
Is the eShop going to be another fucking disaster full of crap? God knows.
Yeah, the test will be when something multi-format and splashy comes along and they release it on Switch 2 at the same time. And, you know, whether it's still kind of appealing based on that. Let's say like the, because Capcom were there and, you know, Street Fighter is not really our kind of game, but, you know, it's, let's say that the next Resident Evil game launches on, you know, both, you know, PS5, Xbox and Switch 2.
And then at that point, how many people buy that version versus the other two shinier versions? And I think that would be a litmus test of like, you know, how are sort of third parties fairing, how are like these non-exclusive games actually like fairing on the system, both technically, but also are people buzzed to play them on there?
Because, yeah, Borderlands 4 would be a perfect one.
Yes, exactly. That's spot on. A lot of those games are, you know, like Split Fiction and Civ have just come out, so they've only missed the boat a tiny bit.
But they're definitely getting better at closing that window. We've moved on from The Disaster of Wii U, see again, Mass Effect 3, Arkham City, to, you know, Switch where it was like Skyrim again, and you were like, oh, yeah, okay, sure. People will buy a second time to have a little handheld Skyrim.
That's novel. Maybe they've already experienced handheld cyberpunk. Maybe that doesn't have the same appeal to it.
I actually saw today from the hands-on, I think the only thing that did get dinged in the write-ups I read was the cyberpunk in handheld mode was quite rough, but was quite good on the TV apparently.
Well, again, I just couldn't even imagine wanting to play cyberpunk on there. It's like one of the shiniest, best things. It didn't even run on PS4 and Xbox One.
Well, that's it. This looks more that level of power, right?
Yeah, exactly. It looks so nice on PS5. It's one of the five games I'd recommend to anyone who's bought a new console.
It's like play this and just look how shiny it is. It's almost like a weird hint to that. I think Nvidia have come out today and said it's like 10 times more powerful graphically in the Switch and that's fine.
But the graphical power is never really the point. But for a long time, the Switch was the only handheld in town. It was the only home for any game that's not a modern AAA game in terms of its looks.
I don't know if this necessarily had the same pull. I kind of shrugged a little bit of most of those third-party games to be honest. I think it's good that they've got the support out of the gate.
But I share your tiny bit of hesitation. I don't know if this will quite have the same lightning rod effect that we saw last time.
I've just seen so many of these presentations where there's a guy from EA going, FIFA and Madden are coming to the Nintendo platform. And then it's inevitably ass, like an ass version of it, over and over again. They're always just a couple of years behind.
And to make parity worth it or even achievable. You just pretend that stuff doesn't exist. If I was making a magazine now, I wouldn't be writing about the EA or the 2K stuff, I don't think.
You know, that wouldn't be what the mag would be about.
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, well...
I'm making an imaginary magazine about the Switch 2 in my head, which is entirely healthy. What about the from software, Dustbloods?
Yeah, I just didn't really like the look of it. When I learned it was multiplayer, I was like, well, I'm never going to play that. I just don't...
I'm not interested.
I felt like... Because it's directed by me. It's me and Zacky's next game, right?
Yeah, he's like, he's working on it. He's in the... Wasn't he on the app as well, like doing a Q&A or something?
That was the thing that was promised.
I felt like, oh, this should be a huge mic drop.
Yeah.
That Nintendo have got... have basically bought his time, you know, the next thing after Elden Ring, it belongs to them.
Yeah, an exclusive.
I find it hard to have a read on it as someone who isn't, like, super into those games, super religious about those games. Will I have to be interested now in that some Nintendo platform? That seems like it's a bit of a bad way to behave.
You know, I can't pretend now I'm suddenly care.
Well, do you not also think there's a thing that happens now with from games, where the people who like these things are just like, yeah, and then the people who don't are like everyone else. And so there's not really anything in between where someone's like, oh, I'm kind of curious about this. I mean, like, Elden Ring was an open world game, and I think that did actually get more people to play these things than previously.
But in terms of the hardcore of the hardcore, who would have a point of view on this game, I do think, yeah, you're talking about the existing audience really, and how they react to it.
Yeah, part of me thinks, like, the Nintendo Platinum partnership, at its best, came up with some really interesting things where you got, like, a bit of best of both worlds. Like, Nintendo applied a little bit of their philosophy to Platinum, and you ended up with, like, Astral Chain, which I thought was just, you know, absolutely superb. And, you know, you don't really get the, only we know nothing about this, but this doesn't feel like a Nintendo Times From Software.
It feels like a Nintendo have gone, please, From Software, make us a game.
Yeah, which is smart, because it's a good collaboration to go and seek out.
It is, but personally, I would love to see From Software game that, like, goes through, like, the Nintendo internal process.
Right.
Like, how does that, what does that look like? You know, that's something I would be interested in, and maybe they will yet reveal that, yeah, like, maybe this is a slightly gentler into that world. As you would maybe think from a Nintendo platform, or maybe Nintendo will go, no, do not water it down on our behalf.
Well, I thought it was a softening of the edges in terms of the imagery in it. It looks a little bit, you know, as whimsical as these games really get in some places.
The dinosaur was dumb.
Yeah, well, I think it was a bit, the range of imagery was a bit too broad. It needed a little bit. And that's the one thing you can really depend on these games for, is they have a very confident visual identity.
And, you know, and all the like creature designs and stuff reflect that. This is a little bit more like, if someone had told me that another studio made this, trying to make it look like a bunch of from games, I might have believed them. You know what I mean?
Right.
Yeah. But again, these are not really-
I thought someone would describe it as a bit like, it looked a bit like Lies of P.
Right. But even then, I think Lies of P had quite a coherent visual identity. This was just a little bit all over the place, I thought.
It just, as it went on, I was like, what?
What?
It's more and more stuff, more and more like imagery it was drawing from and influences us. I just couldn't really get to grips with it. And then it's a multiplayer thing.
You're like, ah, I don't know if this quite lands the way it should, you know.
In the first minute of it, I thought it was a new Castlevania game. And I was really, I thought, oh shit, Nintendo have like tied Konami down to make a Castlevania game. That fucking rules.
I cannot wait. That's going to be so exciting. Then you do have that sort of thought process of, is this actually like a Bloodborne 2?
Surely not. Like, what's going on with that? Like, have they just like bought it out from under PlayStation?
I briefly thought it was a remaster, very briefly, you know.
Yeah. But then there was some imagery which is like, well, that wasn't in the first 20 minutes that I played.
Yeah. Yeah. So for some reason that was like, I was a bit like, I mean, I know there's probably a portion of the Souls audience that will really like this, but I was just like, I don't know.
And then Donkey Kong came along and I was like, oh, amazing. That's great. That's something I really want to play.
And everything was better from punching a wall.
I will say even though I understood why they did all the things they did with those third party showcases, almost none of it really moved the needle for me, which was surprising. I was like, well done, you got Hitman on a handheld. Well, that is good, again, without thinking about the idea that it might be a bit overpriced compared to the Steam version that's been out for years.
I did just think, well, those games are perfect for a handheld. They're just absolute all timers. They scale really nicely.
And they're really fun to replay. I mean, great stuff. But yeah, otherwise, I just sort of, eh.
I was like, ah, I don't really see what's significant about this. It's kind of actually a bit more in that vein of, well, you've got the games the other platforms have got, too, which is not really what even remotely what the Switch was about. So when it came to third party games.
But yeah.
But then that is the messaging of the interview, the developer interview. Everyone can play here and this is good for everyone. And maybe that is just the impression they're trying to give.
Yeah.
You know, they're making a fucking Air Ride sequel, Kirby's Air Ride. That's a really weird game to let Sakurai make a sequel to.
Yeah.
You know, that's quite bizarre. Yeah. I don't, I, you know, not to dig back into that.
I am really curious what happened second time round because the cult of Sakurai is so much bigger now. Like, I don't think people really appreciated, like, who he was back then.
Right.
You know, I rewatched his Sakurai YouTube channel episode about Air Ride today. And just to see if there was any glint in his eye of like, oh, I'm going to make one of these in two years. But he was still very proud.
He was like, this is a great concept for a game. Like, probably one of my favorite concepts for a game that I've done. And a racing game which only has two buttons, basically, is if you haven't played Air Ride, the original.
Yeah, I was about to ask, what is that?
Which back then, everyone went too simple. It basically isn't a game where now he's like, actually, it's beautiful and elegant, you know?
Yeah, you're right. The very specific way they put his name at the end of that trailer was a little bit unpres... It's not really a Nintendo move, is it, normally?
No, he's such a celeb now, you know? They gave him a Japanese knighthood for being good at YouTube or something silly.
Is this like... Do you think this is the bargain game to get him to make another Smash Bros, Matthew? Is that like what...
Do you think that's what's happened here?
I thought it was going to be Kid Icarus.
Yeah, me too.
They were always rumbling, so they were going to do it, and maybe they are going to make a remake with the mouse instead of the pointer controls.
That could work.
Yeah, but... Yeah, maybe it's literally he's got them over a barrel. Like, I ain't doing anything until you let me make my beautiful air ride sequel that I've always dreamed of.
Or something new. Let him make something new. That's also allowed.
Yeah, I mean, I guess like even that's a very different type of racing game. It is odd having that in the same directors as Mario Kart. You know, I don't...
Again, don't quite see that.
Within six months. Like, it's for this year. It's coming out this year.
Yeah, it's kind of bizarre. That's... Yeah, don't totally get that.
That's got big... Well, we released Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 next to each other vibes, where it's like, do you need both of those? But anyway, we'll see how that goes.
Except they're charging more for Kirby's air riders than they did either of those games.
It's very true. Anything else you want to say about the games, Matthew, before we get to one last thing, which is the... I think we should talk about the GameCube games being included in the Switch Online.
No, I hope none of this seems like we're just ragging on it. Obviously, the price thing could completely change the perspective of this console. If it has the same kind of crazy sales that the Switch had over the years, where often games could be slashed down to a five or whatever, mainly because it gamed the algorithm in the store, that's okay, I'd be up for that.
Obviously, Nintendo's games never will do that. There'll be like a third of them.
No, Nintendo games never will, but like, you know, if at some point that Hitman on Switch 2 is decent and is 20 quid, I'm like getting that, you know?
Yeah, that's true. I don't want to sound like down on this either, but I think it is just a transformative effect of having a game on Steam and playing it on your PC, but also having it on a handheld. And the thing I will say there, the Steam Deck is not a mass market handheld.
It's not widely available in different retailers. It is a niche device relative to Nintendo's handhelds. So I'm not saying that my perception on that is universal by any means, but I'm just saying that maybe since the Switch released, it's reframed what I think of.
Just that market has changed a lot. So how third-party games fit into that is a bit of an open question, and how much they make use of the expansion pack element as well to give these things a boost, or how many of these games get free upgrades, which I think is probably going to happen a lot as well, because not all these games will justify having an addition in the way the Civ is going to, for example. But we'll see where that goes, Matthew.
But yeah, I think the way I see it panning out for me is, I think by the end of the year, I will have the console, Mario Kart and Donkey Kong, and that might be it. But, and possibly Metroid. But that's probably where, where prizes are at now, I can see that's where it's going for me, a personal podcast about video games and make some living from doing it.
But yeah, what about you?
Well, I will have all those things, I would hope, as long as the pre-orders thing doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong. I will probably also have Air Riders and Hyrule Warriors because I'm a sucker.
Yeah, I think I remain optimistic and I just really want to see, I never ever regret buying new Nintendo hardware. Okay, the Wii U was a net loss overall, but there were definitely times where I had, I was having the most delightful experience with it. Even if the quality time I have with it ends up being maybe a hundred hours or 150 hours across like five years or whatever, as opposed to playing it as frequently as my PS5 or PC.
I just always want to be there to see what Nintendo is making. Yeah, I'm just hoping that the price war over these physical editions is so aggressive that we end up seeing some sub 60 prices on some of these games. Because that would really hit the spot.
I actually quite like that thing they used to do on the store where they sold those game vouchers that were like a voucher for two first party games. And as long as you pick the right first party games, you could save, you know, it was like, was it 100 quid for a voucher or 90 quid for a voucher? So you're basically getting a game for 45 quid.
You could get Zelda Tears of Kingdom for 45 quid from Nintendo. And if they have things like that, then maybe. I mean, that's probably why they've stopped doing the gold coin currency that you earn back on digital purchases.
Games are so expensive, you'd be able to buy a whole other game just from the gold coins you spent on Mario Kart. So yeah, that makes sense. There's just too much money going around to give everyone 10% of it back.
Yeah, and of course that 90-quid voucher now would get you basically one game and then with some change, basically, of where things are at.
One game and the tech demo that shows you how a Joy-Con works.
So I think it's fair to say we're both mixed on the price of the games, but I'm not mixed on the price of the hardware. I think that's actually quite realistic of where things are at.
I won't judge anyone who buys one, and I don't want to be judged for buying one.
Yeah, this is not Alamo we're talking about here. It's a very different world. So yeah, last up there Matthew, I thought it was worth talking about.
There's a few other things we haven't talked about there. I won't be buying the camera, for example. That's a no from me dog.
That big like WeSpeak energy. I don't want more cables in my living room.
Yeah, it's got the extra USB port on top for that as well. But no, thank you. Don't need that.
Again, I think that's when you talk about the price stuff. Like people were totting up. I think the Joy-Con 2 is a quite expensive standalone as well.
So it's just a lot of, it's going to be a pricey experience all in, even if you just try and do the slim down version of it like I'm going to. But one thing that was really cool is that the rumored GameCube games are going to be part of the Nintendo Switch Online plus expansion pack library. This seems to rule out the existence of a Wind Waker HD port, Matthew.
So that would appear to be a Wii U exclusive forever and ever, which is wild. I don't know if that will ever happen, but regular vanilla Wind Waker is in here. Thought that was really, really cool.
But also it was like F-Zero GX, which is going to be one of the games that will be there at launch. What was the third one again?
Soul Calibur.
Soul Calibur 2 with Link. So great stuff. Coming up, Ashley Day Classic, Chibi-Robo is going to be releasing on there.
It'll probably be the slow cadence we use to the drip feed of games. But this is something that I think people have always wanted from this service and they're actually doing it. Then all your existing tiers of the different Nintendo classics are coming over straight away as well.
So on that level, this is something the old game front, something they don't always succeed at, seems pretty good from the off.
Yeah, and increasingly, with the Switch 2 edition upgrades as well, like that Switch Online subscription, as long as they don't ramp up the price of that, that's becoming better value for money, especially if you've got the family membership. I think, you know, you're getting quite a lot of decent stuff now. Like the appeal of it gets better and better.
I like that Nintendo just like seem to randomly bundle in whatever they want in there, where they're like, oh, this bit of DLC, that's in there. That one upgrade, yeah, that's in there. These consoles, they're all in there.
But some of these consoles, they're in the expansion bit. That's a bit more expensive, but only like a couple of quid. It's quite a weird system.
But I think if you can get like seven mates together, split it between you, it's good value for money that way.
Yeah, for sure. It's definitely worked out well for me so far.
It's just not very good when they do a ballot for the next Switch 3. That's where you get stung. When you start sensing the Switch 3 is on the horizon, that's when you get the fuck out of that family membership, get your own membership and start playing a million hours of freaking Super Metroid on the SNES.
The one I was hoping to see when they were scrolling through the GameCube games was Eternal Darkness. I was thinking, that would be such a good thing to bring back. No, it wasn't there.
But I was like, you would hope that's something that they've got in their back pocket. But yeah, nonetheless it was cool. I'm really excited to see where that goes.
I imagine some major GameCube games, the ones that have already been remade, like Metroid Prime, no need to really have those in there. But yeah, it's nonetheless, if you get like 20 to 30 games, you've pretty much got the entire library sewn up. So yeah, we'll see where that lands.
That could be really good. Imagine if they just put like, yeah, Resident Evil and Zero on there, that would be good.
Yeah, that's a good shout.
Although I guess they've re-released those everywhere. Well, I associate them with the thing and it being quite exciting.
Adama, of course, Matthew. It's got a microphone built in.
Got a bit of freedom fighters on there.
Yeah, oh yeah, I like that actually. I hadn't really thought about that. The idea of accessing a bit of a lost generation of multi-platform games, that's actually a really good point.
I didn't really think about that, but.
Twin Snakes.
Yep, Hitman 2, but not the other Hitman games that released on other platforms.
Burnout 2, but not the other Burnout games.
Exactly, spot on. Yeah, so.
Very cursed.
It was really jam-packed. I had to write about it, and it caused me so much psychic damage trying to fit everything into one new story. It was like, oh, this is actually impossible.
Well, it was just so much crammed into there. So you definitely can't say it was a sort of like trimmed back showing from Nintendo. No, you don't have years worth of first party games in there, but it's quite evident that they're on top of their game when it comes to scheduling first party games, so there's not a drought of things.
Like you're saying, Matthew, very decent library going into the rest of the year. Well, good stuff, Matthew. Well, that's us done then, and I look forward to hearing what you make of the games when you play them next week.
I really cannot wait to hear what you think of Donkey Kong in particular.
Yeah, I was going to say, if anyone wants me to look for something in particular or answer any particular questions, I thought maybe if you go on the Discord, you could pop them in the pod questions bit. If you say, Switch question, capital letters, I'll do my best to answer those next week as well.
Yeah, they'll be right above, like, what's the best brand of mayo or whatever that someone else will put in there. I'm only joking, the Discorders do put some good questions in there.
I just want to play a Donkey Kong game really, because if I come away and I haven't played that, but I have, you know, I've played like an hour of fricking Joy-Con tutorial school, that would be a bummer.
Yeah, okay. All right. So that's a funny thought.
All right. So that's us done then, Matthew. Where can people get you on social media?
I'm at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and in Letterboxd. I haven't watched a film for weeks though. I've not updated it for ages.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both Blue Sky and Twitter and also Letterboxd. I've watched two Michael Mann films in the last week, Laster Mohicans and Thief, which was very enriching.
I'm weighing up watching The Keep Next, but everyone says it's rubbish. So that's, it's got a Tangerine Dream soundtrack, so I want to check that out. That's me on Letterboxd.
But the podcast is at Backpage Pod, backpagegames.gmail.com. I've got to say, actually, I found it slightly daunting to do a podcast where we don't get edited. I think I stuttered a little bit more than I normally do because I was like, fuck, I only get one shot of this.
I only get one shot. Like when they had Heath Ledger blow up the hospital in The Dark Knight. It's like that but in pod form.
You only get one shot.
The stakes are definitely the same.
Yeah, the outlay is the same for sure. Okay, Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
See you later.
Goodbye.
