I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, I saw on Twitter that you've totaled up 80 hours in Tears of the Kingdom now. I'm assuming the total goes even higher. How's it going with that fabled game that we will return to discuss at some point in July?
That's going great. I'm yet to finish it. I'm three dungeons in.
I've done 102 shrines. I basically got to a point now where I feel like wherever I want to go, I can probably get there. So is that mopping up?
I don't know. It doesn't really feel like mopping up. It still feels like exploration in the skies, but I'm having good fun.
I still occasionally will come across a Zonai device I've yet to see. And I'm like, oh, what's this for? I've got a thing that sprays out frost.
That won't be had. All I need is flame emitters to make hot air balloons. I'm like a big hot air balloon guy.
So all these other things, which I'm sure could be used to build incredible contraptions are of no interest to me. If it isn't heating a hot air balloon, I'm not interested.
You're not a big glider guy. You don't like those things.
I'm a big glider guy when I'm in the sky, but often it's height you need. And that's what the hot air balloon's all about. Because the other thing with a hot air balloon is you can just put wood in it and burn the wood and wood will burn forever and it's not battery powered.
So technically you can power something without using any batteries and then kick the batteries in whenever you need them.
You're like the first men, you know what I mean? Like who discovered fire? You know, just that's you basically.
That's what the game is about. It's about, it's basically like it's technology from like the dawn of time to modern day kind of crushed into this mad fantasy open world. And you're constantly making these discoveries and when you improve upon something, you know, they do sort of supplant them and you no longer need those earlier technologies.
Like it's really like an incredible depiction of like industry and yeah, like research and science is kind of mad.
Very slowly, you build your overriding take on what this game is, your wide take. But yeah, good job. You didn't have to review this one, isn't it?
In retrospect, that's-
Oh, I've been an absolute pig. I cannot imagine. I'm so glad I dodged the biggest of bullets.
I'm actually just doing the wind temple at the moment and it's with that little bird pal and it's all right. But once you get there, I think the actual thing you do at the temple itself is not as interesting as the journey up there, which is like this grand kind of platforming challenge. And that's quite interesting, where it's like how much of it is the thing itself versus the journey to get there.
Yeah, that's interesting.
I've begun treating the approach to the temples as part of the temple, because there's like platforming and it's kind of themed about what you're gonna get there. But once you actually get there, in a way, they're less sophisticated than the Divine Beasts, because they don't have the mechanical element where you can recalibrate the temple in some way. Though I did actually quite like the Fire Temple, which I've seen a lot of people are down on, which is like a little mine cart thing, but I quite like that.
Well, it's interesting as well, because I feel like the reason maybe that there's a truncated approach to these temples somewhat is that the game always thrives when you're outdoors, as opposed to when you're indoors. I suppose like there is a whole underground element to this game, but I feel there's a little bit of that to it as well, where the game is at its best when you are appreciating the scale of it and the journey to get somewhere. So why not make that part of the experience of those?
That kind of makes sense.
In the rhythm of that world, stopping to do like two hours of something wouldn't make any sense. So like the dungeons are maximum an hour, I would say, and even that the leap from a shrine to a dungeon is quite substantial. So the idea of like, oh, here's a three hour thing that's gonna stop you in your tracks.
It doesn't really gel with this design of Zelda.
Yeah.
So.
Especially because the Wind Temple journey was probably about one hour in total, just to get up there and to do all the different bits and pieces. And even then I was going fairly quickly. So yeah, I do like.
It's good bouncing on those little Viking ships. That's quite fun.
Yeah, exactly. And there's also the moments of realizing just how high up you are when you slip a little bit and then like a little bit of vertigo sort of kicks in. Wow, this is, yeah, it's really hitting me.
I think I'd feel very differently about that section if I had fallen off it properly. Because then I'd be like, fuck, fuck this section. I've got to get all the way back up there.
I had that at the start.
And so it's this amazing like high wire act where you come out the other end going, wow, I can't believe I did that. But I imagine some people did fall and now curse that section forever.
The bit where you bounce through the clouds in that bit, I think you alluded to it on that original Zelda pod we did actually, or at least like you discussed the experience of punching through the clouds when it's different weather. Actually, you might have just said that when we went for pizza, that might have happened. But either way, that experience in that section where you sort of see the four boats circling the big weather ball and like the sun, I assume that it's always doing this, but the sun was just setting when I got up there and it just looked like the most incredible thing.
And that like sailing from over there and then kind of like diving through that hole to get to the dungeon was pretty amazing as moments go. So yeah, it's sort of, I'm still not really digging the crafting, Matthew, but everything else about it is sort of ticking my boxes so far. So excited to return to that in July for the ultimate Tears of the Kingdom pod when theoretically the game is done.
You're getting Diablo 4 by the way. Is that something that's on your radar?
Yeah, I am tempted by it. But again, like I know that it's a game that rewards hundreds of hours of commitment. And have I got that?
I don't know. But then I also kind of regretted, I feel like I missed out on probably quite a fun time with Diablo 3.
Yeah, Diablo's 1 through 3 basically. Just missed out on those.
Well, I bought the remaster of 2 in a PlayStation sale a couple of months ago and that game is old and bollocks.
That's good, yeah. I'm glad you said it here and not on the 90s PC draft. That's a good sort of podcast tactical maneuver there.
Matthew, I was gonna give the listeners a quick rundown of what's coming up in June, if that's okay with you. And since we put the schedule out there and we like to bore people with the stuff that we're working on before we get into this episode, which is The Xbox 360 Draft. So that's what you're listening to right now, June 2nd.
Another draft, we thought it was about time. We'll get to that in a second. The Edge 10 episode with Chris Schilling is coming on June 9th.
Excel episode for Patreon subscribers, the best video game boss battles, volume two, the surprise second health bar, that's coming on June 12th. Should be a really good follow up to our very first Patreon episode that we did on there. So if you do want to back us, you can listen to both of those, see what we think about boss battles.
Our 10 most anticipated games on June 16th, sort of a reaction pod to what's going on in the vague E3 window that exists these days that stretches through the first half of June. So that should be fun to dissect.
Oh, E3, man, this is so underwhelming.
Okay, and so that was a pod that I did last year with Jeremy Peel and you were ill. Was that a year ago you had COVID then, I guess?
No, I wasn't ill, that was a family matter.
Oh, okay, sorry, yeah, okay. So yeah, I did that with Jeremy last year, but this year we'll do it with Matthew. Very simple countdown of things we're excited about.
Not seen any yet from the showcases, to be honest, so fingers crossed that that will change. And then June 23rd, a longer-awaited episode, the top five Final Fantasy games, that'll be a broader Final Fantasy pod. It won't talk about Final Fantasy XIV, so if you like to talk about that, MMO, lower your expectations accordingly.
XXL, another Patreon episode. The Indiana Jones rankings, June 26th, that hoovers up. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles that Matthew collected on VHS fastidiously as a young man.
Look, excited to talk about that. The three films, of course, Fate of Atlantis, a whole bunch of different Indiana Jones stuff thrown into one big list, so it should be good. And to Emperor's Tomb.
Yeah, of course.
Infernal Machine, PC and then 64 editions.
All the six out of 10 classics from the Indiana Jones back catalog.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
So that should be good. I'm really, actually really looking forward to talking about that. That's gonna be a lot of fun, I think.
And we were hoping that they'd have announced that Indiana Jones game by now, probably, but they haven't really done that, so.
Well, that might appear at the showcase.
I don't know. I don't feel like it. I feel like that was just a, it'll be out in four years.
Ask us again later kind of thing when they announce that. But fingers crossed. It does feel like the time to show it, doesn't it, with the film coming out?
And plus we both had that as one of our predictions at the start of the year, Matthew, so hopefully that pays off. And finally, Two Giant Men replay Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater on June 30th. That's a regular episode, and that's because they announced a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.
You probably saw that. So I felt like a good time to do that. Start to kind of kick off the journey to that game, I suppose, with a replay of a PS2 classic that's available in a very nice form on Xbox 360 for people who are wise enough to hoover that up on the store before it disappeared, and it will be on sale again later this year.
So those are the pods, Matthew. You excited about that bunch?
Yeah, I think that's a really nice bunch. I think that's a little bit of magazine, a little bit of current affairs, a little bit of retro love, a little bit of big blockbuster. I think it's got it all.
I agree.
I'd be very satisfied if I was a listener of a podcast.
Yes, and if I spent £4.50 on the XL tier, I'd be very satisfied.
Boss battles in Dan and Jones, they're both going to be classics.
Yeah, I've got one boss battle, I can't wait to discuss that from a game in the past year, so it's going to be good. But yeah, so that's us for June, and we're going to try and do the old one guest a month thing in going forward as well. We want to try and bring in more guests wherever we can, so look forward to that, whether they're mag people or games people or whatever.
So this episode, Matthew, to finally get to it after boring the listeners with all that stuff. The Xbox...
You're holding back the goods.
Well, no, I should go.
They all came for it. You know what they want. You can make them wait.
Yeah, that's true. You got the goods. You've already downloaded it.
Now it's too late. We've already got your stat logged in Spotify's podcast stats. So yeah, it's too late to take it back.
Though, so this episode is the Xbox 360 Draft. So why do this now? There was a reason for this.
When me and Matthew were talking about the drafts about a year and a half ago, we said that we should wait until we are clear of the best games of the different year episodes before we did this for the 360 and kind of pierced three times. Actually, we did break that rule with a wee, so I don't know what I'm talking about there. But the 360 felt like something we litigated for a while there, but we haven't discussed as much in recent times.
You think that's fair to say, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, there hasn't really been a reason to, so, you know, I'm sorry, that was very defensive.
No, I feel like the last time we really talked about this catalog in any detail was that Excel episode about backwards compatible games and all the seven out of 10 episodes. I think it's really come up in as much detail since then. So, you know, since it's been a long time since the best games of 2012, which kind of wrapped up, or 2013, which wrapped up the 360 PS3 era nicely, we thought we'd come back to it and do a competitive draft to pick the best 10 games that represent the journey of that platform.
So as usual, there are two parts to this episode. This is part one, preamble, if it wasn't fucking obvious in the last 12 minutes of podcast. But part two is gonna be the draft itself.
So we will pick 10 games across 10 different categories, take it in turns, and you will vote on the winner at twitter.com/backpagepod. So Matthew, to start with, the Xbox 360, it seemed like it was going to make good on the promise of the original Xbox when it came along. And what I mean by that was the original Xbox felt like it was Microsoft applying its very specific PC gaming leaning expertise to a home console.
And this came along very quickly after the original Xbox, actually, which launched in 2001, late 2001 in the US and 2002 in the UK. And this was already on shelves by late 2005. So very quick turnaround there, the 360.
But it sort of, while that might also explain why the console suffered from a fundamental defect that killed loads of them and put Microsoft support helpline on overdrive as they paid to sort the problem, it did seem like the 360 was immediately doing all the things that the Xbox did only better. So more integrated online features, these PC type genres coming to 360. They were already good at that Xbox, but here you launch with like Quake 4 and games like Prey and Mass Effect and Oblivion have a very PC profile.
There was this built-in hard drive as well, which is a very PC touch and had even better third party support than the Xbox did, which is pretty good. But this was, the 360 was kind of like the number one for video game publishers, it felt like at the time. So Matthew, with all that in mind, what does the Xbox 360 mean to you?
And do you think that's an accurate assessment of its starting point, at least, of like Microsoft refining what it already had in the original Xbox?
Yeah, I mean, that all makes sense. I didn't have a relationship with the original Xbox, because as you remember, no one in the UK owned one.
Oh yeah, yeah, no statistics there, but yeah, seemed legit.
No statistics and don't look it up, but I'm pretty sure that was the case. So, you know, obviously, like really the 360 was a completely fresh start. No, that all makes sense.
I've often thought the 360 was just sort of like, it put the nice console face on a lot of stuff, which I know people have been doing for years on PC, but was always completely baffling, you know, as someone who had tried to get into online gaming, but never really understood it. You know, I remember incidents of like, ringing up friends' houses with my PC, trying to like connect to their PC and things like that. Leslie!
Yeah, very much like that. Where's the queue? So the kind of appeal of something that could kind of tidy that all up and package it in a way that me, a console idiot, could really understand, is like a huge part of the appeal.
On a personal level, this is probably like the last console that I really enjoyed just purely as a punter. Like I did a little bit of freelance for the Xbox world, but this was like my, you know, I was obviously working on NGamer and writing about Wii and DS and that was great, but that was kind of the job. And this was very much like what I chose to play on and was like a much bigger part of my life.
This was the generation where I did play online games and a lot of my sort of social circle were also on 360 and 360 was like a key part of it. I wouldn't say that's maybe something like an inherent quality of the 360, although it made it very easy and very accessible. You know, other people have that relationship with PS4, PS5, Xbox One, you know, their consoles are a great connector, but like maybe this was just the right age the last time I was interested in those kinds of games.
Also the kind of games people were making, like the trends were very much to my tastes. So it's kind of like a bit of a perfect storm in that sense.
Yeah, I agree with that. I think that the thing that I admired about the early days of the 360 was that they, Microsoft had figured out their own angle on games that was noticeably different to PlayStation's angle, where, you know, PlayStation came into the PS3 generation, assuming I think that they would win outright because in the past generation, in PS2 generation, they'd have such unprecedented amounts of third party support. So, GTA obviously launched first on PS2 and that sold a hell of a lot of PlayStation 2s at the time, GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, did all appear on Xbox, but later on.
And so, PS2 was just the default platform for so many publishers and developers, which meant they came into it with a really strong, sort of like background essentially of, oh, well, there's no way we can lose because we have proved that we can win on the third party front over and over again. This was interesting because Xbox had already made moves to show what their kind of angle on games was somewhat in the Xbox, the original Xbox generation, when you had games like Morrowind come to Xbox or Kotor, things that were not appearing on other platforms. And I think that that did show where the PC gaming lineage sort of fed down into the console.
And so I think that's partly their starting point with the 360. It just means that they have those kinds of games, just as they are becoming quite sort of attractive to a mainstream audience. Maybe that stuff was more the domain of like niche dad fair, but there is a massive difference between how Morrowind is received and how Oblivion is received by a wider audience.
And suddenly on that front, with Xbox also having Mass Effect and PlayStation 3 not having it, they seem like they were ahead on something that had become quite important. And that happened while the 360, it also transpired, was much easier to develop games for than the PS3. Do you have any thoughts on that, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, I definitely remember like, you know, always looking at Digital Foundry and its early iterations and feeling very smug that my console played everything better. I mean, it was the big indicator in the office at the time was that everyone played 360. Like the people who worked on PlayStation Mags, they played 360 in their spare time.
Like we all chose to play that. If you had the option, that's where you play these games, which I think was like a big indicator of like where those things lay. Yeah, I thought it was interesting what you were saying about like, you know, this kind of like marriage of like traditionally PC genres and that they come over to 360.
I don't know, people seem to bet big on 360 in a way because they will not just bring in these games over, but like sort of adjusting them for console audiences. It's almost like people knew that that's where, that's where they'd be making like most of their money going forwards, you know, I don't know what would have inspired that jump to kind of like tame some slightly unwieldy PC genres and make them console friendly, because a lot of these things would have been in development before people knew 360 was going to be a big deal. So someone must have just really sold them on it behind the scenes.
Or maybe just like everyone sensed like, well, this is just the way the wind's blowing. You know, it's, this felt like a generation where I remember like people on PC Gamer sometimes being a bit miffed that, you know, they were beginning to get games which felt like they were console first, that would have been their traditional kind of fare. And that those games weren't being treated with like brilliant respect by PC ports and whatnot.
You know, it was kind of a lot of pushback against games built for controller first and things like that. So it definitely was happening.
Yeah, it was. And this was, you know, this was the first time you, I guess there are two parts to this. So I think that it was probably the first time they saw hardware that could actually run these games with parity and without like massive graphical compromise.
That I imagine was part of it. I also think that the reason you had so many Western developers diving in with Microsoft is because the Xbox actually was, I believe, starting to outsell the PS2 in North America in the last few years, the generation. I don't know, I do not have stats to back that up.
I've definitely like read that before.
This is a stats-free podcast. We're just going on like gut feeling anecdotes.
Source is not found, yeah. So I think that was part of it as well. The Xbox had at least caught up with the PS2 in North America.
And so there's more confidence in what Microsoft were doing. And they took, they lost loads of money on the original Xbox, but they made it happen. They made it happen very quickly as the excellent documentary they produced for the 20th anniversary of Xbox told that story of like the Xbox demo unit dying on stage at E3 and things like that.
They overcame these like massive odds to get out the door. And then 360 comes along and could be a more confident version of that vision. And there was so much to like about it as well in terms of like the interface, the old Xbox blades made the console feel very contemporary.
That original kind of like white model and just how it looked, it was such an elegant looking thing. The snap on, snap off hard drive just, it just felt really nice in the hands. And it felt right for the moment in a way that the PS3 with its massive amounts of varnish, placed it in the Spider-Man 3 font and sort of like the price, you know, did not tell that story.
Xbox 360 felt like the console for that moment. And the PS3 felt like it was someone's vision that could not be compromised for that moment. And that to me felt like the difference, you know, the, yeah, it's one vision of what the future is versus another and Microsoft happened to be correct with this one.
So yeah, I think that kind of differentiates it. So that's why to me it always lauded over the PS3. I mean, it was a mild source of tension, my then editor, I've definitely told the story before, but he was quite put out when I bought a 360 over a PS3, but I was chuffed.
The first time I plugged this thing in and just saw how clean the blade menus looked like, I looked on my HD TV, I'd never had a HD signal plugged into that thing and it just looked so beautiful. And then like booting up Graw 2, I got Graw 2, Rainbow Six Vegas, and Gears of War is my three games when I bought it in 2007. And Graw 2 just looked fucking incredible on my TV, I was properly blown away by it.
And so, that leap from SD to HD was arguably the last truly massive leap, right? And so, here was 360 doing that in a way that was affordable, it had tons of good games, both multi-platform games and also those exclusive to the system. Absolutely bossed it.
So, yeah, so the other thing I want to ask you Matthew was looking back, do you think the 360's catalog of great games is front-loaded in those first few years? Or does that greatness extend deeper into the generation when Kinect becomes more of a concern for Microsoft?
Yeah, I think definitely like things get a little murkier first-party wise. There's like a time where they're like riding this wave and it seems like, you know, Microsoft are making great games, loads of third parties are making great games, but like the later years, you know, you still have your, you know, your very shiny Tomb Raider and Dishonored and I think DMC, Devil May Cry, that was quite a late one. Like, plenty of people are doing interesting things.
I think maybe like the conversation had changed a little bit, or at least what Microsoft was saying and, you know, the introduction of like Kinect and their, you know, growing obsession with like the console was like the all-in-one kind of entertainment system at the heart of your living room and beginning to kind of forget the gamers a little bit. You know, arguably it's kind of like the flip of what goes on with PlayStation, who kind of get their act together first party as it goes on and start putting out like absolutely essential stuff like slightly later. Yeah, I would say, but yeah, I mean, I definitely like found stuff to enjoy and, you know, God, we had, you know, GTA V came along so late in the day.
And like, you can't really say it was weak with stuff like that.
No, I agree. The 360 as well always remained the multi-platform console of choice, right? So when Skyrim would come along in 2011 or even, you know, like DMC in 2013, I was still going to play on Xbox and not PlayStation, you know?
So that was even despite the fact that Sony had, you know, or whatever had happened behind the scenes. You know, the multi-platform games did get better on PS3. They, you know, by the end of the generation, there was a lot more parity going on.
But at the start of the generation, it was a real mess. So that's the thing to me is that the 360, and actually this does inform how I've picked games in the draft here. I think it was so many of these multi-platform games are 360 games to me because it's simply just hoovered up that mind share, you know what I mean?
It was just, I just regarded it as this is the platform where everything happened. So yeah, that's interesting.
Yeah, so that's definitely formed some of my potential picks of like, there's lots of things just have the feel of 360. A few things still have the feel of PS3 and don't make as much sense there, but I guess we'll get into it if any of those come up.
Yeah, absolutely. So, okay, this is the big question, Matthew, but I remember reading an edge piece in an anniversary issue. I can't remember how many years ago this was, but it was about how if it wasn't for the Red Ring of Death, the 360 would be a contender for the best console ever made, and it was on a page as a runner-up to the PS2, I think, which they gave that honor to.
So, objectively, Matthew, without your Nintendo hat on, is this the best video game console of all time?
I mean, I don't have the same relationship with PS2 that a lot of people had, and so I know it's mammoth, and I know the library is vast and so much important stuff gets decided. It's definitely the PS2 of this generation, and so maybe it comes down to which generation speaks to you more. Is it the formative days of those genres on PS2, or is it the HD era and seeing some of these things supercharge, which definitely brings in some amazing new franchises and genres, but also sees certain favorites trail off a bit.
What rules the roost in each.
Era is actually quite different?
I'm kind of in the same boat where I can't quite decide. I think the PS2, when we did that draft, felt like it had about the same number of great games to choose from, but the profile of those games was very different. So there is no real equivalent to the Silent Hill 2 on 360 or Shadow of the Colossus.
It's just Sony's domain was completely different game type. So they are quite hard to compare. But I think one thing that's different about this generation to PS2 is that the third-party games are of a much higher standard.
So the multi-format games step up massively from the PS2 era, I think. It becomes more competitive on that front. That's a bit of a vague point, but you know what I mean?
I think that's what I was getting at. If you actually look at the people who did incredibly well in the PS2 era, like Square Enix, Capcom, they take a lot longer to find their footing in this generation. They get there with some franchises, but the things that would once have been the benchmark for quality and also just dominated the conversation from how many of them there were, like Final Fantasy, that just...
this destabilises a lot of those. It's a bit like musical chairs. There's a huge amount of all change in this generation.
There is every generation, but it felt very clear here. I guess that third-party thing is part of that.
Yeah, I think so. It's a really quite complicated comparison to make, but there is definitely a period where it seems like Japanese game development is... There's a transition to make to the HD era, like you say, and that takes a bit longer.
So you do end up getting those high-quality games, but they take a slightly different form. This is quite a different generation for Capcom to the PS2 generation, really. It's more of the Lost Planet and Dead Rising type of game that feel a bit closer to what Western developer might make despite their quirks.
So there's a little bit of that going on. And obviously, a lot of the Japanese publishers try and make spin-offs of popular series with Western developers thinking that that will sell in a market that's become beset by Gears of War. We all know how that ended, like not well, apart from everyone except for Ninja Theory, of course, who absolutely bossed it.
So yeah, it's interesting, but that's what I found is I thought, when I was looking at the top 50 games on Metacritic for the 360, I was like, holy fuck, this is just, this is a really deep bench. And it's a very different bench to the PS2's library, despite only being a few years later. So yeah, interesting stuff, really.
The sea turned quite rapidly there. So Matthew, do you think there'll ever be another console like the 360? And I ask this because I don't personally feel like there's much point in us doing a Xbox One or PS4 draft because the generations have become, the platforms have become quite amorphous apart from a handful of exclusives.
There isn't a culture that defines multi-platform, that defines these kinds of consoles like they used to be, do you think that's fair?
Yeah, I think this comes back to the kind of right console, right time and also matching tastes at the time. This was the console that was lucky to usher in online gaming becoming really accessible and being really great and making some big leaps, like when Call of Duty Modern Warfare comes along, whatever you think about it, the kind of structure and the online, the persistent account and your profile that you're working towards, it just gives so much shape to that online game and really changes everything. Like that's about as much online interaction as I had.
I think the next generation is defined by games of service, and personally, that isn't for me. I don't have the time for that and everything becomes, I think the online gaming in this era would happily support you as much as you wanted to play, where after this online gaming becomes more about commit or else. And it's just a very different vibe.
So I think more it's about where the industry's gone, isn't as much for me. And so any machine won't ever quite have the same appeal within it.
Yeah, it's that massive focus on single-player games, right? And there being so many single-player options for you to enjoy, and not all of those single-player games being 30 hours long plus. You know, which is more the standard now as people fight pre-owned sales or whatever it is that they're worried about when they make longer games.
So that was one of the reasons, you know, I think I said this on the Rezzy 4 podcast we did, but Capcom has smuggled in old-sized games by making them Rezzy games. So you always expect Rezzy to be a certain length and no one complains about it, because who wants to play a 40-hour Rezzy game? No one does.
Like you want that sharp shock. So yeah, it's interesting. Another thing that I think has changed a lot since then, Matthew, is this is really specific to this generation, right?
But for a while, Sony and Microsoft were both fighting this downloadable game, downloadable content war that was running parallel to the main console war. So you had the arrival of Xbox Live Arcade, we had the smaller download-only games, and then PlayStation would do the same in kind with the PlayStation Store. So on 360, you have things like Castle Crashers and Explosion Man, and that would just run and run when they start doing these summer or winter of arcade initiatives, rolling out these new games and turning each one into this massive event, which was cool because there were so few downloadable games around at the time, relatively speaking.
Now, there are so many downloadable games, you couldn't really do anything like this curatorial in quite the same way. But I think it meant that those games were incredibly appealing. That's how I felt at the time where it's like a new game drops and it's 1200 points, but everyone's given an 8 out of 10.
So, of course, I'm going to download it. There was a bit of that going on. Do you have any thoughts on that side of things, Matthew?
Only that it was great that they called it points, so you didn't think about things in terms of money. Yeah, I guess again, that's just part of like, it's another part of gaming, which is obviously massive now, like independent games, kind of like finding its feet, but in a kind of manageable way. I guess a lot of stuff that happens in 360 is kind of what we have now.
It's just more manageable. And that's what I like. I don't feel bad about anything.
I feel like I could be on top of things quite happily back then, which now it's just not true. Like if you play something, it feels like you're not committing to one thing, you're ignoring a thousand others. And yeah, that's probably not the right point.
No, I get you. I just think it was really exciting because there were game types that had been out of vogue for such a long time, since the 90s, that were suddenly back in. And things that could just become phenomenons like Trials HD taking off on Xbox and becoming like a leaderboard phenomenon.
And that lead to things like Joe Danger or even like Limbo, of course, which was a very startling debut. And these game types now that I think Jay alluded to this when he came on the podcast talk about Cassette Beast, but you actually couldn't launch these games now and get the same attention you got then with the same like resources and stuff like that. You got to do more now to stand out.
Like a Braid or a Limbo could fade very easily into the background and probably has. There probably are games of that quality that we don't know about or they have only sold like 300 copies or something like that. But this was an era where those games could have a real spotlight.
And people were like, everyone talked about Braid. That was just everywhere. It wasn't really for me, even though I kind of like admired some of the things it was doing thematically, but it was quite cool that those games could just hijack the conversation at the time, because there were a few things around generally, right?
Yeah, no, that's all very true. We haven't mentioned the achievements of it all as well. Which was a thing.
Definitely.
A big powerful factor. So much of this stuff, it was just, it must have been the same everywhere, but in the office, there was just such an instant ecosystem for this. It was just so easy to play things.
And even games that weren't online, online, like your trials with the leaderboards, I can just remember people talking about it at work and being incredibly jealous. Basically, if you were friends with Jason Killingsworth on Edge, you would never dominate in anything. You'd always be eating his fucking dirt in whatever game had his ghost, trial ghost in it.
But it's just a real fondness. Do you think people have continued that on PS4? Does that exist just for a younger generation?
The thing is, I never quite got the feeling that trophies had the same instant compare appeal thing. Like I did use to compare a bit on PS3, but on Xbox, since I've come back to the Xbox ecosystem with the end of the Xbox One generation, I do compare points sometimes. I mean, there are, arguably the Game Pass has made that a bit too arbitrary because you have a million games that are like one out of 20 achievements unlocked.
But I could never look at a trophies list and understand how one person was better than the other at something. Whereas all you had to do on Xbox is look at those, compare those two points scores and you got it instantly, you know? So it was a real cultural thing for sure.
Like definitely like the Platinum is sort of genius in terms of like, if you get everything, you get the Platinum and it's a real kind of like badge of honor, it's like a stamp on that game. And I guess you can compare Platinum counts with people, but outside of that year, right? It's instantly kind of like, oh, loser, I got five bronzes and three silvers and you've got two bronzes, two silvers and a gold, which I think means I'm technically ahead of this.
And yeah, just give us a number.
It was appealing though. And it did make me play games in ways that I wouldn't normally play them. Arguably that was a bit unhealthy, but I don't know.
I can't say that I got anything but joy from that as a whole system. Like it did make me live in my games a bit more. I did play a lot more of Dragon Age Origins probably than I would have normally because I thought, wow, if I keep going, I'd get over 1000 G because it's DLC in this one.
So yeah, yeah. It sort of definitely pushed me to get more out of my games, so yeah.
Yeah, it definitely pushed me into like bitter places with the likes of Jason destroying everyone at trials and in the office, like Matt Pellett always had a game of score that was like miles ahead of anyone's. Like he broke 100,000 years before anyone else did in the office. And it was just, you know, it got to the point where people were buying like shitty games that had famously easy achievements.
King Kong. Or like there was like a black market for like Avatar, you know? Yeah.
Because you could just hammer a button, you got like a thousand points. I think there was like one copy of Avatar that got passed around like every 360 owner in the office. So everyone had that thousand points.
Incredible.
Or like there was some Doritos game on XBLA. Like a free Doritos game.
I think that's backwards compatible now, that game, I think.
Yeah, Doritos Crash Course.
That's like the height of like the sort of big feel era, basically, was making that bring that back to Xbox. I think that was quite the thing. But yeah, that was very true.
Also the games that would outrageously have odd number achievements, like two or three at the end of them, and you were like absolute motherfuckers. Only a joker level fucking evil genius would try anything like this. But they were clearly only doing it to fuck with people.
And so you'd also get these FAQs of how to fix your gamer score, i.e. how to add two points on the end such as five or zero instead of a one or a four or whatever. And it was quite deranged, I suppose.
But I was in my 20s, so it seemed fine. If all this happened in my 30s, it might have felt more like a waste of my time. I don't know.
Yeah. I just think achievement culture now just doesn't feel quite the same. Like it's just too much.
We get into the realms of like, here's the Master Chief collection, which has got like 10,000 achievement points or some bullshit like that. And you're like, well, I'm just never going to do this. There was a glimmer of like, you might be able to kind of keep a foothold back on 360, but now it's just an absolute like wasteland of single achievements in Game Pass games.
It's all, it's quite sad.
Yeah, it really is. Just to also kind of like underline though, like how vast this library is, Matthew. I scrolled down through the Metacritic list, right?
And I've gotten to the number 200 mark, right? And the 200th game on Metacritic with an 84 score is Bulletstorm. And above that is DJ Hero.
Above that is Worms 2 Armageddon on XBLA. And above that is Need for Speed Most Wanted. Now, that is a fucking deep catalog right there.
But that's like so much critical acclaim for so much stuff. It was, yeah, it was a very good time. So it makes this draft all the harder to pick what represents that catalog out of just from 10 games.
So it's going to be interesting.
Thanks for reminding me that Worms 2 was, or Worms Armageddon was an XBLA, because I'll add that to my list.
Yeah, it goes straight into the free pick category. So yeah, take that Vanquish, or whatever you would have picked. It would have been Vanquish, would it?
But yeah.
I'm not going to say.
Okay, last question, Matthew.
You can't use your mind games on me.
No, that's true. Although I did, how do you feel about me kicking the orange box out of the running at the very last minute, Matthew? Are you okay with that?
Yeah, that was fine. I thought that might be a bit of a draft ender.
Yeah.
Thus it being like, you know, quite high on my pick list.
Yeah, and I just thought that it kind of belongs to PC a little bit, the orange box. It was a big deal on 360 as well, I won't lie, but you know, the Team Fortress 2 element of it and stuff like that, very much a PC concern.
Did anyone ever play Team Fortress 2 on 360?
I'm sure someone did, because it was like vanilla, right? They never updated it as far as I'm concerned.
Oh, it was so fucking, I remember going into it and just being like, nope, I don't understand this at all. I don't understand what any of these characters do. I don't even understand what I'm trying to achieve in this game, like, am I even playing?
Very confusing.
That's funny. That's got the vibe of like you bought a box of chocolates and one of them is some strawberry licorice thing where you're like, absolutely not. And you just spit it back into the box.
That's Team Fortress 2 experience for you on Xbox, I guess. Okay, Matthew, final question, and we'll get to the draft. So if you could add one non-backwards compatible game to the Series X library from the 360 catalog, what would it be?
I actually found this quite difficult. So a lot of the stuff I want is on there. Like, it's pretty good.
It is very good, yeah.
Oh, I don't know if this is a good one at all. I was thinking, what about Chronicles of Riddick, a sort of darker theme?
That's a great one, yeah. I completely agree with that. Because you could get that on PC, but in theory, it should just be on Xbox too.
Yeah, it's a bit of a pain in the ass, that one. But yeah, I thought that might be a case. I wondered about Hitman Absolution.
Is that really not backwards compatible? Is it?
I don't think so.
Okay, that's strange. You'd have thought they'd have gotten that on there, I hope. Didn't they do a new collection of them for Xbox One?
Was that a thing they did, so you could play? Maybe it's like blood, money, contracts and Absolution in one pack or something.
And maybe that is on the list. It's quite confusing. There's so many games to scroll through.
It's kind of easy to see through some of them.
Yeah, well, I've got a couple of picks here. So Lollipop Chainsaw, that was my number one. So, you know, Enby, I'm not a pervert.
I'll just make that very clear. That game just probably is trapped in Limbo because it has so much licensed music on it. Very much the vibe of James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy films is in this game, but it's a bit more on the trauma anarchic side.
It's kind of horror pastiche game. I've talked about it before, but it has some Suda 51 involvement and it's like quite good as a combat game, but really good as a hang, like great script and really funny and just a great time, just loads of style to it. One of the better non-no more hero Suda games, I would say from this era.
And so that side, I also put Condemned 2 in here, Matthew, because you're going to only play the first one on Xbox Series X. And that's a truly nasty depraved game that should probably have been excavated. That feels like it would have been a good show.
So yeah, just have to play that one on my dusty old PS3. So Matthew, should we have a quick break and then get to the draft?
So, the draft, what are the rules of the draft? So, we each have to pick 10 360 games from different categories, and then you will vote for the winner at BackpagePod on Twitter. We'll tweet out the list on the Monday after this episode goes live.
We'll recount the list at the very end of the episode too, so you kind of know what's going on, as you're going into the voting. But basically, it's about picking the best 10 games that represent the 360s catalogue. Matthew, is there anything else to add here on the criteria?
I would say, as always, when it comes to voting, look past petty politics, and if someone said a good zinger or not in the episode, really think about the list. Don't just do it to annoy the other person. Vote, we want an honest answer here.
Neither of us will be upset if we lose, he said. So, we really want to think about it. It's important.
It's interesting, because I think the Capcom Draft is maybe the most even one we've ever done, and I felt like I had won too many Resi games, and you lost ever so slightly in the end with that one. But I feel like it's the 360 Ultra.
That's because I picked some fucking glass rose or whatever it was.
Yeah, a cracking reference to that in last week's Gamescore that I wrote and said out loud. And yeah, but that was fun. But this one, I've got to say with the Capcom Draft, we each took things the other person wanted quite a lot.
And so it meant that it was really, you were looking at the other person's list and they had like three or four things you definitely wanted and then lost out on. This is gonna be a bit harder to sort of call if that'll be the case because the library is so deep. There are some genres there where it feels like there might be only one or two truly great picks.
So, that factors into it a little bit. Matthew, shall I read out the categories?
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay, category one, Xbox Live. So, a multiplayer game. It can be multiplayer in any form.
So, co-op, competitive, et cetera. Category two, XBLA. So, something badged with XBLA, a downloadable only game that came to 360 at this time.
Category three, first person shooter, very obvious. Category four, role playing game. Category five, one of those sevens.
People who have been listening to podcasts a long time wouldn't know what that means, but it has to. I think the other person could possibly veto it if it seems like they're picking an eight or a nine, Matthew, but it feels like it should be self-evident when you pick it that it's one of those sevens. Category six, exclusive game.
So, a game that came to Xbox either exclusively for the rest of the generation or came to Xbox 360 first before it came to other consoles or was on PC as well at the time. So, basically, it didn't come to PS3 when it came to 360, I think is the criteria really there. Category seven, licensed game.
Category eight, open world. Category nine, wild card, so something weird from the library. Category 10, free pick, anything you want.
I'll read those out before we get into it. Matthew, how did you find these categories when it came to selecting candidates for this draft?
They're very broad. There are some absolute monster games that can go into many of these categories. I don't think many of them are like danger categories where you can seriously fuck yourself.
I feel like I've got a couple of backups for each one, which makes me feel good about myself. Weirdly, Wild Card is a little tricky. Because I don't think 360 goes super weird in the way that some other machines do.
There's maybe some crossover between Wild Card and one of those sevens.
That's true. Here's a good question to ask, Matthew. Would Bayonetta count as a Wild Card?
I don't know if it could. I wonder if it has to be stranger than that.
The thing is, by 360 standards, that is quite weird. Because it's quite conservative. It's quite trad.
I sometimes think Wild Card is secretly, try and pick a bad game.
That may have been what you did with the Glass Rose, but I'm not saying you should do it here for this category.
Listen, we'll see what the other person picks. We can debate it if we feel like. We can talk this through as gentlemen.
I'm not necessarily saying that Bayonetta is not a Wild Card, because I did consider it for this category. Then I thought, well, okay, I've got something else slightly weird and I'm probably going to select for it instead. But whilst they're thinking, it's interesting because that's a game that you could only really slot into one other category here.
That's kind of why I ask, basically, is I don't exactly know where the line is on some of these categories. And feeling that out may be a bit of a discussion back and forth, you know?
If either of us think the other is taking the piss, I'm sure they'll say something.
Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, one of those sevens will also be interesting. So I wonder if you will allow my pick, but we'll get to that when the time comes.
So, like I say, you can vote.
The orange one. I'm like, no. In what world is that a seven?
And you're like, well, it's got Team Fortress, which is probably one of those sevens.
Amazing. Yeah, Half-Life 2 Episode 1 is more of a seven than the rest. So, yeah, you can vote for the winner at twitter.com/backpagepod.
I will pin the tweet to the top of the Twitter page, so you just have to click on the vote. You, along with many members of Matthew's family and a big WhatsApp group. I'm only joking, Matthew.
Don't try and say that I've got this huge base that I can rely on. Like, that isn't true. It's like, it's five people tops.
Well, look, but the Capcom Draft did sway massively in your favour and then sway back again. And I couldn't work out why. And I just wondered if there was a lot of people who look a bit like you voting for you.
But, no, I'm only joking. That's just, I'll try and keep the shit talking to a minimum. We'll have a good, clean draft and a thoroughly good time.
That's what will happen on this podcast. So yes. Okay, Matthew, last thing then.
I'm just gonna read the categories out again. So category one, Xbox Live, so multiplayer game. Category two, XBLA game.
Category three, FPS. Four, RPG. Five, one of those sevens.
Six, exclusive. Seven, licensed game. Eight, open world.
Nine, wild card. Ten, free pick. So, as of a Matthew-
And the, we're not doing the snake draft as per usual, right?
No, we're changing it up, because someone pointed out that the way we were doing it, which was someone gets to go first, then the next person picks two, then the next person picks two, and so on and so on and so on, is a bit unnecessary when it's only two people. You only need that first, the person who goes second to pick two games, and you can go back to taking one game at a time. So that's how we're going to do it this time, because I think it also, the back and forth is maybe slightly better for the podcast and allows for maybe more considered discussion.
It's a bit more like how we did it at the start, so that's what we're going to do. So whoever goes first, yeah, we're going to go from there. Matthew, do you want to do the old coin flip, figure out who's going first or?
Yeah, what would you like?
Tails.
Tails?
I get this every time. Are you just letting me go? I just don't...
No, I honestly...
Because the thing is, the reason Matthew does this is I can't be trusted, because I would fuck over Matthew, because I'm a much pettier man than he is, a much more pathetic individual. So I get to pick when I go first or second, don't I? Yeah.
Fuck, that's a hard one for this console.
I think you should go second.
Thing is…
Get two juicy picks off the board. How much damage can I do with one pick?
But there may be one game from one series that I think is like, if you don't get that one, it's tough. But I may live to regret that.
But we may have very different takes on what the most precious game is.
Yeah, that's true. But nonetheless, I'm going to go first. So my first pick is going to be Category 3 First Person Shooter, and I'm going to take Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
Interesting.
So when I weighed up the Call of Duty series on this console, this is clearly the standout. They are all kind of like the pattern for what a first person, a linear first person shooter is set here, and then it basically adhered to for the rest of time. It's a foundational cinematic game that flips perspectives like the old Call of Duty's did, but does so to tell a much more cinematic narrative than the World War Two Call of Duty's did.
Obviously, it updates the setting, but it has a much more involved kind of narrative of all the thrill rides that were built over the years by, you know, by Infinity Ward and then by Treyarch. This is clearly the best one. They've never quite matched it.
At the same time, it was married to this foundational Xbox Live multiplayer game, which I know you played a shitload of, Matthew. I played some of and was very petty and threw some tantrums during it. But I think that combined means it's just an essential pick.
And I don't know if any other Call of Duty quite sums up the 360 era as well. And there are other FPS series that are important on Xbox. There's a massive generation for that genre.
But COD4, I felt like the one where there was no alternative I'd be happy with. And the other ones, maybe there are some alternatives I'm happy with. So yeah, that's my first pick, Matthew.
Thoughts?
Oh, and I absolutely love this game. Probably like one of my, probably still my most played online game. Playing with my friend Cyrus, sneaking around, doing my little snipey bullshit, protecting my incredibly high accuracy ranking at all costs.
Yeah, and yeah, like you say, the kind of campaign that kind of establishes it all. Yeah, so it's a really good pick.
Yeah, so there is one other thing that I was weighing up for this, but yeah, it's, which I think you'll probably take now, but what can you do? Okay, so yeah, onto your first two picks, Matthew.
I think for my first pick, I'll go open world and take Red Dead Redemption.
Interesting.
I thought this was quite a precious one. Thus picking it first, obviously. Rockstar's open world, World West game in an incredible taste of that sort of Westworld fantasy.
A world which I just had an amazing time pottering around, hassling people. It's a great kind of rascal simulator, the kind of nonsense you can get up to in it. Of all the kind of open worlds, I think this was the one that kind of came out of nowhere, surprised anyone.
Obviously, there's GTAs in the mix as well. Maybe the case is that it has been bettered so much by Red Dead Redemption 2, but I still think this has a character and tone all of its own, that it's still a decent pick. I think it's a definitive game of this era, big on 360.
Maybe if I've got it on my 360 mini console, I'll finally try the online. Who knows? But I'll certainly be tying up lots of people and dunking them on the train tracks.
Yep.
So an absolute favorite of mine. Weirdly not my pick for this category, but obviously it was my backup pick. So yeah, just a bolt from the blue, incredible.
Did everything you wanted from a Wild West open world game. I know Matthew, you're not as big on the ox patting stuff towards the end with your family. Famously down on that.
But it did also do something different with the Rockstar open world. We had this flat, white, hot Mexican desert to these snowy mountains. And even though you're only really journeying about four minutes on horseback, it did feel like a very coherent world and the wildlife would change around you.
It's the first time that Rockstar would simulate wildlife in that very meaningful way. So yeah, just a really important game in the growth of that studio. Because it feels like in some ways as well that from this point onwards, from Red Dead onwards, GTA becomes kind of a fusion of, well, I guess we're just talking about GTA V here, but I imagine we'll see it in 6 as well, that combination of like wild open spaces and dense city areas.
And so San Andreas sows the seeds for that. But this is the first time they've simulated it and done it in that really detailed, hyper detailed form where it feels like you're in a real place. So yeah, don't know why I'm doing so much talking up for your game, but it's a good thing.
Well, thank you so much. I mean, you make a much more elegant case for it. I was just thinking, like, I really liked fucking with people in that first town.
Just going into the bar, shooting someone, seeing how much trouble I could get into, climbing up onto the roof of the saloon and shooting people in the street. I mean, it really, for a studio which has this desire to kind of tap into the sort of cinematic fantasy, I don't think they ever really did it any better. Like, this for me is more of a cowboy fantasy than GTA's tapped into a crime film fantasy for my money.
You didn't feel the same thrill when you were chewing tobacco to improve your aim in Red Dead 2, Matthew?
Yeah, just neck and tin peaches while I shot everyone in slow motion. Thoroughly weird game. But, yeah, this one's a little bit more manageable.
It's a little bit more polite to actually kind of go back to. I know I'd probably still take two over this, but, you know.
For 360, yeah.
It's on the box of my mini-console. I'm not upset about that. For FPS, and I think this is valid because it's the perspective.
Take Bioshock.
Yeah, good pick.
A really definitive 360 game, definitely. Well, I think for everyone, but in our office, I can remember. Bioshock is the game I got when I got the 360, so I didn't have one before that.
And I can remember everyone talking about it and listening to all the guys on PC Game and PC Format and the other PC mags, of which they were more at the time, obviously. And it was just so much chatter about, like, you've got to see this thing, this world. There's nothing else quite like it, what it does with the storytelling.
Like, it is a game with brains behind it. And obviously that means other smart people are drawn to it and like to kind of like lay into it a bit. But I still will always value, you know, a game with aspirations to say something a little bit more meaningful or have deeper ideas about something.
I mean, that aside, I just think it's just an incredible bit of like world establishing, one of the all-time great game openings. Like, I'd be happy to just boot that up and see the kind of like the sinking down to the city, I give you Rapture and all that. I think it's, you know, a really like top 10 gaming moment for me.
That and so forever kind of like entwined with with what 360 is. But, you know, a fascinating kind of horror shooter in its own right, slightly ridiculous sort of powers, but still, you know, I think that the kind of the rhythm of it that you have enemies attacking you, but you also have these like major threats that you can choose to engage. And the idea of kind of like, you know, building, you know, preparing an area to take on a big daddy and kind of psyching yourself up for those fights.
I think still very sort of singular moments. And, you know, this series, you know, people debate about what's the best one or whatever. But for my money, like as much as I loved like the world of Bioshock Infinite, I don't think it ever really had the same kind of hook as that big daddy thing.
Some great sequences in it. It's just an old timer.
Yeah, absolutely. I think that the this kind of represents the biggest moment I remember of being clubbed over the head with how how far along Western developers were at the time and how this was suddenly what the center of games was. Because I think like you were alluding to earlier, Matthew, this is the era where a lot of PC developers, they soften the edges slightly so console players can play them and enjoy them.
And I think that that yields such good results and accessible games that are still incredibly deep, you know. So this is the, you know, perhaps the best example of that, of this generation of just, you know, what they, what Irrational were doing with System Shock 2 boiled down to something you can play, you have in your hands, but that also looks absolutely astonishing as a, you know, HD proposition, where the art direction has held up so well because it was so vivid and imaginative and such amazing talents working on it. So it's really stood the test of time.
I think I agree. Definitely the opening of Bioshock is the thing where I'm like, it's never a bad time to just play the first 10 minutes of that game and just get into that first area and be like, oh, wow, what a game. And also just the reactivity of the world, just doing things like, you know, shocking the water with your electric powers and just watching it conduct and setting oil on fire and things like that.
And also just the soundscape of Rapture was so memorable as well. These weird voices you hear from the Spices over and over again just really gave that city so much life. What a series.
We should definitely do a Bioshock pod at some point whenever they get around to revealing that new one, Matthew. That might be good. I do love that series.
So yeah, good pick. That was definitely something I wanted. But what can you do?
That is the nature of the draft, Matthew. So next up then for me, I'm going to go for Category 6 exclusive. I'm going to take Fable 2.
Yeah. So this is interesting category in the sense that, you know, there are very few games that only come to 360 from this time. But this is one of them.
This is, you know, Lionhead's attempt to build on the ideas of Fable, an action role playing game that was basically promising to be a life simulator. Then I think underdelivered in some people's eyes. This refined that while also having an absolutely probably this is probably the most complete vision of what Fable was trying to achieve, I think, in terms of, you know, terms like you simulate that life and immerse yourself in this British infused fantasy.
I guess like Pratchett infused fantasy world, Matthew. And so, yeah, like a little bit. I guess that's maybe a bit of a lazy comparison, but certainly had its own its own tone, just like certainly not an open world that an American developer would make.
It felt very British in its its construction, its outlook and its sense of humor as well. Hence the farting as we discussed previously, although I suppose people from all nations can appreciate farting, can't they? Anyway, and also has this absolutely killer time jump element in it, which is such a great narrative device.
And I think that when you play Fable 3 by comparison, it's just it's hobbled by that very quick ending, despite also being a very good game, I think. And in a lot of ways, it takes that fantasy setting forward to the Industrial Revolution and, you know, and definitely adds something itself. But this is the one where I was like, OK, this is a this feels like the quintessential Xbox adventure to me.
There's something about this that sums up what this platform is, what this platform is going for. And yeah, just and it's just incredibly endearing. And I think the reason they're rebooting it now is because a game that has this much personality and views, it just remains so memorable.
It just it's so easy to love, I think, as a series. So while I think it's like dated in some ways, for sure, it's a blurry ass game when you play it now. It's still a special one off, I think, Matthew, despite there being other entries in the series.
Thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, I love this game. I've always thought of it as kind of the RPG in Fast Forward. It doesn't want to kind of drag you out to 100 hours.
It's happy to show you everything it has in like 30 hours. And it's all done in the name of humor. You know, everything's like written in shorthand.
Like when you find a book, it will be a couple of funny lines rather than having to read, you know, oblivions, like page after page of text. There's someone who wasn't into like grand high fantasy set in open worlds. I thought Fable 2 and Fable in general.
It's just like it's the antidote to bloated fantasy RPGs. Yeah, a really great game. I absolutely love this.
I would have 100% have put this on my console if I was able to get it.
Yeah, I did. I'm actually surprised this wasn't in your first two picks, but you made two good picks.
I just didn't think you'd go for it.
Oh really? That's interesting. There's nothing else that quite hits in the exclusive category for me in the same way.
Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah.
I think my exclude... Well, we'll see when we get to it.
Okay, well, you know, we'll get to Banjo Nuts and Bolts later, Matthew, but aka the Tears of the Kingdom prequel.
They fucking wish. No, I'm not getting into that.
No, we'll save that vitriol for the behind the paint wall. That's what the patrons for to take shots of the listeners. So your next pick, Matthew.
My next pick.
So fucking hard. We're going to miss so many games, man.
Yeah.
Will Assassin's Creed, a key 360 series, even come up in this draft? I don't think it will.
For a licensed game, I'll go Batman Arkham City.
Nice.
Like I say, a bit of a multi-format game, but this is where I played it. This is where multi-format felt like it really lived in this era. My heart of hearts, do I prefer Arkham Asylum?
The kind of contained nature of it, the more cleaner, metroid-y-ness of that smaller environment, maybe. But in terms of taking that design and taking the gradual accruing of skills and how that unlocks the world and applying that to a semi-open world, this was just sublimely done. Also increasing the scale of the area that you had to play across let you have all that amazing gliding and diving, which is an incredibly satisfying movement.
Batman stalking a city and being the city's protector, that is the kind of complete fantasy, so it's the natural place to go. I never was crazy into the Hugo Strange of it all, but everything else about this game and the cameos and just how confident Rocksteady were with the opening with Bruce Wayne and how they brought you into that world, it's a real class act. It's a great bit of sequel making for one of the best surprises of this generation, was the Batman thing coming alive.
Yeah, I think that's absolutely fair and a good pick. We've discussed this before briefly, but I think that Arkham City does, on a personal level, slightly trump Asylum, even though I think that Asylum is considered maybe the heart pick for a lot of people where they like the contained settings. There's a lot of back and forth in that one, but I loved this game at the time.
This arrived at the peak of my Batman fandom when I was reading Grant Morrison's Batman, Inc. and having a great time. I was so pumped about The Dark Knight Rises, a film that couldn't be bad in any way, shape or form, surely.
Look at Bane, look how scary he is. Nothing about this film can go wrong. So yeah, good pick, Matthew.
Got to hear Catwoman getting called a bitch by loads of people.
Yep, the year was 2011. Now the NPCs have to be more polite. It's like, you can hit a woman, but you have to be polite about it, you know what I mean?
Did you have to buy Catwoman?
Yeah, her sections were... Remember when they did this whole... You had to buy random bullshit to fight...
Because EA were worried about the pre-owned market, and then Warner Bros. did it too. It was like, you could only get two characters in Mass Effect 2 by paying for something.
That was a thing they did for a while.
Do you remember that? Or if you bought the game, it came with a one-time voucher. So if you traded it in, you could get this, but you'd never have the Catwoman bitch DLC.
The thing is, I did buy this... No, I did get a copy of this from the publisher, and then had to buy the Catwoman DLC alongside it. Because it wasn't in the promo copy box.
I didn't mind paying, of course, because I was a very privileged games journalist getting my free games. Those are quite bad sections anyway. The Catwoman ones are very cool.
They were very bolted on, also ran bits. My next pick, then. 4 RPG.
I'm going to take Mass Effect 2.
Oh, shit.
I weighed this up, and there's a lot of RPGs I love from this era. But I don't love any RPG as much as this one. This was like the...
However, maybe if you were into more of the old-school kind of PC RPGs, you would feel differently about this. But there was something about how Mass Effect 2 coalesced everything that was going on at the time with games in terms of cinematic presentation, with what people loved about the original Mass Effect, which was making choices, with this refined Gears of War-style third-person shooting. It brought it all together in this perfect package, where it was the best crew of any of the Mass Effect games, just a really great combination of characters whose loyalty missions would let you unravel their stories in these Star Trek-style TV episode-like side quests, really effectively done, packed with the idea that you are going into something called the Suicide Mission, and so you know that your chances of success are very slim.
So when you do prevail, at whatever cost you pay, it feels like a mighty victory, and that's one of the all-time great RPG arcs. It also doesn't waste time with bad side content, because most of the side content is all packed into those loyalty missions. There's a little bit of...
a few bits and pieces besides. It just means that there's no fat on it. It's just a really...
It's like the best version of what the original Mass Effect could be. It was the ultimate sequel, and I think it was the ultimate statement of a 360-era RPG for me, which is why I picked it here, Matthew. Thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, it's a great pick. It's a really good standalone game, just the whole concept of it. You know, that focus on the Suicide Mission just gives it this, like, focus and drive that very, very few RPGs can match.
My big problem with the genre is always, you know, do I know what I'm doing at any given moment? Do I know what I'm working towards? And I often lose the thread, and here you just can't.
It's so good, this game. And you're right, like, you know, the first game had a lot of the powers and the iconography that I loved, but it wasn't, like, particularly nice to play. But this one was actually, you know, a pleasure to play as well, on top of all the narrative goodness.
So, yeah, it's a great pick.
Yeah, okay, interesting. So, yeah, good stuff. Mass Effect 2.
I'm not gonna badmouth Mass Effect 2.
Well, that's it. It's tough to do that with these games because there's been no bad picks so far. These are all fucking amazing games from a defining era of video games for both of us.
So, what's the next pick, Matthew?
Uh... Would you accept for Wildcard Lost Odyssey?
Yes. In fact, that was one of my picks for this category.
Let's do that. Let's go for Lost Odyssey, which is one of the JRPGs that Xbox produced with Mistwalker. The other was Blue Dragon, which I never actually played.
I don't have any read on Blue Dragon whatsoever.
It's pretty boring.
Lost Odyssey, obviously, you know, a big Sakiguchi JRPG, and probably the last time, well, definitely the last time, Sakiguchi had this kind of like budget to make a game. Like, I'm probably over... Am I overselling it to say it's like a Final Fantasy style budget?
I mean, it's that kind of level of production.
It's like, it's close to, I would say. Final Fantasy definitely like pushes one step further. But it's like, it's definitely the closest comparison you can make, you know?
Yeah, kind of a mix. Like, if you were to compare it to Final Fantasy, like, you know, this is definitely like Sakiguchi in quite a traditional mode. He's not trying to like rock the boat too much here.
Like, it kind of looks and has this kind of feel of Final Fantasy X, which is very much like guy who has only seen Boss Baby says this film is like Boss Baby. Guy who has only played Final Fantasy X is gonna say, yeah, this is like Final Fantasy X. So, yeah, that's part of the assessment.
Quite like moody and soulful. Doesn't have like the instant brand recognition of Final Fantasy, so it's like a bit of a harder sell. You play this like immortal warrior called Kaim.
I think it was Kaim?
Yeah, I think it's Kaim, yeah.
And, you know, who's lived for all these years and one of the kind of unique kind of gimmicks this game is that there are sort of novelistic sections, almost like visual novels, I guess, where you kind of find stories from his life and stories about this world, which are written by a Japanese author whose name I don't know, but are like these sort of very like moving beats, if you want to kind of like slow it right down and sit there and read kind of pages and pages of this sort of basic novel that's been written for this game. But outside of that, quite standard turn-based JRPG. It has a sort of Mario RPG-ish kind of timed element that you can kind of make your attacks land harder if you hit this kind of like quick time event when you're attacking.
But like a bit of an oddity, like I say, Sakaguchi with a big budget for the last time kind of locked away, you know, the work of major JRPG players is always interesting, especially when it doesn't really live on in any other form. It's backwards compatible. But I think having a big monster traditional JRPG in the mix on this console would probably appeal to some people.
Oh yeah, this was the reason I put this category in, because I thought, oh yeah, that's like, you know, it would be nice to have something that's not the 10 most obvious Xbox games, but also this was a game that I think represents that early throw things at the wall era that paid off so well for Microsoft, because there is no Lost Odyssey in the second half of the generation, despite it seeming to sell quite well. I would love to have seen a reality where Sakaguchi and Phil Plus, I think was a studio, that they became, you know, like a sort of, I was about to say like a lion head, they got closed down, but you know, like, or like a bungee, they got rid of those, or they left at that point. Basically, an in-house Microsoft studio, basically, that just kept making games for them, because while Blue Dragon was very much like a Dragon Quest style thing, like a very straightforward conventional JRPG, and this was a bit more of that operatic large scale Final Fantasy thing.
So, yeah, definitely. And it also had some cool quirks to combat, like it had a bit of the old Mario and Luigi, like, time your attack, press a button kind of thing. Although I suppose you could argue that was back in Final Fantasy VIII with the old Gunblade, but still.
Oh, no, it's in the Super Mario RPG, wasn't it, on the SNES. So, yeah, really old system there. But bringing that back into it made it a little bit different from Final Fantasy.
And this was an up and down generation for Final Fantasy. People are not in agreement about the quality of XIII and I like XIII, but Lost Odyssey was an absolutely amazing counterpoint to that. And also represented, I think, a strong push from Microsoft to try and get Japanese games onto the platform.
Then I feel like they kind of gave up on the market when they realized it was never going to happen for Xbox in Japan. And so they would switch their focus to the West a bit more. But it certainly yielded some cool results on both the original Xbox and on 360, Matthew.
So, yeah, good pick. Good pick.
Thank you.
Yeah, no worries. Again, talking up your pick.
And also, like, because it's all digital, this console, I'm assuming you won't have to swap four discs to play it.
We didn't even introduce the mini console element. You keep bringing it up. It's like, when my mini console hits the shelves, it will have Red Dead Redemption.
It is a mini console. I like to imagine it as a mini console.
It's probably more fun to do it that way, isn't it? Than me just being like, it's just the ten games. But yeah, I suppose this is a little box that you buy and you plug into your TV and stuff.
It's the ten games unboxed just in one of those, like, you know, those plastic things you used to get, like, rewritable DVDs on, like, 25? It's just one of those. And they're not even the original discs.
They've been written on to those rewritable and just written on in pen. Lost Odyssey Disc 1, Lost Odyssey Disc 2, and it's just rattling around in that. That's what people are fundamentally voting on.
Amazing. And the funny thing is as well, no matter how we package this up, it's a worse deal than just buying an Xbox One or a Series S and just downloading most of these games onto it yourself. But yeah, OK, fine.
I'll retain that fun element just for the purposes of entertainment, Matthew.
Thank you.
OK, so my next pick. Right, this is the final one I just need to get off the board. Category one Xbox Live or multiplayer game is Halo 3.
Ha, did it, got a Halo finally.
Yeah, for some reason that completely passed me by that that was a thing, even though it's an obvious choice.
I do feel like between Halo 3 and COD 4 I've wrapped up the FPS on 360 quite nicely. There's other great FPS games on there, but those two were like, to me, they were like the two halves of the FPS because you had Halo 3's wild open spaces and vehicles and sci-fi weaponry. You had COD 4's like trigger, finger, you know, instant kill, kind of like quick paced rapid fire, more contemporary military combat.
And those two were served, you know, served your first person shooter brain in different ways, I think, but in great ways, and they both had fantastic campaigns. I think it's interesting. I think Halo 3 has the highest highs of the series, but it's not the most consistent of the campaigns.
That's another Halo game on Xbox that maybe Matthew will pick. We'll see. But the combination of that campaign with the multiplayer at the time was just phenomenal.
It was just amazing to see Halo get this facelift and for the campaign to be so much better than it was in Halo 2 as well, which notoriously felt a little bit unfinished. And this had the two scarabs set piece, which is my favorite video game set piece of all time, where the two scarabs drop down, you have your pick of vehicles, you can go and destroy them in any way you see fit, but either way it will end with two giant robots being blown up by you. And it is the most fun I've ever had in co-op.
So I had to pick Halo 3 and I'm delighted I got it. Any thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, you know, I also like the scarabs. You know, I could be shitty and focus everyone's attention on the level setting in Anus, but I won't do that.
That's a brief level. When that's over, you don't need to play it again.
I know, I know. Yeah, this was, yeah, I mean, it's obvious. Halo 3 is absolutely massive.
Yeah, not one, like, I think one that I came to appreciate more with time than necessarily at the time. Like, it wasn't one that we played lots of. This isn't me, like, dunking on Halo 3.
I'm trying to undermine Halo 3. It's impossible to undermine Edge 10 Halo 3. But I'm just more explaining in a defensive way why I haven't picked it.
Yeah, it's interesting, because I was there wondering, I knew you didn't really have strong takes on Halo either way, but I did wonder how you'd feel about me taking Quad 4. Was that one you really wanted?
Yes, yes, I have a sort of heart pick back up.
Right, okay, interesting.
Which is why I don't feel as sad, but that is...
Well, we can come back to Homefront later, Matthew. I know you're a big fan of that game.
Yeah, Modern Warfare is a very key text, particularly online. Like sniper battles across that courtyard and all that. I mean, God, I played a lot of that game.
Yeah, fair. Okay. In which case it's your pick again, Matthew.
Oh, man. I still feel like this is sort of... I can lose this somehow.
I feel like there's some big things where I'm like... There's a couple of major games, but I just don't know if people really care about them. And I don't really care about them, and I don't really want to waste a head pick where I could go for a heart pick, especially if it doesn't do anything for me.
Yeah, I've just about so far managed to toe the line between things I'm passionate about and things that were massive on the console.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For my exclusive, I'm going to take Crackdown 1.
Nice.
The Crackdown series, everyone knows, is the open world. Actually, there's nothing else really like it. It's a power curve in an open world city where the more you do stuff, you get these ability orbs.
The more of those orbs you collect, the better you get at that thing. So if you shoot loads of people, you get better at shooting. If you do cool driving, you better get at driving.
You get better at driving. If you pick up these agility orbs, you get better at jumping. And really, I would imagine that is the hook for a lot of people in this world in that it's a crazy sort of city-climbing agility sim in that it's all about the more of these agility orbs you get, the higher the rooftops you can get.
You start leaping buildings with a single bound. There's an iconic building in the heart of the city, the Agency Tower. There is an achievement, a very famous achievement for getting to the very top of the Agency Tower.
And it's more that power curve than anything else specifically about the action of the game. I think this is a game that gets by on that style. I don't think they've ever quite bettered it.
I think everything that's good about Crackdown is in Crackdown 1. I don't know if that aligns with what the wider fandom think, but this is one where I can remember there being a lot of fondness for it in the office. It's one of those weird games where a lot of people got it because it came with the Halo 3 beta.
It's a little bit like Zone of Enders with Metal Gear Solid 2. It's kind of like the whole game that you've got for another reason. But I think this is slightly better than Zone of Enders as pack-ins with demos go.
Crackdown is pretty splendid.
I think the pretty... the reasonably famous story that came out of this was that when the Xbox Live most played charts dropped, Crackdown was number one and Halo 3 beta was number two. So that's how big Crackdown was.
It exceeded the thing that was supposed to sell it basically. And so, yeah, I think that there is that consensus. I will say I think Crackdown 2 is really underrated.
I think it's got a lot going for it, sort of systems-wise. The DLC Gravity Gun they added was just such a great addition to that game. And I think that maybe it's because it has more of an undead zombie thing going on that made it less appealing to people, but you'd go into these quite gnarly spaces to clear them out.
I found it quite appealing as a mix-up, a change-up of the open-world template from Crackdown. Because I think that Crackdown 3, maybe the reception to that, showed that there was only so much you could do with repeating the same formula from one, so I respect them changing up.
The basic rhythm of getting orbs and getting better is great. And even in Crackdown 3, they can't get in the way of that, but it felt like it should have been more of a generational leap. It had that kind of pitch of the mad cloud multiplayer mode that never really came to anything.
This is just one of the original great podcast games, just going around a city, cleaning it up, not having to invest too much, but just enjoying movement and the chaos of it. There are a lot of games doing a lot more sophisticated things in open worlds in this generation particularly, but there's something about the dumb broad simplicity of Crackdown that still really appeals.
Well, I think this is the first open world action game to let you share an open world with another player. It wasn't just you get put in a more condensed version of the city. You had the whole city and you could go around together in that entire city.
That was new. GTA 4 would do the same thing, but that was a year later. This was first.
So that was something it was doing that no one else had done before. So it was a really significant game. I had this down as my backup for Xbox Live multiplayer game actually because the co-op element was quite a strong part of it for me.
But yeah, a very good pick Matthew. So, my next choice. I kind of got a lot of the ones I wanted off the board now.
And now I feel like there's just such a vast pile of stuff to pick from for the other categories, it's actually hard to narrow it down. Let's go for... I'm going to go for category 2, XBLA.
And I'm going to take Shadow Complex. So, quite a few games I was weighing out for the XBLA category. Things that are very representative of the lifespan, I guess, of that console.
I know you're a big Geometry Wars head, Matthew. I assume that's what you'll pick here. But I was sort of drawn to this because I think it kind of...
What it did with the reviving the metroidvania for the modern age and doing so in this almost uncharted, like right down to getting Nolan Northen as your generic handsome white guy shooting up a load of people, sort of skin. It meant that it was like a blockbuster version of this genre. And I think it showed people what else you could do with it.
And maybe sparks a little bit more of the imagination for what would follow with this genre. I think that it's actually kind of when you play it now, it feels like another version of what Metroid Dread would be. You know, this high budget take on a classic genre that feels fresh in a lot of ways.
But the fundamentals basically go back to Super Metroid or Castlevania. It sort of holds up as well as playing a bunch of this in preparation for this. And I think that even though there is such an avalanche of Metroidvanias that follow in its wake, there is something very specifically Xbox-y about this.
It's like the shooting is just front and center. The story which has a bit of the old cursed Orson Scott Card association about it. It was written by Peter David though, who is a very wholesome superhero comic book writer.
Yeah, it's just Xbox to its core. And I also think that they did an HD edition of it, which definitely polished it up. But the 360 ass textures and things like that, it's so 2009 when you play this.
And I think it is a good representative game of what they could do with XBLA, which is revive these old game types, give them a lick of paint, and everyone goes to buy it because they've made such a big deal about it being the big game that's dropping this summer in the Summer of Arcade lineup. So it was between this and Peggle, and I fucking love Peggle, but Shadow Complex just squoze in. Sorry.
It's late on a Tuesday. It just squeezed into my list there, Matthew. So that's my pick for Expelle thoughts.
Yeah, I love Shadow Complex. I love the foam gun, and I love that when he runs in a straight line enough, he runs incredibly fast, like the little boy from The Incredibles, and he just tears it across the lake. This is like a big blockbuster version of that Metroidvania before lots of people were doing it.
Just a very shiny, exciting version. I really love this.
Okay, good stuff. So what's your next pick?
My next pick... We're in the Matthew Potentially Biffs It zone.
I love that zone. It's my favorite zone.
Yes. Yes. Let's go for one of those seven out of tens.
Let's go binary domain.
Nice. Good pick. That might win it for you.
Who knows?
I mean, it'll win it for me with like five binary heads. Yeah. But is it enough to shake it?
I'm not so sure. Pass me by at the time this one. This is obviously the Yakuza studio taking a swing at the cover shooter, basically off to the back of Gears of War being massive.
On paper, this should be a disaster. Lots of other Japanese studios taking a swing at cover shooters were absolutely horrendous. I remember playing some shocking old shit from Bandai Namco.
There was one set in this insect tower. What was that called? Inversion, maybe?
Oh, right.
Something like that. Some real 3 out of 10 nightmare stuff. This fundamentally works because the core interaction, which is shooting robots in this futuristic city, is incredibly satisfying.
The robots have an almost ceramic quality, so the way that their limbs shatter when you shoot them is really, really nice. The fact that they are robots and you can shoot their limbs off and they keep coming at you, so if you shoot their legs off, they kind of grind themselves along the floor. If you shoot their heads off, they go kind of crazy.
If you get that basic thing, like it's nice to shoot the enemies, that really is what a lot of these games hinge on. Gears is good because it's nice when the head explodes in a gooey way. This is good because robots break in a funny way.
You also have just a very, almost like, if it was accidentally iconic supporting cast of like weird stereotypes, there's a French robot called Kane who's a really cool guy. There are some like deeper AI systems in this where the way you behave is like subtly kind of impacting the kind of behaviour of other characters and their relationship to you. Like I've never really gone massively deep into that stuff.
I just enjoy it as a roller coaster third person shooter. I think this is just a really, really fun game. There's a case to be made that it's maybe better than The Seven because it gets it so right.
But I think people would widely agree it's one of those sevens.
I think it's, yeah, The Seven is a state of mind in a lot of ways, you know. So I think it fits in that respect. One day I hope to play it, Matthew.
I do own it. So, yeah, I should play at some point.
I mean, it's a shame to like force everyone to play this slightly stodgier framerate version on 360 rather than the boosted version on Xbox, but on Xbox One.
But you've imposed that quality to it. Like that was never part of the pitch. We were just pitching games and now you're like, oh yeah, but it's going to run like shit on my cursed console that you got for 20 quid at Sainsbury's or whatever.
Oh my God. Do you know there are so many like series that have just not appeared in this list that are fundamental? And I don't think they're going to appear either.
So, you know, your Dead Spaces, like Borderlands, Gears of War, Assassin's Creed, Left 4 Dead. Okay, that's true, yeah, but I don't know. I couldn't, I don't have that relationship to Gears.
I just don't love Gears of War enough to pick one of those. So, I'm just saying there's a lot of series you're going to miss out here, Matthew. And even for a draft, this is tough.
Maybe it should have been 15 games, but it's too late now. So, yep. Okay, my next pick then.
Okay, Matthew, will you let me have for category 9 wild card Mirror's Edge?
Yeah.
Okay, cool. In which case, that's what I will go for. So, Mirror's Edge, DICE's first person platforming game.
Had a bit of shooting in it as well, but you were not encouraged to shoot. This was a game about running across rooftops in an absolutely beautiful looking dystopia, sliding into guys, beating them up and then just running away again. It's a free running game.
Free running had never been realized this well in a game before. It arguably hasn't been since, even though I think Mirror's Edge Catalyst does a lot of the same things very, very well and gives you a bit of an open world to play around in. This was such a breath of fresh air.
I loved it so much. And when people kind of bounced off of it, it did break my heart a little bit, because some people were just like, this is too hard, I don't get this. But I think it was actually a bit ahead of its time in the sort of like leaderboard-y ghost, chasing after ghost culture of online games that would kind of follow a little bit later, but people were not quite ready for it at this point.
And maybe if it had been a couple more years, it might have been a bigger hit. But I think the fact that people were up in arms when they were going to take it off sale earlier this year, and then they decided not to, just shows that it's really left a kind of cultural impact this game. I think it's what happens when a developer that is made up of incredibly talented artists and designers are allowed to make something that they are passionate about that has nothing to do with the military stuff that's so familiar in the main games that they're known for.
You get something just so original and powerful. Even though the story does not work in this game, everything else about it is perfect. You skip the cutscenes and the story is what you see.
It's the different colors of this city. It's the experiential aspect of just being there. Some of the level design is absolutely phenomenal as well.
Just these immense climbing puzzles where just the basic act of jumping onto a ladder suddenly seems really exciting because you're doing it in first person. You hear this amazing breathing. There's these filter effects that make it feel like you're actually doing it.
You're jumping from moving trains at some point, running underground, jumping across skyscrapers. Just a really great time, a game I'm incredibly passionate about. It had to be represented in Matthew's thoughts.
Yeah, a good pick for this particular category. I don't have the same relationship that you do with it. I recognize those qualities, but I don't think it's a game I've ever finished.
I've just died on a couple of bits too many times and got frustrated with it, never really got into the flow of it.
I probably prefer the original to Catalyst in terms of just the purity of it and the surprise of it. Yeah, I mean, it's a great game from this generation. Nice to have interesting EA from this generation represented as well, given the lack of Dead Space so far.
Yeah, I mean, this is partly EA's fault for making a good Dead Space remake and making that a less sexy pick. I can pick the second one, I guess, which some people liked more. What's your next pick then, Matthew?
Oh, I keep thinking I should really pick Dark Souls.
Yeah, I thought about that too.
But people just know that that's bullshit from me. It's such bullshit. And I just feel like Dark Souls is everywhere now, you know?
Yeah, it did belong to 360 at the time though. It definitely did.
Yeah, but...
With a lower frame rate.
Yeah, it's a no from me, dog. For Xbox Live, I'm going to take Battlefield Bad Company 2.
Oh, interesting.
Which was my second most played game after Modern Warfare. I don't think this is like a wild pick. It definitely doesn't have the pure accessibility and blockbuster popularity and necessarily importance of Call of Duty.
But this generation was defined by Call of Duty vs. Battlefield. A bit of a one-sided fight.
I don't think Battlefield ever really troubled Call of Duty massively. But what I did like about the Bad Company games was this is sort of Battlefield re-envisioned a little bit for console. It's very much a console first approach.
I don't think Bad Company 1 was even on PC actually. It was the console Battlefield. Slightly smaller scale, probably a smaller play account, I guess, than what was happening on PC.
But has that obviously classic Battlefield team focus, which some Call of Duty modes had, but really Call of Duty just felt like loads of lone wolves who happened to be put together. Here you're really rewarded for helping each other out. Here you're really rewarded for playing as your class and helping people and being a support class if you weren't necessarily the best attacker in the world, which I wasn't.
I really came to love that about Battlefield in general, but this is the one that really got me into that. I absolutely loved the Rush mode in this, which I think was first introduced in Bad Company 1 as Gold Rush and was then rebranded Rush. It's now quite commonplace, but that's what we played loads, which is where one side is trying to push and blow up two computer machine things.
I'm not a military guy, all right? And the other team are like defending it. And there's this endless push up, and everyone's kind of like, your whole team is all focused together at pushing away this waiver of attackers coming in.
Has the crazy destruction for the time. Like, if anything, they probably lent a bit too much into that, and you could basically destroy everything in this game, and like the whole level could just basically crumble and collapse by the end of it and not really resemble a kind of functioning multiplayer map because it was so chaotic. But we had a really good time playing this.
This was a big, definitely a big future favourite playing this with Xbox World and PSM3. I will always remember Andy Hartup on PSM3. His game attack at the time was Shark in a Jar, and always seeing the words Shark in a Jar on my screen.
Just, yeah, I love this game. A different pace, an alternative vision of war to Call of Duty, but very much, you know, the other vision if you wanted it on 360. So I think it's a sound pick.
Yeah, I feel like the Bad Company games had maybe a tiny bit of cult appeal. The mainline Battlefield games didn't have as such. So, yeah, I mean, that was from the outside looking in though.
There was absolutely nothing to substantiate that on my side.
But yeah, I even quite like the single player campaign in Bad Company 2, which I don't think many people do. But it fundamentally has the nice feeling guns and some of the destruction. And those two things are just satisfying in themselves.
It was a bit more jokey. The Bad Company were like a cartoon squad and there were like four of them. And they all had sort of goofy names and they'd get up to like hijinks.
It was a bit more like a kind of like World War Romp. It was a bit more like, I don't know, Inglorious Busters or something rather than Saving Private Ryan. But I quite liked that vibe of it.
One day they'll do Bad Company 3 and it'll be like a massive comeback and everyone will be thrilled, I'm sure.
Yeah, I'm surprised that hasn't happened to date. But yeah, good pick, Matthew, for a game I don't really know much about. Okay, my next pick.
Category 8, Open World. I'm going to take Grand Theft Auto IV. Question, do I get the DLC with this, Matthew?
Do I get that as well?
I don't think so. Doesn't that break our compilation?
What? Is that a compilation? I guess it...
Was it compiled? If there's a version of it where it was compiled in, then...
Well, the two DLCs were packaged together as an individual release.
You can have that.
But they were like DLCs you could install onto the main game.
Be bold, take the DLCs and not the main game.
But the trade-off is, Matthew, you get Undead Nightmare for Red Dead Redemption if you allow this.
Oh, if that's the rule, then it absolutely has to be.
Amazing, got him with his own...
Yeah, I don't care. Undead Nightmare is fucking great. That strengthens a pick I'm already very confident in.
Okay, Grand Theft Auto IV then. So remains my heart pick GTA game. This campaign starring Nico Bellic, this immigrant who comes to Liberty City, aka Rockstars New York, in search of a better life, but gets dragged into a life of crime.
It's like Rockstar riffing on all kinds of movies to pieces together, but still felt a little bit specific in how it was executed. Very sincere Rockstar storyline, despite having all of the classic Rockstar gags and Roman going, did these every 10 minutes or whatever. It was doing all those things tonally at the same time.
Even had a few narrative choices in there. It's still my favorite Rockstar open world. It's just such an incredible mythical depiction of New York.
It's what New York feels like in a game, in a way that Rockstar are always able to do this. Los Santos has the same thing, but there's something about New York and seeing it in this way and that leap from San Andreas level detail, which I love the aesthetic of the PS2 GTA games, but the HD GTAs just look so incredible. Yeah, just a very special game, dear to my heart.
The DLCs only improve the basics, add new tools to the mix. Brand new self-contained storylines take you to slightly different places in the city. Two of the most celebrated DLCs of all time, Lost and Damned and Baldigay Tony, Matthew.
So that's GTA 4, a good game, a very good game. What's your next pick?
My next pick is...
Oh my God, I've got to resist bullshit.
Dark Souls is right there.
The temptation is so strong. But I just don't want to sink it. I feel like it's good so far.
I think all those wondering voters on Twitter will be like, Oh, this guy put Dark Souls over it for him.
Fuck him. I don't want the votes of the Dark Souls people. XBLA, I'll go for...
I will go for Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2. A big flat favorite when I was living with Rich Stanton. We used to play this a lot.
Pacifism mode in which you drive through little gates to detonate enemies rather than shooting. We were obsessed with this game. It is one of the most compelling.
Pick up and play. You instantly understand what you're meant to do. But it's got that real one more go.
There are leaderboards there constantly showing you, you know, who's just above, who's just ahead of you, which will never be Jason on edge, which will be infuriating, so you'll keep playing for that reason. Just the neon aesthetic of it, the incredibly clean lines, a very different vision for what the sharp HD era could do. Not everything had to be incredibly fushy.
There's just certain styles. I mean, XBLA was great for arcade classics. I definitely toyed with Pac-Man Championship Edition.
It has a similar one-more-go element to it. I did toy with Trials HD for that one-upmanship and the subtle multiplayer of the leaderboards. It's really compelling, but I am shit at Trials, so it simply cannot be that.
Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, just improved on an already brilliant game with some other great modes, great achievements as well.
Good pick, Matthew. It felt like it was always going to be that or Shadow Complex from you, I think, for this category, if I like to be.
Yeah, I did love your fairs and your braids, but I don't know.
I couldn't be certain that some of these games weren't already just bettered elsewhere. You know what I mean? It was tough.
It just felt like I needed to pick something that was still quite specific to XBLA in its feel and shape. So, yeah, that definitely is what Geometry Wars is. So, okay, my next pick.
Free pick, category 10. Really tough. I was tempted to take Halo Reach here as well, but I don't think that would give enough variety to the list.
I've got Halo. People know I fucking like Halo on this podcast. That's fine.
Thought about Alan Wake. They're very widely available now, but definitely synonymous with 360 there. But I'm going to go with Bayonetta, category 10 free pick, for the simple reason that I want a bit of variety in my list.
This was an incredibly important moment in this generation when Platinum Games came along with this one-two punch of Bayonetta and Vanquish. It seemed like they were on the top of the world. Both these games made our Platinum Games Hall of Fame, of course.
Bayonetta, though, arguably, was the better of the two games. This was the 10, whereas Vanquish was the 9. So, yep, it was a reboot for the Devil.
Well, not a reboot, really, but it was the cameo vision of what the modern version of Devil May Cry should be. That third person, kind of hack and slash, but more commonly referred to as a beat-em-up, I think, style of 3D action game. So, it was about time that someone gave this a shot in the arm.
Devil May Cry 4 was really good, but this was absolutely incredible. This really stylish and iconic main character who, out of the box, just people didn't know what to make of her. You know, whether she was cool or too weird or whatever, and I think it's the sort of fandom around her suggests that she's really stood the test of time as a character, but also just like was a really nice evolution of this genre, pushed it forward a little bit in terms of the dodge that slowed down time to make it a bit easier.
Great weaponry, really fun tone to it. Tone that would arguably great a bit over time, but in this first game was very well judged. It felt like at the time absolutely.
And then some fun mini games as well, and lots and lots of Sega and Capcom references. So that's my free pick, Matthew. What's your next pick?
Can't be turned, I'm gonna go for Dark Souls. Turns out I'm a big Dark Souls guy.
For RPG, I'm gonna go Witcher 2, Assassins of Kings.
Nice.
Big heart pick. Any listener of this podcast will know that I love the Witcher 2. Witcher 3 is obviously the big, the one which gets all the attention, the massive open world adventure.
Witcher 2, I think, is the better exploration of the world. It's a bit more like, I don't really know what you'd liken it to. Maybe like Mass Effect in terms of like something more like a linear area.
You still explore it. The map's like semi-open, but it's much smaller. It's very, very like sculpted, very handcrafted.
It isn't an open world game in any way, shape or form. But it is a horrible political situation that you come into in that, as the title suggests, someone is killing the kings. You're on the trail of these assassins.
As basically the world goes to shit without its rulers and there are all kinds of power plays. A game which famously like really delivers on when you make a big choice. This really shows you the consequences to the point that Act 2 of this game is completely different based on one of two people you side with at the end of Act 1.
And it's the meat of the game, so, you know, there are lots of games where you're encouraged to replay them to see different things. This is definitely the most substantial version of that. It's so ballsy.
It sort of understands that having a very malleable 20 hours is maybe more enjoyable than lots of tiny choices spread across a hundred hours. It's got the most difficult moral quandaries of any video game that I've played in terms of where I've really sat there going. I really don't know what the right thing is to do here.
You know, do I side with these bastard A or bastard B? There's some characters I absolutely adore in this game. You make some friends who you feel such deep affection for.
This makes The Witcher 3 better as well when you come to it because you'll have met all these quite key characters. Yeah, like maybe more of a PC game in people's minds when it was originally on it, but this was a really big effort to bring it to console. It's always this enhanced edition they called it, and it's a real technical feat that it worked at all.
But RPG storytelling, I don't think, gets much better than The Witcher 2.
Yeah, and not on PS3 either. They only brought it to 360, another kick in the balls there for the PS3. Yeah, the RPGs are a really interesting one.
It's a great generation for that genre. This is Bioware firing on all cylinders. This is great Bethesda games in the mix as well, but this is a really good specific to Matthew Castle picks.
So I'm glad you picked this and not the renegade option of Dark Souls, Matthew.
I've still got a free pick.
Oh yeah, that's true actually.
I can literally do anything, but we all know he's going to blow it on Lords of Shadow.
Let's hope so. Okay, my next pick then. So you've only got one pick left, right?
Yes, that's right.
Okay, going to go with licensed game, and I'm going to be a shit eater and take Batman Arkham Asylum.
Okay, that's right. I like it when we go mano a mano with similar games.
Yeah, I did think about picking Bioshock 2 actually, which is mechanically better than the first one, but I didn't want to have to make that argument. Arkham Asylum is a bit neater to make that argument that this is a viable alternative to Arkham City. Arkham City adds more tools, more Batman villains.
This has the very specific, actually very Bioshock infused sort of environment where it's a more limited canvas, but it's basically a spooky sort of correctional facility basically and lots of unhinged patients. I have no idea what the right words are to discuss this stuff anymore. It was so different.
Inmates. Yeah, but the words that describe their mental health issues, those words have become so...
Freaky limited.
They've become so opaque over time, like what we can and can't say about that. It used to be very black and white, so I just don't say anything instead.
I know who will have the right answers. Let's consult The Games Magazine.
That always works out great. Yeah, very good.
Oh, it's Nudgell.
Oh, it's Mentalist. That doesn't seem right, does it?
Okay, good. That's satire, though, so I think we're covered on that one.
That is satire, everyone. Let's sound the satire clock.
Yeah, hashtag satire.
What you just heard was satire.
Okay, good, and now we can move on. Yeah, so Batman, Arkham Asylum, it was still, it still just like brought back these very iconic animated series era versions of these characters as well, but presented to them in this context where it felt like you're experiencing more of an adult Batman story. It was a perfect accompaniment to the Bale films at the time.
And at the time, I was worried it was going to be this knockoff that just didn't feel like the same, but it really was just Rocksteady punching above their way. It really made their name. And I still think it's great.
And so much of what is great about this series is right here in this first one, even if the canvas will get so much bigger afterwards. That's my pick, Matthew. And yeah, what's your final pick?
My final pick? It's a free pick. It could be anything.
Does he pick Viva Pinata? Does he pick Asura's Wrath? Does he pick The Darkness?
Oh, there are so many tempting options.
So fucking many.
The Darkness would have been good for Wild Colors.
Oh, it would have been good for License Game. I should have picked that. Fuck, never mind.
That's fine.
Oh, I'm really torn. Do I just go... Basically, I've got a lot of 8 out of 10s it could be.
Classic.
Yeah. It's a real dilemma. I'm going to pick a Gears of War.
I'm going to say Gears of War 2.
Nice.
It's the one where you go inside a giant worm and chains through its heart. It's one where someone has to deliver lines to the sinking cities with a giant worm and really sell it. John DiMaggio, fucking incredible.
That he can deliver that mad performance. It's the one with the sad bit where Dom's wife dies. And I shrug.
Yeah. Like, Gears of War. I've got more of an affection for it after the fact.
At the time, I was never into this. I always found it a little bit bro-y. And again, living with Rich, he used to say, I think it's a deeply ironic take on this culture, which I never, never quite bore into.
But actually, I've grown very affectionate towards its co-op over the years. Like, I really like playing Four and Five with Catherine in co-op. It's just very, very satisfying.
Very nice, sort of solid game feel. A nice little co-op campaign that you can enjoy for ten hours. This one, I think, is the right balance of, like, you know, the basics that make the series good and the more preposterous elements.
The third one, like, is absolutely packed. It's an incredible package and probably has the more exciting, like, multiplayer modes as well. Like, they really went all out with three.
It's got, like, the lambent and the mad, kind of glowy things that explode. But I think this sort of, like, thread in the needle of, kind of, like, not too silly, not too serious, just right. Let's go Gizawar 2.
And, you know, it's a key part of this generation, of the 360 story. I feel like it should be on there.
Yeah, I'm glad one of us has it in there, because it feels like then we've represented every major beat of the 360's life. And Giz is part of it, even if I have no affection for it. But cold appreciation of good third-person shooting mechanics and set-piece design.
I have that, so that's how I feel towards this game. So, yeah, it's a good pick, I think, Matthew. Very good Xbox-style pick.
Sorry to Castlevania, Lords of Shadows, Tomb Raider Underworld, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction, which I really love.
Yeah, those are all good games. Also, in Licensed Game, I should say I did way up Riddick as well. Richard B.
Riddick. Yeah, Richard B. Riddick.
That's a philosophy for life. Always B. So, come to my last pick.
What are those sevens? Now, Matthew, will you let me have Spec Ops The Line?
I will.
Okay, good. I think that's fair because it's...
Yeah, I think it's one of those sevens.
It falls into the 70s on Metacritic, much like Binary Domain. So, if it wasn't going to be this, it was going to be Space Marine, the Warhammer 40,000 game, which I really enjoyed at the time. Pure seven, just great fun.
Really great depiction of that universe. Sequel coming out this year that looks banging. Can't wait for that.
So, I'm instead going with Spec Ops The Line, which is essentially a reboot of an older shooter series, but they use it to tell this Heart of Darkness-style story, this Apocalypse Now-style story in Dubai that has basically been abandoned to this warlord and has lots to say on the nature of the military and conveys that through a fairly conventional third person in shooter experience, which is why I think quite a few reviews dinged it at the time, because the shooting is just okay, but the larger point it makes, the story it has and its themes, those hit you like an absolute ton of bricks at the end of this game, and I think speak to a real narrative achievement. And so while as a third person shooter, it may not stand the test of time as anything particularly compelling, especially next to something like Gears of War 2, it is the antithesis in terms of what it tries to achieve and I think has earned a cult reputation as a result and really holds up.
Are you really trying to claim that Spec Ops the Line is more profound and powerful than Don's wife, Don?
In some ways, I think that the sincerity of Gears of War has held up quite well. They didn't pretend it was high art, you know what I mean? But yeah, yeah, it's just not my bag, Gears of War.
They're sinking cities with a giant worm.
Well, this kind of has a sinking city in it. There's a lot of sand that's collapsed into fancy hotels and things like that. I also really like the idea of picking Dubai as a setting because it feels naughty to make a shoot there.
That's what's good about it. It feels naughty. We don't even blink when a game is set in New York, but when a game is set in somewhere like Dubai that's more unusual and you see it all blown the fuck up and people having a really bad time there, it's like, well, why not?
All cities should be fair game. So yeah, it's a great choice, very distinctive setting. Less said about the white phosphorus bit, the better truly harrowing bit of narrative design there.
So that's my final pick, Matthew. So we did it. Good draft, I think.
Good bit of colour to bulk out the more obvious picks.
I think so. I think so. And I don't think there's any true howlers in there.
I really, really controlled myself. I love Tomb Raider Underworld, but I don't think it can be in the top 10 games. That would be mad.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I think this is fair. I'm really interested to see if people see them as 10 or if they look at the pairings.
Yeah, that's interesting.
Because there's some real, like, you know, Red Dead versus GTA, Batman versus Batman, like very different visions, Bioshock versus Modern Warfare, Fable 2 versus Crackdown. Yeah, lots of interesting discussions could be had there.
Yep, so you can vote for the winner at twitter.com/backpagepod. We will pin the tweet, and you vote for who you want to win. We'll post the list on the Monday as mentioned.
Shall we fly through the list once more, Matthew?
Yeah, let's do it.

Let's do another draft soon, yeah?
Oh yeah, I enjoyed it. That was a nice, civil, good draft.
Absolutely. No glass rose in the mix. So yeah, everyone gets to go home happy.
So yeah, we'll see who wins. And then if you're listening to this months down the line, I'll update the episode description so it says who won in the poll. So you have continuity.
