Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, it's the first of three episodes about one thing, the first time we've ever done this. In fact, it's been a long time since we even did, like, a two-parter episode. I think we only ever did that once, with the best games of the generation back in the early days of this podcast.
So, yeah, before we get into that, how are you doing? Are you thriving out here in Bath in the summer?
No, I'm having my Fat Man summer, so I'm sweating a lot. I bumped into a listener today when I was walking home. I bumped into Luke.
Hello to Luke, if you're listening. And it was good, because I was with another junior member of my team from work. And so for this to happen live in front of them, made me look like a real legend, I would guess, in their eyes.
Like, wow, my boss is so famous. Almost had the air of something I'd organized.
Yeah, I guess so. Can you say anything about Luke? Did he offer information on his whole situation, his whole deal?
Well, his whole deal was he said he liked the podcast. He said he had listened to me back on the ONM podcast. So obviously a long-term Castlehead.
Apologies to Luke for labeling him like that. But that was my read.
That's good. Well, he doesn't have his surname read out on the podcast, so he has plausible deniability.
He didn't give me his surname, he just said who he was. But he said that we always talked about Bath, so he always wondered if he'd ever see us around or whatever. So he works down in that Newark Works by Makoko.
Oh yeah, that seems like quite a nice area to work at, actually. I'm a little bit jealous. I kind of want to open my own sort of little working-from-home office there.
I don't have the funds to do that, unfortunately.
Every time I walk through there, I think, if I had a little game studio, like a Hello Games-style games, that's where I'd have it.
Yeah, you too could release a game that is borderline, busted at launch, and then highly revered eight years later.
That could be your art there.
That's the dream. Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking, when we open our consultancy slash agency, Two Giant Men Incorporated, we can open up shop in there, Matthew, and clear out the sandwiches from Makoko.
That'd be good. I got emailed this week by someone at work, actually, who on the PR side, normally journalists are the people who have listened to podcasts and will kindly say how much they enjoy it, which is very nice. And then I sort of like have to pretend that I'm not just a fucking idiot basically, just doing games court nonsense and be like, yeah, it's very good.
Anyway, would you like to cover this computer game kind of thing? But this week I had a PR, Patrick, hello, Patrick, if you're listening, who said he was a big fan of the podcast, started listening back when Parkin appeared on here. I don't know why I called him Parkin, I meant Simon Parkin.
I saw him for coffee actually in a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, I think you can call in whatever you like.
Yeah, exactly. Very highly informal at this point. So yeah, that happened.
And yeah, again, I e-mailed him back and just said, this must be like being emailed by a character from a cartoon. I imagine that's what it's like. So yes.
So a little bit there on me and Matthew's minuscule fame. It's going well. Very good.
It's like getting an e-mail from Moe in The Simpsons.
What I should have done is pivoted from, he was listening to ONM back in the day to the subject of this episode, Matthew. But I didn't, sadly. I'm not the master of segues, unfortunately.
So what are we doing here? We're going to do a top 50 Nintendo list. So all of Nintendo's history, all of its different platforms, home consoles, hand-helds, we're going to compile a back page top 50 off the back of that across three episodes.
Does that sound ill-advised? Sure, it does, but I think it will be good. So why do a top 50 and why split it into three parts?
So first of all, we've never made an episode about the idea of compiling a massive team list feature in a magazine. So we're starting with that. So every now and then we'll do an episode on feature writing or review scores we got wrong.
And that's kind of considered a little bit of the core DNA of the podcast, I suppose, the how you make a magazine side of things. People always like hearing about that. That's something we're not really discussed.
So we're gonna start with that, talk about that. I think that might be fun. I also wanted to use an existing list one of us worked on to kick off this conversation about Nintendo.
It's a chance to interrogate the choices made with that list and we can use it as a measuring stick for how Nintendo has evolved since that list was made. So obviously Matthew worked on this list. It was in the final issue of Official Nintendo Magazine, issue 114, I believe.
And so, yeah, you'll hear that whole list during the break of this episode and then you'll hear us discuss that list in the second half.
So hold on to your hat.
You're gonna hear a list of 100 games. And then I'll also, I will also post in Patreon. I will post the complete list there on the post as well.
I'll make it a free interview post so you can just like read it on patreon.com/backpagepod. You can see the hundred there if you want it for reference. I couldn't find that information online.
So it'll be nice to just have that somewhere.
Where did you get it from? Did you write the list up from a physical copy?
Yes, I did, Matthew. I earned my Patreon dollars, my friend.
That's hardcore.
I bought the issue for 12 pounds on eBay, got it delivered. And then, yeah, opened it and then just, it took four listens of Madonna's La Isla Bonita, a problematic banger, to actually write the list out. So about, I don't know, 15 minutes or something.
It wasn't too bad.
Any pre-owned horror stories, any pubes in there?
No, nothing like that. It was very cleanly maintained. It was provided in a bag.
I have since used the magazine to swat a fly that was in my flat. So it's in worse condition than when I got it already. I've given it a little clean off though.
I plan on keeping it around. There's only a finite number of these things around. This is the only copy I could find for sale.
So I don't think there's that many of them. I mean, the magazine was closed down, so it can't have been fucking thriving. Sorry, sore topic, but you know, sorry.
Sorry, I didn't mean to, that's been such a kicking as it was. I do apologize. So that's part one, right?
That's this episode. So we're talking about list making this old ass list that Matthew made and the choices that went into that. That's a prism through which to talk about lists and how we compile this list in part two and three of this project, I guess.
So in part two next week, we're gonna create a long list and break it down by series when it comes to what can make the cut. So it's literally a list of which Mario games go into the long list, which Zelda games go into the long list, all the way down to stuff that isn't really attached to any particular big series. You're Dosh and the Giants and they're like, I'm sure that'll make the cut, Matthew.
Dosh and I ain't going near the top 50.
Yeah, so that will be that episode. And then from there, we'll have our long list going into part three where we will arrange the final top 50 list in real time and talk about our choices.
And finally put it to rest for good. That's it, it will never ever be discussed again because we will have decided the top 50 Nintendo games.
Yeah, so the other interesting thing in part two as well is that we'll talk about the criteria of what makes the list. Is it a case of games historically? Is it all Nintendo games?
Is it about what you should play now? That's something we will figure out in the second part. But I'm hoping overall it'll be like a nice distillation of what it's like to make these lists on the editorial side, what it's like to bring these things together as a kind of like mix of, you know, compromise and putting the best stuff at the front, like, you know, reader functionality and also just like, you know, accounting for the taste of the people compiling it.
So there's a lot of different things that go into it. And I think we'll have some good Nintendo chatter along the way. So Matthew, how are you feeling about this project?
I'm excited about it. I was slightly trepidatious about it, but then you have, just listening to your spiel van, it's kind of solidified the idea for me, which is lucky that it's happened now, in episode.
Not convinced before that?
No, there were bits of it where I was like, I sort of said to you in a message beforehand, I didn't quite see the shape of episode two as clearly, but yeah, I think I get it.
Good stuff, good stuff. And then a little bonus for our Patreon supporters, patreon.com/backpagepod. In September, we'll do the top 50 third party Nintendo games as a standalone episode.
Phoenix Wright, Rogue Leader, you'll find those in that list, no doubt. That won't be as like tenuously created. It'll just be, we'll compile the top 50 before we make the episode and then just do it.
But that's the key thing to point out actually, is the ONM issue 114, they did the, I say they, I mean, literally this man I'm talking to right now and a bunch of other people, they did the 100 Nintendo first party games in the final issue, but in the second to last issue, 113, they did the 100 third party games. So we decided 100 was too many, but that's fine. 50 is plenty for this podcast, but yeah.
So my hope is we can eventually undertake similar projects with PlayStation, Xbox and PC, but let's see if anyone likes these ones first. That's the big question mark here. So Matthew, the art of list making, is it fundamentally a flawed endeavor to compile a video game best of list as part of a larger editorial team?
How do you make everyone happy, including your staff and readers? Is it even possible?
Uh, it's probably not possible in the long term. I think you can make everyone happy in the short term, which is maybe the exercise. You know, they aren't forever.
If anything, they're the beginning of a kind of broader conversation. That's kind of the idea of them. It's kind of what I like about them, is that you have the list, and while it may feel like the final word from the people who compiled it to the reader, it is the beginning of something.
It's the, let me think about this, let me ponder about this, let me argue about this. And so it kind of has life in that sense. And then a year later, you do it all again.
And you rewrite it all and throw it all away in the bin. So that's absolutely fine. So I mean, it's like literally temporary, unless for some reason you go, we're only ever doing this one time.
Which I guess the ONM lists were. I've always really loved lists. Like I say, I think they're a great conversation starter for readers.
On magazines, they were a really good opportunity for staff to kind of take stock, chat about things, like work out how the mag felt about things broadly, maybe through that, what the mag kind of represented. Definitely when we were doing Nintendo Gamer and we're redesigning NGamer into Nintendo Gamer, like we didn't necessarily kick off with lists, but the directory, which is kind of a list feature when you first create it anyway. If people read Nintendo Gamer, they'll know that we did a directory for every single individual Nintendo platform from the NES forwards.
And they were each like a miniature top 25 games, I guess. That felt like a really core part of the magazine in terms of like laying out what Nintendo Gamer and NGamer and NGC and N64 before it valued and let us put that big kind of team stamp on kind of gaming history. Rambling way of saying that, you know, I think they probably mean different things to the readers and the people who make them and the criteria for success are probably different.
Is there one which ticks both boxes? I don't know, but you know, as a rule, we always did what we thought what pleased us as staff and just assumed slash hoped it would resonate.
Yeah, that makes sense. I have some thoughts on how you approach the ONM list, actually, which I'll say for part two of the episode as we discuss that. But yeah, it's a big question of who are you targeting it at and kind of like what decisions are good for the list itself.
So that will be the interesting thing, I think, about compiling our list is to what extent we make it a purely us picks thing versus what do, how much of it is read expectation to see their favorites on there? Because I think that's definitely a part of it. It's obviously why people have such heated opinions about lists online.
I just remember so many times working on websites just when people would be upset about, why isn't this game in there? It's the oldest complaining comment on the internet, really, isn't it? It is, this list doesn't have X thing that I like in there.
We've even had it with this podcast before, but in a friendly way from our listeners.
Where's Gothic 2?
Oh yeah, of course Gothic 2.
Said one person repeatedly.
Best games in 2003, I think, where the games are discussed for about five minutes each, but your fridge and home base are discussed for about 45 minutes if I recall correctly.
More interesting than Gothic 2.
Very serious endeavor. Yeah, so it's a really interesting thing. So I do think it's, I don't know if it's fundamentally flawed, because the stakes are only that high if you make them that high.
And often when readers sort of take them in, they can take them more seriously than they are intended to be taken. Like it's that thing of, obviously everyone goes into it working hard and putting thought into the final list, but there are sometimes time restraints in making the choices. There are wild picks you might have to account for from different staff members.
There is definitely an element of compromise on some level when it comes to putting these things together. So yeah.
Yeah, I'd say like, actually now you say that, probably navigating the feelings of staff is maybe a bit more important than navigating the feelings of the readers, because the staff obviously have to work with and sit next to, and if you've just steamrolled them and ignore them, that would absolutely suck. And you do like fear a bit when you build lists that someone's gonna introduce an absolutely wretched heart pick into the mix. And then you're like, ugh, well, I guess this is going in.
There may be a few of those in the ONM Top 100. But for the readers, I'd say the more it doesn't align with your taste, the more interesting it is, I would find as a reader. I like to read lists where there are things I haven't heard of and there are big surprises or bold cases made for things I wouldn't have considered.
Yeah, I like that too. I like it when I read a list and I've heard of only half the things on there. But yeah, we can revisit that subject, Matthew.
Do you remember reading big video game lists and magazines when you were a kid or a younger man and how much stock you put into them? Do you remember your pre-editorial days, how seriously you took these things?
I remember them more from film magazines, maybe, than more than games magazines. I feel like lists became quite a big thing around the time that I was on magazines. There seemed to be endless lists and endless mags and sort of game of the year lists and things like that.
Maybe this is just shitty memory and this is completely wrong, but I don't remember N64, NGC, Gamers Master, Edge doing loads of lists all the time. There certainly wasn't the equivalent of PC Gamer's Top 100, which I don't even know when that started. I mean, hopefully you can fill us in on that.
I think it was N94 that started.
Oh, okay, well that shows how... Oh, well, I really, you know, a magazine I had little to do with, but I don't remember the equivalent of that in these other magazines. Maybe there are readers of those mags who know better and will be like, madness, they did it all the time.
But that isn't what I remember. I was a very avid reader of Total Film and they were always doing like 100 cult films or the 50 comedies you've got to see before you die or whatever. And as someone who was just hoovering up new film and trying to kind of improve, you know, just my knowledge of film, those were great starting points.
So I took those really seriously. I think the buying in a film list is slightly easier because if you read an entry and then you're like, well, that's two hours of my time, where like every entry in a game list is like 50 quid and you know, potentially a huge chunk of time and do you have the platform for it and all these other questions. So I can't say I had like a passionate relationship with video game lists, but I've enjoyed them since they became more prevalent and I'll always read them.
I do have a memory of the PC Gamer Top 100 being a big deal, but it's true, I don't recall loads of other similar types of lists. So for example, in 2007, I think that's when they did that Edge special, the 100 best games, and it wasn't like some recycled content or anything like that. I think it was an original publication they'd pulled together.
It was like a book-a-zine kind of thing, like a larger project.
That's the one I wrote Paper Mario in.
Yeah, that's the one. I had a reader comment on Metal Gear Solid 2 in there. That was wild, but I remember that being a feature of John Denton, Simon Miller and Tom Leclerc's flat in Bournemouth, circa summer 2007.
I imagine that was like a toilet reading kind of classic.
It was like blue, it was quite thick and blue.
Yeah, it was like yellow font on the front, maybe. Yeah, so it was, and it's a really nice thing, but yeah, I didn't really, again, people might just completely shoot this down, but I don't remember those kinds of lists being a feature of Edge that much in its history. Lists were very much a kind of like modern internet phenomenon that definitely transformed the way that things were read and consumed and highly desirable on search and all that stuff.
But yeah, it's true, magazines are a little bit rarer. But I did put a lot of stock in them. That PC Gamer one, I remember just for years, they were talking about how like 1996's Grand Prix II, like old ass looking MicroProse Jeff Cramming game, was just like, it was always up there because they'd given it some bonkers score.
And they were like, this is one of the best games ever made. And I was like, really, it barely even has 3D graphics. That's the oldest ass looking thing ever, but you haven't got X-Wing in this list.
That's like the first thing I remember thinking when I read that. So that must have been 99 or something.
When I think of older PC Gamer lists, I mean, this is probably still true of PC Gamer lists now, but like I'm pretty sure Ultima is a series I've only interacted with through PC Gamer Top 100s.
Yeah, there was a few games like that. And the other funny thing as well would be seeing PC games that would be forgotten within a few years, just stuff that just completely gets deleted from history or seeing them like two years later, dinging an earlier 3D era game because it was looking a little bit outdated because graphics were moving on so quickly. And things just seemed to stick in the memory slightly less in like the nineties.
And because there was always something big and shiny around the corner. Whereas now I think there's such a long history of PC gaming that there is a distinct number of eras that maybe you can tap into and try and represent, or some of the classics are obvious and stick out. But yeah, it was a bit of a weird, it was more of a larval state kind of era for PC gaming.
And therefore that made the list really interesting to read. And there was definitely a bit of, well, discover new things from this. But being honest as a kid, I just wanted to see the games I liked in there.
And then just being furious when Red Alert didn't make the cut or whatever. And that sort of thing. But yeah, so definitely put some stock into them.
But yeah, it's just interesting because it was such a different era, like you say. Do you remember the first time you worked on a big video games list in editorial, Matthew, and what went into that?
The thing with NGamer was it was like a magazine full of micro lists. The World of Nintendo section at the back was like four double page features. And so a lot of those features, maybe one an issue would be like a top 10 something, like the 10 saddest games or the 10 craziest hats or whatever.
So I was definitely used to writing lists and like heavily involved in list culture. I think the second issue I worked on, which was the Wii launch thing had so, there was this like mega Wii launch feature, which had endless lists about all kinds of, every sort of facet of the Wii was covered in some way from like top 10 things to get better sound out of the Wii and top 10 party games, launch games, this, that and the other. In terms of like more substantial things, at the end of the year, we definitely did sort of game of the year features.
Something we did, which I was really into was like moments. So features of like best moments of the year. And I really loved the specificity of that.
Oh, there's gonna be some interesting boss fights. There's gonna be some like, you know, here's a weird mini game, here's like a puzzle, here's an amazing quest. And that to me kind of brought me into games, made them seem a little bit more alive than maybe just a straight, like, these are the best games, more like these are things you had to have seen in games.
And maybe we took that from Xbox World 360. I think they did something similar. Like most of my list writing was freelance, kind of being asked to write a couple of entries for a tenner each.
In terms of like really substantial, I think that ONM list may have been the first major one in terms of just page count and the fact that it was two issues and like 200 entries was probably like the biggest undertaking.
Yeah, I can see that. Like I thought I'd worked on more lists than I actually have.
That's kind of my feeling too. What ones did you work on?
Yeah, so working on PC Gamer, I definitely ended up doing more because I was conscious of the website and so we were kind of feeding that beast and they're very easy to pull together. That's the thing about a list. You can pull lots of little bits of editorial together and have it done very quickly.
We did a Sonic Games ranked list on PC Gamer that is incredibly unhinged bit of work and probably very unsatisfying if you like Sonic that went up about, I don't know, six or seven years ago. At that point, we were doing loads of them, so they became, I guess, like I just thought a little bit less about the process of them. But I remember two very specific examples of the early days of me working media.
So when I was on Play Magazine, I've mentioned this before, but I had to do a top 100 PlayStation games book. This was like the early days of the PS3 era. So arguably, PlayStation didn't quite have the history yet to do that list properly.
So it was a bit of a hodgepodge of games I knew I liked and then things that I just thought that PlayStation fans would want to see in there, like making sure a Crash Bandicoot was in there, probably putting something that I thought was ass, like jumping Flash in there, making sure Final Fantasy VII was in the top 10, that sort of thing. I mean, and then I wrote the entire thing in two weekends, basically, it was like 15,000 words, it was ridiculous. And probably not very good.
This is when I got trapped in my flat, Matthew, and had to be rescued by the fire brigade while writing this list. It was a proper sort of like cursed writer shit exercise to me.
Sounds like it could be a plot line for Silent Hill 6.
Yeah, four out of ten for Batch, I can see it now.
The other room.
The other room. And then I remember submitting the list to my editor, and I think he was just like, yeah, sure, I don't think he even like contested it or anything like that. Thought went into it, certainly, but not as much thought as I would later put into a list like 2013, when I moved to Games TM, we did a best games of the generation list there.
And that I think I interrogated quite a lot, because I started working on it before I joined the magazine. And then when I arrived, I started questioning some of the decisions made in it. So I remember David Scarborough, who's been on this podcast, put Duke Nukem Forever in there.
And I said, what? Why have you done that? And he said, well, that is a story of this generation that this game came out.
And it was like a huge deal for a moment. You know, the What's-his-face was out there going, if you criticize this game, you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all that rubbish.
Numerable quote.
My point to him was, this game is ass and there were like loads of great games we should be celebrating. And so I stripped that out. I knew what he was saying.
He was trying to say, if you're telling the story of this generation...
I said a little bit clever, clever. Like...
Yeah, I agree.
If the whole feature was on that criteria, then maybe.
Yeah.
But...
Yeah.
You can't just throw in one because it'd be bizarre.
Yeah, yeah. But, you know, I'm actually quite a big fan of those kinds of lists where you try and boil down a smaller era as opposed to trying to take on something much wider as we're going to in this Nintendo list. Yeah.
Because you could just be a bit more... You just have such a certain sense of what your criteria is. Like it was fun to do that Games of the Generation podcast because it was...
You could get your arms around it as a generation still and make a call on what things mattered along the way in a very small period of time. So I like that. And yeah, I do remember just a little bit of like...
It's my first taste of being a bit of a dictator and being like this has to come out. We're not doing this basically on a few different entries like that. So interesting stuff.
Have you ever tried to incorporate a scoring system into compiling a team list, Matthew? Do you think that ever works if you do like a weighted 10 points for your number one and then one point for your number 10 kind of thing?
I think there's a little bit of this in the ONM list, which we'll go into in part two. But otherwise, I don't think I ever worked with teams where enough people were invested enough to make it worthwhile doing. On NGamer, most things would just be me and Kitsy tossing ideas back and forth and then that would be it.
I'd be like, you got a problem with any of this? And he'd be like, no, that's fine. And so that was kind of the vibe.
It's a thing I'm incredibly envious of about the PC Gamer list, just because there seems to be a science to it, seems to be to the outside reader anyway. What is it like being on the inside of a big mad stats operation?
Yeah, it's sort of because we actually like approach the PC Gamer list in a few different ways. So we did the scoring system in a few different times. And then I think we decided it wasn't quite getting the results we wanted.
So there would be a meeting afterwards where a representative from the US and a representative from the UK would meet and then hash out the final list as I go somewhere.
Oh my god, it sounds like post-war treaties or something. Where did they meet? Which European's capital did they meet in?
It's very much inspired by the beginning of Battlestar Galactica when the humans meet the Cylons on the edge of space and then hours later, we had bombed Washington.
Where's the edge of space in the UK?
Land's End?
Land's End. We shall meet in Land's End and decide whether Grand Prix 2 is still up to stuff.
We shall meet in Land's End. That's big around the world at 80 Days Energy.
I've just been watching Manhunt on Apple TV, so I'm a little bit 19th century.
Pilled.
Lots of proclamations.
It's got that actor you like in it, hasn't it? Toby something?
Tobias Menzies, yeah.
That's it, yeah. Tobias Menzies, yeah. Okay, interesting.
Yeah, so we watched out a few different ways, and by the time I left, and I think they're still doing this, they did the scoring system. You would invite a certain number of freelancers to participate, compile it, and then you would have the meeting afterwards to decide the final list. I think that might have got to the point where most of the team joined the list, and joined the list-making process, the finalizing process, and it was a big debate.
I actually think that was the optimal way to do it in the end, because everyone gets to be heard, and loads of people get to question the logic of the list. I think we probably had a guilty ear of PC Gamer a couple of times earlier on, of just saying, it was based on numbers, so let the list stand kind of thing, so we don't have to have a big disagreement.
How about Brexit?
Well, there was a little bit of, I think, maybe there was a different relationship between the US and the UK teams before that, and I'm very conflict-averse, so I was just looking for a way to not have a big debate, but a big debate sometimes gets you good results, and I think it definitely did in that case.
This has actually reminded me of a huge part of list-making which had completely gone from my mind, but was when I was on Rock Paper Shotgun, when they did their Games of the Year, which they did in the form of an advent calendar countdown, so it was 24 or 25, I can't remember if they did Christmas Day itself, compiling that, that was numbers-based, so there was a big spreadsheet and you put in your games and you had a, you voted 1 to 10, so your heaviest weighting was 10, your least was 1, and that was, on paper, statistics-based, but what really bugged me about that was, in the process, it was open for quite a long window and people could go in and change things based on what other people were doing, and so there was a lot of jostling and a lot of score-tweaking to drive certain things out or drive certain things up, which I actually thought like it was really like passive-aggressive because there was lots of people leaving it to the last day to go in and then just shit on everyone's favourite games, because you were trying to get, you were trying to make your 10 votes stretch as far as possible. You wanted as many of your favourite games to make it into the list. Alice O'Connor, who is the news editor on RPS, would always spend her 10 on some really, really obscure bit of like, I'd say beyond indie and into the realms of like art game or art project, just to make sure it got in.
People would do things like that. I honestly think some people would adjust their scores so that their games didn't make it and so they didn't have to write entries in the list.
That was my big conspiracy theory. I wasn't as involved, you know, as a video person on the side, you know, but there were definitely years where some people got away with having like one game that they played in a list.
Right, right.
But also it meant that if enough people spent their 10 on like a weird heart pick, something quite strange getting very high up in the list or like the number one spot and you definitely sense a bit of bristling from people who did care about the craft of list making. This was never the case. But like, it would be like a far cry being Rock Paper Shotgun's game of the year.
It just doesn't quite sit right, but it could happen, you know?
Yeah, that is the other thing actually. The other like major flaw with scoring systems, like you say, is that, you know, say it's a weighted scoring system, we do top 15, so I think we did that one year. I think that did end up with getting like something quite odd and naughty spaced from like one freelancer who, you know, like, maybe the freelancers think about the list as much as the staff do, but the chances are they probably don't because they're not being paid a salary to think about these things and they were just asked to contribute.
I'm not saying that all freelancers, that's the case. Many like have that level of investment, but just had a couple where I was like, oh, by giving this 13 points, you've automatically forced it into the list, and so to delete it now is an aggressive editorial decision I have to make. I was too cowardly to do that at the start of working on PC Gamer, but by the end I had no problem doing that at all.
That was something I just grew into as a manager from being a 25-year-old manager to being a very tired and overweight 30-year-old manager. That's the difference there, I guess. That's the thing is that you could just get, someone could just say, I think Turok 2 is the best game of all time and force it into the list.
I'm not saying it shouldn't be there necessarily, but it does ask interesting questions. That is the other thing as well, actually. Picking a number one is hard because that will be the most discussed entry.
So wherever you put as a number one in the top 100 will be a lightning rod for discussion. So one year, it was very, oh no, that was a game of the year. We had an argument about MGS5 or The Witcher 3 getting game of the year in 2015.
That was it. I got my own way with that. I got my own way with that and then The Witcher 3 was voted the number one game in the top 100 the next year, I think.
So it's kind of like, not revenge because no one was as petty as me probably making the list, but I guess it more, it reflected, I guess, what the longer tail was on The Witcher 3. Obviously, we know it's the most important game of its generation, arguably, in that genre. So it kind of makes sense.
But yeah, the number one thing is an interesting factor, isn't it?
Yeah, absolutely. I was going to say more broadly, though, I do like it when you read a list and you can sense shenanigans going on behind the scenes. Like, this may sound unfair, because it's not a genre I play and I know nothing about it.
I was very surprised to see, was it Street Fighter 6 was in the top 10 of the last PC Gamer Top 100?
Oh, right.
Yeah. And that was just like, well, I think I can work out how that happened from afar. And that tickles me as a reader.
But at the same time, it's also kind of like, that's an interesting outcome. That's a weird bit of list craft.
Well, that's the thing, though, where if the intent of the list is to reflect what the staff of the magazine slash website think now, then that's a justifiable entry. And that's definitely a big question you ask yourselves. And then I remember there was one year where John Strike, the designer, I think I got a Red Alert II mod he liked put into the list.
And again, maybe I could have stripped that out, but I was like, well, it's quite interesting. Mods are part of the fabric of PC gaming. But arguably, I don't know, maybe sort of like maybe Bioshock Infinite should have got his place instead.
I don't know. Maybe to more people, that's a more relevant entry. But again, these are the questions you ask yourself when you make a list.
It's trade off of, you know, of reader versus writer. It's a really interesting thing. So yeah.
So I guess my last question, Matthew, before we get into the ONM Top 100, the final Top 100. When you read video game lists now from publications, we touched on this a little bit. Do you carry any of your editorial baggage into them?
Can you simply enjoy them in the way you might have done in the before times?
No, I definitely bring a lot of that baggage in. And amongst that baggage, I would say just like knowledge of previous lists. As an avid list reader, you can't help but carry, you know, what are the norms of certain lists?
And so I'm interested to see if people have kind of gone against them. Like you say, I prefer a kind of slightly shocking list, I guess, or something kind of goes against the grain. When lists have been made by people I know, trying to sort of see them in there, I guess, I'm interested in like the lower tiers of a list.
What happens in there is kind of a bit of a wild swamp. I think a lot of people focus on getting the higher end quite kind of tight, sort of water tight in terms of sense and feeling pretty good about it. And then there's sometimes a sense that like, you know, in a top 100, the lower 50, like anything goes, you know, what's the difference between the 86th best game and the 57th best game?
And I don't always know if as much thought has gone into it. We were obsessed with on OXM where I used to work on there and I was often talking about lists with Alex Day on my DepEd on the Mag and we were super interested in like what entry 100 was. The first entry you read, isn't that, it's almost as important as the last entry, I think.
So yeah, I kind of bring all that to them.
Yeah, sort of like, I must admit, I can still enjoy them, but I can also have the visceral reaction a reader might have of like, oh, that's fucking bullshit, what are you thinking?
Yeah, I actually do have that.
Well, that's the thing, I don't want to be like sanguine, sort of like, oh yeah, very good, the art of list making. I don't think that when I read every list, sometimes it's just a kind of like, well, that's a contrarian's take, what the fuck are you doing kind of thing.
Oh, I think that a lot.
Yeah, I think that loads. But also, I do think list making has a really valuable function, particularly for video games these days. The last couple of years, I've really become fond of polygons lists, actually.
I used to be a big fan of the Giant Bomb Top 10 list. I don't think they do those now, or don't do them as much, but they used to just have loads and loads and loads of different top 10s from various people in different cultural spheres and video game developers and the sort of people you wouldn't normally see making a top 10 because they don't work in editorial. So I thought that was very valuable.
But in recent years, polygon I found is really good for doing a big, I think it's like a top 50 list they do. Just sort of like hoovering up literally everything of notes from the year and having first hand impressions from someone who's played this. I don't know who any of those writers are, I don't know any of that team.
So it's just a pack of strangers to me. It's a bit different to reading a PC Gamer list where, like you say, I do know who some of the people are and what they might put in there. So yeah, there's definitely like a mix of viable utility to reading lists now.
And then also the, yeah, like I say, a classic, what the fuck are you thinking kind of reaction as well. Both definitely exist within my small brain. So yes, that's, yeah.
The most chaotic lists of all time were the mid-naughties Eurogamer game of the year lists. Because they had a, for a couple of years, they had a format where anyone who played the game could like weigh in. Well, actually, no, I think anyone could weigh in on any entry.
And so they'd have their best games of the year. But most of the entries would have one of the Rock Paper Shotgun founders in the mix, because obviously they were not then part of Gamer Network, but associated with them. So they kind of got pulled in, I guess, just as staff writers for these articles.
And it was just them being really sniffy about console games instead of PC games. You'd have a very earnest Eurogamer staffer making the case for Tomb Raider Underworld. And then you'd have John Walker or Ciaran Gillan just taking a big old shit on it, because it wasn't a fucking broken ass immersive sim.
It wasn't a horse jank game.
Basically, if it wasn't Boiling Point, they weren't interested. But it was just to see such contrarian thoughts embedded in the positivity of this Game of the Year list. I like that, though.
I miss the wildness of that.
The internet is too ordered now. We're too afraid of our own readers to be really bold in that way, because you just know you'll get a load of shit from them on Twitter. So that is a difference.
You could be a bit bolder in the pre-comments days, pre-asshole days, pre-right-wing grift days. It was a bit of a nicer time to be on the internet, I guess, to be a bit naughty. So I like that as a sort of, these are the people writing this.
So like it or don't, go fuck yourself kind of thing. Well, that's good, Matthew. I think that's a good primer for our next session.
So should we take a quick break, let people listen to 100 video games being read out and then talk about the list?
Yeah, set to some nice music.

Welcome back to the podcast. Hope you enjoyed that long list. It did have big BBC pools in the 90s energy, I would say.
Enjoyed that, Matthew. So we're gonna discuss that list now, and that kind of like final issues, top 100. I'm just gonna read a little bit of an extract from Matthew's lead news in this issue 114, signing off basically the end of Nintendo magazines in the UK.
It's interesting, so I think it contextualizes where Nintendo was in 2014 when you made this. Was this the end of 2014 you made this, Matthew?
It was September or October, I think.
Right, because I think one of the last reviews in this is the two Smash, maybe it's just one Smash Bros. game, the 3DS one.
I think it was the 3DS one, yeah.
Yeah, and then I think you missed out on the Wii U one, because that was a few months later, is that right?
That rings a bell.
Yeah, it's interesting, because you're sort of like, I wouldn't say defensive about where Nintendo was at, but you said like, it wasn't until Nintendo DS and Wii blew up that Nintendo went from Toymaker to serious business concern in the eyes of the world. Since then, detractors see Nintendo toiling the shadow of that success, while a fan who plays Nintendo's games, that's you lot, know the games have never shone brighter. I thought that was interesting, but what I also like is, you do, there's a whole feature in this issue where you try and review the future, so you give a load of fake scores to games that aren't out yet.
That's a fun feature, that's very enjoyable writing in there, I would say, a lot of very you writing in there, too.
I think it's all scrubs, actually.
Okay, well the humor just seemed kind of, I guess, you're quite aligned in your sense of humor, but very enjoyable anyway. I'm surprised you're able to do that in an official Nintendo product, the score for it.
Oh, you say that, so there's a thing which really made me laugh reading the top 100. In the Lylat Wars entry, there's a reference to Star Fox 2, which had never been released, at that point hadn't been released. And there's a reference into the entry about you being able to find it on corners of the internet.
Yeah, that doesn't quite seem right, does it?
I mean, what the fuck was an official Nintendo magazine doing going, oh, you should go and pirate the realm of Star Fox 2.
Maybe you're just feeling a bit raw because it was all over and you were like, one last shot on the way out. But what I do like is that you are kind of optimistic about the future. So you talk about how Splatoon was at E3 and that was like a big deal.
The original Splatoon were you. So the saddest bit of this last issue is knowing that a whole new generation of design talent waits just around the corner and we won't be here to cover it. At E3, we saw the arrival of the Splatoon boys promising to give the third person shooter a much needed shot of adrenaline slash Dulux and the ludicrously good team at Intelligent Systems currently working on code name Steam, big 2014 energy to bring that one up.
Listen, one out of two is not bad.
No, but what's interesting is you're talking about a new era here and you are optimistic about the future, but you don't know just how good it's going to be around the corner from that, right? Like you are two and a half years from the launch of the Switch and then Nintendo's fortunes change again. Do you remember what was going through your head when you were writing this, Matthew?
I was like, oh no, I'm not gonna have a job. No, I think I knew I was going to Xen at that point. No, I was definitely trying to end on a jollier note rather than a sour note and definitely hard to argue that it was so far from top of the world at that point.
You couldn't really deny it. But I think actually what I wrote in there is what I was feeling in terms of the direction of like travel for Nintendo. The fact that they had, like that E3 just felt really energized.
Like Splatoon was a big part of that because here was something completely new and the fact that they put those people front and center and I think in that same piece, I talk about the rise of Nintendo Treehouse and the idea of Nintendo trying to get away from just being like Miyamoto and Enuma and loads of anonymous people and the good work that Awata-Ras did to like really open up. Our appreciation of who makes these games and phase two of that was a newer generation, all those names who you recognize from those interviews coming up and making games. And admittedly, I don't know if that revolution quite came to pass.
Outside of Splatoon and ARMS, the really new new, the new newness that we were promised was very early Switch and it's kind of died off a bit. At the time, there's the beginnings of a thing here. Obviously, you couldn't have predicted Switch and just how big it was gonna be.
And I think the key move that no one really appreciated back then, because this was still the era of Wii U and 3DS, was just what would happen when they combined everyone behind one piece of hardware and merge their handheld and console teams. That is what has unlocked what seems like a crazy era, but is this one console era. I think that is, that's the, if I was to write it again, I would maybe, because the rumblings were there and they were edging towards that.
And you would have said, oh, this is, this is going to be the thing, but.
Yeah, it's a really interesting read. Like it doesn't feel like naive or anything. And I think as well, it's quite, quite nice to see the little bits of narrative strands that you have like sort of threaded through this podcast as well.
So I'll just, I'll just wait one note.
Well, I just mean like your, you know, your sort of like interest in certain figures at Nintendo getting prominence is a very you thing. That's a very like, that's a very, you know, you have a magnifying glass to everything Nintendo is doing. You're paying attention to all of its moves.
So this stuff matters to you as someone who is invested in this and paying attention to it. So I enjoyed, I enjoyed reading that. I sort of like, it's also just quite nice to have a state of the nation like that.
And in this, at the start of a magazine, it's not just the edge intro where you can't really say anything of notes.
And I didn't.
It's just a proper sort of like, yeah, proper dignified side off before you sort of like get your hat and coat and leave, basically. So yeah, I really liked it.
Oh, that's kind. Yeah. I must admit, I rereading that issue for this episode, there was a lot in there.
I was like, oh, this was actually all right. You know, this was okay. This was quite a bleak time.
And I tried to kind of forget about a lot of it, but I was like, oh, this thing's not embarrassing. Like as a final thing.
Yeah. Yeah. And Star Fox 2 available at all good ROM sites now.
The really mad bit of that issue is the Meet the Team page. Where Joe wrote, and it was like, I think it was everyone who ever works on ONM over the years and like what became of them, but they're just really weird. A lot of them like die in quite weird ways.
Yeah. There's a joke about interns dying, I think as well. Like there's just endless numbers of them or whatever.
And yeah, so lots of jokes at your expense in a very sort of soft, nice way. Yeah. Yeah, it feels very, I guess like games mags in this sort of vein just were kind of gone.
I didn't realize quite how jokey ONM was. I don't know if it was just these two issues, Matthew, but it actually feels maybe a bit more of the NGamer spirit in this than I remembered from it. Maybe that's because I remember the preceding eras of it a bit more.
That's the Castle era.
Yeah, well, you know, it's very enjoyable. And it, you know, sort of like, you know, and you still had the genius after this, Barrel Watch, of course, but yeah, no.
No, OXM, it was never the same. I just couldn't make it work. I just didn't have the affinity for the subject matter.
That's fair enough. But yeah, so I guess, like, how did you decide to end ONM with these two top 100 lists? What made you break it down into specific first and third party lists?
And what made you know this was the right way to go out, I guess?
The key part of it was there was just nothing for us to cover. And we were really desperate to fill some pages. So I looked ahead and went, oh, what could we get ahead of?
They were stripping us of parts at that point. Joe and Kate had been taken off in various regard. Like, I think they'd already been put onto OXM.
There was a lot of movement behind the scenes. So the actual staff lineup was, it was all quite turbulent. So part of it was like, well, here's a big project we can just do and it can largely be written by freelancers.
And so cynically, it ticks that box. Definitely the fact that it was the end and we'd been told in advance that the magazine was ending. It was like, well, this would be a nice way to kind of underline it.
Let's just leave this. We haven't done this kind of feature ever. So what better time now just to sort of say, this is it, this is what we're doing.
These are the best games, according to us. I thought that would just make it a nicer thing for people to kind of keep down the line. I think the most interesting decision was to split it into two separate lists of, so first party and third party, games published by Nintendo and games not published by Nintendo, because I felt if you mix them up altogether, arguably it'd be the same list, but you know, just a bigger, messier thing.
I felt like the first party stuff tended to dominate the conversation and trample over some of the third party stuff. I was really interested in being able to surface more interesting things. I thought if we cut out all the first party, let the third party kind of duke it out without that extra pressure, that would be really interesting.
I think I was more interested in the third party list than I was the first party list.
Yeah, well we can talk about that third party list in the Patreon episode as well.
Yeah, absolutely.
Because it is a very interesting exercise, yeah.
Yeah, so, yeah, you know, I just thought, I hadn't seen that before. I thought that would be different. I remember having a bit of a struggle with some freelancers who were debating whether certain titles were first party or third party because they'd been like published by Nintendo in the UK, which is basically what I based it on, but maybe weren't in Japan.
And some people were trying to be kind of clever clogs about it. And it was like, oh, let's not do this. And there's a lot of people arguing about second party studios or parties that, you know, third parties had worked with Nintendo and da.
But I thought it was a pretty clean divide. And it just meant that we'd see stuff. I mean, in both this that you wouldn't normally see because, say, a third of those, you know, the top third of the third party probably would have like invaded the first party list quite comfortably and driven out, you know, the very interesting bottom third of the third party list.
So that made perfect sense.
Yeah, I do like it as a kind of like a completionist kind of exercise really to, you know, because not to spoil it, but the number 100 in the third party, sorry, yeah, number 100 in the third party list is the David Beckham game on GBA. Go, go Beckham, whatever it's called. And it's, Sean Bell wrote the entry, I believe.
It's a Sean Bell ass pick. But like it's again, like that, you know, that obviously would never make a top 100 of the two combined, but it's, you know, that's just like, but again, that you hear that and you're like, that's a really interesting list. I think number 99 is infinite space.
So from there, you know what I mean? Like it's just, that is because of, I guess, the similar ways in which, you know, Nintendo's, Nintendo's dominant series end up taking up real estate in a list because they have to, because Mario has to, it makes sense. It means there's just room for kind of weirder stuff at the side.
So I can see why you did both lists. It does make sense.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Had you made any similar lists before working on this one, Matthew? You say that lists weren't really a big part of what you did. You did anything like this when you did Nintendo Gamer and you ended that, that magazine?
No, because I wasn't there right at the end. I don't think we did do a top 100, just because we had the directory, which was so list heavy. I think that kind of filled in a lot of it.
Right, right. I have a feeling we did like the, maybe we did like the best Wii games. I don't know if we ever did like all of Nintendo and NGamer.
I think we did a top 50 for like the 50th issue of NGamer, but it might've just been like Wii and DS games. So this was, no, I think this was the only time I ever did like an out and out, like this is it. This is the Nintendo list.
We're gonna throw a load of resource at this, a load of money, a load of time, a load of writers. One of the things I'm like most pleased about that list is the variety of people in there. It's a snapshot of a very particular kind of games writer in 2014.
It's like the Nintendo heads, there are a few NGamer kind of alumni in there. It's quite a me, quite a Joe Scribs, quite a Kate Grey list in terms of mutual friends and people whose like opinions we agreed with. People you might not necessarily see loads of things online, but are always there.
The piracy thing, Lylat Ward's, that's definitely an Andy Hamilton joint. But then that's why you ask him to do it. That's what you hope for, right?
Is you want that take, so.
Yeah, absolutely. I think as well, like it's, that's what's fun about it actually, is that knowing who about 80% of the people are, right? Is seeing an entry in there and then thinking, you know, I wonder who put last window in here and flicking down and seeing the magic MC.
But also just things like seeing Zelda 2 in there and then seeing KB and being like, yep, that tracks kind of thing like it.
Yeah.
You know, this is stuff that, yeah, it's kind of like, is at the back of my brain somewhere.
Sitting in punishment and then you get a bit of Simon parking.
Yeah, like I think that's what I like about it is, there are like peculiar, more peculiar I guess than a standard sort of like, you know, Mario 64 or GoldenEye take of like, I had this in my collection and it mattered to me and people going to bat for it. That's what I think is good about this list is you see that mix in there of the, you know, the classics you expect to see as a reader, they definitely dominate the top 20. But then like loads of other stuff that, yeah, reflects people's sort of Nintendo peccadilloes, I guess.
But yeah. So do you remember how much notice you had to make this once you learned ONM was closing, Matthew?
It was all quite quick. I think ONM was, I think we knew it was going in about five issues. It's how I remember it, because there was a few issues of panic.
Oh God, I've got to find a new career. And in that timeframe is when it all went tits up at Future London and they moved everyone to Bath. So there had to be enough time for all that to have happened and for me to then get the escape pod that was OXM.
But that wasn't on the cards at the start of the process. So about five issues, I was never very ahead of things. I wasn't a very organized editor.
I kind of went month to month. I think this is probably the most organized I've ever been doing this feature and kind of getting moving on it pretty quickly. I don't know if I even did say, was allowed to say to freelancers, to frame it as like, this is the end of O&M.
I don't think I did, is how I remember it. Annoyingly, I've been trying to find, cause Catherine wrote for the list. I thought she might have the email where I sent out the pitch for the list and how we compiled it.
Cause I don't quite remember it, but she doesn't have that email. I know actually weirdly, one of our listeners, Alex Jones, contributed a couple of entries to it. So maybe he's got that email and can send it to me so I can see.
But yeah, I wish I had that email. Cause I'd love to be able to say, read out what I actually sent to people to get this list. But I don't have that.
So it's a very unsatisfying bit of podcasting.
No, that's okay. I mean, you know, trapped on a future server, probably long deleted now. How did you compile the two lists?
Do you remember what your criteria was?
I don't think it was all time important. I say this again, cause I just don't have the, I just don't have the memory for it. I think based on what's in there and the tone of it, I think I sent out a thing to loads of writers and people on the staff.
People did vote. That was phase one. So this was compiled with people picking their top 10 games.
I think we framed it as like things you could play now, or like if they were still good, rather than we're looking for like a historically most important list ever. Like there are certain things which are, kind of tick both boxes. So like Ocarina of Time at number one, is definitely an important Nintendo game choice.
But I also know that loads of people personally still really love it and consider it great. Particularly because the 3DS version had like renewed it. So that's why I think it was still Heart Picks.
It's quite thin on like NES and SNES.
Thinner on NES I would say.
Definitely. The NES games, that's just Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 3 and Star Tropic, which is like fucking balmy.
What's interesting is there is like, there's like one of those River City games, NES games in the third party lists. So that's interesting to see that over there. But I did other work.
That stood out because you just, there are so few NES games in the list.
It's quite interesting. Yeah, that is true. So yeah, so I think it was like, pick your top 10, not score, but like just list them onto 10 and we put them all together.
And then we definitely at one point had a version of like, if this was just based purely on votes, this is what the list looks like. And then there was a big editorial phase to it where we decided like, how could we honor these individual lists without putting out something that was too barmy, made sure our personal favorites were in there. That's why there's some like big Castle Heart picks quite high up the list.
Like I was definitely in Tyrant, Tyrant light mode for this, I'd say, in terms of forcing things on people. I did find an email I sent to Mark Green, who contributed to the list, but he didn't actually vote in it for whatever reason. But I remember sending him the long list as like a sense check.
Right, right.
As like a, you know, the email is a little bit cringe, cause it's like, there's no one I respect more on this topic here. I just want you to sense check this and make sure there's nothing really important or interesting that you think we've kind of missed. And he gave me some picks and the list actually did change a little bit after that.
I just read out a couple of his thoughts cause they made me laugh. This obviously was in the top 100 at one point. Pokemon Coliseum.
Feels like this one could drop out the top 100 and no one would miss it, which I agree.
Guess who liked that idea?
Yeah. He argued, I'd argue Rhythm Tengoku is a bit low, which is like a big greener thought. Originally Majora's Mask was below Twilight Princess in the list.
And it said, Majora's Mask below Twilight Princess. That seems a bit iffy to me. I reviewed both, so my judgment is probably askew, but Majora's Mask has only improved with age, while Twilight Princess hasn't.
Did the readers say otherwise? So I just thought it was interesting that I obviously took on board his thoughts and some of that went in there. But yeah, outside of emails, it's hard to lock down exactly how it changed over time.
But the version I like that's in my head is that Joe and Kate were very involved because they were on the mag still and I wanted to make sure they felt ownership of it. Whether or not that's true, maybe they'll say otherwise, but that's how I remember it.
Well, I look forward to Joe DMing me and letting me know either way. That should be good. But yeah, it certainly feels quite rich.
And I think what's interesting is I didn't really recoil reading any of this. So I do want to ask you about how you think it holds up, but to just give you sort of my take in the first instance, Matthew, just so I'm not agreeing with you politely. I do think that making an ONM Top 50 isn't quite as hard as making like a PC Gamer Top 100, because I think Nintendo's history is a bit more linear than the history of PC gaming.
The PC game has just got so much disparate stuff, genres that only exist there, and sort of like evolutionary dead ends, and genres that have died, that sort of thing. It's sort of like with Nintendo, the biggest questions are how much do you punish the N64 era for seeming a bit dated? I think that's like the big question that you have to ask yourself, because with the SNES, SNES games hold up really, really well, because they are like the pinnacle of 2D visuals and sound, and like they all mostly play pretty great still, you know?
So that's like a massive tick in the favour of SNES games. And then when you get to the GameCube era onward, like a lot of that stuff, a lot of what Nintendo was making is pretty timeless. So I think that helps in a way, is that like you can treat it as, you can say it's like games you would enjoy now, and it's true for some games that are like 20 to 30 years old.
And I don't think that's always the case when you're doing like a PlayStation or a PC or an Xbox, for example. Does that make sense?
Yeah, that made sense. Yeah, I don't agree with that.
The only other thing I was gonna say was that the funny thing is seeing a tiny bit of recency bias creep in. So seeing like Wonderful 101, for example, which is a very you pick, not saying that wouldn't necessarily be in your top 100 now, but there's little bits and pieces like that of 3DS or Wii U things that reflect the time a little bit more.
Yeah, that felt like part of the list duty to kind of inform people and use a bit of heft. Like maybe that got punched up a bit higher than it should have been. But as like a last ditch attempt, one of many in ONM to tell people, this thing is really, really legit.
You are likely a person who only buys Mario, Zelda and Pokemon, because that is true of most ONM readers. And it was just really just a desperate attempt to get people to just look beyond the obvious, but...
Yeah, but I don't think there's anything wrong with that. So, but what do you think? How do you think this list holds up?
And what do you think it says about this moment in Nintendo's history?
I think the recency bias thing is true. I think there's some strange 3DS, not strange, there's like more 3DS than Wii U than there maybe should be based on like the whole history of Nintendo. It gets like inevitably conservative as it goes higher and higher.
There aren't really any surprises or shocks in the top 20. You get a lot of Mario games, you get a lot of Zelda games, quite a few Metroids quite well represented. You know, reading it now, I sort of think, what is there any way of shaking up this top 20 particularly?
How do you really challenge this without putting very strict rules in place? Like without going one game per series, say, which some lists do do, but I don't think you can do a Nintendo list because Mario is a genre of games, you know, arguably. And to go like only one makes the cut is, I mean, it would create a very exciting, different list, but it would also just not represent, you know, what is true.
So, you know, that is just the inevitable thing. There's never anything more boring than the Nintendo all time top 10, I think. Like it's just so hard.
Maybe how you mix up the kind of games that are always there. If a list came to the conclusion that Metroid Prime was the greatest Nintendo game of all time, that would be a bit different. It's always a Mario or Zelda, it just is, you know.
And so like I look at it now and think, well, we didn't quite escape that. You know, the bottom half of the list is like super interesting, but it becomes, you know, it becomes pretty standard.
Yeah, it does. But like it takes, I would say, until you get to the top, like 30 for it to feel that way, maybe a top 40. But before that, it definitely pulls you in some different directions.
It is good seeing stuff in there that like, you know, has a reputation like Chibi-Robo or Sin and Punishment. But like you say, like the readers who are only into Mario, Zelda and Pokemon might not know about. And, you know, right up to seeing you go to bat for things like Xenoblade Chronicles or Kid Icarus Uprising, which matter to you and are important to surface is like this is some of the best stuff Nintendo's making.
Yeah, I mean, that probably is the boldest it gets, is like dragging something that new into the pantheon of the top 20 or 30 Nintendo games.
Xenoblade at 18, definitely that's like the...
That's a bit of a statement pick, I guess.
Held up quite well though, that as a choice, I think.
Yeah, I mean, it's a series that's now a big part of a lot of people's Nintendo diet. So, I don't think anyone would look at that and go, oh, what a mistake.
I also am a big fan of the Pokemon games you did take into this as well. Can I ask a bit about that? Because you got HeartGold up top.
And when I thought about this exercise, I thought HeartGold is going to be the one I go to bat for because it includes the world of red and blue. So therefore, you don't need to pick that as well. But it's also still got the very nice 2D art style that they maintained over on the DS.
So it's sort of like the best of... It's kind of like everything that I think is important about that is still in there, for example. Do you remember what goes into those choices when it's stuff that you don't really personally care about?
How you sort of determine what goes in there?
I think that one was... That was... I wouldn't have voted for it.
So that would have been voted for by the people who liked Pokemon games. Interestingly, for a series of its size and importance, Pokemon is only represented by that and Snap in the list, where most other franchises... There's so much Mario, there's so much Zelda.
Based on how the rest of the list behaves, you might expect there to be another Pokemon in the mix. I'd argue that's just due to how similar... I think it's harder to make the case for this and this.
This, to me, is... Certainly, I think on this part I've said several times, if you put a gun to my head and said, What's your favorite? I'd say HeartGold and SoulSilver. It's the one I played the most of.
It does seem to be that perfect meeting of a retro one, which did lots of wild stuff that people really like, and a particular point in Pokemon's technical evolution, where the quality of life features were pretty good and the look of the thing and the sound of the thing and the pedometer was a fun extra twist. Like, there's an awful lot right about that, so I can understand why that was the one we let in.
Yeah, absolutely.
Let in, but you know, I'm just like, in my world, there wouldn't be a Pokemon game in that list, but that's obviously absurd.
Well, that'll be an interesting thing for us to discuss when we do our long list next week, for sure. But yeah, there's a few other things I liked in there where I was like, oh, maybe this can be explained by the fact that they had a resurgence of some kind. So for example, Lylat Wars at 26, that's your fifth highest N64 game in the list.
And I think it's a very celebrated game, but it's not necessarily considered a mega top tier game in the way that GoldenEye or Mario 64 are, for example. But I wondered if that getting that high, higher than something like Perfect Dark, for example, if that was like a kind of, oh, because it's been on DS, 3DS as well, maybe it's punted back into the memory a little bit.
But yeah, there's probably a bit of that. While the series quality hasn't like always been there, and this is probably like still the highlight, not definitely still the highlight, the footprint of Star Fox is quite big and how it's represented. And there is a part of this list of trying to make sure that like all the biggies are accounted for.
It doesn't really explain why it's so high in the list, which is true when you look at it, you do think, oh, interesting. It wasn't like we were talking about it all the time and evangelizing it, but I think Star Fox has to be in definitely the top 100 somewhere.
Yeah, that makes sense. I was just kind of curious about that sort of placement, which is cool. The other thing I wanted to ask you about was Game Boy Camera at 97.
So I do get that pic. It has the tiny whiff of Charlie Brooker saying Twitter's the best game of all time to it, but I do think it's quite a fun entry.
Oh, it's 97.
Yeah, it's 97, but I guess it's that thing of like, you get to represent a part of the history of a platform that wouldn't otherwise be talked about elsewhere, right? So maybe that's part of the thinking there.
Yeah, I think so. And there was definitely debate around things which had exploded in the Wii era, like Wii Fit. It's like, does anyone actually like this?
While it's this huge story, does anyone actually like it? No, it doesn't go in. Is there a bit of fondness for this weird game by camera?
Are we just trying, you know, would we like to have something very interesting on the first spread of this feature? Maybe that's part of it.
Yeah, absolutely. And then interesting as well to see you wrestle with, like you say, the Wii series that do get in there. So you've got Wii Sports in there, for example, and Wii Sports Resort are both in there.
That's interesting as well, because again, you've put them in the bottom 50, so you're not trying to say the most popular things are the things that matter. Like, I don't know, I don't think this is why the list holds up well. It's not like, I think like you say, like it ticks a lot of obvious boxes, but then there's a lot of like very heart picky kind of stuff in there as well.
Maybe that heart pick stuff doesn't necessarily penetrate the top 10, but then it doesn't need to. I also wanted to ask you about the fact that you got two games in joint first, like Mario Galaxy and Ocarina of Time. I feel like editorially I understand why you did that, because Mario Galaxy was the pinnacle of what could be achieved by Nintendo as game designers on Nintendo hardware.
At that point, you have Mario Galaxy to a number nine as well, which is interesting, but it's like, as a milestone in its history, it's important to represent. At the same time, you've picked a Zelda that I think would be uncontested as a choice to have a number one in this list. Do you remember how you got to having two number ones?
I think it's like being a chicken, really, and in terms of not, you know, it felt like we anointed, you know, like the last issue of ONM was going to leave it for all time with like Mario or Link, you know, it had to be one. And throughout the list, there's so much of both of them in there. It feels quite deliberate in terms of trying to create some kind of debate or discussion by basically sitting on the fence and saying these two things are as important as each other.
My list, obviously Mario Galaxy, I mean, my list, I don't know, Ocarina would be near number one, really.
These days it's a bit harder to see that being at the top.
That's quite a traditional pick, accepted Nintendo wisdom. Galaxy is more controversial in that sense. I'm basically projecting a lot of stuff onto a decision that I don't remember brilliantly.
I'd like to think that I was trying to pair the most traditional bit of accepted Nintendo wisdom and the most recent Nintendo masterpiece we could all agree on. But I don't think it was as clever as that. I just thought it'd be nice to have them both on the same page and for you to have read through these 200, these two lists of games and get to there and then just to end on this sort of symbolic, it was both of them.
Yeah, that's fair enough. I was curious if any choices jump out to you as being a bit weird looking back.
Obviously, all the Castle heart picks from listening to this podcast, you know what I like, you know what I value, so I'm obviously gonna force their way in there. I'm gonna apologize for that. Two Mario and Luigi games is a bit odd.
That felt unnecessary to me.
Yeah, Superstar Saga feels like you tick that box, doesn't it?
The heart pick is about its inside story. What that feels like to me is that lots of people voted for Superstar Saga, so I let it in, but then I also didn't want to like, let the Superstar Saga narrative continue. So I put in Bowser's Inside Story also, but just lower down.
So it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't like make any difference at all to my argument. That's quite weird. Two Rhythm Heaven games is an indulgence.
It sure is, yeah, yeah.
But that again, like, I think that's something to do with Greener's interference. Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes shouldn't be in this list.
That's a third party game, isn't it? That was published by Konami, according to Wikipedia. I don't know if that's true or not.
Nintendo worked on it though.
Yeah, they did, but I think they're like, if it was ever published by another, no, that's not, yeah, I think that that should be how it counts, right? Cause pretty much every Capcom Nintendo game for a long time was published by Nintendo here, right? So you wouldn't call it first party, you know what I mean?
Like it's, yeah.
Anyway, well, I say it shouldn't be in this list, not necessarily because of the first party, third party confusion, just, I just don't think it's, I don't really know why it's there.
It's a curio, that game, isn't it?
It is totally a curio. Last Window at 57 is obviously mega-lol, as is at the other Castle Peaks, yeah. Hydro Adventure, Golden Sun being as high as it is, and maybe being in this list at all, like, that should-
And not the most beloved in that series as well?
My, again, my purse, the one I like, so that's what counts. If other people on the team liked Golden Sun and had been invested in it, they would have been able to make their case, but they weren't, and that's on them. It's on them to stop me.
I'm not gonna stop myself. Moboshi at 100, that's a classic. Annoy people with their 100th pick.
The first thing that they read is ideally something they haven't heard of.
What is that game?
It's a WiiWare game made by, I want to say Jupiter, it's really good. It's like a really abstract early WiiWare game, puzzle game, where you kind of play these three puzzles simultaneously and they kind of impact each other. That was just me being a wanker, putting that in this list.
Amazing.
Luigi's Mansion 2 at 41, that seems mad to me.
Yeah.
Luigi's Mansion represented in the list, fine. In the top 50, I don't know.
I don't think that's held up that badly as a choice. No, but it's not like... It's nowhere near the top 20, so I don't know.
I think Luigi's Mansion is a serious... I think that's very low tier Nintendo, for me personally, but anyway, that, I was like, hmmm. And that thing I said about the NES being represented by so few games, it's more the absence of things.
Though saying that, trying to think what big NES games are put in there, actually, Zelda 2 is in there as well, so. And I think a lot of the NES stuff, there's more of it in the third party list.
Yeah, do you think it would like... That's the thing as well, is that when you turn on your Nintendo Switch, you've got the online subscription, you dive into the little catalogs of games that have been gradually assembling. Do you ever dive into the NES games?
Because I never do. And it's not, not to say it has no value, but I sort of think to most people, you probably would recommend something like, well, I don't know about Metroid Other M, but you know, certainly a lot of these are the games you... But you know what I mean?
Like it sort of, it maybe makes sense to pick something like Kirby's Epic Yarn rather than like Ice Climbers, you know what I mean? Like it's...
Yes. Yeah.
Yeah.
There's maybe a case for like original Kid Icarus, but you know, Kid Icarus at Rising is just so much, so much better, so...
Yeah. Yeah. I was curious as well about, you've got Pikmin 3 in there as well.
That's quite a nice placement for that. I think a lot of people still agree that Pikmin 3 is the best one. So not everyone was enamoured with 4, I don't think, and how long it was, etc.
Pikmin 3 was... It felt like a bit of an underrated gem on the Wii U. It just...
You know, like so many games that generation, Nintendo just really nailed the formula and made like the best version of it. Like mechanically, Pikmin 3 was just so pure. They added a lot of noise to it in 4.
And I do love just how packed 4 is. Like if you love Pikmin, there's just shitloads of Pikmin in there for you to play, which is obviously cool. But I can't help but think core idea of Pikmin has never been better than Pikmin 3.
The balance of difficulty and just how nice it looked. So yeah, that's a pretty solid one.
Any other observations about the list, Matthew?
I don't think we necessarily knew what to do with Super Mario Galaxy 2.
Right, right.
Because it is so close to Mario Galaxy. Like what... Like it's just more Mario Galaxy, which we've put at number 1.
And then here it is sitting at number 9 for some reason. Like, she didn't want to put it at 2. Because we'd already split the number 1 position between Zelda and Mario.
You couldn't then go, Oh, and Mario is actually 2 games? Because I think that would be really confusing. Your number 1 is actually 3 games.
Did you resent putting Earthbound that high? Because 25 is... I think that's like one of your highest rankings, next game, 10th place.
No, I think that had been voted for by lots of people.
I guess it had just come out on the 3DS store as well. Or the Wii U store, the year before.
The one now where I'm like, ugh, is like GoldenEye.
Oh really? I don't think that's a bad placement.
But that's coloured by the fact that I maybe didn't have as good a time going back to it as I thought I might.
I thought it held up quite well personally, but that's fair enough.
It gets to number 8 without anyone having replayed it. That is just the memory of GoldenEye, our 8th best Nintendo game.
That's a good point, actually. Above Mario Galaxy 2, I can kind of see… Above Metroid Prime, actually, that's an interesting one.
You can flip those or something like that.
That's most important games of all time. It being that high feels like an entry from a different kind of list.
Readers expect to see that, though, I think. That's where good editor judgement comes into it, where it's like, this should be in there, because to our core readership of people who probably own 10 to 20 Nintendo games per platform, this will matter to them, so it kind of makes sense, but yeah. Okay, so last question then, Matthew, before we wrap up.
As we compile our own top 50, how many of these same games do you think will make the cut?
I think the top 50 will be built from the same games that are all in this list.
Do you really think so? I think so, because there's been the Nintendo Switch since then.
Oh yeah, obviously, yeah, Switch will come through, it's like a wrecking ball, I take it all back.
Yeah, that's the thing, that's what's really interesting about looking at this, is like, if you did have to do the same exercise now for a magazine, I just think it would be completely redrawn by the landscape of the Switch. This list, quite a lot, but the third party list, maybe like, maybe a third of the games would be newer games, you know, just because what counts as like a third party Nintendo game, the definition of that has changed exponentially since you made these lists, but there's just so many of them now, like, you'd have to put Hades in that list, you know, it's sort of like, those are kind of, you know, would you put a Kami in that list, or would you put ports of older games that are now synonymous with Nintendo platforms, an interesting question, I think. So, yeah, okay, my prediction is about two thirds of these games will appear in the top 50, Matthew, and then things will be a rearrange.
And then, but it all depends on the criteria we come up with in the next episode. Do we favour older games, do we try and represent the entire continuum of Nintendo, or do something newer? Like, it's, we'll figure that out on the next episode, Matthew.
But yeah, I've enjoyed this discussion of list making, and this list in particular, didn't that have the, had the stuff for part one, Matthew?
Yeah, I really enjoyed that, that was good. I'm feeling pumped for part two.
Yeah, me too. So next Friday, you'll hear part two of this, where we construct the long list, go through most major Nintendo series, pretty much every major Nintendo series, and some of the smaller ones as well, to build a pretty viable long list. And then, yes, like I say, a couple of weeks from now, part three, the final part, we will compile the top 50 on the episode itself.
So thank you so much for listening. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
