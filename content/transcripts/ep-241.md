Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. How have the mean streets of Los Santos been treating you as you prepare for next week's Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Deep Dive?
I'm making progress. I'd say I'm making healthy progress. I'm trying to hold back my opinion on the game so that it's a nice surprise in the episode when we chat about it.
I think I've revealed little snippets here and there. I got stuck behind a kind of pay gate, I guess. You had to earn an X amount to trigger the next mission.
That massively slowed me down. And right now, progress seems to be hindered by... Well, I won't spoil it because I want to talk about it in the episode, but I've got a bit of a moral dilemma, shall we say.
I haven't seen it through yet, so let's see how it turns out in the episode.
Intriguing. Well, you know, lots to look forward to there. That's coming next Friday.
I thought you were going to say the mean streets of Bath.
The mean streets of Bath remain fairly tame, I would say. I can't say that anything particularly threatening or unsettling has happened to me here recently. The scariest part of Bath, by far, is that area outside the McDonald's, which is the only place that spawns teenagers in the city.
It's the only spot. There's no other spot where you will find the teenager NPCs just appear in Bath's little open world, but they are all congregated around Macky Dees. Am I wrong, Matthew?
You must have noticed this.
I very rarely go down there because I just don't have any business down at that end of town. Is that our version of the alley where Bruce Wayne's parents get shot?
What crime alley? Yeah, I imagine that you've got your own little fantasy-style cloth map of Bath and that's labelled the Badlands. You know what I mean?
The Badlands.
You just don't go there.
Well, that's more like Temptation Alley because it's like Burger King, McDonald's, Krispy Kreme, Gregg's, the Morrison's supermarket which has nice cookies. So, I just avoid all those these days.
Yeah. Okay. Well, I see the wisdom in that.
It is definitely like a sort of danger gauntlet when you're leaving the train station and you're like, I could take a route here. I could go into McDonald's and leave McDonald's and have followed my route home still. It's that convenient for me.
I know it's the same danger for you. There's a KFC nearby. They currently have, I think it's something mental, like 60 of those chicken bite things they do.
What are they called again? Mini? No, not me.
Don't do this whole, I can't remember what they're called, Ruti.
No, because I never order, popcorn chicken. I never order them because I don't consider them like chicken canonically. I don't know about you, but they just seem like-
I don't consider anything KFC has chicken canonically. I'm quite snobby about my canonical chicken.
But there's something about the popcorn chicken in particular where you're like, well, it's got the essence of chicken. It's almost like the chicken version of having those bacon-flavored crisps, where they're like, what are they called? Razzlers or Rizzlers?
Right. It's thinking looking vague.
Exactly. But something meant to like 80 of them for like six quid or something. And I've got to just avoid that while the deal is going on, because the hot wing deal already did a lot of damage to me.
I was at like a crazy golf thing last night, and there were like photos of me from behind. And I think I'm still carrying a lot of like extra hot wing weight from the 20 wings for six pound deal, eight pound deal. So yeah, that's just anything I can do to avoid those places wise, you know.
I've been having celebrity encounters.
What? Does such a thing occur in Bath? Anti-Straighthead?
Well, I've had one celebrity encounter enough times that it's now boring.
Is it a theatre related thing?
Yeah. I keep seeing Dylan Moran. Oh, right.
Okay.
Because he's doing As You Like It at the Theatre Royal. It starts tomorrow and runs for a couple of weeks. And they've been rehearsing.
And I'd heard other people in the office say, Oh, I just saw Dylan Moran. But he's like always in the local Sainsbury's. Because I was in there and he wasn't doing like the subtle celebrity like, I've got a baseball cap on or like, don't bother me.
He was trying to put through, I would say, a massive supermarket style shop through one of my self-service tills. And it was too much for the scale. And he was going, I need another bag.
Someone's got to fetch me a bag so I can do a second thing. I was like, wow, you're so loudly famous.
Yeah, yeah, okay. I mean, yeah, I suppose like, see, I would be curious to know what was in his shop. Did you pay attention to that Matthew?
I imagine some people kind of just bus in every day when they're doing production. But I assume he's got like an Airbnb somewhere because he was doing like a normal food shop. Like vegetables, fruit, some condiments.
I didn't look too far. I mean, he had it fucking like jengered up on the scales. I was quite nervous.
I was at the self-service next to him and was like, well, I can't say like a big fan of your work because he was clearly very stressed out about this teetering pile of vegetables. And there were some other lads who were attractive enough that I assume they're also famous, who are like, we're going up to the park for our lunch. You come in.
And he was like, oh, I've got to do this. I've got to do all this shopping. It was a really weird like, yeah, there was a lot going on.
And then I walked past him this morning at Society Cafe. And then Matt Elliott saw him in Sainsbury's Local again today. When is that guy rehearsing?
Because he just seems to live in Kingsmead Square.
Well, that's the thing is there aren't many places to go. You can't really be discreet in Bath and go in. There's no like hidden treasures in Bath really, because it's all pretty.
I mean, maybe you could go to the top floor of the Curde Lion, that pub down that alley. And then sit in the corner there with a book. He might be a bit harder to find.
But yeah, I don't know. I also think that if you're going...
He's giving off big, recognize me energy.
Do you think so? He seems like a kind of guy who wouldn't like that.
Yeah, I think he's giving off like, I'm into it, that's my read.
Well, I haven't engaged with the works of Dylan Moran for I would say 20 years at this point. Whenever he had a standup come out in the mid noughties and I had some friends who were like, Black Books is my entire personality. I think we all had friends like that.
Spaced or Black Books or both was like their, and I picked Peep Show as my personality. That was the choice I made at the time of all the different channel four box sets.
So if it was freaking Super Hands in local Sainsbury's you'd be all over it?
No, not really. I don't really want anything to do with the people in it. You know what I mean?
I think I had a famous encounter in Paddington this week, but I don't know, not as in The Bear. I'm not saying the encounter was with Paddington and The Bear. But I was in the McDonald's by the station getting a cheeky chicken burger because they say that on the little self-service thing that's got the most protein in it.
So I'm like, well, that's the healthy one then. And I saw there was just like very good looking couple and the person behind the till was like, I'm sure I'll see you on the side of the bus one day. And then the couple looked to me as if to sort of like waiting for the recognition behind my eyes of who they were.
And I just sort of nodded awkwardly. I got fucking no idea who these two hotties are. They could just be Instagram stars for all I know.
But I get the impression I might have met someone very famous in the wild, but I have no fucking idea who they are. And then I'll be watching like a film in two years, and I'll probably realize who it is. But anyway, Matthew, a bit of an orator.
Maybe one of them is the person under the Ronald McDonald maker and the other one is the Hamburglar. Sand's Costume.
Well that was my anecdote was more of a cul-de-sac. Yours actually went somewhere, so that's a difference there. Well, okay, we're definitely not stalling for time as I flick through Metacritic in the background.
Page 462 of the best games of all time. Trying to find more games, 61 out of 100, to bolster my ranks in case I need to pick them later in this episode, Matthew. That's definitely not what's happening.
So this episode, new podcast format, a little bit connected, I guess, to the draft we did a few months ago, the sub 80 Metacritic draft, which was a really fun exercise. Quite exhausting, and this has proven to be exhausting too, but the premise is very simple. We've each got 750 points to spend on games on Metacritic across, it's across 10 different games.
We have to each pick 10 games. And it's about how we spend those points relative to the meta score of each game. So, for example, the page I've got open right now, the game iToyPlay 3 on PS2, 61, that's got a Metacritic.
Matthew, I'm sure you'll be rushing to pick that one. But that would basically take 61 points from Matthew's total. So he will be left with 689 points to spend on his remaining nine games.
And that is roughly the episode, really. And I think it's going to be fun because the mathematic side of it, I would say, puts us on the back foot a little bit, Matthew, because this is not really our area of expertise. Is that what you found yourself with this one?
Yeah, I've been creating little rules for myself to kind of try and simplify the maths. So, you know, we've obviously got 750 points to spend across 10 games. So I basically started in my head with, I've got 10 games that scored 75 on Metacritic.
And so I'm thinking more of it in terms of every game I can bring under, 75, another one can go above 75. Now, it may be a bit more finesse than that, but that's kind of the broad maths I've been using to focus my picks, you know?
Yeah, I'm somewhat nervous that Matthew is slightly better prepped for this than me. But I do have a set of rules and like brackets of games to swap in if certain things come off the board. And we'll basically see how it goes.
It's sort of unlikely in a way because this is the first time we're doing it and we're just kind of feeling it out. There's not a lot of shape to it. It's any game, right?
The ten are coming from all games.
All games. The rule we set was that the games have to be PS2 generation onwards or 2000 onwards, because I think we roughly discovered during the draft that we did that that was when the scores got a little bit less shaky. It's all a bit pre, it's a little bit Super Smash Bros.
79 before that, isn't it? We like, I don't know what was happening there. It's just some-
Pokemon Snap 77.
It's because like Dave's game blog, blogspot.com in 1998 said that he fucking hated Kirby and thought he was OP or whatever. So he's brought the whole thing down. There's that kind of energy to it.
So it gets a bit more dependable because I think the site did start in, I should remember this because the site used to work for dinner, literally a history of Metacritic recently. Set up by lawyers, it was. I think guys who trained for law and then went off to do this, something like that.
It's a good piece anyway. But after the early noughties, they made it a lot more professional. Certainly for a while, Metacritic was the most important metric in games.
Now there are a lot of different metrics for people to blame games not hitting their targets or crow about when their games have hit their targets and make it look like they had a plan all along, whatever it might be. But Metacritic is certainly still a great conversation starter and a great way to just think about games and archive games for the purposes of this podcast. I have a bit of affection for it after doing these two episodes, Matthew, where I'm like, it is kind of a useful resource because Wikipedia can never quite give you this many games in one place with the criteria that you want, but Metacritic is sort of uniquely suited to that.
Did you have that experience with it?
Yeah, definitely. And whether it's platform by platform or literally taking every game on Metacritic and putting it into a massive list from best to worst, you know, those are useful tools for doing these episodes. There are times where I wish I could like impose a couple of extra.
I wish you could do like a score, a specific score search. I wish you could say like, I want to see everything between 70 and 60, rather than trying to find it in like 600 pages of everything on Metacritic ranked. But, you know, that's maybe also a scenario that only ever arises in this specific episode.
So I can understand why they haven't invested loads of research time into that. That makes sense. But yeah, I definitely know what you're talking about in terms of having that affection for it.
And sort of wading through it, you begin to see like some like weird trends, or you're just reminded of maybe some older trends or things that people valued. You can sort of see some scores writing themselves in a weird way. Like often if games come around for a second go, like re-released or ported or re-made or whatever, they tend to get a lower score which is maybe like closer to the vibe of what it should be, or you know what it should maybe should have been first time around.
And you just get a better sense of that. If you've got like a spare five hours, it's really worth going through all Metacritic scores ever from best to worst.
Yeah, that is the thing that the amount of research for these two episodes has been so fucking onerous that I'm hopeful that the next time if this goes well and people like it, because it is a bit different to the drafts, if people like it and we do it again, that it will just become slightly less hard work as we figure out different criteria. Whether we do like a Nintendo themed one or a PlayStation themed one or a handheld themed one or whatever it might be. Yeah, it's certainly yeah, there's fucking loads of it.
That's what I'll say. It's fucking loads of Metacritic, Matthew. 577 pages of games from Red Dead Redemption 2 down to a family party, 30 great games on Wii U with 11 out of 100.
Truly, all of life is here. What a magical thing. So this is going to be fun, Matthew.
Before we get into it, I think we should just jump straight into it because I don't think there's any more preamble needed for Metacritic because we talked about it all in that draft episode anyway. All we really need to talk about is, I think the fact that we are only, this time we're doing it as a free for all, but we're not saying we won't necessarily introduce categories or certain things, objectives you have to hit in the games you pick in future. Is that how you feel about it that maybe there are different ways you slice this in future?
If the free form version, I guess we could only do the free form version once, or you change the point total and go down.
It felt like too much trying to get your head around all the numbers, and also making sure you had one driving game, one fighting game, one first person shooter, etc. It probably means it's not going to be hugely high pressure in terms of competition. You've got so many different places you could go.
More than anything, we'll come out the other end with two lists. Maybe people will want to do this exercise themselves as a free-for-all, and just see what they can come up with. I think we've both done enough research that we're going to come out with a list that we feel is as good and as balanced as we can possibly make within those restrictions.
I think there'll be more crossover than you think.
Unlike the draft, there's so many different ways into this. There's playing it safe around the 75 and not really moving away from there, and then there's sacrificing games, putting terrible games with low scores to just buy you more of a points buffer.
Yes.
That can also be done.
It's true, and it will be down to our panel of judges to decide. Yeah. Of nine judges, I think it is, that I asked.
I think they all said yes. I should probably double-check that. But our judges who have all previous guests on the podcast to decide who wins or loses.
Another way in which is different from the drafts is a panel of peers or former peers or whoever, and they are going to decide, we're going to accumulate the vote and it'll be like a sort of blind vote, like you can't see what anyone else is voting for. It'll be news to everyone when we declare who wins, which I think is a fun way of doing it because I think you get a bit too much of people responding to the stats in real time with the poll in the Discord or on Twitter. They can't do that here.
It's all down to what do our peers think? I think that's where the really interesting question comes of, can you get away with picking Yarris 17 out of 100, free game on XBLA, but then you can load up on fucking Half-Life 2 and Grand Theft Auto V or whatever. I mean, that's like a strategy you could employ, but how much will the panel punish Yarris is the question.
So I think it becomes a question of like, how low do I allow my floor to go? You know what I mean? How bad can it get down there in the depth?
Yeah, because we're both picking, alternating. If someone decides to go low, does that then open up another low pick for someone else? Yeah, we don't know until we do it really.
Indeed. Should we have a little pause here with a little bit of music and then we'll come back with the first ever Metacritic game. I should have given it a snappier title really.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, the rules for this, then. They're pretty simple, and they're quite similar to our Metacritic draft rules.
So, the crucial thing is that the score that we're using, the criteria for picking the games, is that you have to pick the highest score it got on Metacritic at its original release for it to be eligible. I.e., you can't pick a port that scored less just to get it in there, but it has to be based on the original release of the game.
And that's the key thing here. So, if a game... It's a bit of a anti-shitty ports maneuver, because this is more of a thing in the 360 and PS3 era.
That still happens now, where games would come out in looking like covered in Vaseline on PS3 and look like the best thing you've ever seen on 360. Bit of an exaggeration, but not too much, to be honest. I was there, I remember it.
And so that's the key thing to keep in mind. There may be exceptions though. I think Matthew, a full remake would count as an exception.
Is there anything else to discuss around that particular rule?
That all makes sense. Like if there are any weird fringe cases, we can debate them live in the episode.
Yeah, that's the interesting thing is you did say to me, I think you used Fable Anniversary as an example, like something to litigate. But I don't know if you're going to pick that or not. I guess we'll find out.
But that was, we didn't quite settle on the exact outcome for that. I think I said to you that maybe it was too close to being the original game, but you argued it's quite a lot different. So I don't know, these things do might, they might get a bit complicated here or there, but Resident Evil 4 Remake is obviously open and shut, you know.
As in, that would be allowed.
That would be allowed, yes. Because it's, well, it would be, you couldn't pick it as the original Resident Evil 4. They're different games.
Oh yeah, they're different games. Yeah. Whereas with Fable Anniversary, it's a question of, are you actually trying to sneak the 80-something rated Fable into your draft as a 69% rated 360 port?
I don't know. We'll see if anyone tries to pick it. Yeah.
I think we both also said that we've probably got cleaner picks than require that level of thought. Yeah. Here's the way I described it in the original Metacritic draft, which I think is helpful, right?
You have to pick the game when it first came out. You can't pick a port years down the line where critics have gotten grumpy about it. Let's call this the Hitman Blood Money Reprisal Rule, 79 on Switch, but 80 plus originally.
For example, Billy's Scholarship Edition on PC would not be allowed because it scored 87 on PS2. That was specific to the 80 plus criteria there. But anyway, yes.
That's a key rule. And then I don't know if there are any other key rules apart from the date thing we discussed, Matthew. 2000 onwards.
Anything else to talk about?
No anthologies or collections.
Yep. But that time that I properly fucked Matthew with the Metroid Prime Trilogy in the Wii Draft, which is probably the actual worst thing I've done to Matthew in a draft, that was bad form, really. Nothing like that.
You can't load up on games. You can't pick the old Mario All-Stars collection or whatever to get in Mario Galaxy. We just have these rules in place for a reason.
Well, then Matthew, I guess we should do the coin toss and decide who's going first.
Yeah, let me bring up the old coin toss.
I just can't wait to find out your strategy I've got. I've got no idea. But I think we're going to have more crossover than you realize.
What would you like, heads or tails? Tails it is.
Shit. Well, okay. Now the question is, do you go something that's good value first, or do you shit your pants early and then sort yourself out later on?
When you say shit your pants, do you see pant shitting as a really high game which you're then going to have to find the money for or a really low game shitting the pants as in putting a stinker in the mix?
Putting a stinker in the mix. I think I'll split the difference and go somewhere in between and take my beloved Mad Max for 69. That's my first pick.
Comes in under that 75 average. It was actually my second priority pick but I've got a backup for my first one. I don't have a backup for this one.
I think this is the best value low score relative to quality of the game. I'm not saying this is the best game of all time but it is a very solid open world game better than I would say most of the similar Ubisoft type open world games that have come out in the last ten years since it was released. It's almost exactly a decade old.
It is obviously based in the Mad Max world so it has a very particular fiction that you don't find in other open world games despite it being a bunch of deserts. They're very pretty deserts. And it's all about car combat, car customisation, making your car feel like it's your little home base as you're going along.
You got that little lad with the wonky eye in the... I can't remember his name. Your bloke who's going around with you.
It doesn't work out too well for him. Spoiler alert in the story. I should try and remember that guy's name.
Anyway, it was...
What is he called?
He's got like a rag tag or something. I think we had this literal conversation when we did the fucking draft last time. And I'll just find out live on the episode.
Oil rag? No. It's like a mechanical term.
It's like...
Chum Bucket.
Oh, chum bucket. All right.
So your car is being upgraded as you go. So you start feeling a little bit like... Honestly, like you're driving a fucking Ford Fiesta and trying to take down like these immense, you know, convoys of different lorries and stuff.
And then by the end of the game, I think you got a good grasp on the different ways you can play. It's not really like wipeout style vehicle combat. It's much more attach your harpoon, pull bits of a vehicle off, ram them at key moments.
It's sort of like a bit of a kind of like, I suppose you might say post-apocalyptic like burnout or something. Not quite as arcady as that but…
Weirdly, playing GTA San Andreas, whenever you get a mission where you have to destroy a car just by bumping into it loads and trying to knock it off the roads, there's almost like an evolution of that.
Yeah, for sure. So it really is its own little evolutionary track of open world games. Definitely some commonality with your Assassin's Creed and the like but quite particular as well.
So thoughts on this pic Matthew, was this on your radar at all?
This is like one of the classic, now acknowledged as being underscored. I do sometimes wonder if you can go too far the other way. Like what would you say is a fair score for this?
I don't think we can pretend this isn't like a 90.
No, I think it's probably somewhere between like a 75 and an 81, 82, that kind of thing.
Right, so it's so it's off by about five to ten points.
Yeah, which I think is okay.
Which I think is really all you can hope for. Like a lot of the things I've potentially lined up for this game. The commonality between every pick is I think it is undervalued in some way.
But by how much, you know, that's different. It's kind of interesting. I wish maybe we should talk about this at the beginning.
But when I was going through the list, it made me actually think back to like childhood of like, I get to pick one game for Christmas. I've got to really make it count. Like, what is the one good game I want?
And when you look at a load of 90 plus games, it's quite interesting, like, you know, how your mind begins weighing them all up of like, is that, you know, is that 97 really worth it? Five more than that, than that 92 or whatever. And yeah, I keep thinking of this in terms of money.
That I've got 750 Metacritic bucks to spend.
Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. I've definitely done more research in the middle part or lower than the upper end. Because I think that is, that's where the battles are gonna be fought.
There's no shortage of games, great games.
It's like how much time you spend in the middle.
Yeah.
You know, like how much of a gap are you trying to create to punch into the 90s, if at all?
Yeah, it's very true. So, well, I guess we're gonna find out, aren't we? So what's your first pick, Matthew?
My first pick? I'll also go for a 69 scoring game to eat into the same credits. I'll take Ghost Squad on the Wii.
Yeah, that was also in contention for me.
I think that that is quite underrated. I think going through all of Metacritic, another trend that pops out is 20 years ago, even 10 years ago, quite an undervaluing of anything with like an arcade backbone. People didn't see these games as being worth 50 quid compared to the all singing all dancing brand new narrative experiences.
You know, a lot of people are going, oh, this game's only an hour long. And you're like, not really, because obviously Ghost Squad has famously a huge amount of replayability baked in, in that there are different routes through the levels, different enemy formations, so it's constantly recalibrating itself. I'm not going to pretend that one run of Ghost Squad is radically different to another run.
You know, I'm not going to say it's like a light gun rogue-like or anything like that. But between run one and run 100, I think you'll be surprised at all the different places a terrorist can pop out of. And that is the magic of this game.
It's like, wow, there were five under the bed this time. That's crazy. What are they doing under there?
Very very charming. Love this sign, Gamer. If I'm spending money on it, I know I'll get a good amount of gameplay out of this.
Makes sense, Matthew. I think it's a solid pick. I told you we were thinking about the same fucking port when I sent you that WhatsApp message earlier.
We were, weren't we? Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I mean, I like this game a lot.
So I did, yeah, sort of, I did weigh this up. And yes, it's exactly the kind of example of like something that it technically is a port, but it hadn't been on home consoles before. It's, you know, it belongs to the Wii.
I think it makes sense for sure. So good old Matthew. And I love this game too.
I should also say I'm not, I'm trusting you on your maths and I hope you trust me on my maths.
Yeah, I mean, I've got, that's the other thing. This is the only time, apart from the one we've done the XXL episodes on like Bond films ranked or Nolan films ranked where I've done actual fucking spreadsheet maths, which I'm terrible at to like sort this out. So I've got a running total, trust me when I tell you that I'm playing it by the book.
Okay. All right then. So my next pick, Matthew.
My second pick, I'm going to get what's probably my lowest rated game out of the way. And that is the 60 rated Rise Son of Rome on Xbox One.
Oh, interesting.
Which I think is a little bit underrated. Certainly not as good as Mad Max, but I would say probably for the time, a 7 out of 10. It's a perfectly fine, very nice looking, fairly short.
So, you know, I think appreciated more now for that, for that reason, third-person hacker slash game, like very handsomely made. Just, and then I think at one point maybe has some Kinect nonsense tied to it that got shuffled around or whatever. But when it launched was just graphics, graphics, graphics.
And I played this a couple of years ago on Steam Deck, where people said it ran really, really well. And it did. And I honestly thought it was a little bit underrated.
I thought this was like a true dud. And for 60, which is definitely like low on Metacritic. And some of the games around it are like way shonkier than this.
This is a perfectly fine hacker slash game. Nothing wrong with it. And yeah, like mega graphics even 12 years later.
What do you think of this pick, Matthew?
I did have this down in my notes. I actually, I paired it with the Order 1883 for 63 points. In that they're both quite shiny things, which I'd say while aren't necessarily good, I think if you had them in a mini console, you might not have played them.
So they actually do have Curio value. Yeah, because not many people did buy this full price because they were told it was like a five or six hour long game. Same goes with the order, actually.
And I think it has been rediscovered by a lot of people who maybe spent ten quid on it in a sale and went, yeah, for ten quid, that's alright. Like a slightly weird AAA game that I hadn't experienced before. Yeah, I can't…
I don't necessarily have like any particular fondness for it, but I think it's a pretty good pick and a good use of sixty points.
Indeed. So, yeah, that was probably as low as I'll have to go, to be honest, because… Interesting, I might be going lower.
Well, I mean, it was this or Anthem for me, basically.
Yeah.
And, well, you know, I'm sure that we can talk about that another time, but between those, that gets me back twenty-one points to reinvest in the rest of my line-up, Matthew. So, that seems like good value, Mad Max.
So, you can get an 85 and an 86 if you want.
Yeah, potentially. So, why don't you take your next pick?
Well, I don't feel too threatened about having to go super low, if you're not planning to go lower than 60, unless you've got some sneaky backups.
Oh, yeah, I'm dying for fucking, what's it called? Murdered Soul Suspect, which I think I had to take last time. Tough.
I'm going to... So, I'm going to play it safe. I'm going to go almost bang average.
I'm going to go 74, binary domain.
Oh, yeah, came up in the draft as well, right?
It did come up in the draft, and I know binary domain is one of these perennial Back Page favorites, but I genuinely do really like it. I can sort of understand why it didn't set the world alight at the time, you know, it arrived after years of war and when there were just so many cover based shooters, I think there was quite a lot of fatigue about it. I don't know if people dismissed it in their heads, just that it was unlikely that the team behind Yakuza were going to make an amazing third person shooter, but I actually think they did achieve that mechanically.
I think it's a very satisfying shooter. Oh, I've said these words so many times on this podcast. If I describe shooting these robots as like shooting ceramics and their limbs pointing off, I think that's actually like illegal for me to say it that many times.
Like if you repeat the same boring observation, there should be like a Candyman style apparition.
I promise you that other games that have not been discussed will come up in this episode, I promise you.
If you say binary domain four times, Nogoshi climbs at your bedroom mirror and, I don't know, ignores you in an interview.
Reading a magazine upside down.
Yes. Comes out and it's just slightly sniffy towards you. It's quite scary.
My part in this dynamic is to go, Oh, that sounds great, Matthew. I'll have to play that one day. Anyway, my pick.
That's what happens every single time this comes up in a draft. So, yeah.
Obviously, I'm legally obliged to say there's a French robot in it. That's what I always say.
What's his name again? He always say what his name is and what his name is. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. And he's got like, you know, lardy guy.
He wears like a beret. I think he wears a scarf. I might be combining that with like the French costumes in Claire Obscure.
The two have blurred into one now. I don't know.
When I think of everything I know about France, basically comes from Claire Obscure and binary domain. So that's what I've got. And asterisks.
So that's what I've got. But yeah, 74. I do think it's Sun Raider.
I think it's famously described as one of those sevens. I think it's a solid 8 out of 10. It's probably like the third person shooter I would play on 360 after a Gears.
So yeah, I think that's quite boring, but quite safe.
So that makes perfect sense to me, Matthew.
Don't worry, it gets spicier.
Yep, so does mine. And so with my third pick, let's just like go up a little higher. Yeah, we're going to go 86, which is the highest score that Cyberpunk 2077 got when it released back in 2020.
Yeah, yeah. So as in really at the pick or really at the score?
No, really. I'm surprised it didn't break the 90s, because it's obviously in the 90s now with like Game of the Year editions. So this we're talking about core Cyberpunk.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Do not try and unpatch Cyberpunk.
Oh, no, no, I'm not trying to unpatch, but we're not talking about like, it's not bundled in with like Phantom Liberty or anything like that.
No, because I don't, I didn't want to do anything like that, because it just overcomplicates the draft.
Because I'd say that version is higher scored, because...
Yeah, yeah, it is because people have changed their mind on the game and they've sorted out all the... I mean, the reason it got 86 was not to do with the quality of the game, it was to do with how it ran, right, at launch, and the fact that, you know, obviously it got a lot lower on console, 57 and 61 on PS4 and Xbox One respectively, but, tough, and then it did do a bit better when it released on PS5 and Xbox Series X, but that came later, PC came first.
So on PC it only got us, that's a good find.
Yeah, it's pretty, I think it's pretty solid, so...
You were excited when you saw that when you were on Page fucking 150 Metacritic, you were like, oh yeah, hot damn.
Well, in some ways, I think it's clever, it's clever selecting to think about what game had a dicey launch, but then turned it around. This is a game that absolutely did. This has entered that echelon of games like that.
Those 10 or so games that people just play perpetually and are always talking about it. I think it's a good sign of the way in which that playing games, the relationship with games has changed as a result of digital libraries and these games are always being on sale and always being available. Someone is always discovering Cyberpunk for the first time.
And it's only gotten better obviously since it first came out. They've completely redone the way the skill trees work in the game. It was a bit more of a superficial shooter open world game, even when I played it first of all.
It's a bit closer to being a proper RPG now. I would still argue that it's still quite a light RPG in a lot of ways. But that's okay because I think the spectacle is amazing.
It's still the most next-gen looking thing I think most of us have really seen in the last five or so years. I think everyone still wants that experience from the games they play now. And it feels like it still keeps getting better in terms of how it looks, depending on what PC you're playing it with and what you're installing and what kind of effects you turn on.
And I just really enjoyed it. It has become one of those games. And all you're really missing out on is the DLC, Phantom Liberty.
Obviously, very good. But the base game, you know, was, yeah. But they invested the time to get it right.
And so 86 feels like a good value for the very high quality game that this is. And I feel like we've still got another decade of people talking about it and playing it very similar to The Witcher 3, Matthew. What were your thoughts on this?
I gave it a 7 at launch. But I genuinely I think I was rating it as an experience as well. Like, I think I had more problems with Cyberpunk than most.
I think it has found its feet quite well over a series of patches and updates.
It is still the same game though, isn't it? That's the thing.
It is, but they like completely reconfigured like the skill trees and things. Because originally you were buying skills, which there are literally not places to use them in the game. Like that's how fucking funky Cyberpunk was when they first made it.
Like there was a like a water takedown, but there were like no enemies close enough to water for you to ever use. And things like that where you're like, what? Why are you doing this?
You know, this is this is insane. I think that's good. I actually think that's probably what it is worth.
Like, I don't think it is a 90 game for me.
So I think I agree with you, actually. Yeah, I got I've played Phantom Liberty at some point still, though, which I know people are quite high on.
Yeah, that's got it's got. What's his name? Not Stringer Bell.
Idris Elba. He's he is amazing and he is way better in Phantom Liberty than Keanu Reeves is in any cyberpunk.
That's interesting. And yeah, I hear it's a bit more next gen looking as well. Yeah, Phantom Liberty.
So I think it's the bit that kills it on Switch 2. I think it's like fine when you're in the base game. But the second you go there, it's just Idris Elba is just too much for whatever the Switch 2 has got inside.
That's when it starts to look like Spider-Man 2 on PS2's Times Square, basically. It just really like, yeah, it just goes to pot. I will ask my third pick, Matthew.
So Mad Max, Rise, Son of Rome, Cyberpunk 2077. I haven't shat my pants yet. So what's your third pick?
I feel like I'm just like tiptoeing around you and just sort of following. But you know, I feel like you're setting the pace for this. So let's continue.
I'm going to go with a mid-80s game, which I was actually surprised to see that I thought this was going to be much higher. It's one of my favourite games of all time, Outer Wilds at 85.
Oh, interesting. That seems low.
That is low. Yeah, well, that's what I thought. Anything where I thought, oh, that's low.
That got noted down and an asterisk next to it as I'm probably going to pick that. I can maybe understand it in that if people don't like Outer Wilds, it tends to be they played it for half an hour and instantly bumped off the slightly weird physics of the jetpack or launching the ship and flying off, or they didn't even complete a proper loop of the game to see what the central trick was. You know, I know lots of people go, I simply won't play it because I find it uncontrollable.
This of course is a game set in a sort of small self-contained solar system where you are a space explorer who has 22 seconds to explore that world before the sun explodes and resets you back 22 minutes. As well as dealing with the time pressure of that loop, you also have to deal with the strange physics of the ship and flying through space and trying to land on things. It actually has lots of aids and autopilots built into it which will help you, but I don't know if a lot of people discover that.
So that's the only reason I can think people don't think this is like an all-time 10 out of 10. Like this was a mind-blowing experience for me. Likewise, the DLC, which isn't included in this pick, but is scored even lower, despite being maybe even cleverer in how it does its time loop and environment.
So yeah, it kind of made me a bit cross and sad to see this that low down there. Well, I think the people who know know, you know?
I don't think Outer Wilds is a forgotten game in any way, shape or form, so hopefully the judges will agree. I'm going to assume the judges listen to this episode.
I think some of them will, and some of them have got better things to do with their time.
And in like the ideal world, we'd have recorded this so far in advance that they could have judged on the lists before listening to the episode and even seeing who picked what.
Well, I will send it to them straight after we record, so they've got that option if they want to.
Yeah, but if they are listening, they're all amazing writers, very intelligent people. Sure, they're going to enjoy Outer Wilds.
We never say that about our listeners. Brutal. I think our listeners are very nice by the way.
I enjoy them a lot.
That is my third pick for 85.
Very good, Matthew. We are definitely sort of very usless so far, I would say. Actually, is that true?
Cyberpunk belongs to the people, really, not to me. Okay, time to pick a game that just came out, but has way too lower score for how good it is. And that's Rematch at 75.
Wow. I mean, 75? 75 for this?
I mean, I don't know what they were smoking, right? But I will say that this game, I did hear this game was a little bit buggier at launch than maybe it is now, or they've refined it a bit, but I just think that this is a majestic game, and it's definitely going to be in my top 10 for the year. I've played more than 30 hours of it.
It is, the skill ceiling seems pretty astronomical to me. I go from feeling like a complete failure to like the fucking Pele in the space of like two different matches. That's how much you can have a turnaround with this.
It has that arcadey pick up and play quality, but you can do so many amazing things. For a while there, I would just do this thing where I dribble right up to the goal and then flip the ball over my head while the keeper dived in to try and take it and then just like left it there to go into the net. No doubt making the other team incredibly angry.
Unfortunately, that tactic is being stamped out now because the player base is maturing and I'm a buffoon who doesn't know what he's doing. But nonetheless, I've had an amazing time with this slow-claps sports game which seems to have been a bit of a hit this year and 75 man, that seems like really low for how good this is. So there it is Matthew, bang up to date, but totally different to the other games I've picked.
I haven't played this yet but there's a chance I'll be playing some soon for some pod-related shenanigans.
Indeed?
Yeah, but I know from your enthusiasm and our other friends who are into this game that this is popular. I saw, was it Scrib Shed, the Randy Newman player name? Yeah, was it Nandi Ruman or something?
Yeah.
He was like, what are the chances? No, that wasn't me playing. This is a smart pick.
Again, as you went down the list, there were lots of games where I thought, oh, that's because it got reviewed in the opening week and that's actually gone on to be a bit of a staple. They weren't necessarily things I had huge affection for. I did wonder about Dead by Daylight, which has obviously become a huge thing.
But at the time, I think it's a six out of 10 on Metacritic. Those are the games whose scores are most likely to change. But this one, I thought everyone liked Out the Box, so I am surprised by that.
Yeah, it's surprising. I don't know if maybe it just wasn't exactly what some football fans are after. I don't care about these people.
This is my version of what good football is, so I like it. Okay. Yeah, I'll be curious to see if it ends up on a load of end of year lists, if it does have that level of popularity.
Definitely the people who I know have played it, they all pretty much adore it. We will see. What's your fourth pick, Matthew?
Well, I'm also going to pick a recent release that was grossly maligned. I'm going to take Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour for $54.
Yes, you're probably going to win it on that basis, which is incredibly annoying if so. Fucking Castle novels you pick. Amazing.
Yeah, I mean, I've spoken about this on this podcast. I do think that's underrated, maybe not by much. I think there's a case for that to be like healthily in the 60s, in which case I might not have picked it.
But I thought, is there any game that lets me go sub 60 here, while still maintaining a bit of honesty in that people know I did enjoy going around this virtual museum of Switch 2, being lectured on how injection molding works, and why games consoles need a fan, things like that. It was like Digital Foundries for Absolute Dunces, which is me. So that was good.
Digital Foundries is already for Absolute Dunces.
You can watch those videos and understand what I'm talking about. There's some stuff. It varies from writer to writer.
They've got a couple of absolute robo men who use the PC stuff I just don't understand.
The word rasterization is made up. I'm convinced that's when like, rasterization, when people say that, I'm like, that must mean when a white guy dresses like a Jamaican guy. To me, that's what rasterization means.
I'm just like, that just must be made up.
I still don't know what that means. That isn't explained in Switch 2 Welcome Tour. But yeah, it has lots of little mini games that let you use your console.
I think this was punished by reviewers for not being free because reviewers are big fucking babies. Of course, it was free for them. They were given the codes for free.
So I paid for it and thought it was well worth the price of my admission ticket. This is definitely better and more valuable than going to that fucking Nintendo museum over in Kyoto.
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's going to come down. If this comes down to, would you rather play Ry Son of Rome or Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour? I would say the episode was a success, you know?
I think that's like, we've done what we set out to do, you know?
I just need a bit of breathing room with scores, like a nice 54. I mean, would you be cross if I had an even lower score I could lean on?
Well, let me just be very clear and say I don't think that this is good, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. Maybe that's important to just point out. And I don't think that you make it part of your personality is like, is charming or cute.
I think it's like, and if you want, I can pick Dragon Drive, which is currently set at 62. If we want to just cancel out the two cursed Switch 2 picks, we can do that, Matthew. I wonder what the rasterization is like in that.
I have no idea what that word means. Okay. Yeah.
Curious to see how much you push it, so you can get away with picking something else. But if it does transpire, you're the world's biggest murdered soul suspect fan. It will not be a complete surprise, but yeah.
I mean, without saying what it is, I looked far down the list. I was like, is there anything here I could get away with, or would it just be seen as sacrificing a slot? I'm still humming and aahing about it.
The funniest one I thought, will Matthew try and pick this to get away with picking a bunch of amazing stuff, was Sponks Racing on WiiWare, which was at 18 on Metacritic. I think this whole episode could have just been me reading out game names to you from the bottom of Metacritic and you laughing. That might have been a better episode.
The further I went down the list, the more things I remembered from NGamer. That's what's depressing about that period, because you're like, there's a lot of WiiWares down in these 40s and 30s.
Yeah, that's funny. Well, I think there is just an element of personalisation to the list, so I guess we'll see how far you test the boundaries, Matthew. My next pick then, my fifth pick is going to be Deadly Premonition on Xbox 360, which actually scored 70 on PS3, which was a higher score at launch.
Technically, it launched just in the West on 360 and launched in Japan on PS3, but whatever. So I'll take it at 70 rather than fighting for it at 68. A very famously divisive game and a beloved game as well.
Still, I think the most beloved of Swery65's video games, although I am quite fond of D4, a game we discussed before in the podcast, even though it was unfinished. And this is basically a riff on Twin Peaks, a weirdo low-budget open-world game, murder mystery, tries to be Resident Evil 4 sometimes, doing it all with a little classic PS2 era game design mentality to it. And so I think that makes it very winning.
I think also that despite the oddness of it, the bits of audio that come in and out because they haven't been mixed properly or the odd bit of dialogue where you're like, what is that all about? There's so much of it that is genuinely charming and well done. And I think some of the voice acting is actually really good in this.
I think that maybe when the second game came around, which everyone hated, they developed a bit more of appreciation for this game being a little bit of lightning in a bottle. I mean, certainly in this era of 360 games where I feel like not loads of oddball Japanese stuff was breaking through in the way that it did in the PS2 era and earlier, where that stuff was being shunned a bit more. People did really go to bat for this despite having the worst box art of all time, and despite it being relentlessly strange.
I think Hated famously by IGN and by other reviewers gave it very high scores and it landed somewhere in the middle. I personally think that Deadly Premonition probably is a 7 out of 10 and this score is not entirely unfair, but I do think it's a good value pick because of how beloved it is. Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, it's a good games journal pick as well. You know, without knowing the specific judges.
You know the judges, I sent you who it was in the...
Oh no, to the listeners.
Oh right, yeah.
Yeah, you know, it's definitely got a lot of champions. It feels like one that I should have made like a cornerstone in my personality, but the actual sort of shooty actiony bits are like rank enough to kind of put me off a little bit. But yeah, the weirdness of it is very, very timeless.
There's a reason this is constantly being clipped. And even though you may see all the little meemy bits out of context, it does actually all kind of care into sort of something bigger than those bits. It's not just a collection of completely disparate little gags and NAF moments.
Yeah, I think the resolution to the mystery is quite well regarded. And people do like some of the emotional development of the story later on, alongside the oddball stuff.
I wish Sphere would make something as good or cherished as this again. Like it's been a little bit middling since then.
Yeah, I think this game was in development hell for a long time. And then it just sort of came out. And then, yeah, I remember when I first saw the footage of it that IGN uploaded of just driving around the town, I thought that looks absolutely horrible.
Why would I play that? Like, why would I play that in a year that where Red Dead Redemption came out? What would I have to gain?
But then, yeah, you give it the time and you realize it definitely has some depth to it.
So you banked it, should you one day have to pick 10 games with a score of 750 points from Metacritic?
It's worth it. I never finished it. I got about halfway through it.
And I thought I went back to the pandemic, but the pandemic was already driving me a bit or loopy enough, and I just thought I can't. I'm already being mentally shredded up by lockdown.
So I played Bayonetta 2 in my COVID fug. It's just some combos are particularly deadly.
Yeah, exactly. That's why when you talk about Bayonetta 2 now, you're like, remember that bit where you fight Reggie from Nintendo? It's just a big Reggie head in space.
And it's like, no, that didn't happen, Matthew. You were just hallucinating. What's your fifth pick, Matthew?
My next pick is a bit of a niche one, underscored, probably for similar reasons, to Ghost Squad or just being misunderstood. I'm going to take Space Giraffe for 68.
Interesting.
A game I was never particularly good at. This is Llamasoft, Jeff Minter's lot, which I'm pretty sure is just him, maybe one other person. Very sort of psychedelic, neon arcade game based on older arcade game Tempest, I want to say.
I'm always on unsteady ground with these things, but if you've never played it, you're a little sort of spaceship thing attached to. You can sort of run along various rails, shapes in the foreground. You're shooting enemy shapes coming towards you down a grid, but by shooting them you also drive away this sort of power zone element, which means that as long as you're in the power zone, when the enemies do reach your end of the grid, you can zip along and kill them by touch, which gives you a multiplier.
Trying to explain weird high score mechanics verbally is kind of death. It's much easier to explain. If you watch a bit of footage of this, you'll be like, oh, I sort of see what you're getting at.
You're shooting at these things, but you're also risking having the things near you so you can get a multiplayer out of them. While an obscene sort of crazy soundscape plays out of like animal noises, blips and bloops, dance music, it's all set on like a music visualizer so it's super hectic to look at. One of those games that I think like the British gaming press really liked and championed, and everyone else was like, what the fuck is this confusing mess?
Very early ex-BLA favourite, 68 purely because it was misunderstood. It is good. It is niche though.
Maybe they won't cut through with our judges.
Well I think it's an interesting choice. This and Outer Wilds takes us into slightly different territory than have come up in the drafts, which is good podcasting, you know.
That's part of it also. I didn't want to just wheel out endless classics. I should say at five entries in, I calculate that as 400 points remaining.
Okay. I mean, I've not done that particular mass, but I've got a running total of mine anyway. So it's still the intended goal games add up to 750 exactly, Matthew.
Okay.
We'll see where it lands or if I have to make compromises. Hopefully not. I guess this is available in that collection that Thingamajig did, the folks who have done digital clips.
Oh, I genuinely don't know. You would think so.
That seems like something that's probably worth owning, doesn't it? I feel like people were like, again, I think Jeff Minter is just a bit of a British, more of a British concern. I say that, but I think digital clips are an American company, so they obviously have a lot of passion for it.
But I think that got really highly rated and maybe compiles a load of his games in one place. I think that's what that does. You and I also bought Atari 50 at one point with the intention of talking about that in an episode.
We never did that.
Maybe there's an Excel in that.
Yeah, I do wonder if like...
Two giant men play some old ass games.
Yeah, we spent a minute each on each game in Atari 50 and then talk about it.
Come round, we'll do it like the Dreamcast episode.
That would be fun, I think. Let's do that. And then we play Pong and we're like, what are we doing with our lives?
And then we... And I'm sure it'll be better than that. Okay.
All right, Matthew, good stuff. Then it's my sixth pick. I'm going to take a Samuel Roberts classic, Lollipop Chainsaw, for 70.
Interesting. A game developed by Suda51 and Grasshopper, written by James Gunn, director of Superman, Guardians of the Galaxy, and blending the sensibilities of both, so you don't really know where one ends and the other begins. A version of the game that has not been restored in any way, shape or form, and I believe the rights to this are owned by someone else and they put out a remaster that was coolly received, didn't have any of the original music in it.
The music really made it, I think, so that's a bit of an unfortunate turn of events because I think this is a real classic, but it is trapped on 360 and PS3, it never came to PC, so there's no one modding it or whatever, the original version. And it is basically an action game that riffs on schlocky horror, trauma horror and George Romero horror, and wears all those influences on its sleeve, well, being a tribute to schlocky horror while also being this very competently made and colorful looking and fun third person action game. Of course, the plot of the game is that you play a cheerleader whose boyfriend has been beheaded and is now being carried around and emasculated by his cheerleader girlfriend.
The head is played by Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville, our guy Matthew, just big fan of that guy. It's just really, really funny, the writing. It is a very James Gunn game.
I would say that you start to, I would say definitely the music choices which include like, you spin me around like a record, Dead or Alive or Cherry Bomb, Joan Jett and the Black Heart Stickers literally in Guardians of the Galaxy. The way the first Five Finger Death Punch or one other, Mickey by Tony Basil there. Hey Mickey, you're so fun.
You're so, that one. That plays when you activate your special abilities in the game. It is not the most in-depth third-person action game ever.
It's certainly not Bayonetta quality, but it's so breezy and fun. It's probably a little bit canceled now to be honest, because it is a slightly horny game as well as subverting horny games, having this cake and eating it a bit. But a 70, I think it's a steal.
I really think it's one of the most distinctive, fun games of the 360 era with a proper cult following. Hence why they tried to bring it back. Thoughts, Matthew?
Meaning to pick up the or play the redo of this, though, does that lose some of the music, did you say? I can't remember.
Yeah, all of the licensed music is gone.
Oh, right. So it's basically no point. Megabust.
Well, that kills that conversation, haven't you?
Would you like to know who is in the cast of the game, Matthew?
Oh, yeah.
It's a very James Gunn cast as well. Again, I think he was pretty involved with this. It's like a minute before he becomes the Marvel superhero guy.
So you've got Greg Henry in there, who's in Guardians of the Galaxy, but like Sean Gunn, Michael Rooker, Linda Cardellini is in here, and there's more people you wouldn't have heard of. Tara Strong plays the main character, but yes, there's probably more here that you haven't heard of.
That lot must be dreading the day James Gunn dies. Like, what the fuck am I going to do?
There are some people you do only see in James Gunn things. This is quite weird for Rosenbaum, who I think is meant to be quite a funny guy. I've not listened to his podcast where people talk about all their deepest, darkest secrets and they get cut into Instagram clips, but here he really brings it.
Yeah, I did play this with my partner a few years ago and I think she was appalled by the haughtiness of it, but also did enjoy the audiovisual touches of the game. It's mega distinctive as a result of that collaboration, so in it goes. Good value at 70.
What's your sixth pick, Matthew?
Oh, I'm at Crossroads. There's like an honest struggle approach to this, and then there's something really shitty.
Is it Star Fox Zero?
No, even shittier.
Oh, okay. Intriguing.
But it kind of breaks it. I worry it breaks the game a little bit.
I couldn't drag myself to the level to pick Star Fox Zero. I know it's fundamentally like not good in a way that-
Oh, no. Yeah, but that's the thing. I'm literally talking about like sacrificing a slot to get some points.
But I feel like it's not in the spirit of the thing, even though it is in the rules of the thing.
You can do whatever you want. And like, honestly, it'll be an interesting test of what our judges value if they say it's okay to have one shit game because you got these mega games. So I can see you slowly picking lower games here with the intention of doing some like big damage at the end, so yeah.
Yeah.
Do what you got to do, Matthew.
Oh, God. How low do you go? So I played something awful.
I bought and played a truly terrible game, but I just am genuinely agonizing over this. I don't want you to take it personally.
Why would I take it personally?
Because it's kind of shitty because I think you're playing this in a more honest way. I think you're genuinely trying to get 10 good games on the board.
Yeah, I don't want anything that I can't be ashamed of. And even Anthem was a borderline.
This is worse than that.
Worse than Anthem?
Yeah.
Well, I mean, Anthem's got OK robot combat, but nothing else is going for it, really. And it's been shut down in January, which is not ideal.
Yeah.
Oh, god.
Go on. What do I do?
You going to do it?
Let's test it and see what happens.
OK.
I'm going to take the quiet man with a score of 40.
Oh, fuck off.
That stinky Square Enix thing that had the worst trailer of all time.
I literally played this to see if I could possibly do it.
Well, that's what the money is for, Don Draper Voice, for you to spend on fucking the quiet man. OK. Well, that's definitely worse than Rise, Son of Rome.
So I feel OK about that.
Oh, listen, I'm not going to pretend it's a good game. I think I could really scrabble on saying… So for people who don't know what The Quiet Man is, it's like an interactive movie, it's got like FMV sequences that they filmed with real life actors, and it occasionally slips into being…
Now imagine the worst version of Yakuza combat possible. It's that. But the whole thing is compromised by the fact that it has this, you know, real life actors, so it's trying to kind of recreate them, and it's trying to sort of like avoid their being too violent a seam between the digital world and what is like, you know, 4K camera footage.
And so it has these bits where they've had to like match the actors, you know, base the the NPCs have to be based on the specific actors who are in the scene and things like that. And like, they're one way around it is that they've just cast the most sort of generic, smooth looking man as the lead to obviously like lower, like the rendering load on him. So they're like, well, we can, we can make this guy happen because there just isn't a lot to him.
That's like really weird. I'm not going to say it's good. It's kind of interesting to see the transition, but you can watch it on YouTube.
The reason it's got Ding so violently, and probably rightfully so, is that the lead character is deaf, and to represent that, basically you hear the game from his perspective. So it's got like no soundtrack or dialogue or sound effects. Nothing kind of clever is done with that.
You're just watching cutscenes that you can't understand, that he can't understand. I think once you complete it, it maybe does a mode where you can play with all the dialogue added, so you can actually find out what the story is. But somewhere, someone thought this was a really smart, interesting way of tackling with the hearing impaired experience.
But it's actually a complete dud. But I went down into the sub-fifties thinking, is there anything here which is at least a bit novel? Because most of it is truly worthless down there.
This isn't a good game. If the judges are fair minded, they will probably disqualify me for including it. But I was feeling nervous about doing the points.
I just needed a bit of breathing room.
Yeah. I can tell that you're going to try and ram your last three entries with like 90 plus bangers at the expense of consistency. But it's good in a way because I think it will test, what do the judges respond to?
Do they think that's an okay tactic? And it definitely makes this different from the drafts where no one would ever pick the quiet man. And that's part of it.
Matthew, my fear is that when you went into the sub 50s of Metacritic, you never came back. Like the real you is still down there somewhere. And we've lost you forever.
So the one that you're dealing with now is like Dougie Jones from Twin Peaks, The Return.
Yeah. Or the Avril Lavigne they swapped out. So that's another similarly hilarious internet theory.
For the rest of my response to this, I'm going to read out some of the...
Yeah, you absolutely do your worst.
Okay. You're a gamer. The worst of pretentious story games and brainless beat-em-ups combined with an insulting gimmick that's all its own.
The Jimquisition. Nonsensical, ugly, broken and often hilariously incompetent. The quiet man is confusing gibberish from beginning to end.
Speaking of the end, who, boy? By the way, this game is about three hours long. PlayStation Official Magazine UK.
The Quiet Man is a once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-generation terrible game mired by technical and racial issues, pretentious ideas and poor execution. It's an ineffable game that fails to land any of its posy punches. That it merely exists.
Now, that is something to cry over. Just a couple more. CD Action in Poland.
They said, it's the worst game of 2018. Don't play it. Just watch it on YouTube.
I didn't listen and I should have. Last one here, I think. Well, we got inexplicable design from Gamespot, but I will end on this one.
This is from PlaySense who gave it 15, 1.5 out of 10. A deaf protagonist, a quiet man, a thundering silence as he sneak by this game unnoticed, leaving its abysmal contents to the vultures.
Yeah.
And that's what Matthew picked after Lollipop Chainsaw. But it may get past the judges. We'll find out if he fucking rams it with Half-Life games at the end here.
Imagine that.
Do you think that this doesn't, in some ways, this like besmirch where you inevitably pick Mario Galaxy or whatever, that you've linked the quiet man to Mario Galaxy? Like, it's the price you've paid, just too much in plain sight for you to live with yourself.
Yeah, I'm trying to think of what TV show or film character it best resembles in terms of like, they win, but like really they know deep down they absolutely bollocksed it.
Yeah, that's funny. Yeah.
I mean, it's a tale as old as time. And it's nice that we got to see it play out in the inaugural Metacritic game.
Yeah, I mean, this is definitely different to The Drass, which is what I wanted, so that's good. At what cost though? I keep asking myself.
Okay, my seventh pick. Back into the land of seven out of tens as I take Barnet Commando from Capcom, the 2009 game, which I am very fond of. I played through this game twice at the time.
It is a third-person game where you swing around environments shooting enemies, but the swinging mechanic is very, very intricate. You have this robot arm, and it's based on an old Capcom arcade game that was brought back up to date. It is certainly not as visually stylish as the games made in Japan by Capcom.
I believe this is made in the US. It's visually does look amazing in places. It's set in a post-apocalyptic landscape.
It's got amazing ruined cities and places like that, but the characters and the enemies look a bit generic, but look a little bit 360-era. But I do think that the way that the arm is used for navigation and combat is fantastic. This has become one of those perennially underrated.
Every now and then, someone will say, oh, this is two quid in a Steam sale, you should buy this, or Chris Donlon will write about how good this is or whatever. I think that it really is a bit of a forgotten. One of those 7 out of 10s from the 360 era.
And cricks were harsh on it, but I don't know if the gulf between something like this and Resident Evil 5 was that vast, really. It's just that Resident Evil 5 had more of what people wanted at the time and looked way nicer. So I think this is good material for a draft like this, again, buys me a few points for a later pick.
Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, that's a very decent way of balancing the price quality within the desired rules of the game. Yeah, it's funny, I was just writing about Bionic Commando, the NES game the other day about how you blow up Hitler's head at the end of it, which I assume doesn't happen in this one.
No, you fight some generic army man, I think, in a mech.
What score was it?
71.
The narrative of 360 around Capcom is just like it's all a bust where actually I think there is a lot of fondness for this Dead Rising. Is there a bit of Lost Planet love somewhere in a dark corner of the internet?
I thought Lost Planet 2 is the one that was a bit Monster Hunter-ish and I quite like that one. I don't think you can play it, might be playing it now.
I think it is easy to just go, oh they made nothing of note in that but that isn't true. It's a good pick. I feel really lousy about The Quiet Man.
Well I mean I'm just more, it's that thing again where I'm like, oh it's a bad pick to me but it's good podcasting and so it's a net gain for the culture. That's how I see it.
Yeah, this is going to be shitty when I use it to crowbar a load of bangers in.
Go on then, what's next Matthew?
Let's have Bellatro for 90.
Oh yeah.
There is some logic here. I was looking at, I think this is where some of that, which games could I play a lot of factored into my thinking, even though this is like a completely theoretical exercise and I'm not just going to be playing these 10 games, these 9 games and The Quiet Man for the rest of my life. But I was, yeah, I began thinking about them in terms of like bang for your buck.
This is, you know, of all the sort of rogue-like phenomenons of the last few years, the one which has clicked with me that I have played the most of, still no way near as much as the people who are like truly lost to it. Like I'm still very much a casual dabbler as evidence by the fact that I play it on PS5, which I know is cursed. I don't even play a portable version of this game.
But yeah, the core idea of building out poker hands, developing these mad multipliers and modifiers by buying the jokers in between sounds a little bit baffling to have it described to you as I felt when you first told me about it on the podcast. I was like, I can't quite picture it, but you play like a couple of hands of it and then you're just in forever. I just like the vibes of it.
I like the whole Jimbo, the clown thing. I like all the weird little crossovers that they've done. I like that the developer is clearly over the moon to be, I say in the spotlight, he's an anonymous person.
We don't even know what he looks like, but he plays nice with other games and seems to be taking it all in a good spirit. I thought for one of the defining games of the moment, I'm not going to say it's underscored at 90, but I thought 90 was pretty fair.
Yeah, I mean, I love this game. It was second in my best games of last year, so definitely fond of it. Yeah, I mean, here it is.
You got quite a few indie kind of games in here.
And the Quiet Man, of course. Yeah, that is true.
Yeah, which is an interesting tack because I've definitely got a bit more down the classic Back Page games route in contrast to that. I guess there are pros and cons to each approach, Matthew, and we'll see what the judges make of it. But, you know, does Bellatro cancel out the Quiet Man?
I don't know. That's a bit like saying, ignore my war crimes over there. Look at this thing over here.
You know, it's great politicking, but I'm just not sure it's, you know, morally right. You know, so. Oh, I mean, yeah.
I think this definitely shake things up though. I didn't see that come in. I think my body temperature has got up five degrees since he said The Quiet Man, so.
Shit's got serious. All right. My next pick then.
Let's just take Red Dead Redemption 2 at 97.
Better than The Quiet Man, Samuel Roberts. So, yes, I did want something mega scoring. I thought I'm really chuffed with the runs of like cool sevens and interesting bits and pieces I've got in this so far.
But definitely my strategy was anchored by get two big awesome things that make the list look really good. One thing that's like not amazing but not terrible, which is Rise, and then loads of stuff in between, which I know is I can live with myself for picking basically.
So far, it's working out okay. Red Dead Redemption 2, arguably the best open world game ever made. Just incredible levels of simulation.
A story that people really like, a world that still blows people away with the amount of detail in it. Set up arguably too high a bar for the rest of the industry to follow. Just still looks incredible if you play on PC today, 60 FPS whacked up.
Again, games are a bit frozen now, but now aren't they? People are always buying this, always playing this, always talking about this. Definitely sets it apart from the original Red Dead in that respect.
People have not moved on from this game. It is just perpetual, I think. And so, I believe that will even remain the case after GTA 6 comes out, because they're just so different.
It's a game where it takes an hour to do anything, really. You do a mission, going from one side of the map to the other, there'll be something that draws your eye. It's just, it requires a level of dedication and time commitment.
I don't even think that any previous Rockstar game really needed. This pushes things forward. The level of simulation elevates everything.
So even if the mission design seems like old school Rockstar mission design, the way in which the world is rendered and the game behaves is just a level above what you've experienced previously. So I think this is a great pick for similar reasons to Cyberpunk. It's sticky, Matthew, and in undisputably a great game.
Thoughts?
Playing GTA San Andreas at the moment, you constantly think of like, here are the bones of the mission structure in a world of like a similar size and the beginning of some of those RPG systems. But I think the way Red Dead Redemption 2 weaves them all together, you know, even compared to GTA 4 or 5, is it does so much more complete. Like it's properly immersive.
It's probably the Rockstar game that I've played the most of, like in between the missions. Like it's the one way I think the game, the wider game, the kind of emergent game is just as good as the core story, which is, I'd say rarely true for Rockstar, for me personally. Yes, it's just, yes, absolutely magic.
It looks absolutely amazing as well. It makes me really excited for GTA 6. Like if they can bring that same level of detail and just sort of totality to it.
Yes, it's just such an all-encompassing game. I've not finished it, but I will one day, and then we can talk about it some more in the podcast, Matthew. That'd be good exercise, I'm sure.
So there you go. Wow. Well, I mean, I'm getting whiplash from the amount of ups and downs we've had in this episode so far.
But it's now your eighth pick, Matthew.
Quiet Man really has broken this for me.
In a good way or a bad way?
Well, in a good way for me getting stuff I want, but in a bad way for, it's quite shapeless. I have a big enough pool of points to play with.
Yeah, so you can just grab whatever you want now.
Yeah, and it's like no one's going to root for that fucking guy. You know? No one's going to be like, yeah, look at that guy, he got everything he wanted.
That famous story shape that everyone loves. Just a guy who easily got what he wanted, as is at the heart of all great storytelling.
I have a good question for you off the back of this actually, which is, do we tell the judges in the email what points each scored? Do we include that information or do we remove that information?
Oh, no, I think we should put the scores on there.
Yeah, okay, yeah. So I could say, if you're going to leave the quiet man for people to discover, so like they're just scanning down the list and they just sort of double take again.
What? They're like, oh, that sounds cool. Quiet man, quiet man, hmm, enigmatic.
I like the sound of that, tick.
Okay, so what bangers will you be taking Matthew to balance out that war crime?
It's more like what degree of banger. As a mega scoring game, but even, but I would say a tiny bit underscored at that. I'm going to take The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt at 92.
It's The Witcher 3. It's, everyone knows what the deal is in this game. It is one of my favorite open world games of all time.
I do think it is a little underrated at 92, like I say. I think, you know, it's the combination of a beautiful open world with lots of different sort of continents and styles to it. So that constantly sort of trading up as you play along.
But I love the through line of playing as Geralt and having a more fixed character. That speaks to me more than the RPGs where you just build a blank slate out and go on adventure. I like stepping into his shoes with his particular reputation, his social network, his prior relationships that he has to uphold or betray as he goes through the game, making different decisions and role playing as him.
That speaks to me. Maybe a song with like, you know, a lack of some imagination. That's just yeah, that's really, really why this works for me.
Also, you know, it obviously has the Gwent side game in it, which I played more than most games on my list in itself within that game. You know, It's a Witcher 3, quite hard to argue with. You know, hopefully Witcher 4 will be just as good as this.
Yep. I think there's definitely some sensible thinking there. I think when it comes to the mega scoring games, they're a little bit obvious in some ways, but I think it's how you grab them at what number of points they are is the crucial thing.
What was the Witcher 3's, Matthew?
Oh, 92.
Okay, 92. That is quite low. What did it score 92 on?
Oh, God. Let me check. Oh, no.
That's okay. I mean, I can always just fly up in the background.
Witcher 3 Metacritic.
Well, according to this, on PC it's 93, so you have to take it at 93.
Okay, yeah, that's absolutely fine. That's just me misreading the thing. Yeah, that's good.
Okay. I promise I'm not trying to put any shenanigans here. We have to check.
Because the way Metacritic works is it gives you a score and then you have to click on the score and then click other scores to make sure there wasn't another score higher than it. Metacritic, I think it picks the review with the most reviews.
Yeah.
It's a bit vault, but that's okay. 93, I can live with it. That's still...
We're doing better at 92. I did a close read of all the 90 games and for each one I was like, is that really worth it? Is that really like five points better than X or whatever?
The one that got me was The Last of Us Part 2 being like three points lower than The Last of Us Part 1.
That's wild. That's an 8 out of 10 versus a 10 out of 10, in my opinion.
Yeah, but not that I've picked that yet.
Yeah, we'll see what other Rich's The Quiet Man buys you Twilight Zone episode style as you've driven completely mad by the consequences of your choice. Okay, I've got a choice here between a Back Page favorite or something I've not picked before, but I think might be more fun and give the list a bit more color. And so, sorry, Godhand, move over, Godhand.
It's 50 Cent Blood on the Sand at 72. A perfectly fine third-person shooter of the time, starring rapper 50 Cent turned media mogul of the Power franchise, which I think is like his main thing these days. I think he's pals with Trump, which is unfortunate.
But a really like interesting little 360 era, you already said the word curio, but I think it does apply here. Yeah, I think. Competently made third-person shooter, like I say, Unreal Engine, super shiny.
Yes, he's looking for his fucking skull. No, I have not finished it, but I played two hours at the time and was like, wow, they really committed to the nonsense of this. It is like become one of those sort of like the CEX version of a legendary Pokemon where it's like there are rumors of it out in the wild, but it's incredibly hard to track down and catch.
I bought this for a good price on Vinted and the guy was like, I don't have it actually, you can have your money back and I was gutted. But also it was a good lesson in like, I don't know, games court purchases before they happen. Because I think I ended up saving something like 36 quid and I was like, that was probably a good call in retrospect.
But at 72 I think it's good value. It is really different to anything else on my list. And there is nothing else like this game.
A game where the premise is novel, but the execution is actually pretty high level for what it is. Thoughts Matthew?
I don't know if I've actually played this, to be honest. I've definitely got a copy to hand somewhere for some reason. Definitely a key aim of the Metacritic game was for us to go into territories previously uncharted.
You, Blood on the Sand, slightly more respected than the Quiet Man.
As far as we know, the Quiet Man is not pals with Donald Trump. So the shame isn't quite the same, but you know.
Yeah. I'd say it continues your run of there's nothing outright bad in your list, which is probably really what we should have tried to do in this episode.
Well, you know, it's again up to the judges really. But I just certainly think as well that when you're going through my sevens, maybe it starts to become a bit too much of the Japanese seven out of tens. And it's good to have something that's a little bit different.
So that was definitely the thinking here. And just one pick left after this, Matthew. So what's your ninth pick?
So there's lots of series that I would normally try and get in, but I can't I don't necessarily want to spend the points I have. Normally, I'd like to have like a Xenoblade in there. I'd like to have like the JRPG series that I like.
But that pushes me towards like Xenoblade Chronicles 2, which is 83, so notably lower than the other Xenoblade games. For 84, I'm going to take Uncharted The Lost Legacy.
Oh, right. Oh, okay. Interesting.
Yeah. So this was like I said, I had a group of games of I would I quite like this series. What's the lowest scoring one, which I think is still good and still has the sort of spirit of the thing.
When I compared Lost Legacy to Uncharted 2 or Uncharted 4, like those are better games, but are they 12 points better than this in the context of the Metacritic game? That's kind of my thinking on it. Maybe that's wonky maths and maybe people will be like, well, Uncharted 4 is that much better than the Lost Legacy.
But I want something quite flashy and fun that has that naughty dog narrative energy like I'm more of an Uncharted person than I am The Last of Us. Like I like the tone of voice of that world. I think the banter between these two particular characters is a little bit more fun and lighter on its feet than some of the stuff in Uncharted 4, which is maybe like trying to kind of put them through the wringer a bit too much.
But it still has all the incredible technological developments of Uncharted 4 and it looks spectacular, has those open world levels. We get to sort of drive around and do a few objectives in an order of your choosing. It is a little bit shorter, but I don't think you get to the end of it and think, oh, I've been hard done by.
I feel like you've had a Uncharted's worth of fills crushed in. So yeah, as a means of getting Uncharted at a slightly cut price, Uncharted The Lost Legacy.
Yeah, I think that makes sense. Yeah, it's sort of like, it would never be my go to Uncharted is the thing.
No, no.
It would be two, I'd still do one, two, three, four, this. And then the PSV2 one would go under that. Yeah.
Oh, no way. That's bonkers. I know I can't be incredulous when I've picked The Quiet Man.
I know I've given up the right to that, but come on.
I'm not saying it's a better game. I'm saying that if I wanted a go to, then I think I would take that instead personally. But just because, you know, I'd rather...
I think of this like a side story. Like it is like a lab rat DLC to me, you know? I'm not saying it's a bad pick on that basis, but it sort of doesn't quite get the juices flowing if you had pick Uncharted 4, you know?
I think that would have been a quite big deal. But yeah. Sorry.
I didn't think that would be the one that would make sense.
Listen, you got to do everything you can like this. I was expecting grief for the Quiet Man. I thought you would be like well played with this, but yeah, obviously not.
Well, it's pretty good. Do you know what I, in this bracket, I thought was good value and I almost picked, almost exactly the same score was Marvel's Midnight Suns. It was like 83.
Oh, shit, I missed that.
That's pretty good for 83, that. And I almost picked it, but I went with Cyberpunk instead just for a few points more. Yeah.
But yeah, people do really like this one. It's definitely a sign of a spin-off being successful when you've got contrarian saying, well, this is the best one actually. And you know it's not true, but the people who are saying it are mega passionate about the characters.
For the record, I'm not saying it's the best. I think I've been quite clear in acknowledging that it isn't the best one, but I think it is maybe the best value in this competition.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. At that score.
And I obviously am someone who rates value.
I can't wait to find out what 99 rated game you end with anyway, Matthew.
So I've got 93 points left.
Okay, all right. I've got 80 points left. So here comes the last pick then.
Weighed up a lot here. Thought about Until Dawn on PS4, which is 79. Thought about Metro 2033, which is, I think, 80 on PC or 80...
Yeah, I think it was 80 on PC. Really like that game. But I think it has to be the star of the sub-80 Metacritic draft, which is Prey.
I mean, it's a terrific game. It was, you know, undervalued at the time. I think you picked it in a draft very recently, Matthew.
This came up, and I think people talked it up as like a great addition, and, you know, it was. It's a sci-fi game where there's lots of goopy monsters taking over bits of objects around this space station, and you're trying to unpick what happened to all of the different crew in that space station. All the stuff we talked about in that draft episode, basically the sort of contiguous nature of the world, the fact that you can go back to places, and it feels like a real place, and it has that kind of art deco on a spaceship visual style to it that's so distinctive, and the bones of an immersive sim game without being quite as immersive sim as something like Deus Ex or Dishonored, and yeah, very much undervalued in its time, and I think now praised as the sort of like modern classic that it is.
I think that's fair to say. Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, it absolutely was the star of that draft. It's the biggest like what the fuck. I'd say it's probably the one where you're like, you know, if that game had 90 on Metacritic, I probably wouldn't bat an eye out of that.
Yeah, so it's a great way of getting a really, a really good game in the mix. Yeah, it's bonkers to me. Like Alien Isolation, I can understand a little more, the way it got dinged, just because it's more of an acquired taste, and it's so difficult.
But yeah, this one is one of the great underrated games. I'm looking at your list here, and it's so coherent. And as a collection of games, like mine actually, it's a fucking mess.
Oh, I think I might have cheated here though, Matthew, because I just dug into it a bit deeper, and I was trying to work out why this would not get through this got through that draft, but does it fulfill the point criteria for this? Because I looked on Metacritic, and I've just clicked on it, as we mentioned previously, and it's got 82 on PC and 84 on Xbox One. So it technically is not eligible because it goes above my point total.
And so I looked at the rules of the Metacritic draft, and on at least one of its initial release formats, the game had to have scored 80 or below. So we didn't have our highest platform score thing that we have here, so it's not eligible. I can't pick it.
However, I can pick Mirror's Edge, which I love basically as much. So in that goes instead, another first person game from the time. And I still feel like it makes my list mega coherent.
Now let's act like none of that happened, but keep it in the episode because it's funny that that happened, obviously. Mirror's Edge, 79 on both PS3 and 360, very undervalued for its time. Developed by DICE.
I'd rather be honest about this than like bullshit my way through, obviously. So, you know, I'm self-governing over here, Matthew. You have basically a game about parkour in first person.
Amazingly vivid sort of sci-fi dystopia, very, very clean world that they brought to life. You know, we always describe it as the interesting kind of EA combo, I think. The interesting EA era of this and Dead Space.
Didn't last very long, that era, of course, but this was probably the most interesting exponent of it. I think probably helps to move forward the physicality of first person games. I think DICE were thinking about that a lot with this, and then I think that that carries over a bit to sort of how, how, you know, battlefield feels in later games, like how the sort of feeling that you are controlling a person and a bit less, kind of like just a step further in terms of simulation than the kind of point-and-shoot thing, like it's just such a, it really does feel like you're playing quite a fragile person here who is really good at like hand-to-hand combat, but as soon as there's a gun in front of you, you're like, I've got to just run basically, the whole game is about that.
Has some amazing levels, great level where you're running around bits of a sewer that's moving around, even manages to make like warehouse and shit look very, very beautiful with the stark color palette. And yes, this one actually scored 79, so that is my final entry. Thoughts on this one, Matthew?
This is another Sam Roberts classic. Yeah, I've always enjoyed hearing you praise this one on the podcast.
Amazing music to this game.
Yeah, yeah. I don't have quite the same relationship with it. I think just forever associate it with doing quite a rushed preview for Games Master and getting quite stressed that I wasn't very good at it and trying to rush through and panicking and dying loads.
Will always kind of stay with me as my sort of baptism of the fire for Mirror's Edge. I would have loved for you to have pray because it is a secret 90, but Mirror's Edge I guess isn't that far off and it sits amongst all these other games. Yes, a nice mix.
I feel like yours isn't going to give anyone shock as they go from game to game. Well, mine is like a much bumpy ride. It's like, I hope you like six out of tens and nines.
I love this for us though, you know, I mean, in some ways I feel bad for like, because you and I have basically, I think Off Air made it a pact to like try and pick things that are a bit less obvious in some of these competitions and drafts that we've been doing. And by picking Mirror's Edge, I have very much like, you know, sort of deferred to type. And there's a bit of that with Lollipop Chainsaw and Mad Max as well.
But I did try and mix it up with some of my other stuff, like 50 Cent and Deadly Premonition, we've not talked about that much before, I don't think. And, you know, a man talking about rice in 2025, that can't be that common, you know, so hey ho. So what's your final pick, Matthew, with your 93 points?
Did you end with one point left? Yes, you did.
There were no 80s that were better than either of those games, I found.
I'm just going to mix it up a little bit in terms of genres, because I've got a few things which are a little too similar, like 93 could get me Resident Evil 4 Remake, but I don't want to step on the toes of binary domain. The thing is, if you play Resident Evil 4 Remake, and then you play binary domain, you'd be like, why binary domain?
No French people in Resident Evil 4?
No. So I'm going to pick for 92, Forza Horizon 4.
All right, interesting.
Yeah. A Castle Heart pick, racing games, unless we have a genre, very rarely get picked in these things and these lists. But this is a rare one I actually do love, mainly because I made a video about it for Rock Paper Shotgun, which was my first successful video.
I've probably said that before. But that you do have emotional ties to games when you've done good work with them, I feel, that you remember a review you were happy with or whatever. What I really like about Forza Horizon 4 is open world racing game in this weird crushed Britain where you're somehow driving ten minutes up the roads from the Courtsworlds and then you're driving around Edinburgh and there's some sort of muddy Welsh valleys going on just off to the side.
It makes no sense and you aren't really meant to think about it. But I think it does capture the sensation of those different environments. There are places where you're like, oh yeah, I am in Edinburgh here.
Or I am on a beach in Norfolk and the skies are grey and everyone's having a terrible time. And that's all great. Big tics for that.
I really like how celebratory it is. Whatever form of racing you're interested in, it has like a mini championship for that. And the more you do of something, the more you're served that something.
Which is probably why it is the racing game that speaks to me because I have quite specific tastes. I prefer the goofier, arcadia stuff in this. So like the cross country races where you're bombing across these massive hills in jeeps while it plays Ride of the Valkyries or whatever on the classical FM radio station.
And then I do that and then it asks me if I want to do another one. And of course I do. Do I want to do all the drifting challenges?
Probably not. Do I want to do all the kind of urban street racing around those tight Edinburgh corners? That's also not really my bag and the game doesn't really judge you for that, which I really, really rate.
Just incredibly accommodating, just absolutely gorgeous, really good fun. You know, I don't think it's just bias that I like, you know, the British one over all the other ones. I genuinely think the kind of sort of hilliness of the terrain really, really adds something to the cross country stuff.
So, yes, it is maybe a slightly unusual pick, but I think just trying to kind of give it some sense of balance and shape quite hard, given what's already occurred.
Does it include the one road going out of Scotland that you discussed in a previous episode, Matthew?
Yeah, you're racing a giant hovercraft down it, so you don't really complain as much. And you can drive across the, you know, the mountains in a way that you can't in real Scotland. Yeah, I'm okay with that.
Okay, well, look, that was, I very much enjoyed that and it felt, the energy felt sufficiently different to a draft to me. Do you think it did?
Yes, I'm looking at this list, it's quite odd.
I sort of wonder if my picks are like too boring when you look at yours. It's like quite, I mean, yeah.
Truthfully, what you did, I did look at doing, but I didn't want to fight in that, that fight out over that territory as much. Yeah, I get it. Because I think you've got the good ones.
There are a lot of bad 70s and 60s that could also make the cut. Yeah, I just didn't want to get too messy. If I committed any crime, it's that I may be stuck quite rigidly to a plan I went in with.
I mean, I would say that the much greater crime is the quiet man, but that's certainly one of your crimes.
Well, listen, let the judges decide.
Indeed. Let's just recap our picks then Matthew. In fact, let's just read out our list in full.
I'll read mine and you can read yours. The judges will have it written down anyway. I picked Mad Max for 69.
Now, I'm starting to panic if that score is not correct, Matthew, per the actual criteria.
No, I checked that one myself and that's fine.
Okay, good. Rye, Son of Rome, 60. Cyberpunk 2077, 86.
Rematch, 75. Deadly Premonition, 70. Lollipop Chainsaw, 70.
Barnet Commando, 71. Red Dead Redemption 2, 97. 50 Cent Blood on the Sand, 72.
And a Metacritic, Mirror's Edge, 79. For a total of 749 points, Matthew, what's your list?
My list is Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, 54. Ghost Squad, 69. Binary Domain, 74.
Space Giraffe, 68. Outer Wilds, 85. The Quiet Man, 40.
Bellatron, 90. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, 93. Uncharted The Lost Legacy, 84.
Forza Horizon 4, 92. Also leaving me with 1 point, so that's 749.
Yeah, very good. Okay, so the judges will decide and you the listeners will hear about it in a future episode. So yes, that was the inaugural Metacritic game.
Was it good? Was it bad? Let us know in the comments on Patreon or on the Discord and we'll potentially do this again in future.
But yes, that was the episode, Matthew. It was good fun. And yes, next week we have Two Giant Men replay GTA San Andreas.
So we will finish the definitive editions of the game by then and we can come back to that, which will be good fun and a bit different, I think, from what we've been doing lately on the podcast and the main feeds. That should be good. We have a sequel episode to our XL from early this year on Vice City.
And two weeks from now, we've already recorded it, is the four-person draft for the All-Star Japanese Game Developer Draft. And that, trust me, is a great episode. Do you want to tease that Matthew?
Did you enjoy recording that one?
Yeah, it was long, it was very stressful, quite emotional for me. But yeah, I think people are going to enjoy it.
Yeah, it's good stuff. Okay, where can people get you on social media, Matthew?
