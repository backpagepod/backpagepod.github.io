00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:25.683
<v SPEAKER_1>Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast.

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:28.463
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:29.003
<v SPEAKER_2>Hello.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:29.803
<v SPEAKER_1>Hello, Matthew.

00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:32.343
<v SPEAKER_1>Welcome to another Monday pod.

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:33.243
<v SPEAKER_1>Yay.

00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:35.783
<v SPEAKER_1>Your favorite day to record, my least favorite day.

00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:38.263
<v SPEAKER_1>And yet somehow, we always make it work.

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:39.923
<v SPEAKER_1>So, yes.

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:47.543
<v SPEAKER_1>Coming up to the 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, the launch of the PlayStation in Japan, which is absolutely fucking terrifying.

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:52.463
<v SPEAKER_1>No one wants to think about that really, but nonetheless, here we are.

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:57.423
<v SPEAKER_1>So, the PlayStation launched in Japan on the 3rd of December 1994.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:04.363
<v SPEAKER_1>Somehow, it has been 30 years since that point, or just under that when you're listening to this, but it's about to turn 30.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:09.723
<v SPEAKER_1>So, you know, significant milestone for, you know, for the brand in my head.

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:12.483
<v SPEAKER_1>I always thought of PlayStation as being 20 years old.

00:01:12.483 --> 00:01:21.163
<v SPEAKER_1>And then you do that horrible mass of realizing, oh no, Jurassic Park is actually a 31-year-old movie, and then it kind of just gets worse from there, basically.

00:01:21.163 --> 00:01:23.863
<v SPEAKER_1>So yes, 90s, long time ago, it turns out.

00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:27.223
<v SPEAKER_1>And PlayStation changed gaming forever, really.

00:01:27.223 --> 00:01:31.983
<v SPEAKER_1>So felt like we should give it a bit of time and attention on an episode.

00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:35.183
<v SPEAKER_1>And the way we're going to do it is basically in a list feature sort of format.

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:48.783
<v SPEAKER_1>So we're going to do our favorite first and third party games on every PlayStation platform, minus PocketStation, which neither me nor Matthew have owned, although I did think about it at one point as a kind of ill-advised games court draft.

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:51.683
<v SPEAKER_2>Yes, that's Patreon money talking.

00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:56.943
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's luckily Cozzy Lives and rising sort of like gas prices have spooked me out of that.

00:01:56.943 --> 00:02:00.243
<v SPEAKER_2>So, of course, you are desperate to make that a thing.

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:01.283
<v SPEAKER_1>I didn't make it a thing.

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:02.583
<v SPEAKER_1>Mumsnet made it a thing.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:03.803
<v SPEAKER_1>I just perpetuated it.

00:02:03.803 --> 00:02:05.603
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it does have Mumsnet energy.

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:06.283
<v SPEAKER_1>Someone told me that.

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:08.503
<v SPEAKER_1>I can't remember who said that, but it really does.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:12.943
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, PlayStation really changed gaming forever.

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:16.323
<v SPEAKER_1>I think changed the mainstream perception of gaming forever.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:22.383
<v SPEAKER_1>And I think of that as the legacy of certainly the original console and probably the PS2 as well.

00:02:22.383 --> 00:02:34.463
<v SPEAKER_1>But I still think to a lot of people, and the numbers kind of like bear this out, PlayStation is what the sort of like hardcore definition of gaming is, as in the non-mobile gaming, you know, sort of like core gaming essentially.

00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:38.603
<v SPEAKER_1>I think PlayStation still represents the face of that to a large extent.

00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:41.423
<v SPEAKER_1>Matthew, do you think that's what the legacy of PlayStation is?

00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:42.103
<v SPEAKER_2>Probably.

00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:50.723
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, it's one I struggle to find my place in as someone who came to the PlayStation thing quite late.

00:02:50.723 --> 00:03:04.663
<v SPEAKER_2>If I'd known I was going to be a games journalist in the future, I would have paid way more attention to PlayStation other than just being envious of it while I was reading Games Master.

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:24.723
<v SPEAKER_2>I often feel quite on unsteady grounds, certainly with PlayStation 1, but yes, there is no denying that I think in the same way that we in DS were said to kind of open up the audience, I think PlayStation made gaming cool in a way.

00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:28.623
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, cooler and has sort of persisted.

00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:30.203
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think that is true.

00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:47.943
<v SPEAKER_1>I think in some ways you had to be there to understand why Sony's youth-focused marketing and the kind of cool profile they created for PlayStation by advertising in nightclubs and stuff like that was significant because that sort of approach now isn't really what they take.

00:03:47.943 --> 00:03:56.023
<v SPEAKER_1>They are mainstream in this very kind of like all-encompassing way, whereas before it felt like they were deliberately courting an adult audience in the late 90s.

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:57.663
<v SPEAKER_1>That was certainly what they were going for.

00:03:57.663 --> 00:04:05.863
<v SPEAKER_1>It's interesting because PlayStation, I think, it remains, it kind of maintains that profile going into the PS2 era.

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:10.743
<v SPEAKER_1>PS1, PS2, hugely dominant console, both sell 100 million plus.

00:04:10.743 --> 00:04:11.983
<v SPEAKER_1>Massive, massive deal.

00:04:11.983 --> 00:04:36.443
<v SPEAKER_1>PlayStation indeed, it revolutionizes gaming by, well, it's not really, it's not the first console to do the kind of CD-ROM, but it's the widespread adoption of that kind of format of game being adopted, moving away from cartridges which are very expensive and games being easier to mass produce, cheaper to sell, all that kind of stuff.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:44.323
<v SPEAKER_1>It was hugely significant in driving that and reshaping what the future of gaming would be, and so many series started on PlayStation.

00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:46.663
<v SPEAKER_1>It was the birth of 3D gaming basically.

00:04:46.663 --> 00:04:48.563
<v SPEAKER_1>They were there at exactly the right moment.

00:04:48.563 --> 00:05:02.263
<v SPEAKER_1>They were there when developers were a little bit down on Nintendo and ready to make the leap including some key developers like Square at the time and NX and just basically most of the Japanese developers at the time really.

00:05:02.263 --> 00:05:06.743
<v SPEAKER_1>When you look at the third party selection on N64, you get to the PS2 era.

00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:07.843
<v SPEAKER_1>They build on that success.

00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:18.843
<v SPEAKER_1>They have a backwards compatibility with the original PlayStation, built-in DVD player being the crucial thing at a moment where everyone's kind of suddenly buying very fancy home video setups.

00:05:18.843 --> 00:05:24.703
<v SPEAKER_1>And it was an even internet connectivity, although I don't think the PlayStation 2 really nailed that.

00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:26.363
<v SPEAKER_1>No one would really suggest it did.

00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:33.283
<v SPEAKER_1>Then you get to the PS3 era and it starts to curdle a tiny bit, maybe a little bit too much success going to their heads.

00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:40.443
<v SPEAKER_1>And they're trying to sell this multimedia device rather than a video games console, perhaps identifying that the PS2's DVD player was a strength.

00:05:40.443 --> 00:05:44.283
<v SPEAKER_1>Maybe that was a little bit of the source of the downfall with PS3.

00:05:44.283 --> 00:05:46.943
<v SPEAKER_1>It was sold as this luxury entertainment device.

00:05:46.943 --> 00:05:52.843
<v SPEAKER_1>The world said, well, it didn't say no exactly, but a lot of people did say no, bought Xbox 360s instead.

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:57.983
<v SPEAKER_1>PS4 represents a massive turnaround in the perception of that.

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:07.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Because they decided to just sell it as a games console at a time where Xbox does what they were doing during the start of the PS3 era, selling a multimedia device under the Don Mattrick era of Xbox.

00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:12.803
<v SPEAKER_1>And so that ends in PS4 being massively dominant again after a generation where they were not successful.

00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:18.723
<v SPEAKER_1>And then you get to this era of PlayStation 5 where PS5 is basically building on the PS4's legacy.

00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:32.803
<v SPEAKER_1>And during the PS4 era, Sony sort of reinvented its portfolio of games to be these massive single player blockbusters that got people really excited about the systems they were playing them on and showing off their graphical capabilities, that kind of stuff.

00:06:32.803 --> 00:06:34.983
<v SPEAKER_1>But also the games were great as well.

00:06:34.983 --> 00:06:41.983
<v SPEAKER_1>And so we've entered this era where in a lot of sequel territory with those games, along with a few new ones as well.

00:06:41.983 --> 00:06:44.103
<v SPEAKER_1>And that's basically where we find PlayStation now.

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:47.503
<v SPEAKER_1>And of course, along the way, there was a PSP and a PS Vita as well.

00:06:47.543 --> 00:06:55.683
<v SPEAKER_1>For raisin to handheld gaming, which were very much building on their success with the Walkman, which is obviously an iconic Sony device.

00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:59.603
<v SPEAKER_1>They had some success in that field, it's fair to say, but they were also ravaged by piracy.

00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:03.763
<v SPEAKER_1>Then when the PS Vita came around, mobile gaming on phones exploded as a thing.

00:07:03.763 --> 00:07:08.143
<v SPEAKER_1>Despite the fact that circa 2012, I thought mobile gaming was shit.

00:07:09.443 --> 00:07:10.763
<v SPEAKER_1>But people have no taste, do they?

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.863
<v SPEAKER_1>So that's fine.

00:07:12.863 --> 00:07:13.583
<v SPEAKER_1>Is that unfair?

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:15.623
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, we're both thinking it.

00:07:15.623 --> 00:07:16.883
<v SPEAKER_1>We thought it when Neil Long came on.

00:07:17.543 --> 00:07:18.683
<v SPEAKER_1>That was kind of what it was like, wasn't it?

00:07:18.683 --> 00:07:20.083
<v SPEAKER_1>I sort of like…

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:21.383
<v SPEAKER_2>There was an element of it.

00:07:21.383 --> 00:07:22.983
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, it's certainly…

00:07:22.983 --> 00:07:24.443
<v SPEAKER_2>It's a huge blind spot.

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:25.523
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, a massive blind spot.

00:07:25.523 --> 00:07:31.123
<v SPEAKER_2>It's a blind spot that's bigger than the hobby I do keep an eye on, you know?

00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:34.743
<v SPEAKER_2>It's larger than everything we cover here.

00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:36.603
<v SPEAKER_2>But I think that's okay.

00:07:36.603 --> 00:07:39.243
<v SPEAKER_2>Listen, we are who we are at this point.

00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:45.963
<v SPEAKER_2>And show me the mainstream console journalist who is super on top of that stuff also.

00:07:46.423 --> 00:07:50.363
<v SPEAKER_2>So Neil aside, so I'm not apologizing for it.

00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:51.963
<v SPEAKER_1>Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:56.263
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm happy with the blind spot and respect Neil's expertise for sure.

00:07:56.263 --> 00:07:58.583
<v SPEAKER_1>But it's not my area, dog, and that's okay.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:00.443
<v SPEAKER_1>I've got a different corner, so that's fine.

00:08:00.443 --> 00:08:03.603
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, so it's good gaming on phones.

00:08:03.903 --> 00:08:07.623
<v SPEAKER_1>When you've got Netflix, you can download games onto your phone that way.

00:08:07.623 --> 00:08:11.263
<v SPEAKER_2>You can get Rise of the Golden Idol as part of your Netflix subscription.

00:08:11.263 --> 00:08:12.203
<v SPEAKER_2>Just get it.

00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:14.463
<v SPEAKER_1>That's how I've been playing it, Matthew, playing it on the phone.

00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:16.323
<v SPEAKER_1>It does work very nicely on the touch screen.

00:08:16.323 --> 00:08:22.083
<v SPEAKER_1>Sometimes it's got a lot of detail that it's quite hard to be as specific with, but I've got no complaints.

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:22.883
<v SPEAKER_1>It's completely free.

00:08:22.883 --> 00:08:28.383
<v SPEAKER_2>You can't solve it because there's a banana skin you didn't notice under one of your fat thumbs.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.983
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, similar problems to that, certainly.

00:08:30.983 --> 00:08:37.043
<v SPEAKER_1>So that's a little part of the history of PlayStation, but obviously Matthew, you and I have done a draft episode on every single PlayStation console.

00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:41.243
<v SPEAKER_1>So we have certainly not overlooked PlayStation at the time we've been making this podcast.

00:08:41.243 --> 00:08:44.783
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, I suppose you weren't there for the PSP draft, but you were there for the rest of them.

00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:49.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I certainly have dragged you along for a lot of these different episodes, and here we are.

00:08:49.343 --> 00:08:51.543
<v SPEAKER_1>So 30 years of PlayStation, Matthew.

00:08:51.543 --> 00:09:09.883
<v SPEAKER_1>Sony has decided to market with a quite sought after gray console and some gray controllers, which just that color scheme of gray appears to make millennials completely lose their minds based on social media, which fair enough, that's not the kind of nostalgia that massively speaks to me, but I do see why it's enticing.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.683
<v SPEAKER_1>But what does PlayStation mean to you, Matthew?

00:09:11.863 --> 00:09:25.183
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I was saying, this early era of PlayStation, which is being celebrated with these gray controllers, you know, I didn't have a original PlayStation apart from that one weekend where we rented one to play Final Fantasy.

00:09:25.183 --> 00:09:26.583
<v SPEAKER_2>Do you want me to tell that story again?

00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:28.243
<v SPEAKER_1>I think that gets better every single time.

00:09:28.243 --> 00:09:30.903
<v SPEAKER_1>And since we're on the 10th retelling event now, I think it's...

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:34.063
<v SPEAKER_2>I had to play Final Fantasy VII without a memory card, Samuel.

00:09:34.063 --> 00:09:34.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, shit.

00:09:34.663 --> 00:09:35.863
<v SPEAKER_3>Can you imagine that?

00:09:35.863 --> 00:09:36.283
<v SPEAKER_1>Not ideal.

00:09:36.283 --> 00:09:38.083
<v SPEAKER_2>I turned it into a roguelike.

00:09:39.323 --> 00:09:40.503
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, so there you go.

00:09:40.783 --> 00:09:41.663
<v SPEAKER_2>There's that again.

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:51.903
<v SPEAKER_2>Um, no, so I think the success of the PlayStation in that early period was marketing it to a slightly older, newer audience, which wasn't me.

00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:54.823
<v SPEAKER_2>It seemed that it was home of genres.

00:09:54.823 --> 00:10:02.163
<v SPEAKER_2>I wasn't as interested in fighting games, driving games, darker looking action games, even JRPGs to an extent.

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:04.823
<v SPEAKER_2>I wasn't, you know, super clued in on those.

00:10:04.963 --> 00:10:06.203
<v SPEAKER_2>That came later.

00:10:06.203 --> 00:10:08.623
<v SPEAKER_2>Definitely aimed at a kind of older, cooler gamer.

00:10:08.803 --> 00:10:15.003
<v SPEAKER_2>People who might appreciate the music of Wipeout or whatever the appeal of Wipeout is.

00:10:15.003 --> 00:10:17.563
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, things not targeted at me.

00:10:17.563 --> 00:10:20.483
<v SPEAKER_2>Nowadays, I get on far better with them.

00:10:20.483 --> 00:10:33.543
<v SPEAKER_2>I think they've not lost some of that character, but they are easier to enjoy as just, you know, they make quite simple gaming first consoles, which I like and which speaks to me.

00:10:34.063 --> 00:10:42.583
<v SPEAKER_2>They have a much stronger suite of single-player game support or they have in, you know, the last couple of generations.

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:45.663
<v SPEAKER_2>Right now, we're maybe a little hungry for it again.

00:10:45.663 --> 00:10:47.623
<v SPEAKER_2>And yeah, so those things sort of speak to me.

00:10:47.623 --> 00:10:55.483
<v SPEAKER_2>If anything, as they maybe lose some of their character and attitude, I sort of become more kind of aligned with them.

00:10:55.483 --> 00:10:57.603
<v SPEAKER_1>That's fucking tragic, that is.

00:10:57.603 --> 00:10:58.403
<v SPEAKER_1>Here's what I think.

00:10:58.403 --> 00:11:03.083
<v SPEAKER_1>I think you were aligned with it about five years ago, and they're still generally on that trajectory.

00:11:03.423 --> 00:11:09.783
<v SPEAKER_1>And so, you're comfortable with that mode, as opposed to anything particularly recent that's truly gelled with you.

00:11:10.283 --> 00:11:15.443
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that's probably true, but still, it's a little bit…

00:11:15.443 --> 00:11:17.943
<v SPEAKER_2>I wouldn't say it's the most characterful thing.

00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:23.303
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm not super tied to the era where they were like…

00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:27.243
<v SPEAKER_2>Japan Studio was knocking out all these kind of weird oddities, you know?

00:11:27.243 --> 00:11:30.043
<v SPEAKER_2>I was all in on Nintendo at that point.

00:11:30.043 --> 00:11:30.943
<v SPEAKER_2>That's what I mean by…

00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:36.483
<v SPEAKER_2>I feel like I kind of gel with a slightly more generic PlayStation now.

00:11:37.423 --> 00:11:40.643
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think you would have liked some of those oddities if you were there to give them a chance, though.

00:11:41.783 --> 00:11:45.963
<v SPEAKER_1>They were not all going to be your sort of thing, but I think some of them were certainly great.

00:11:45.963 --> 00:11:48.803
<v SPEAKER_1>You know, like the likes of LocoRoco, Patapon.

00:11:48.803 --> 00:11:50.203
<v SPEAKER_1>Those are like great oddities.

00:11:50.523 --> 00:11:53.783
<v SPEAKER_2>Maybe some of these things will come up in this episode.

00:11:54.503 --> 00:12:03.843
<v SPEAKER_2>Certainly, when I was playing Astro Bot, which is obviously sort of a history of PlayStation through cameos, there were loads of stuff.

00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:17.423
<v SPEAKER_2>I had no idea what it was, and I'd look it up, and it was quite surprising to see that they'd made this weird conductor game, or something to do with a man on a giant cube, which I didn't really understand.

00:12:17.843 --> 00:12:18.643
<v SPEAKER_2>That's kind of fun.

00:12:18.643 --> 00:12:21.063
<v SPEAKER_2>You sort of think, oh, well, they don't do that anymore, that's for sure.

00:12:21.423 --> 00:12:22.583
<v SPEAKER_1>That is true.

00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:24.943
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Astrobot was very good at celebrating that.

00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:38.123
<v SPEAKER_1>Yes, not all of it was gold, but that's the thing, is that PlayStation's lifespan in the PS1, and maybe the PS2 to some extent, was defined by volume as much as quality.

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:40.803
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, there were lots of great games on PS1, absolutely.

00:12:40.803 --> 00:12:46.083
<v SPEAKER_1>But to me, the PS1 is a massive jumbled box of chipped games.

00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:49.283
<v SPEAKER_1>That's what I remember of people's PS1 collections.

00:12:49.383 --> 00:12:58.983
<v SPEAKER_1>It was like a vast, bad photocopies and just finding FIFA 98 Road to World Cup in this immense box with the man you're missing.

00:13:00.283 --> 00:13:01.323
<v SPEAKER_1>That's what I remember of that.

00:13:01.323 --> 00:13:05.603
<v SPEAKER_1>It's just the sheer volume of games people had, and some were good, some were bad.

00:13:05.603 --> 00:13:14.083
<v SPEAKER_1>You'd put in a demo disc and then the menu music would start rewiring your DNA, because it seemed like the most cool and hypnotic thing you'd ever seen.

00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:15.623
<v SPEAKER_1>What the fuck is this that I'm looking at?

00:13:15.843 --> 00:13:34.363
<v SPEAKER_1>And just so different a profile of gaming to the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog and what I was used to at that time, or games I'd been playing on PC where Windows 95 and 3.1, those are very dadly interfaces.

00:13:35.783 --> 00:13:40.123
<v SPEAKER_1>You never really felt like you were playing anything cool when you played a PC game in the 90s.

00:13:40.123 --> 00:13:44.483
<v SPEAKER_1>Steam has zhuzh that up a little bit, but still arguably PC gaming is the dorkiest kind of gaming.

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:50.483
<v SPEAKER_1>It's not unfair to say, but PlayStation did feel cool and the selection of games felt cool.

00:13:50.483 --> 00:13:52.263
<v SPEAKER_1>Die Hard trilogy was cool, Matthew.

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:55.043
<v SPEAKER_1>It was just good times.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:58.843
<v SPEAKER_1>You get to PS2 era and the profile of it, I think it's still similar.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:09.023
<v SPEAKER_1>Instead of like a jumbled box of games, I more picture like someone's first DVD shelf and it's half films like The Matrix and sort of like...

00:14:09.023 --> 00:14:10.043
<v SPEAKER_2>Ghostbusters.

00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:11.983
<v SPEAKER_1>Hate, Goodfellas.

00:14:11.983 --> 00:14:12.763
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:12.763 --> 00:14:14.063
<v SPEAKER_1>Like that kind of thing.

00:14:14.063 --> 00:14:16.523
<v SPEAKER_2>Goodfellas, we're here to flip it halfway through.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.483
<v SPEAKER_1>Exactly.

00:14:17.483 --> 00:14:17.783
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

00:14:17.783 --> 00:14:21.443
<v SPEAKER_1>So that and the perfect storm, things like that.

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:29.483
<v SPEAKER_1>Just sort of like Six to Set, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, sort of like 10 to 20 of those and then 10 to 20.

00:14:29.483 --> 00:14:42.083
<v SPEAKER_1>This big tower of, you'd spot two to three GTAs in there, a Pro Evo, maybe like an ill-advised FIFA, because FIFA was shit on PS2, but maybe some of the other stuff, James Bond games.

00:14:43.023 --> 00:14:46.643
<v SPEAKER_1>You'd spot like a Night's Fire or an Everything or Nothing in there for sure.

00:14:46.723 --> 00:14:49.003
<v SPEAKER_1>Then like Gran Turismo 3, definitely.

00:14:49.003 --> 00:14:50.883
<v SPEAKER_1>That would definitely be a fixture.

00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:54.103
<v SPEAKER_1>ResiCode Veronica X, the Platinum edition of that one.

00:14:54.103 --> 00:14:57.343
<v SPEAKER_1>An ill-advised crazy taxi purchase.

00:14:57.343 --> 00:15:05.403
<v SPEAKER_1>Metal Gear Solid 2, which the person's house you're at, they played the prologue and they were like, I thought this is shit and I hated all the cut scenes, turned it off.

00:15:05.403 --> 00:15:07.543
<v SPEAKER_1>That's like the profile of the PS2 library to me.

00:15:07.543 --> 00:15:09.303
<v SPEAKER_2>Burnout or SSX tricking.

00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:10.343
<v SPEAKER_1>Yes, exactly.

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:10.823
<v SPEAKER_1>Perfect.

00:15:10.823 --> 00:15:12.683
<v SPEAKER_1>Spot on.

00:15:12.683 --> 00:15:13.683
<v SPEAKER_1>That's PS2.

00:15:13.683 --> 00:15:17.063
<v SPEAKER_1>PS3, just a litany of tragedies really.

00:15:18.383 --> 00:15:20.583
<v SPEAKER_1>Brown shooters across the board.

00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:35.343
<v SPEAKER_1>You see it and then one game with color just fighting back, like Ratchet and Clank, a crack in time or something like that, under a wall of army of two, which runs worse on PS3 than it does on 360, like most PS3 games did in the early days.

00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:46.523
<v SPEAKER_1>Then just some combination of modern warfare, a kill zone, probably the original Resistance, a motor storm in there as well.

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:55.963
<v SPEAKER_1>Then maybe you'd get the three Uncharted's there to save the day as well, just make things a little bit better.

00:15:55.963 --> 00:16:04.543
<v SPEAKER_1>PS4, Return to Glory, that's like you got your 10 or so absolutely killer exclusives, and they define the system to a large extent.

00:16:04.603 --> 00:16:09.243
<v SPEAKER_1>Then PS5, I don't know if it seems like few people have physical games now, but I do.

00:16:09.243 --> 00:16:11.023
<v SPEAKER_1>I've got probably half physical, half digital.

00:16:12.103 --> 00:16:18.943
<v SPEAKER_1>I think over there I've got Returnal and Final Fantasy XVI, Spider-Man 2, that sort of thing.

00:16:18.943 --> 00:16:22.823
<v SPEAKER_2>Slave to the add-on disk drive should you decide to upgrade.

00:16:22.823 --> 00:16:27.903
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, which does make me wonder if we are in the waning days of the disk era.

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:32.743
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, that's how I perceived PlayStation over the years.

00:16:32.743 --> 00:16:34.083
<v SPEAKER_2>I enjoyed that rundown.

00:16:34.523 --> 00:16:43.263
<v SPEAKER_2>That almost had the makings of a little stand-up bit, a kind of history of consoles through very well-observed game compilations.

00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:45.403
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I lost the thread of it a bit around PS3.

00:16:45.403 --> 00:16:46.343
<v SPEAKER_1>That's fine though.

00:16:47.463 --> 00:16:50.583
<v SPEAKER_2>I thought the first two, PS1 and PS2, were like really bang on.

00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:52.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that was what it was like.

00:16:52.663 --> 00:16:54.383
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, it was cool.

00:16:54.383 --> 00:16:56.623
<v SPEAKER_1>It was something I thought was cool from afar.

00:16:56.623 --> 00:17:09.863
<v SPEAKER_1>And then when I locked into it when I was 13 or so, I just thought, oh, the browser screen, a pinch emoji at the browser screen for PS2, and then looking at the little PS2 memory card symbols and being like, god damn, this console is cool.

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:13.203
<v SPEAKER_1>Picking up OPM and being like, damn, the design in this is really off the charts.

00:17:13.203 --> 00:17:18.623
<v SPEAKER_1>And they've got a Hideo Kojima column that Matthew later reveals to be a load of old arse, the writing in that.

00:17:18.623 --> 00:17:22.243
<v SPEAKER_1>But you know, it's certainly the type it seemed exciting to me.

00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:23.763
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, that's what it meant to me.

00:17:23.763 --> 00:17:27.083
<v SPEAKER_1>So there's your half-constructed stand up bit, Matthew, off the cuff.

00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:29.503
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, good to audit that, I think.

00:17:29.503 --> 00:17:35.523
<v SPEAKER_1>I think in a lot of ways, my peak interest in PlayStation was definitely around PS2, PS3 era.

00:17:35.523 --> 00:17:40.243
<v SPEAKER_1>But I sort of really respect the PS4 onwards era, you know?

00:17:40.243 --> 00:17:42.523
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, I love the games probably a tiny bit less.

00:17:42.523 --> 00:17:54.903
<v SPEAKER_1>But I also recognize that they are highly polished and they've like, they've made, whereas I don't think PlayStation had many defining a series of its own back in the day, I think now they have loads of them that people seem quite buzzed about, you know?

00:17:54.903 --> 00:17:59.683
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, it's just, it's quite a, it's quite a boring and obvious thing to be a fan of.

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:00.523
<v SPEAKER_2>It's just good.

00:18:00.523 --> 00:18:01.323
<v SPEAKER_2>It's just solid.

00:18:01.763 --> 00:18:11.163
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, I feel like the people who would call themselves PlayStation fans are people who have a specific love of PS1, PS2 and PS3 in their blood.

00:18:11.163 --> 00:18:13.643
<v SPEAKER_2>Like someone who's in was PS4.

00:18:13.643 --> 00:18:18.583
<v SPEAKER_2>They're not going to have quite the same profile, I guess, as those other people.

00:18:18.583 --> 00:18:29.403
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I work with a lot of people who are proper PlayStation fans, people who get excited about a grey PS5 Pro for like a billion pounds or whatever, you know?

00:18:29.403 --> 00:18:33.123
<v SPEAKER_2>People who get excited about Parappa the Rapper on a t-shirt.

00:18:33.123 --> 00:18:38.663
<v SPEAKER_2>Where I think if you're a PS4 person, you probably just like solid good games like most people do.

00:18:38.663 --> 00:18:39.163
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

00:18:39.163 --> 00:18:39.743
<v SPEAKER_2>But that's fine.

00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:40.963
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm no shade on them.

00:18:40.963 --> 00:18:42.983
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I count myself amongst them, so.

00:18:43.183 --> 00:18:46.443
<v SPEAKER_1>I have a vivid memory of you being excited to buy God of War on PS4.

00:18:46.443 --> 00:18:53.183
<v SPEAKER_1>I think I was at your house the day before and you were like, I'm going to go down there, I'm going to pick it up, going to bring it back, going to play it.

00:18:53.183 --> 00:18:56.543
<v SPEAKER_1>And you were just like, you were pumped about that little ritual.

00:18:56.543 --> 00:18:58.683
<v SPEAKER_2>I bought the God of War 4 PS4 Pro.

00:18:59.643 --> 00:19:00.203
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, wow.

00:19:00.203 --> 00:19:02.203
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, you were massively into it then.

00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:03.423
<v SPEAKER_2>It's got runes on it.

00:19:03.423 --> 00:19:05.463
<v SPEAKER_2>That's just what you want to see when you're sitting on your couch.

00:19:05.463 --> 00:19:10.203
<v SPEAKER_2>You look under and because now it's not plugged in and there's like a shadowy crevice under the TV.

00:19:10.203 --> 00:19:16.323
<v SPEAKER_2>But occasionally see a rune and remind myself that I have a ill-advised PS4 Pro.

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:20.183
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, the custom consoles can often date the fastest, can't they?

00:19:20.223 --> 00:19:22.163
<v SPEAKER_1>They don't sort of...

00:19:22.163 --> 00:19:27.743
<v SPEAKER_2>The controller itself is quite tattie now and just it gets plugged into like whatever and wherever.

00:19:28.103 --> 00:19:35.263
<v SPEAKER_2>The God of War PS4 Pro controller just turns up like randomly in the house to just embarrass me for a few minutes.

00:19:35.263 --> 00:19:40.643
<v SPEAKER_2>And then I forget it again until like three months later, I'll be like, where's that extension cord?

00:19:40.643 --> 00:19:41.863
<v SPEAKER_2>And oh, there it is.

00:19:41.863 --> 00:19:45.023
<v SPEAKER_2>The embarrassing controller again, running in the knee, I'm covered in dust.

00:19:45.023 --> 00:19:48.523
<v SPEAKER_2>I've probably got a Chew It rapper stuck to me.

00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:58.623
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I sort of, I remember making the very difficult decision one day to like, I'd broken a dual shock too, probably some kind of rage for no real reason.

00:19:58.623 --> 00:20:02.423
<v SPEAKER_1>Went to buy another one, the shop were like, we've only got the pink one left.

00:20:02.423 --> 00:20:04.503
<v SPEAKER_1>And I made the decision not to buy it.

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.603
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, so pathetic.

00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:08.383
<v SPEAKER_2>That's toxic masculinity, that is.

00:20:08.383 --> 00:20:10.143
<v SPEAKER_1>Ha ha ha ha, it is.

00:20:10.503 --> 00:20:12.563
<v SPEAKER_1>That was like early incel shit, that was.

00:20:12.563 --> 00:20:15.463
<v SPEAKER_1>That was not ideal.

00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:19.983
<v SPEAKER_1>So yes, I think we've covered the territory there for what it means to each of us, Matthew.

00:20:19.983 --> 00:20:25.343
<v SPEAKER_1>And I appreciate your honesty about, you know, a competent exclusive being the thing that gets you buzzed for it.

00:20:25.343 --> 00:20:29.563
<v SPEAKER_1>That is better than pretending that you thought Vib Ribbon was good, because we all know it's not true.

00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:32.043
<v SPEAKER_1>After 200 episodes of this podcast.

00:20:32.043 --> 00:20:34.043
<v SPEAKER_1>What's the best PlayStation ever, Matthew?

00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:35.183
<v SPEAKER_2>It's the PS4.

00:20:35.183 --> 00:20:36.403
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, okay, interesting.

00:20:36.523 --> 00:20:37.763
<v SPEAKER_1>Not even a pause.

00:20:37.763 --> 00:20:42.223
<v SPEAKER_2>No, it just for me, it plays everything really well.

00:20:42.223 --> 00:20:44.043
<v SPEAKER_2>I am a console gamer at heart.

00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:53.143
<v SPEAKER_2>Obviously, a PC will play things flashier, but if you want to play third party games to the best standard on a home console, PS4 at the time is where it's at.

00:20:53.143 --> 00:21:05.323
<v SPEAKER_2>It's also where they finally, finally had a big enough suite of first party games that I wanted mainly by making everything into a over the shoulder, third person action adventure game.

00:21:05.403 --> 00:21:06.743
<v SPEAKER_2>But that was fine with me.

00:21:06.743 --> 00:21:09.163
<v SPEAKER_2>It's really basic bitch, but that is it.

00:21:09.163 --> 00:21:16.183
<v SPEAKER_1>I think that's a proper head pick choice, because I think for most people to look at the...

00:21:16.283 --> 00:21:19.223
<v SPEAKER_1>We went through this when we did the three person draft of the PS4.

00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:26.403
<v SPEAKER_1>It's immensely strong and most sensible people wouldn't disagree with that choice.

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:31.543
<v SPEAKER_1>But I think for the people who say PS1 or PS2, it's very much in the heart pick territory.

00:21:31.543 --> 00:21:35.643
<v SPEAKER_1>For me, Matthew, I would say PS2, very predictably.

00:21:35.723 --> 00:21:41.163
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm just going to read out a selection of games that are from the top rated games on Metacritic for PS2.

00:21:41.163 --> 00:21:44.363
<v SPEAKER_1>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, Grand Theft Auto 3, Resident Evil 4.

00:21:44.423 --> 00:21:46.783
<v SPEAKER_1>You can't really count that as a PS2 game, can we?

00:21:46.783 --> 00:22:13.243
<v SPEAKER_1>Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, G2 Vice City, Grand Theft Auto Resume 3, A-Spec, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater, God of War, God of War 2, Burnout 3, Takedown, Virtua Fighter 4, Akami, SSX, SSX Tricky, and Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, Final Fantasy X, Guitar Hero 2, Guitar Hero 1, Twisted Metal Black.

00:22:13.243 --> 00:22:17.563
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't care about that, but I know Americans do or did.

00:22:17.563 --> 00:22:22.943
<v SPEAKER_1>Then Matthew's favorite series of all time, Ratchet and Clank, of course, and Jack and Daxter.

00:22:22.943 --> 00:22:23.463
<v SPEAKER_1>Very strong.

00:22:23.503 --> 00:22:42.423
<v SPEAKER_1>The thing is, I think that there is, maybe this will come up in the PS2 redraft that we're doing in January, but I do think there is a finite number of really great killer PS2 games you would play now, and then quite a large range of stuff that is interesting, but that you probably wouldn't play now or wouldn't enjoy now, whereas PS4 is much more durable library.

00:22:42.423 --> 00:22:43.683
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, fair enough, Matthew.

00:22:43.683 --> 00:22:45.303
<v SPEAKER_1>So PS2 for me, PS4 for you.

00:22:45.303 --> 00:22:47.343
<v SPEAKER_1>What's the worst PlayStation ever?

00:22:47.343 --> 00:22:48.763
<v SPEAKER_2>For me personally.

00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:53.523
<v SPEAKER_2>Don't say PS1.

00:22:54.443 --> 00:22:59.243
<v SPEAKER_2>What I wrote down was, I wrote PS1 or PS3, question mark.

00:22:59.403 --> 00:23:02.103
<v SPEAKER_2>Because I couldn't decide.

00:23:02.723 --> 00:23:06.703
<v SPEAKER_2>I do think from my personal taste, it might be PS1.

00:23:06.703 --> 00:23:07.603
<v SPEAKER_1>Brutal.

00:23:07.623 --> 00:23:11.283
<v SPEAKER_3>It is brutal, but again, I just think...

00:23:11.283 --> 00:23:17.503
<v SPEAKER_2>I just think it was a time and a place for that machine, and it really spoke to a lot of people, clearly.

00:23:17.503 --> 00:23:21.083
<v SPEAKER_2>And I just wasn't at the place where it would have spoken to me.

00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:24.103
<v SPEAKER_2>And now going back to it, I'm like, I don't really get this.

00:23:24.103 --> 00:23:25.943
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't really get the fuss.

00:23:25.943 --> 00:23:29.363
<v SPEAKER_2>And that isn't just like the remnants of some mad Nintendo fanboys.

00:23:29.363 --> 00:23:32.743
<v SPEAKER_2>This isn't me pretending that no one ever bought an Xbox in the UK.

00:23:32.743 --> 00:23:34.883
<v SPEAKER_2>I know PlayStation is fucking massive.

00:23:34.883 --> 00:23:48.303
<v SPEAKER_2>But I also said PS3 because outside of a couple of essential games that were only on PS3, it was where you played the lousier versions of everything else and a load of first party games you probably didn't want to play anyway.

00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:51.823
<v SPEAKER_2>So PS3 is also quite cursed.

00:23:51.823 --> 00:23:53.583
<v SPEAKER_1>PS3 is the more diplomatic answer.

00:23:55.323 --> 00:24:03.503
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, the thing is that you've probably played and enjoyed more PS1 games in the last 10 years than you probably did in the preceding 10 years.

00:24:03.903 --> 00:24:05.603
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that is true.

00:24:05.603 --> 00:24:08.883
<v SPEAKER_1>You'd be playing the likes of Final Fantasy's and Rezzi's on there.

00:24:08.883 --> 00:24:09.803
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm not saying all of them.

00:24:10.183 --> 00:24:12.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Ridge Racer Type 4, did you play that for the PS1 draft?

00:24:12.723 --> 00:24:14.443
<v SPEAKER_3>Yeah, but yes.

00:24:14.443 --> 00:24:19.963
<v SPEAKER_2>And you do go back to them and you go, oh, this must have really hit differently back then.

00:24:19.963 --> 00:24:26.783
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, like, this is great now, but this must have been just mind-blowing to encounter it in its proper context.

00:24:26.783 --> 00:24:27.303
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

00:24:27.303 --> 00:24:31.823
<v SPEAKER_2>But it isn't the same as experiencing it in its proper context.

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:32.983
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll say PS3.

00:24:32.983 --> 00:24:36.483
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't want to be like it's pumping a bit of a shithead saying PS1.

00:24:36.603 --> 00:24:39.823
<v SPEAKER_1>Was that even more than like PSP and PS Vita?

00:24:39.823 --> 00:24:41.003
<v SPEAKER_1>Because I think...

00:24:41.003 --> 00:24:41.963
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, OK.

00:24:41.963 --> 00:24:42.783
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that's interesting.

00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:45.423
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, no, PSP probably.

00:24:45.423 --> 00:24:46.083
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, interesting.

00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:52.703
<v SPEAKER_1>So the thing is, like, the Vita has a really good reputation, but does sort of have the smallest library.

00:24:52.703 --> 00:24:56.243
<v SPEAKER_2>It does, but it's also like Weeb Central and...

00:24:56.243 --> 00:24:59.183
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, yeah, your fucking Danganronpa's are all down there, aren't they?

00:24:59.203 --> 00:25:05.323
<v SPEAKER_2>That's the thing, it was all like visual novels, it was all like Steins Gate and, yeah, Danganronpa's and...

00:25:05.323 --> 00:25:09.243
<v SPEAKER_1>But you still pick PS1 or PS3 over the PS Vita.

00:25:09.243 --> 00:25:11.323
<v SPEAKER_1>Would you really do that?

00:25:11.323 --> 00:25:14.943
<v SPEAKER_2>Uh...

00:25:14.943 --> 00:25:18.423
<v SPEAKER_2>You see, you've trained it in a different way there.

00:25:18.423 --> 00:25:20.923
<v SPEAKER_1>Peak little stinker behavior from you, I must say.

00:25:20.923 --> 00:25:21.603
<v SPEAKER_3>No, I'm not.

00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:23.143
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm just trying to be honest.

00:25:23.143 --> 00:25:25.783
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm just trying to interrogate my feelings about PlayStation.

00:25:25.783 --> 00:25:26.163
<v SPEAKER_1>That's fine.

00:25:26.163 --> 00:25:27.663
<v SPEAKER_1>And so am I, because it's entertaining.

00:25:29.043 --> 00:25:31.043
<v SPEAKER_3>Yeah, I just...

00:25:31.043 --> 00:25:31.483
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

00:25:31.483 --> 00:25:32.223
<v SPEAKER_3>I just think you kind of...

00:25:32.223 --> 00:25:35.163
<v SPEAKER_2>I think with all this generation, you kind of had to be there, right?

00:25:35.163 --> 00:25:36.463
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think that is true.

00:25:36.463 --> 00:25:41.563
<v SPEAKER_2>I have a lot of love for the N64, which is obviously where my attention was during this time.

00:25:41.563 --> 00:25:45.783
<v SPEAKER_2>But like most of that's a horror show that I don't want to go back to.

00:25:45.783 --> 00:25:47.583
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I have moved on from that.

00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:55.343
<v SPEAKER_2>It might just be an era, a general era thing that this early 3D era doesn't quite like land for me in quite the same way.

00:25:56.223 --> 00:26:01.383
<v SPEAKER_2>So PS1 obviously has to overcome that mental obstacle.

00:26:01.383 --> 00:26:02.023
<v SPEAKER_1>No, I get that.

00:26:02.023 --> 00:26:07.183
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, certainly if you weren't there, it's even harder to enjoy a console's lifespan in retrospect.

00:26:07.183 --> 00:26:13.623
<v SPEAKER_1>There are consoles where I have enjoyed the fruits of it down the line and had a really good time.

00:26:13.623 --> 00:26:14.703
<v SPEAKER_1>GameCube most notably.

00:26:14.703 --> 00:26:18.183
<v SPEAKER_1>I played a lot of GameCube games the last 10, 15 years.

00:26:18.183 --> 00:26:32.243
<v SPEAKER_1>And that's been fun to discover games that looked really, really nice despite the limitations of the hardware and were just quite cool or culty or just some banger Star Wars games or whatever it might be.

00:26:32.243 --> 00:26:34.983
<v SPEAKER_1>But it's definitely not the same as experiencing it fresh.

00:26:34.983 --> 00:26:41.523
<v SPEAKER_1>And yes, anything older than sort of HD era now is going to be a little bit dicey to revisit.

00:26:41.523 --> 00:26:43.363
<v SPEAKER_1>So I do understand, Matthew.

00:26:43.423 --> 00:26:55.303
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, so yeah, I think for me, the Vita is by default the worst PlayStation, because the PSP does have a much better library of your physical classic games.

00:26:55.303 --> 00:26:57.923
<v SPEAKER_1>I know the Vita's got a pretty good digital library.

00:26:57.923 --> 00:27:06.803
<v SPEAKER_1>And yeah, most of that has been sort of put elsewhere, whereas the PSP's games are still, most of them are still specific to it.

00:27:07.803 --> 00:27:10.883
<v SPEAKER_1>And so I think that that's, and I obviously had one and was very into it.

00:27:10.883 --> 00:27:15.103
<v SPEAKER_1>And I thought that Sony gave up on the Vita way too quickly.

00:27:16.363 --> 00:27:21.363
<v SPEAKER_1>They basically just couldn't make games of that visual fidelity for both PS4 and that.

00:27:21.363 --> 00:27:27.043
<v SPEAKER_1>The PS4 needed the support, which was the right call, but it was disappointing if you'd bought a PS Vita.

00:27:27.043 --> 00:27:34.943
<v SPEAKER_1>So you either got with the indie game thing or it just didn't, it was just kind of daft and it didn't really have, there wasn't really much in the tank.

00:27:34.943 --> 00:27:36.283
<v SPEAKER_1>That's the honest truth about it.

00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:40.403
<v SPEAKER_1>I still think it's a great hand held though, and a wonderful piece of hardware.

00:27:40.403 --> 00:27:43.083
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, just saying that to be diplomatic really.

00:27:43.083 --> 00:27:46.783
<v SPEAKER_1>Is there anything about old PlayStation consoles you wish Sony did now, Matthew?

00:27:47.023 --> 00:27:48.103
<v SPEAKER_3>Not really.

00:27:48.103 --> 00:27:57.083
<v SPEAKER_2>Again, as someone who didn't have a huge relationship with them, I was curious what your answer was for this, in that it might spur some great thought from me.

00:27:57.083 --> 00:28:14.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I was gonna say that, well, I mean, first of all, you won't agree with this, but I do think that weird Japanese exclusives, I do think they were precious and you ultimately got gold out of that, even if not all of it was for everyone and some of it was a little bit rougher.

00:28:14.343 --> 00:28:15.623
<v SPEAKER_1>You took your jungles and the like.

00:28:15.623 --> 00:28:16.323
<v SPEAKER_2>I can see that.

00:28:16.323 --> 00:28:17.643
<v SPEAKER_2>That sounds very reasonable.

00:28:17.643 --> 00:28:20.303
<v SPEAKER_2>That sounds like a good castle stance.

00:28:20.863 --> 00:28:22.163
<v SPEAKER_1>It's only a couple of things, really.

00:28:22.543 --> 00:28:26.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm not here to tell you that I think they should bring back the brown FPS games of the PS3.

00:28:26.343 --> 00:28:28.243
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think that's necessary.

00:28:28.243 --> 00:28:31.963
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, I'm not yearning for a new Killzone or Resistance or anything like that.

00:28:31.963 --> 00:28:39.103
<v SPEAKER_1>The only other thing I was gonna say, though, is that UK racing games were a clear part of the Sony DNA.

00:28:39.103 --> 00:28:41.043
<v SPEAKER_1>And I think they...

00:28:41.043 --> 00:28:44.003
<v SPEAKER_1>There were so many, like, good ones that came out of that.

00:28:44.003 --> 00:28:47.603
<v SPEAKER_1>I wasn't really like a drive club guy, but MotorStorm series really good.

00:28:47.603 --> 00:28:55.023
<v SPEAKER_1>I know you're a bit mixed on Wipeout, but I thought the Wipeout HD in particular was just a really, really great version of that game.

00:28:55.023 --> 00:28:58.203
<v SPEAKER_1>And that was like a part of their heritage as a publisher.

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:01.523
<v SPEAKER_1>And that was abandoned at the start of the PS4 era.

00:29:01.663 --> 00:29:06.443
<v SPEAKER_1>So those are two things I think were like, it would be nice if they were still in the mix.

00:29:06.463 --> 00:29:11.643
<v SPEAKER_1>But I know racing games have become a bit more of a compromised genre more generally.

00:29:11.643 --> 00:29:14.163
<v SPEAKER_1>There used to be so many of them on PS2 and PS1.

00:29:14.163 --> 00:29:23.723
<v SPEAKER_1>And then over time, we've kind of got it down to Forza, Gran Turismo and then like some really, really simmy ones and like the F1 licensed game.

00:29:23.723 --> 00:29:25.363
<v SPEAKER_1>And that's kind of it really.

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:26.943
<v SPEAKER_2>And Mario Kart.

00:29:27.763 --> 00:29:30.903
<v SPEAKER_1>Sorry, of course, the king of racing games.

00:29:30.903 --> 00:29:33.663
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, I kind of missed that as part of the mix.

00:29:33.663 --> 00:29:38.763
<v SPEAKER_1>I just think they were actually like quite fun games to play, even if you weren't a racing game fan.

00:29:38.763 --> 00:29:40.423
<v SPEAKER_1>And there's something to be said for that.

00:29:40.423 --> 00:29:41.663
<v SPEAKER_1>But that's about it really.

00:29:41.663 --> 00:29:44.063
<v SPEAKER_1>There's not really anything else I'm dying.

00:29:44.063 --> 00:29:48.783
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't wish them to bring back like, I'm not dying for a new Jack and Daxter or anything like that.

00:29:48.783 --> 00:29:52.983
<v SPEAKER_1>I think they've moved on for a reason and a lot of it's been quite well judged, Matthew.

00:29:52.983 --> 00:29:53.843
<v SPEAKER_1>Any reflections on that?

00:29:54.043 --> 00:30:04.743
<v SPEAKER_2>As you were saying, it reminded me that the Britain part of the PlayStation story was quite big earlier on and it's now quite reduced, which I guess is a shame.

00:30:04.743 --> 00:30:07.243
<v SPEAKER_2>This idea that lots of cool stuff was happening here.

00:30:07.243 --> 00:30:13.183
<v SPEAKER_2>PlayStation is part of whatever cool Britannia, I guess, to an extent.

00:30:13.183 --> 00:30:14.663
<v SPEAKER_2>Harder to see where that is now.

00:30:14.663 --> 00:30:15.703
<v SPEAKER_1>For sure.

00:30:16.403 --> 00:30:17.843
<v SPEAKER_1>There's a rumor actually today.

00:30:17.903 --> 00:30:27.883
<v SPEAKER_1>There must have been a rumor before this Bloomberg report came out, Matthew, because I read somewhere that there's a rumor Sony is making a bespoke handheld again.

00:30:27.883 --> 00:30:32.503
<v SPEAKER_1>Then Bloomberg were like, oh yeah, it's definitely happening after I sent you this plan last night.

00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:34.463
<v SPEAKER_1>I was a bit confused by that.

00:30:35.003 --> 00:30:43.563
<v SPEAKER_1>There does seem to be some kind of Sony handheld in the works, but the rumor is it will just play the existing PlayStation games you've already got, but on a handheld natively.

00:30:43.563 --> 00:30:44.943
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you miss Sony handhelds, Matthew?

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:48.743
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you think that was an interesting part of the mix more generally?

00:30:49.243 --> 00:30:50.103
<v SPEAKER_2>I had fun with them.

00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:55.723
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm not like crying myself to sleep every night over the lack of a Sony handheld.

00:30:55.723 --> 00:31:17.083
<v SPEAKER_2>I think right now, because we live in an era where there is a hybrid Nintendo platform and the rise of Steam Deck and, you know, we can assume some other Steam Deck clones to come and, you know, Xbox have spoken about being interested in that space and etc.

00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:17.223
<v SPEAKER_1>etc.

00:31:18.003 --> 00:31:30.463
<v SPEAKER_2>The kind of middle, you know, I often saw those as offering slightly more kind of console adjacent games in that in their handheld form and you can get that from lots of other things now so I don't particularly need it.

00:31:30.463 --> 00:31:42.923
<v SPEAKER_2>I just think when you've got a proven track record of not, you know, like the fact that they didn't sort of stick with Vita or invest in it heavily, I just don't really know where that that goes, you know, why you want to kind of re-enter that.

00:31:42.923 --> 00:31:45.603
<v SPEAKER_2>You're right not to do it anymore if you didn't want to do it anymore.

00:31:46.003 --> 00:31:53.023
<v SPEAKER_2>These streaming handhelds, like the PlayStation Portal, that's not quite the same thing, but that feels like a more sensible fit for them.

00:31:53.023 --> 00:32:04.223
<v SPEAKER_2>But then I didn't, you know, I was just so all in on DS, you know, PSP didn't really factor into my life, you know, it got burgled from me and I, you know, barely batted an eye at it, so.

00:32:04.223 --> 00:32:11.783
<v SPEAKER_1>I agree that they were, when they moved away from it, it was probably the right thing for them to do as like their sort of business.

00:32:11.783 --> 00:32:16.703
<v SPEAKER_1>And I would say that in recent years, they haven't really made any games where I thought they had a hand held profile.

00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:24.983
<v SPEAKER_1>The thing is that, the thing that's miraculous about Nintendo is they've got games that feel hand held and games that feel home console.

00:32:24.983 --> 00:32:29.683
<v SPEAKER_1>And basically, they are running on the same system and you can play them either way.

00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:42.063
<v SPEAKER_1>But it means that they are the only console manufacturer who are making a game of like echoes of wisdom scale or like Mario and Luigi Brothership scale and like making them sort of like sell.

00:32:42.063 --> 00:32:44.323
<v SPEAKER_1>And they are like, that's a hand held ass game.

00:32:44.763 --> 00:32:46.743
<v SPEAKER_1>And it suits a hand held very, very well.

00:32:46.743 --> 00:32:49.343
<v SPEAKER_1>And I don't think Sony has got a great desire to make games like that.

00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:57.463
<v SPEAKER_1>So it really is just a question of like, do you want to play, you know, God of War, Ragnarok or Returnal on your hand held.

00:32:57.463 --> 00:32:59.743
<v SPEAKER_1>And I know there's a PlayStation port so you can stream it.

00:32:59.743 --> 00:33:05.443
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, I don't think there's a, I don't think there'll be any kind of like game design changes to go along with this.

00:33:05.443 --> 00:33:09.163
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think there'll be like a hand held focused ratchet and clank game or something like that.

00:33:09.163 --> 00:33:11.443
<v SPEAKER_1>Those days feel long gone.

00:33:11.443 --> 00:33:14.003
<v SPEAKER_1>And only Nintendo is really doing it still.

00:33:14.323 --> 00:33:16.403
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, so I'm a bit like you.

00:33:16.403 --> 00:33:20.043
<v SPEAKER_1>It's weird how the more hand helds have entered the market.

00:33:20.503 --> 00:33:22.523
<v SPEAKER_1>It is an exciting and vibrant space.

00:33:22.523 --> 00:33:26.763
<v SPEAKER_1>But other than Playdate, none of the hand helds are really doing anything that novel, you know?

00:33:26.763 --> 00:33:30.003
<v SPEAKER_2>They're all kind of like, they're not, yeah, they're not playing hand held games.

00:33:30.003 --> 00:33:39.723
<v SPEAKER_2>And it doesn't feel like, well, some indie games definitely feel like they suit handheld just because they're quite bitty or like little puzzle games or whatever.

00:33:39.723 --> 00:33:40.563
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, you are right.

00:33:40.903 --> 00:33:46.043
<v SPEAKER_2>It takes a dedicated mindset to make a hand held game.

00:33:46.043 --> 00:33:52.123
<v SPEAKER_2>And Nintendo just happened to have half the company making hand held games, you know, 10 years ago.

00:33:52.123 --> 00:33:54.663
<v SPEAKER_2>So they have all that know how, you know?

00:33:54.663 --> 00:33:59.823
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't think Sony never really had that, you know, like their Japan studio making some really cool stuff.

00:33:59.823 --> 00:34:02.963
<v SPEAKER_2>But outside of that, like, a bit shady.

00:34:02.963 --> 00:34:06.063
<v SPEAKER_1>Cambridge Studio, and I think they shut that down.

00:34:06.603 --> 00:34:07.383
<v SPEAKER_1>I think they shut that down.

00:34:07.383 --> 00:34:10.263
<v SPEAKER_1>But like, it stopped existing in the same way.

00:34:10.263 --> 00:34:11.763
<v SPEAKER_1>Japan studio is gone as well.

00:34:11.763 --> 00:34:16.363
<v SPEAKER_1>So, yeah, it's not really the same climates.

00:34:16.363 --> 00:34:17.923
<v SPEAKER_1>They haven't really got the same expertise.

00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:25.323
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, I'm not saying they couldn't do it, but I just don't think they ever will do it, because they understand that it's like, you know, it's a big swing business.

00:34:25.323 --> 00:34:30.003
<v SPEAKER_1>And one of those big swings might be, you know, Spider-Man 2, and it sells really, really well.

00:34:30.003 --> 00:34:31.703
<v SPEAKER_1>And one of those big swings might be Concord.

00:34:31.703 --> 00:34:34.903
<v SPEAKER_1>But that is the market that they've decided to operate in.

00:34:35.103 --> 00:34:38.303
<v SPEAKER_1>So I think I get why they're doing it the way they are.

00:34:38.303 --> 00:34:38.923
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I'm kind of with you.

00:34:38.923 --> 00:34:41.663
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't really, I don't need another Sony handheld in my life.

00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:46.123
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't generally like, I'm not really dying for more handhelds generally anyway.

00:34:46.123 --> 00:34:48.043
<v SPEAKER_1>The Steam Deck is like on a nice trajectory.

00:34:48.043 --> 00:34:53.403
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm intrigued to see what the Switch 2 will be like, but obviously, and I will definitely buy one.

00:34:53.403 --> 00:35:02.343
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, I think otherwise, you have to look to something like Playdate for some more novel game design new stuff that's about the handheld form factor.

00:35:03.163 --> 00:35:05.223
<v SPEAKER_2>A Playdate draft when?

00:35:05.223 --> 00:35:06.923
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think I'm going to buy a Playdate still.

00:35:06.923 --> 00:35:11.103
<v SPEAKER_1>They still seem a little bit, it's like if it was like 120 quid pun, I might do it.

00:35:11.103 --> 00:35:15.283
<v SPEAKER_1>But I think when you look at the tax and stuff, isn't it more like 199 or something?

00:35:15.283 --> 00:35:16.683
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I can't say.

00:35:16.683 --> 00:35:18.863
<v SPEAKER_2>Catherine's is getting a lot of use.

00:35:18.863 --> 00:35:19.783
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh yeah, of course.

00:35:19.783 --> 00:35:21.023
<v SPEAKER_1>I forgot you even had one.

00:35:21.023 --> 00:35:22.503
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, that's it.

00:35:22.623 --> 00:35:26.163
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm just wary of the finite time I have left on this planet, Matthew.

00:35:26.223 --> 00:35:31.843
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, so time to get to some quick fire categories then, which will chart us through PlayStation history.

00:35:31.843 --> 00:35:37.403
<v SPEAKER_1>We basically have the first and third party game picks for each system here.

00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:39.203
<v SPEAKER_1>So me and Matthew are going to do both of them.

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:43.483
<v SPEAKER_1>So first of all, Matthew, what is your favorite PS1 first party game?

00:35:43.483 --> 00:35:49.783
<v SPEAKER_2>This is the hardest one to kick off with because it's the one I genuinely don't really have one for.

00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:54.543
<v SPEAKER_2>Maybe I was looking through lists and I was like, what the fuck could I say?

00:35:54.683 --> 00:35:56.703
<v SPEAKER_2>What can I even pretend that I like?

00:35:56.703 --> 00:36:05.583
<v SPEAKER_2>I wrote down, just because it's like a rhythm game, I wrote down Parappa the Rapper, but I can't sell that as one of my favorite games.

00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:08.643
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think that Parappa the Rapper is a good pick for you, Matthew.

00:36:08.643 --> 00:36:13.423
<v SPEAKER_1>And I think it's better to choose that than pretend that you think Crash Bandicoot is good, because obviously-

00:36:13.563 --> 00:36:14.483
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, that's the thing.

00:36:14.683 --> 00:36:16.223
<v SPEAKER_2>I couldn't really sell any of these things.

00:36:16.803 --> 00:36:26.023
<v SPEAKER_2>I was going to ask you whether you thought I was missing any kind of gems, or if there was a PS1 first party game that you thought I would have picked, but-

00:36:26.023 --> 00:36:26.503
<v SPEAKER_1>Not really.

00:36:26.503 --> 00:36:32.103
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, I would have said that I thought you would have just picked Siphon Fillers so you could tell that story about roasting the dude with the-

00:36:32.103 --> 00:36:34.623
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, we may have a category later.

00:36:36.883 --> 00:36:42.683
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Pirate of the Rapper, though, was a good example of what PlayStation 1 could do well, which is something highly specific.

00:36:42.683 --> 00:36:47.363
<v SPEAKER_1>It doesn't last very long, but it does delight you, and it is incredibly memorable.

00:36:47.363 --> 00:36:54.823
<v SPEAKER_1>And you would never buy a 50 or 60 pound N64 game version of Pirate of the Rapper.

00:36:54.823 --> 00:36:55.863
<v SPEAKER_1>It wouldn't make sense.

00:36:55.863 --> 00:37:01.923
<v SPEAKER_1>It would be such bad value, but makes perfect sense if you buy it for like 20 quid on PS1.

00:37:01.923 --> 00:37:14.283
<v SPEAKER_2>One of the worst things I've had to do at my job in recent years, when I was working on PlayStation Access, there was a stream where some people, if they lost, they were going to be punished.

00:37:14.283 --> 00:37:17.703
<v SPEAKER_2>And Rosie on the team is a huge Pirate of the Rapper fan.

00:37:18.263 --> 00:37:25.763
<v SPEAKER_2>And Ash asked me to record a rap as Pirate of the Rapper, like a diss track, like dissing Rosie.

00:37:25.763 --> 00:37:29.323
<v SPEAKER_2>And it's absolutely mortifying.

00:37:29.323 --> 00:37:32.623
<v SPEAKER_2>Like one of the worst fucking things I've ever done.

00:37:32.623 --> 00:37:36.163
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I had to write it in like half an hour and then perform it.

00:37:36.163 --> 00:37:41.183
<v SPEAKER_2>And if anyone can find it buried in a stream, like knock yourself out.

00:37:41.223 --> 00:37:45.323
<v SPEAKER_2>But just awful, like a horrible time at work.

00:37:45.323 --> 00:37:47.883
<v SPEAKER_1>Have you ever wondered why Matthew is so depressed in the last few years?

00:37:48.523 --> 00:37:50.883
<v SPEAKER_1>This is the kind of thing that I'm only joking.

00:37:50.883 --> 00:37:56.183
<v SPEAKER_2>It was a guy who basically didn't know what Pirate of the Rapper sounded like, trying to do a Pirate of the Rapper rap.

00:37:56.183 --> 00:38:00.863
<v SPEAKER_1>Thing is, here's the thing about Pirate of the Rapper, right, that people might not want to hear.

00:38:00.863 --> 00:38:04.843
<v SPEAKER_1>I think the timing is wrong on like when you press the button in time for the beats.

00:38:04.843 --> 00:38:12.703
<v SPEAKER_1>Like I remember like playing the demo, which is like a 20% of the game, because it's only like five levels in it or something.

00:38:14.483 --> 00:38:21.483
<v SPEAKER_1>When you're like pressing the specific buttons and how it rates what like in time with the music is, I just didn't really, I couldn't really pass it.

00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:23.483
<v SPEAKER_1>I felt like it was slightly wrong somehow.

00:38:23.483 --> 00:38:25.203
<v SPEAKER_1>That's my controversial Pirate of the Rapper take.

00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:38.483
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, I thought the Chop Master Onion was perfectly delightful, and yes, they were like absolute earworms, and the Rodney Greenblatt artwork absolutely like phenomenal, and yes, those are like PS1 ass kind of like experience.

00:38:38.483 --> 00:38:40.863
<v SPEAKER_1>That's a PS1 ass experience for sure.

00:38:40.863 --> 00:38:43.143
<v SPEAKER_1>It's fundamental to PlayStation.

00:38:43.143 --> 00:38:49.783
<v SPEAKER_1>But I also think it's like, I don't necessarily think it was anywhere near an all-timer kind of like rhythm action game really.

00:38:49.943 --> 00:38:52.403
<v SPEAKER_1>It was more like delighting me with color and character.

00:38:52.403 --> 00:38:54.603
<v SPEAKER_2>It's no Owen, Dan, that's for sure.

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:56.183
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, yes, exactly.

00:38:56.183 --> 00:38:58.063
<v SPEAKER_1>So that's my controversial Pirate of the Rapper take.

00:38:58.063 --> 00:39:02.743
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm going to pick the original Crash Bandicoot because I must have played the first three levels of this game.

00:39:03.643 --> 00:39:05.523
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, I probably liked more than a hundred times.

00:39:05.523 --> 00:39:06.623
<v SPEAKER_1>It was the ultimate.

00:39:06.623 --> 00:39:08.023
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm at someone's house.

00:39:08.023 --> 00:39:09.943
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm allowed to play their PS1 for a while.

00:39:09.943 --> 00:39:11.583
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm going to play Crash Bandicoot.

00:39:11.963 --> 00:39:14.463
<v SPEAKER_1>That's the game I liked the most, wanted to play the most.

00:39:14.463 --> 00:39:18.203
<v SPEAKER_1>It's not even the best one of the three, but just great.

00:39:18.203 --> 00:39:23.323
<v SPEAKER_1>Just running away from the boulder, near impossible fucking 3D platforming in that bit.

00:39:23.323 --> 00:39:24.463
<v SPEAKER_2>No death perception.

00:39:24.463 --> 00:39:26.983
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, you got to love it.

00:39:26.983 --> 00:39:28.963
<v SPEAKER_1>People love it.

00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:34.183
<v SPEAKER_1>I played the Insane Trilogy recently to give those levels a whirl.

00:39:34.183 --> 00:39:39.903
<v SPEAKER_1>Didn't have a good time, honestly, but I certainly did in the 90s because my standards were a lot lower.

00:39:39.903 --> 00:39:43.283
<v SPEAKER_1>After all, Matthew had been playing a lot of Sonic games at that time.

00:39:43.283 --> 00:39:46.183
<v SPEAKER_1>What is your favorite PS1 third party game?

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:48.523
<v SPEAKER_2>So basic bitch Metal Gear Solid.

00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:49.383
<v SPEAKER_1>Is it though?

00:39:49.383 --> 00:39:53.683
<v SPEAKER_1>Because what about the pipe sections when you're coming down that tower, Matthew?

00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:56.683
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, did you enjoy Final Fantasy VII more than that?

00:39:56.923 --> 00:40:07.263
<v SPEAKER_2>That did stink, but you've got to remember, I'm talking about, I didn't play this on PS1, so I'm absolutely kind of projecting this as I think this was good.

00:40:07.263 --> 00:40:11.063
<v SPEAKER_2>But actually playing that episode, it's so far ahead of its time.

00:40:11.063 --> 00:40:25.103
<v SPEAKER_2>The strength of its qualities, the weird storytelling, the voice acting, just the immaculate vibes of that strange base, how effective its cinematics is, were and still are, they still cut it.

00:40:25.103 --> 00:40:27.083
<v SPEAKER_2>I do think it is quite miraculous.

00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:31.503
<v SPEAKER_2>I probably wouldn't have said it if we hadn't replayed it so recently.

00:40:31.503 --> 00:40:35.603
<v SPEAKER_2>But it's kind of between that and Final Fantasy VII.

00:40:36.783 --> 00:40:37.923
<v SPEAKER_1>But I've been a bit of a dissident.

00:40:37.923 --> 00:40:40.703
<v SPEAKER_1>But those are like the best games on the system, that's the thing.

00:40:41.883 --> 00:40:43.483
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think there's any real ambiguity there.

00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:47.943
<v SPEAKER_1>They stand the test of time for a reason, and they were beloved at the time for a reason.

00:40:47.943 --> 00:40:49.983
<v SPEAKER_1>They're just really fucking good shit, man.

00:40:49.983 --> 00:40:51.603
<v SPEAKER_1>I think that's okay.

00:40:52.043 --> 00:40:53.843
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm definitely going down a heart pick route here.

00:40:53.843 --> 00:40:54.983
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

00:40:54.983 --> 00:41:04.303
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm going to take Final Fantasy VIII here, because I played this before VII, and I played it just after I played X on PS2.

00:41:04.303 --> 00:41:06.783
<v SPEAKER_1>I went and bought it from Game Station or something.

00:41:07.783 --> 00:41:12.363
<v SPEAKER_1>I just, so much of it seemed like the coolest shit of all time to me.

00:41:12.363 --> 00:41:21.083
<v SPEAKER_1>So my first touch point with it was there was a demo disc that just had the dollot beach landing bit of the game, where people remember this quite well.

00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:22.823
<v SPEAKER_1>You get chased by a big spider robot at the end.

00:41:22.863 --> 00:41:24.243
<v SPEAKER_1>Quite a long demo.

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:26.443
<v SPEAKER_1>That was my introduction to it.

00:41:26.443 --> 00:41:33.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I thought, wow, this game is so cinematic, the way that the cutscenes transition between the blockiest characters you've ever seen.

00:41:33.343 --> 00:41:35.263
<v SPEAKER_1>At the time, it must have seemed very real.

00:41:35.523 --> 00:41:40.903
<v SPEAKER_1>But even when I played it in 2002 or 2003, it was really impressive.

00:41:40.903 --> 00:41:47.583
<v SPEAKER_1>And I was a teenager, so I thought all of the female characters in the game were the hottest women I'd ever seen, Matthew.

00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:49.203
<v SPEAKER_1>And so that part of it was also very exciting to me.

00:41:49.203 --> 00:41:50.983
<v SPEAKER_2>Even made of weird little blocks.

00:41:51.383 --> 00:41:52.083
<v SPEAKER_1>Even that.

00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:54.063
<v SPEAKER_1>My imagination could fill in the gaps.

00:41:54.603 --> 00:41:59.283
<v SPEAKER_1>I had Tetsuya Nomura's artwork in the menu screen of like, Rinoa, Quistis, Selfie.

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:06.923
<v SPEAKER_1>And then it had like the blocky ass polygonal models running around the little towns and stuff.

00:42:06.923 --> 00:42:08.123
<v SPEAKER_1>That was enough material for me.

00:42:08.383 --> 00:42:09.723
<v SPEAKER_1>I was deeply into it.

00:42:09.723 --> 00:42:11.803
<v SPEAKER_1>And I thought that Squall was really cool.

00:42:11.803 --> 00:42:14.603
<v SPEAKER_1>These days, I don't think Squall is cool, just to be clear.

00:42:14.603 --> 00:42:17.283
<v SPEAKER_1>Had a gun that was also, a sword that was also a gun.

00:42:17.283 --> 00:42:19.003
<v SPEAKER_1>Coolest shit in the world to me.

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:21.603
<v SPEAKER_1>Fucking anime, like, war school thing.

00:42:21.603 --> 00:42:23.523
<v SPEAKER_1>All of that really appealed to me as well.

00:42:23.523 --> 00:42:25.463
<v SPEAKER_1>That was my first touch point with anything like that.

00:42:25.983 --> 00:42:31.123
<v SPEAKER_1>As an anime-deprived teenager growing up in the UK where there wasn't such things widely available.

00:42:31.163 --> 00:42:33.223
<v SPEAKER_1>FF8 was a huge deal for me.

00:42:33.223 --> 00:42:36.123
<v SPEAKER_1>And still like a personal favorite for a lot of people.

00:42:36.123 --> 00:42:38.303
<v SPEAKER_1>I imagine people have similar experiences to me.

00:42:38.303 --> 00:42:48.343
<v SPEAKER_1>Flawed in some ways, like, definitely its last disc is not, it doesn't end as strongly as FF7 does or FF10 does, but it definitely, yeah, it's definitely like a personal favorite.

00:42:48.343 --> 00:42:53.843
<v SPEAKER_1>It has some absolutely all-time pre-rendered backgrounds as well, just like the most beautiful places you've ever seen.

00:42:54.503 --> 00:42:56.363
<v SPEAKER_1>And still look amazing to this day.

00:42:56.363 --> 00:43:00.843
<v SPEAKER_1>PS2, Matthew, then, what's your favorite first-party PS2 game?

00:43:00.843 --> 00:43:02.103
<v SPEAKER_1>This had to have been easier, right?

00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:07.863
<v SPEAKER_2>If this was easier, it's still a bit of a struggle in terms of, you know, I don't have a huge connection.

00:43:07.863 --> 00:43:09.523
<v SPEAKER_3>Probably God of War 2?

00:43:09.523 --> 00:43:10.923
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that makes sense, yeah.

00:43:10.923 --> 00:43:18.203
<v SPEAKER_2>Just the crazy ambition of it, the mad aggression of it, what it was pulling off on that hardware at the time.

00:43:18.203 --> 00:43:45.603
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, the second one just really, really ran from it, from fighting that big statue boy right at the start, up to just some of those locations you go to later on, like there's that chariot being pulled in the sky, and the camera would just keep going back and back and back until you were just a tiny little dot, and the scale of the thing wasn't hugely invested in the story, but definitely one that I've kind of gone back to and still really enjoyed.

00:43:45.603 --> 00:43:49.723
<v SPEAKER_2>Quite easy to just like button mash through it and have a good time and just be blown away with it.

00:43:50.043 --> 00:43:59.443
<v SPEAKER_2>Again, kind of interested to hear what you've picked just on the grounds of a console I didn't own, so I'm curious who saw and who really went through it with PS2, what they would pick.

00:43:59.443 --> 00:44:02.183
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, it's definitely Shadow of the Colossus, without a doubt.

00:44:02.343 --> 00:44:14.543
<v SPEAKER_1>I suppose like the defining PS2 first party games would be, you know, Shadow of the Colossus, ICO, Gran Turismo 3, Gran Turismo 4, arguably things like SingStar as well.

00:44:14.543 --> 00:44:16.483
<v SPEAKER_1>That was a big deal.

00:44:16.483 --> 00:44:20.463
<v SPEAKER_1>The Getaway, of course, you know, like a bit ass on a replay.

00:44:20.483 --> 00:44:21.223
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, that was rotten.

00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:21.863
<v SPEAKER_1>It was rotten.

00:44:21.863 --> 00:44:23.163
<v SPEAKER_1>But, you know, it was certainly a thing that people...

00:44:23.163 --> 00:44:26.183
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm talking about defining PS2 exclusives, really.

00:44:26.183 --> 00:44:34.003
<v SPEAKER_1>And then, you know, for Americans who liked Army Men, Socom as well, and had Modems, that was up there.

00:44:34.003 --> 00:44:36.503
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, it's definitely Shadow of the Colossus out of this bunch.

00:44:36.503 --> 00:44:37.343
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, no problem.

00:44:37.343 --> 00:44:43.823
<v SPEAKER_1>That was a proper thing of like, I can't believe this system is capable of showing me what's going on on screen.

00:44:43.823 --> 00:44:45.603
<v SPEAKER_1>It's just absolutely unbelievable.

00:44:46.163 --> 00:44:53.463
<v SPEAKER_1>But I know you're a tiny bit cooler on Ueda stuff than most people are you, certainly of like critics of our generation.

00:44:53.463 --> 00:44:53.823
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:44:53.823 --> 00:44:58.983
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, Shadow of the Colossus is the one I think is good, is great even.

00:44:58.983 --> 00:45:00.223
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, the scale of the thing.

00:45:00.223 --> 00:45:02.583
<v SPEAKER_2>I just, I like what game there is a bit more.

00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:09.683
<v SPEAKER_2>I find the other ones a little bit kind of wishy-washy, or just sort of vague in their mechanics.

00:45:09.723 --> 00:45:17.443
<v SPEAKER_2>This one, I think, is, the nuts and bolts of it are better, and the scale of it, you know, it obviously is terrifying.

00:45:17.443 --> 00:45:27.103
<v SPEAKER_2>I still find there's something a little kind of distant about the whole thing, about his general vibe, that I'm just, for whatever reason, I can't quite lock into.

00:45:27.103 --> 00:45:27.423
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:45:27.623 --> 00:45:30.303
<v SPEAKER_2>I had written down Shadow of the Colossus and God of War II.

00:45:30.303 --> 00:45:37.163
<v SPEAKER_1>I think, like, the unknowable ethereal feel of his games is like, is what defines Ico in Shadow of the Colossus.

00:45:37.223 --> 00:45:40.683
<v SPEAKER_1>And then I think Last Guardian is a little less unknowable.

00:45:40.683 --> 00:45:42.763
<v SPEAKER_1>It's a little more straightforward what it is.

00:45:42.763 --> 00:45:45.463
<v SPEAKER_1>And then you either like it or you don't.

00:45:45.463 --> 00:45:45.743
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.783
<v SPEAKER_1>And those are the three games he's made so far.

00:45:47.783 --> 00:45:50.803
<v SPEAKER_1>And I forgot, he signed a deal with Epic Games, right?

00:45:50.803 --> 00:45:53.503
<v SPEAKER_1>He's, isn't, that's where his next game is being published.

00:45:53.503 --> 00:45:55.503
<v SPEAKER_1>And that was like five years ago.

00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:56.943
<v SPEAKER_1>We haven't heard anything about it.

00:45:57.243 --> 00:46:01.803
<v SPEAKER_2>He's probably just turning all the colossi into like skins for Fortnite.

00:46:01.803 --> 00:46:05.403
<v SPEAKER_1>He's a proper, like he is a proper auteur, isn't he?

00:46:05.403 --> 00:46:10.223
<v SPEAKER_1>He's like, he doesn't just get out of bed to knock out Shadow of the Colossus 2.

00:46:10.223 --> 00:46:14.223
<v SPEAKER_1>Like he's so, not that, he's so like a one of a kind kind of guy.

00:46:14.223 --> 00:46:16.303
<v SPEAKER_1>It's sort of like, it's his way of the highway, it feels like.

00:46:16.303 --> 00:46:19.123
<v SPEAKER_2>It is true, but I also, I do admire, you know.

00:46:19.123 --> 00:46:20.163
<v SPEAKER_1>People who get the job done.

00:46:20.283 --> 00:46:23.043
<v SPEAKER_3>Yes.

00:46:23.043 --> 00:46:23.963
<v SPEAKER_3>I know what you mean.

00:46:24.103 --> 00:46:25.563
<v SPEAKER_1>I just like people to make games.

00:46:25.563 --> 00:46:27.283
<v SPEAKER_2>I know it's really hard to make them.

00:46:27.283 --> 00:46:28.363
<v SPEAKER_2>I know it is.

00:46:28.363 --> 00:46:35.643
<v SPEAKER_2>And to anyone inside the industry, it's so frustrating to hear idiots like me being like, what did you just make more games?

00:46:35.643 --> 00:46:39.783
<v SPEAKER_2>But a little bit of me is like, Ueda, why don't you make more games?

00:46:39.783 --> 00:46:43.523
<v SPEAKER_2>Like the amount of time you spent on Last Guardian, I don't think was worth it for what it was.

00:46:43.523 --> 00:46:47.303
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, but that's because I think they were like at least a couple of years where he wasn't working on it.

00:46:47.303 --> 00:46:47.483
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

00:46:47.483 --> 00:46:49.583
<v SPEAKER_1>And they basically picked it up again and finished it.

00:46:50.003 --> 00:46:51.923
<v SPEAKER_1>I think that's what happened with Last Guardian.

00:46:52.863 --> 00:46:57.143
<v SPEAKER_1>I should probably read the profound waste of time I should have got this.

00:46:57.143 --> 00:46:58.683
<v SPEAKER_1>It was like, fucking come on, mate.

00:46:58.803 --> 00:47:03.303
<v SPEAKER_1>I do agree though that like that was now almost nine years ago or eight years ago.

00:47:03.303 --> 00:47:07.443
<v SPEAKER_1>So it's probably time for something new because it's just such a talent.

00:47:07.443 --> 00:47:09.103
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, yeah.

00:47:09.103 --> 00:47:09.503
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

00:47:09.503 --> 00:47:10.923
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, show the classes for me.

00:47:10.923 --> 00:47:13.463
<v SPEAKER_1>And then what did you pick again?

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:14.303
<v SPEAKER_2>God of War 2.

00:47:14.303 --> 00:47:14.623
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh yeah.

00:47:14.623 --> 00:47:14.883
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

00:47:14.883 --> 00:47:15.063
<v SPEAKER_1>Good.

00:47:15.063 --> 00:47:16.023
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, those are defining games.

00:47:16.023 --> 00:47:19.743
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, like they're boring, easy, good picks for me.

00:47:19.943 --> 00:47:27.023
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, again, but like the first party stuff doesn't really properly heat up in a super interesting way until you get to the next generation.

00:47:27.023 --> 00:47:30.943
<v SPEAKER_1>So what is your favorite PS2 third party game, Matthew?

00:47:30.943 --> 00:47:34.563
<v SPEAKER_2>Is it bad if I also pick Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater?

00:47:34.563 --> 00:47:35.103
<v SPEAKER_1>No, that's fine.

00:47:35.103 --> 00:47:37.723
<v SPEAKER_1>I thought you might pick like a Burnout or SSX Tricky or something.

00:47:37.723 --> 00:47:38.203
<v SPEAKER_2>No, I did.

00:47:38.203 --> 00:47:43.083
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, like I loved Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4.

00:47:43.083 --> 00:47:44.143
<v SPEAKER_2>I played on Gamecube.

00:47:44.143 --> 00:47:45.403
<v SPEAKER_2>It's not really a PlayStation thing.

00:47:45.403 --> 00:47:46.983
<v SPEAKER_2>I know it's the same game.

00:47:46.983 --> 00:47:49.323
<v SPEAKER_2>That is definitely up there just in terms of hours.

00:47:49.423 --> 00:47:58.963
<v SPEAKER_2>I put in to something, but I and again like Metal Gear Solid 3 just because we replayed it in the last couple of years.

00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:04.023
<v SPEAKER_2>I was just amazed at the ambition of it and the playfulness of it, how well it held up.

00:48:04.023 --> 00:48:09.643
<v SPEAKER_2>Just the chaos and cinematic sort of grandeur of that end stretch of it.

00:48:09.643 --> 00:48:11.623
<v SPEAKER_2>I just think is absolutely wild.

00:48:11.623 --> 00:48:16.123
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, a game I didn't necessarily like fully appreciate first time around.

00:48:16.123 --> 00:48:17.403
<v SPEAKER_2>I still think it really holds up.

00:48:17.503 --> 00:48:19.963
<v SPEAKER_2>But it is the last Metal Gear on this list.

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:23.063
<v SPEAKER_2>Don't worry, I'm not going to pick Metal Gear for every generation.

00:48:23.063 --> 00:48:24.903
<v SPEAKER_1>No, I think that's perfectly fine.

00:48:24.903 --> 00:48:29.043
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, mine obviously has to be Final Fantasy X.

00:48:29.043 --> 00:48:32.663
<v SPEAKER_1>But, you know, there's loads that be jostling for this spot.

00:48:32.663 --> 00:48:34.403
<v SPEAKER_1>You know, like MGS3 would be up there.

00:48:34.443 --> 00:48:37.003
<v SPEAKER_1>MGS2 would still be up there a little bit.

00:48:37.543 --> 00:48:42.243
<v SPEAKER_2>It's odd that MGS2 or Metacritic is higher than MGS3, isn't it?

00:48:42.243 --> 00:48:44.963
<v SPEAKER_1>That's because the critics reviewed MGS3.

00:48:44.963 --> 00:48:47.063
<v SPEAKER_1>They gave that the score they should have gave MGS2.

00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:48.983
<v SPEAKER_1>That's what I think that happened there.

00:48:48.983 --> 00:48:55.203
<v SPEAKER_1>And instead, they just all drunk on hype, gave it like 10s when it came out in 2001 or 2002.

00:48:55.203 --> 00:48:59.123
<v SPEAKER_1>And they were just not quite correct about that one, unfortunately.

00:48:59.623 --> 00:49:04.423
<v SPEAKER_1>But I wonder if that will change when Delta comes out next year.

00:49:04.423 --> 00:49:08.903
<v SPEAKER_1>Because I thought I wasn't quite up for playing that again so soon.

00:49:08.903 --> 00:49:12.063
<v SPEAKER_1>Then I watched the trailer again today for some random reason.

00:49:12.103 --> 00:49:13.943
<v SPEAKER_1>And then I was just like, oh, fuck.

00:49:13.943 --> 00:49:16.163
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm actually like, that looks so nice.

00:49:16.163 --> 00:49:21.323
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm actually kind of game to give that another go, despite the fact I've played this game to death.

00:49:21.323 --> 00:49:23.743
<v SPEAKER_1>So I do wonder if it will come out and people will be like, well, this is a 10.

00:49:23.743 --> 00:49:29.063
<v SPEAKER_1>But this was like, this is a great era of games and this is a great version of it, 10.

00:49:29.063 --> 00:49:31.103
<v SPEAKER_1>I wonder if that will happen.

00:49:31.103 --> 00:49:33.603
<v SPEAKER_1>I'd be pretty angry if someone gave MGS3 a 7.

00:49:33.603 --> 00:49:37.783
<v SPEAKER_1>If anyone who does that, if they don't have a good enough reason, I'm never reading that site again.

00:49:37.823 --> 00:49:40.063
<v SPEAKER_1>Just put that out into the universe right now, Matthew.

00:49:40.063 --> 00:49:41.303
<v SPEAKER_2>I do this all the time.

00:49:41.303 --> 00:49:46.143
<v SPEAKER_2>There's so many scores recently, which have put me into a rage.

00:49:46.143 --> 00:49:51.443
<v SPEAKER_2>Anyone who scored Lego Horizon more than a 5, is just basically dead to me.

00:49:52.803 --> 00:49:53.903
<v SPEAKER_1>That's really funny.

00:49:53.903 --> 00:49:55.403
<v SPEAKER_1>You know what?

00:49:55.403 --> 00:50:11.663
<v SPEAKER_1>I've been playing a bit of Vice City and the GTA Definitive Edition lately, and I've actually got a little bit more affection for that than I used to because first of all, the Definitive Edition patch they've given it, so it now has the revised lighting they did for the mobile versions.

00:50:11.663 --> 00:50:13.623
<v SPEAKER_1>That's a little bit more faithful to the PS2 original.

00:50:13.623 --> 00:50:20.663
<v SPEAKER_1>It's not quite as beautiful as looking at Vice City on a PS2 in 2002 and being like, wow, look how nice that sunset is.

00:50:20.663 --> 00:50:28.443
<v SPEAKER_1>It will never beat that memory, but it's pretty sharp and it's a lot more faithful, and it looks so picturesque at times.

00:50:28.663 --> 00:50:32.603
<v SPEAKER_1>This is such a fucking pocket open world.

00:50:32.603 --> 00:50:39.683
<v SPEAKER_1>This was made in one year, and now these games are just so monstrous, they take almost 10 years to make, and it's just so out of hand.

00:50:39.683 --> 00:50:42.323
<v SPEAKER_1>That just reminds you of what could be achieved with this canvas.

00:50:42.323 --> 00:50:48.763
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Vice City is still really impressive, and obviously the music and the way it captures the 80s is very evocative.

00:50:48.763 --> 00:50:51.343
<v SPEAKER_1>So that's climbing up for me.

00:50:52.323 --> 00:50:56.743
<v SPEAKER_1>I get why people dig Vice City more than GTA 3 increasingly these days.

00:50:56.743 --> 00:50:58.923
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, Final Fantasy X still reigns, Matthew.

00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:01.603
<v SPEAKER_1>So what is your favorite PSP first pie game?

00:51:02.683 --> 00:51:06.943
<v SPEAKER_3>Ah, LocoRoco, I guess.

00:51:06.943 --> 00:51:09.223
<v SPEAKER_1>I thought you might have picked one of the two God of Wars for this.

00:51:09.723 --> 00:51:11.723
<v SPEAKER_1>Those are good muscular action games.

00:51:11.723 --> 00:51:12.443
<v SPEAKER_3>Yeah.

00:51:12.443 --> 00:51:13.663
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, maybe I should have picked that.

00:51:13.663 --> 00:51:15.703
<v SPEAKER_1>Or Daxter, your beloved Daxter, of course.

00:51:15.703 --> 00:51:17.443
<v SPEAKER_2>No, it's definitely not Daxter.

00:51:17.443 --> 00:51:21.003
<v SPEAKER_2>That one, it was like, more for all you burglars.

00:51:22.163 --> 00:51:23.003
<v SPEAKER_2>Enjoy that.

00:51:23.003 --> 00:51:27.823
<v SPEAKER_2>They're like, oh no, we've stolen something cursed and awful.

00:51:27.823 --> 00:51:34.463
<v SPEAKER_2>It's a bit like when Rosamund Pike kidnaps that mobster's grandma in that film about old people.

00:51:34.463 --> 00:51:35.863
<v SPEAKER_2>She really regrets it.

00:51:35.863 --> 00:51:37.603
<v SPEAKER_2>She stole the wrong grandma.

00:51:37.603 --> 00:51:39.243
<v SPEAKER_2>It's like, you stole the wrong game.

00:51:39.243 --> 00:51:40.523
<v SPEAKER_2>It's Daxter.

00:51:40.523 --> 00:51:41.903
<v SPEAKER_1>What a specific reference.

00:51:41.903 --> 00:51:43.603
<v SPEAKER_1>Is that I care a lot you were affecting there?

00:51:45.623 --> 00:51:49.683
<v SPEAKER_1>The film that you got upset people disagreed with you about on social media, if I recall correctly.

00:51:49.683 --> 00:51:50.743
<v SPEAKER_2>Hey, I liked it.

00:51:50.743 --> 00:51:52.483
<v SPEAKER_2>And I'll tell you who else likes it.

00:51:52.483 --> 00:51:54.763
<v SPEAKER_2>Ralph Fulton at Playground Games.

00:51:54.763 --> 00:51:58.523
<v SPEAKER_2>He likes that film and he strikes me as a man of taste.

00:51:58.523 --> 00:52:01.703
<v SPEAKER_1>It was a good three star watch at a time where there were no new films coming out.

00:52:01.703 --> 00:52:04.423
<v SPEAKER_1>You know, it wasn't it wasn't too bad.

00:52:04.423 --> 00:52:04.963
<v SPEAKER_2>That was good.

00:52:04.963 --> 00:52:06.183
<v SPEAKER_1>That's such a funny reference.

00:52:06.183 --> 00:52:08.583
<v SPEAKER_2>Anyway, Daxter's that.

00:52:08.583 --> 00:52:09.763
<v SPEAKER_1>Daxter is the I care a lot.

00:52:10.663 --> 00:52:15.423
<v SPEAKER_2>Can I take back LocoRoco and swap it for which is the good one?

00:52:15.423 --> 00:52:16.603
<v SPEAKER_2>They're both pretty good aren't they?

00:52:16.603 --> 00:52:18.203
<v SPEAKER_2>The PSP God of Wars.

00:52:18.203 --> 00:52:22.543
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Chains of Olympus is slightly better, but the other one's a bit longer.

00:52:22.543 --> 00:52:25.663
<v SPEAKER_1>And I think is some people seem to like it more.

00:52:25.663 --> 00:52:26.423
<v SPEAKER_1>I thought it was worse.

00:52:26.903 --> 00:52:34.183
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, it was a real feat squeezing it down, which is the one with the quick time event to push your daughter away at the end.

00:52:34.183 --> 00:52:35.443
<v SPEAKER_1>That's Chains of Olympus.

00:52:35.443 --> 00:52:41.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I love that you have re-learned that information and forgotten it at least three times while we've been making this podcast.

00:52:41.343 --> 00:52:42.703
<v SPEAKER_1>That's incredible.

00:52:42.703 --> 00:52:43.423
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, you know what?

00:52:43.423 --> 00:52:44.323
<v SPEAKER_2>Fuck LocoRoco.

00:52:44.323 --> 00:52:46.583
<v SPEAKER_2>Let's take Handheld God of War.

00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:47.263
<v SPEAKER_2>That's good.

00:52:47.263 --> 00:52:52.743
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think it's Chains of Olympus for me probably, because that was really good on a replay.

00:52:52.903 --> 00:53:00.123
<v SPEAKER_1>And that was a true example of achieving the goal of translating a home console game to a handheld.

00:53:00.663 --> 00:53:04.183
<v SPEAKER_1>It felt like they'd done that, but it still made sense to the PSP.

00:53:04.183 --> 00:53:10.163
<v SPEAKER_1>At the same time, I do want to celebrate the alternating ingenuity of the Patapon and LocoRoco games.

00:53:10.163 --> 00:53:14.583
<v SPEAKER_1>Those are just really cool, visually distinct, perfect for the system games to make.

00:53:14.583 --> 00:53:15.103
<v SPEAKER_2>Yes.

00:53:15.103 --> 00:53:16.643
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, there's nothing wrong with LocoRoco.

00:53:16.643 --> 00:53:18.403
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm not going to let Matthew stop on that.

00:53:18.623 --> 00:53:19.403
<v SPEAKER_2>It's fine.

00:53:19.403 --> 00:53:20.503
<v SPEAKER_2>I wrote it down.

00:53:20.503 --> 00:53:22.703
<v SPEAKER_2>It is a game I owned and played.

00:53:22.703 --> 00:53:30.103
<v SPEAKER_2>It's quite like the excellent water physics tilty game HydroVenture that I quite like on Wii and 3DS.

00:53:30.103 --> 00:53:30.643
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, right.

00:53:30.643 --> 00:53:34.363
<v SPEAKER_1>Did they borrow the LocoRoco mechanics for that, do you reckon?

00:53:34.363 --> 00:53:35.803
<v SPEAKER_2>LocoRoco definitely came first.

00:53:35.803 --> 00:53:43.963
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, it had that energy of you're tilting the level and it's like rolling around, and the way it splits up into the smaller ones to fit through cracks and things.

00:53:45.303 --> 00:53:50.023
<v SPEAKER_2>That's very, yeah, I would say HydroVenture is LocoRoco-coded.

00:53:52.183 --> 00:53:52.583
<v SPEAKER_1>Great.

00:53:52.583 --> 00:53:54.103
<v SPEAKER_1>Very evocative.

00:53:54.103 --> 00:53:55.123
<v SPEAKER_1>Understood.

00:53:55.123 --> 00:53:59.083
<v SPEAKER_1>Wipeout Games is pretty good on PSP as well, and by now Matthew feels about those.

00:53:59.103 --> 00:54:03.123
<v SPEAKER_1>So, what is your favourite PSP third party game, Matthew?

00:54:03.423 --> 00:54:06.483
<v SPEAKER_2>I slightly struggle on this just because I didn't have many.

00:54:06.483 --> 00:54:07.903
<v SPEAKER_2>I've put down Luminis.

00:54:07.903 --> 00:54:09.123
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's a good choice.

00:54:09.123 --> 00:54:10.163
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that holds up.

00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:15.823
<v SPEAKER_2>There are some journos who are proper Luminis heads, are really good at it and have written great pieces about it.

00:54:15.823 --> 00:54:37.663
<v SPEAKER_2>I've never written one word about this game, but as addictive little puzzlers go that get livelier through sound and visuals, as your score increases, which is the whole kind of Mitsugishi thing, you know, Luminis is, it's not Tetris Effect good, but it's in the kind of top 10 of those kind of puzzle games, I guess.

00:54:37.663 --> 00:54:39.923
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, and it's nice to have on Switch these days as well.

00:54:40.063 --> 00:54:51.383
<v SPEAKER_1>Like that's still a great portable experience, just to, sometimes when I'm getting my bleak 6am train in the morning to London, it's a bit of a like jolt in the arm of, you know what, I just need a bit of musical delight.

00:54:51.383 --> 00:54:53.463
<v SPEAKER_1>So I'm going to turn that on.

00:54:53.463 --> 00:55:07.963
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think for me, it's sort of like, in terms of blowing me away and what the system can do, I should probably pick Liberty City Stories, the GTA game, and indeed Vice City Stories and the Port of Chinatown Wars, all pretty good on this system.

00:55:07.963 --> 00:55:11.003
<v SPEAKER_1>But it's got to be my beloved, Crisis Corps Final Fantasy VII.

00:55:11.003 --> 00:55:13.023
<v SPEAKER_1>I know a lot of people would pick Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.

00:55:13.023 --> 00:55:15.903
<v SPEAKER_1>Unfortunately, that's a game I still don't really have a relationship with.

00:55:15.903 --> 00:55:17.043
<v SPEAKER_1>Unfortunate.

00:55:17.043 --> 00:55:22.083
<v SPEAKER_1>Most of the rest of them, I think I probably either picked or they came up during the PSP Draft episode.

00:55:22.083 --> 00:55:24.683
<v SPEAKER_1>But I would say the Dissidia games on PSP were really good.

00:55:24.683 --> 00:55:34.403
<v SPEAKER_1>The Final Fantasy beat-em-ups that were sort of like third-person, kind of like action combat beat-em-ups.

00:55:34.403 --> 00:55:36.563
<v SPEAKER_1>They weren't quite sort of like playing Tekken or something.

00:55:36.823 --> 00:55:37.743
<v SPEAKER_1>They were really something like...

00:55:37.743 --> 00:55:38.963
<v SPEAKER_2>Like Power Stone-y?

00:55:39.003 --> 00:55:39.403
<v SPEAKER_1>You know what?

00:55:39.543 --> 00:55:40.863
<v SPEAKER_1>They were not far off of that.

00:55:40.863 --> 00:55:43.243
<v SPEAKER_1>They had a little bit, they had like an environmental factor to them.

00:55:43.243 --> 00:55:45.663
<v SPEAKER_1>They had like items you could go and fetch and stuff like that.

00:55:46.083 --> 00:55:47.663
<v SPEAKER_1>They were a little bit Power Stone-y, yeah.

00:55:47.663 --> 00:55:53.643
<v SPEAKER_1>But without the kind of like, why the fuck is anything happening element of Power Stone that you and I were so perplexed by.

00:55:53.643 --> 00:55:55.403
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, sideburn Power Stone.

00:55:55.683 --> 00:55:59.483
<v SPEAKER_1>What was the thing that you kept doing to me when we played Power Stone?

00:55:59.483 --> 00:56:01.503
<v SPEAKER_1>Were you chucking boxes at me or something?

00:56:01.503 --> 00:56:03.503
<v SPEAKER_1>What was that thing you kept doing over and over again?

00:56:03.503 --> 00:56:03.943
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I was definitely-

00:56:03.943 --> 00:56:06.043
<v SPEAKER_1>And you were laughing hysterically as I got angry.

00:56:06.043 --> 00:56:15.843
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I thought I had some kind of cannon weapon that if I timed it just right, like the second you stood up, you lost your sort of vulnerability and then you just straight back down again.

00:56:15.843 --> 00:56:17.703
<v SPEAKER_2>So you just couldn't stand up.

00:56:17.703 --> 00:56:20.323
<v SPEAKER_1>Can we say that's a good game when that's in the game?

00:56:20.383 --> 00:56:21.603
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, really?

00:56:21.603 --> 00:56:22.563
<v SPEAKER_1>Can we really say that?

00:56:22.563 --> 00:56:24.883
<v SPEAKER_2>It's good when you're doing it to someone else.

00:56:24.883 --> 00:56:27.503
<v SPEAKER_2>That game's like a 10 when you fuck with someone else.

00:56:27.503 --> 00:56:33.903
<v SPEAKER_2>But if anyone fucks with you, which they often will, it just feels like a 3 or something.

00:56:33.903 --> 00:56:34.983
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

00:56:34.983 --> 00:56:37.123
<v SPEAKER_1>And yeah, but for the grace of God, go on.

00:56:37.283 --> 00:56:39.563
<v SPEAKER_2>Yes, let's split the difference and call it a 6.

00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:41.263
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, exactly.

00:56:41.263 --> 00:56:45.103
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, so PSP had a bunch of good third party games.

00:56:45.143 --> 00:56:49.383
<v SPEAKER_1>So like Shimbugami Tensei, those games started to take off on PSP over here.

00:56:49.383 --> 00:56:50.243
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't know if it counts.

00:56:50.243 --> 00:56:54.923
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it counts as first party actually, but I think I mentioned John D'Arc on the PSP draft.

00:56:54.923 --> 00:56:56.523
<v SPEAKER_1>And now you can actually play that on PS5.

00:56:56.523 --> 00:56:58.923
<v SPEAKER_1>They've actually released that over here for the first time.

00:56:58.923 --> 00:57:04.103
<v SPEAKER_1>But it's almost like wasted to play a PSP game on your TV, on a PS5.

00:57:04.103 --> 00:57:06.223
<v SPEAKER_1>That's not really where it's supposed to be experienced.

00:57:06.223 --> 00:57:11.203
<v SPEAKER_2>That's so not a big, like, sellable point to me when they're actually in PS Plus.

00:57:11.203 --> 00:57:18.183
<v SPEAKER_2>If you see games are PSP games, you're always, every month you're like, oh, is it going to be one of the biggies?

00:57:18.183 --> 00:57:21.123
<v SPEAKER_2>And it's, oh, it's a PSP Ratchet and Clank game.

00:57:21.123 --> 00:57:23.683
<v SPEAKER_2>And you're like, oh, fuck that.

00:57:23.683 --> 00:57:25.903
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like we've got Secret Agent Clank Backlands.

00:57:25.923 --> 00:57:29.183
<v SPEAKER_1>And you're like, I'm out, I'm out.

00:57:29.183 --> 00:57:30.323
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

00:57:30.323 --> 00:57:32.423
<v SPEAKER_1>What is your favorite PS3 first party game?

00:57:32.423 --> 00:57:33.523
<v SPEAKER_1>Now we're cooking, Matthew.

00:57:33.523 --> 00:57:35.003
<v SPEAKER_2>Uncharted 2.

00:57:35.003 --> 00:57:35.983
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's mine as well.

00:57:36.363 --> 00:57:39.283
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like, you know, it was the peak, isn't it?

00:57:39.723 --> 00:57:41.683
<v SPEAKER_1>To go back to is not the peak necessarily.

00:57:41.683 --> 00:57:44.063
<v SPEAKER_1>It's actually a little bit frustrating Uncharted 2 in places.

00:57:44.063 --> 00:57:53.323
<v SPEAKER_1>But I don't know, when it's the first half of the game, before you get to the sort of like Tibet section, it's just really fucking popping off, isn't it?

00:57:53.323 --> 00:58:00.063
<v SPEAKER_1>It's some of the best action, action game pacing of all time, great writing, great acting, just so much to enjoy.

00:58:00.063 --> 00:58:01.323
<v SPEAKER_1>So much fun.

00:58:01.323 --> 00:58:19.463
<v SPEAKER_2>It doesn't happen anymore, I guess, because we don't hang out with people in person, but there were so many bits where people in the office were like, come and take a look at this, because obviously I didn't have a PS3 at the time, but I remember someone showing me the train level, like, this is the coolest shit, this is going to blow your mind, and I was just like, oh, that does look really good.

00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:22.223
<v SPEAKER_2>So I asked for one for Christmas and got one for Christmas.

00:58:22.223 --> 00:58:22.883
<v SPEAKER_1>Finally happened.

00:58:22.883 --> 00:58:31.843
<v SPEAKER_1>That's when Matthew's heart was melted by the PlayStation, just watching something that the Wii could never achieve on the inspiring stuff.

00:58:31.843 --> 00:58:34.183
<v SPEAKER_1>I've got to say, these days, though, God of War 3 is up there.

00:58:34.503 --> 00:58:41.203
<v SPEAKER_1>I did think about saying that instead, because I've played that recently and I know it bangs still, you know?

00:58:41.203 --> 00:58:43.523
<v SPEAKER_1>And it's a better paced game than Uncharted 2.

00:58:43.523 --> 00:58:46.583
<v SPEAKER_1>It's probably better to play now, relatively speaking.

00:58:46.583 --> 00:58:51.563
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, well, playing the shiny, remastered, like, 60 frames version on PS4 is like a delight.

00:58:51.563 --> 00:58:52.363
<v SPEAKER_1>It is, yeah.

00:58:52.363 --> 00:58:55.703
<v SPEAKER_1>But that's also true for Uncharted 2 as well.

00:58:55.743 --> 00:58:59.383
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, yeah, so plenty of good competition there.

00:58:59.383 --> 00:59:02.563
<v SPEAKER_1>So what's your favorite PS3 third party game, Matthew?

00:59:02.563 --> 00:59:04.263
<v SPEAKER_3>Grand Theft Auto V.

00:59:04.263 --> 00:59:10.083
<v SPEAKER_1>I put Grand Theft Auto IV, partly because I didn't play any third party games on PS3.

00:59:10.083 --> 00:59:14.463
<v SPEAKER_1>I was like, fuck this, it's time to get the 360 version about everything.

00:59:14.463 --> 00:59:20.403
<v SPEAKER_1>But GTA IV was the exception because when they sent copies to our office, PS3 was the only one that was spared.

00:59:21.363 --> 00:59:24.083
<v SPEAKER_1>So I was like, well, OK, I'll play GTA IV on this.

00:59:24.083 --> 00:59:30.403
<v SPEAKER_1>And then slowly just started buying all the games that I had on PS3 on to 360, where they had superior versions.

00:59:30.403 --> 00:59:35.123
<v SPEAKER_1>And I just felt more reassured seeing the green box on my shelf rather than those little Blu-ray boxes.

00:59:35.123 --> 00:59:36.643
<v SPEAKER_1>Pathetic behaviour.

00:59:37.023 --> 00:59:41.143
<v SPEAKER_2>I definitely played Grand Theft Auto V on PS3.

00:59:41.143 --> 00:59:42.963
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, it ran well on there.

00:59:42.963 --> 00:59:43.183
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:59:43.183 --> 00:59:45.343
<v SPEAKER_1>It was sort of like, I think it was 50-50.

00:59:45.343 --> 00:59:46.923
<v SPEAKER_1>I think they're pretty much the same, to be honest.

00:59:46.923 --> 00:59:49.643
<v SPEAKER_2>I think I did whatever Digital Foundry told me to do.

00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:56.183
<v SPEAKER_1>The only place you can get objective truth in video games, Matthew, is Digital Foundry.

00:59:56.723 --> 00:59:59.043
<v SPEAKER_3>Tell me what I think, Digital Foundry!

00:59:59.043 --> 01:00:00.503
<v SPEAKER_3>Tell me what I think!

01:00:00.523 --> 01:00:03.023
<v SPEAKER_1>Everything else is terrible subjectivity.

01:00:03.023 --> 01:00:04.003
<v SPEAKER_1>What can you do with that?

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:04.583
<v SPEAKER_1>Nothing at all.

01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:06.043
<v SPEAKER_2>I can't trust my own eyes!

01:00:06.043 --> 01:00:08.683
<v SPEAKER_3>Tell me is the grass better on PS5 Pro?

01:00:08.683 --> 01:00:09.403
<v SPEAKER_3>Please!

01:00:09.403 --> 01:00:10.563
<v SPEAKER_1>That is my serious theory.

01:00:11.003 --> 01:00:13.163
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Digital Foundry do amazing work, for sure.

01:00:13.483 --> 01:00:24.723
<v SPEAKER_1>I think the reason that they are so beloved is because gamers are so angry by the idea of subjective opinions on the internet, that they are desperate for anything that is just objective and numbers based.

01:00:24.723 --> 01:00:31.803
<v SPEAKER_1>And so when people have written down, like this is what the data actually says and does, I think people are like, fuck, yes, it's all I wanted!

01:00:31.803 --> 01:00:33.983
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't want someone giving my favorite game a 7.

01:00:33.983 --> 01:00:37.823
<v SPEAKER_1>Honestly, I think that's what people, part of the appeal of it, for sure.

01:00:37.823 --> 01:00:44.423
<v SPEAKER_2>I do like it though when a little bit of subjectivity slips in and one of them has opinion which is different to the main Eurogamer review.

01:00:44.423 --> 01:00:48.543
<v SPEAKER_2>I know Digital Foundry aren't Eurogamer, but if you're a gamer, it's like, this is shit.

01:00:48.543 --> 01:00:50.803
<v SPEAKER_2>And then John Lenneman is like, oh, it looks amazing.

01:00:50.803 --> 01:00:52.643
<v SPEAKER_2>And also I think it's really good.

01:00:52.643 --> 01:00:54.303
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm always like, ooh, beef.

01:00:54.303 --> 01:00:55.383
<v SPEAKER_1>You smuggled it in.

01:00:55.383 --> 01:00:55.843
<v SPEAKER_1>It's good.

01:00:55.843 --> 01:01:00.603
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like you were talking about sort of like LOD and sort of like sliders, but then you're like, you know what?

01:01:00.603 --> 01:01:02.983
<v SPEAKER_1>I think this level is pretty good or whatever.

01:01:02.983 --> 01:01:04.123
<v SPEAKER_1>And you're like, nicely done.

01:01:04.123 --> 01:01:04.823
<v SPEAKER_1>Smuggled it.

01:01:05.283 --> 01:01:05.883
<v SPEAKER_1>Yes.

01:01:05.883 --> 01:01:06.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I agree.

01:01:06.343 --> 01:01:07.983
<v SPEAKER_1>It feels transgressive somehow.

01:01:07.983 --> 01:01:09.623
<v SPEAKER_1>Thrilling, some might say.

01:01:09.683 --> 01:01:11.043
<v SPEAKER_1>OK, so I got GTA IV here.

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:19.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, I did like the way GTA IV looked on PS3 with its lower resolution and slightly nicer sunsets, for whatever reason, than the 360 version.

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:22.663
<v SPEAKER_1>But otherwise, third party games on PS3?

01:01:22.663 --> 01:01:23.643
<v SPEAKER_1>Nah.

01:01:23.643 --> 01:01:26.103
<v SPEAKER_1>What is your favorite PS Vita first party game, Matthew?

01:01:26.103 --> 01:01:27.363
<v SPEAKER_2>It's Tearaway.

01:01:27.363 --> 01:01:28.223
<v SPEAKER_1>Likewise.

01:01:28.223 --> 01:01:28.843
<v SPEAKER_1>High five.

01:01:28.843 --> 01:01:29.743
<v SPEAKER_2>There we go.

01:01:29.743 --> 01:01:30.423
<v SPEAKER_1>Had to be, right?

01:01:30.423 --> 01:01:33.643
<v SPEAKER_1>There was, it can't be the worst Uncharted.

01:01:33.643 --> 01:01:35.703
<v SPEAKER_1>And it was never going to be Wipeout from you.

01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:39.763
<v SPEAKER_2>If only Uncharted had a lot more metal rubbing sections.

01:01:39.883 --> 01:01:40.983
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, God.

01:01:40.983 --> 01:01:44.163
<v SPEAKER_2>I wish I could do more stencil work in this Uncharted game.

01:01:44.163 --> 01:01:47.803
<v SPEAKER_1>And a very vague Joe Pesci-esque sidekick who's not Sully.

01:01:47.803 --> 01:01:51.843
<v SPEAKER_1>And like, a little bit whiff of Lidl about him, you know?

01:01:51.843 --> 01:01:56.783
<v SPEAKER_1>Just sort of a bit of a Aldi's own brand Uncharted companion.

01:01:56.783 --> 01:01:59.183
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like, we've got Sully at home vibes.

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:03.683
<v SPEAKER_1>So what is your favorite PS Vita third party game, Matthew?

01:02:04.343 --> 01:02:06.063
<v SPEAKER_2>It's Persona 4 Golden.

01:02:06.063 --> 01:02:06.963
<v SPEAKER_1>Of course, it has to be.

01:02:06.963 --> 01:02:08.583
<v SPEAKER_1>That's the goat, isn't it?

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.243
<v SPEAKER_1>That's the hall of famer.

01:02:10.243 --> 01:02:13.223
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, that's probably the reason I got a...

01:02:13.223 --> 01:02:14.463
<v SPEAKER_2>Actually, no, that's a lie.

01:02:14.683 --> 01:02:16.843
<v SPEAKER_2>I was about to say it's probably the reason I got a PS Vita.

01:02:16.843 --> 01:02:20.563
<v SPEAKER_2>I got a PS Vita at launch because I'm an idiot and thought I could get Freelance out of it.

01:02:20.563 --> 01:02:22.443
<v SPEAKER_2>But Persona 4 Golden was...

01:02:22.643 --> 01:02:26.543
<v SPEAKER_2>If you were, you know, any site telling you that this is the game, this is the game.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:38.083
<v SPEAKER_1>I'd love for Sony to release the data of how many weeks was Persona 4 Golden at the top of the best-selling games on the PS Vita store, like, globally.

01:02:38.083 --> 01:02:41.863
<v SPEAKER_1>I bet it was like, I bet that's like a world record that no one's uncovered.

01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:46.763
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like, yeah, it was the number one best-selling game on PS Vita for like seven years.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.563
<v SPEAKER_1>I bet that is like data they have somewhere.

01:02:48.563 --> 01:02:51.003
<v SPEAKER_1>So, yeah.

01:02:51.003 --> 01:02:54.303
<v SPEAKER_2>So I also wrote down Danganronpa, Trigger Happy Havoc.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:56.123
<v SPEAKER_2>That's the first Danganronpa.

01:02:56.123 --> 01:02:58.603
<v SPEAKER_2>It's not as good as Persona 4 Golden, definitely.

01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:14.263
<v SPEAKER_2>But for any game to kind of enter the Ace Attorney space and to do it as well as it did and hold up, you know, positive comparison to that game, which obviously means, you know, so much to me, I think is a sign that it's doing something right.

01:03:14.263 --> 01:03:22.083
<v SPEAKER_2>If not for some of its abrasive anime framing, Danganronpa is almost as good a game as Ace Attorney in lots of ways.

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:24.863
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think I'll say that's a good choice.

01:03:24.863 --> 01:03:26.083
<v SPEAKER_1>Very good to bring that up, Matthew.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.443
<v SPEAKER_1>I was going to predictably say Hotline Miami for this.

01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:33.983
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like the king of PS Vita third-party games to a large extent.

01:03:33.983 --> 01:03:47.683
<v SPEAKER_1>The funny thing is, Persona 4 Golden, I think the reason that is so revered, on PSP, it feels like there's about ten different Persona 4 Goldens on PSP, or maybe even more, because there were so many good RPGs on that system.

01:03:47.683 --> 01:03:52.283
<v SPEAKER_1>But PS Vita is so poorly supported, that Persona 4 Golden really stands alone.

01:03:52.283 --> 01:03:59.463
<v SPEAKER_1>So picking third-party games is not quite as rich on PS Vita, I would say, despite the big indie swell.

01:03:59.463 --> 01:04:05.363
<v SPEAKER_1>So it's Hotline Miami, but I did also want to shout out Lone Survivor, which is a game I really liked on PS Vita.

01:04:05.363 --> 01:04:08.263
<v SPEAKER_1>That is like an old horror game.

01:04:08.263 --> 01:04:13.743
<v SPEAKER_1>It's by the developer Jasper Byrne, and it's a little bit Silent Hill-ish, a little bit Lynchian.

01:04:13.743 --> 01:04:18.863
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like a pixel art game where you're going through this big spooky apartment block.

01:04:19.043 --> 01:04:20.683
<v SPEAKER_1>I thought that was just really, really cool.

01:04:21.143 --> 01:04:22.763
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Jasper Byrne stood out there doing stuff.

01:04:23.303 --> 01:04:25.743
<v SPEAKER_1>He was also a musician, as well as a game developer.

01:04:25.743 --> 01:04:27.123
<v SPEAKER_1>So I wanted to shout that out.

01:04:27.123 --> 01:04:29.423
<v SPEAKER_1>A little bit of a forgotten game there.

01:04:29.423 --> 01:04:30.303
<v SPEAKER_1>So, yes.

01:04:30.303 --> 01:04:32.743
<v SPEAKER_1>What is your favorite PS4 first party game, Matthew?

01:04:33.163 --> 01:04:36.623
<v SPEAKER_2>I was quite torn between Uncharted 4 and God of War.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:37.063
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

01:04:37.063 --> 01:04:37.683
<v SPEAKER_1>Interesting.

01:04:37.683 --> 01:04:39.203
<v SPEAKER_1>Not Last of Us Part II.

01:04:39.203 --> 01:04:40.663
<v SPEAKER_1>That's your first draft pick.

01:04:40.663 --> 01:04:40.963
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:46.603
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, that's the one I thought other people would like the most, rather than necessarily the one that I would like the most.

01:04:46.903 --> 01:04:51.783
<v SPEAKER_2>I have definitely reappraised Last of Us Part II, and think it's pretty spectacular.

01:04:53.463 --> 01:05:06.643
<v SPEAKER_2>I just think the thing with God of War is I loved how it did translate one experience into something very different and how much of it they landed it in terms of the characterisation and the relationship between the two of them.

01:05:06.643 --> 01:05:19.363
<v SPEAKER_2>I just sort of felt like even though it's an over the shoulder third person character action game, like a lot of PlayStation games and indeed other games, I felt like I hadn't quite seen anything like it, what they were trying to do.

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:25.823
<v SPEAKER_2>The combat was quite fierce and interesting, like that over the shoulder melee combat, that's a bit different.

01:05:25.823 --> 01:05:27.883
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I was pretty stoked we got a war for it.

01:05:28.223 --> 01:05:32.943
<v SPEAKER_2>I was just really excited to see how they were going to pull it off and I think they largely delivered.

01:05:32.943 --> 01:05:33.903
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, nicely done.

01:05:33.903 --> 01:05:37.983
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it has to be either Last of Us Part II or Uncharted 4 for me.

01:05:37.983 --> 01:05:40.723
<v SPEAKER_1>If pushed, I'd probably say Uncharted 4 is the heart's pick.

01:05:40.723 --> 01:05:46.603
<v SPEAKER_1>If pushed further, I would say that objectively, The Last of Us Part II is the best Naughty Dog game ever made.

01:05:46.603 --> 01:05:48.723
<v SPEAKER_1>It just gets everything right gameplay wise.

01:05:50.123 --> 01:05:55.523
<v SPEAKER_1>However, you feel about the story, it's just so much bolder than the original Last of Us to me.

01:05:55.763 --> 01:06:00.743
<v SPEAKER_1>The original Last of Us has got a couple of interesting naughty morality things going on.

01:06:00.743 --> 01:06:05.743
<v SPEAKER_1>Last of Us Part II takes proper risks and ask quite a lot from you as a player.

01:06:06.783 --> 01:06:10.823
<v SPEAKER_1>I think that is great and it's a great stealth game and a great shooter at the same time.

01:06:10.823 --> 01:06:12.463
<v SPEAKER_1>It does both really well.

01:06:12.463 --> 01:06:20.003
<v SPEAKER_1>Historically, Naughty Dog games were not always amazing at the gameplay mechanics side of it, not as great as that as the actual storytelling.

01:06:20.003 --> 01:06:30.043
<v SPEAKER_1>So I think both games, in both games' case, the gameplay does finally match up to the storytelling of what Naughty Dog is capable of.

01:06:30.043 --> 01:06:33.283
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, what is your favorite PS4 third party game, Matthew?

01:06:33.283 --> 01:06:35.603
<v SPEAKER_2>Huge heart pick, Tetris Effect.

01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:36.843
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, of course, yeah.

01:06:36.843 --> 01:06:39.843
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't think ever gets anyone excited when I talk about it.

01:06:39.843 --> 01:06:43.283
<v SPEAKER_2>People who love Tetris know that Tetris Effect is really good.

01:06:43.283 --> 01:06:47.663
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, just this completely electric version of it powered with amazing visuals.

01:06:47.663 --> 01:06:49.963
<v SPEAKER_2>This just huge killer soundtrack.

01:06:49.963 --> 01:06:53.843
<v SPEAKER_2>This is the game that kind of got got me to click properly with Tetris.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:59.163
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, I always found it just too stressful to ever really enjoy it, and I wasn't very good at it.

01:06:59.163 --> 01:07:08.323
<v SPEAKER_2>But with all the, you know, the extra gimmicks it now has, I know I can kind of hold my own at it and I've kind of chipped away at it and got better at it.

01:07:08.323 --> 01:07:11.723
<v SPEAKER_2>I haven't played that new Tetris collection, the Tetris history.

01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:13.883
<v SPEAKER_2>Do I need more Tetris when I've got Tetris effects?

01:07:13.883 --> 01:07:15.383
<v SPEAKER_2>It seems so perfect.

01:07:15.383 --> 01:07:17.063
<v SPEAKER_2>Side note, I should probably do that.

01:07:17.063 --> 01:07:18.343
<v SPEAKER_1>So digital eclipse thing, isn't it?

01:07:18.563 --> 01:07:18.963
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:07:18.963 --> 01:07:23.103
<v SPEAKER_2>And I know it's going to be amazingly well done and all the documentary stuff is going to be cool.

01:07:23.103 --> 01:07:32.803
<v SPEAKER_2>But I can't help but feel like, do I like, do you want to play an older version of Tetris that doesn't have all the bells and whistles of this one?

01:07:32.803 --> 01:07:33.163
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

01:07:33.163 --> 01:07:34.083
<v SPEAKER_2>Maybe I should give it a go.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.723
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, Tetris effects.

01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:43.723
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, they've only improved it since then, and they've added the amazing multiplayer co-op mode connected on like every platform it's available.

01:07:43.723 --> 01:07:47.003
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, this was just, this is just really, really cool.

01:07:47.003 --> 01:07:50.603
<v SPEAKER_2>Great trailer as well when they first announced this.

01:07:50.603 --> 01:07:55.003
<v SPEAKER_2>Just very like moving and strange and epic.

01:07:55.003 --> 01:07:56.683
<v SPEAKER_1>Definitely was, it was a good draft pick for you as well.

01:07:56.683 --> 01:07:58.843
<v SPEAKER_1>I think you got a lot of cred for picking it.

01:07:58.843 --> 01:08:01.543
<v SPEAKER_1>I think people like that as a sort of out there pick.

01:08:01.543 --> 01:08:03.663
<v SPEAKER_1>I tried to dismiss it as a game boy.

01:08:03.723 --> 01:08:05.963
<v SPEAKER_2>Yes, yes, yes.

01:08:05.963 --> 01:08:08.583
<v SPEAKER_1>A smear campaign that did ultimately win as I won that draft.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:09.323
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, so that sucks.

01:08:09.323 --> 01:08:13.903
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think, not because of that, but necessarily, but yeah.

01:08:13.903 --> 01:08:14.563
<v SPEAKER_1>That's a good choice.

01:08:14.823 --> 01:08:17.363
<v SPEAKER_1>That's an amazing way to experience Tetris, for sure.

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:21.343
<v SPEAKER_1>I remember that being a huge deal for you, so that makes sense.

01:08:21.343 --> 01:08:27.883
<v SPEAKER_1>Mine would be, like the head says, Persona 5 or MGS5, right?

01:08:27.883 --> 01:08:28.503
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:08:28.823 --> 01:08:30.323
<v SPEAKER_1>Or even PT, maybe.

01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:32.663
<v SPEAKER_1>PT is a great curio on there.

01:08:32.663 --> 01:08:35.563
<v SPEAKER_1>But the heart says Final Fantasy XV, Matthew.

01:08:35.563 --> 01:08:36.243
<v SPEAKER_2>Ooh.

01:08:36.243 --> 01:08:50.763
<v SPEAKER_1>Because despite being a very flawed game and incomplete feeling in a lot of ways, I thought it was close enough to the vision of what I think they pitched it as, as this road trip RPG.

01:08:51.563 --> 01:08:55.263
<v SPEAKER_1>And I had so many delightful, characterful touches around the sides.

01:08:55.263 --> 01:09:00.083
<v SPEAKER_1>The food, the photography, the character dialogue, just driving around.

01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.443
<v SPEAKER_1>The music is obviously always great.

01:09:01.443 --> 01:09:04.783
<v SPEAKER_2>Shimomura going fucking mental on a piano.

01:09:04.783 --> 01:09:07.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, absolutely fucking horde mode on that piano.

01:09:07.663 --> 01:09:10.023
<v SPEAKER_1>Just out of control.

01:09:10.023 --> 01:09:11.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Turbo button on that piano.

01:09:11.663 --> 01:09:13.423
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, that's probably my favorite one.

01:09:13.423 --> 01:09:18.163
<v SPEAKER_1>That was like my defining third party PS4 video game experience, I'd say.

01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:20.483
<v SPEAKER_2>I respect it.

01:09:20.483 --> 01:09:21.203
<v SPEAKER_1>Thanks pal.

01:09:21.203 --> 01:09:24.163
<v SPEAKER_1>What is your favorite PS5 first party game so far?

01:09:26.463 --> 01:09:28.983
<v SPEAKER_2>This is really difficult.

01:09:28.983 --> 01:09:30.903
<v SPEAKER_2>You're going to really disagree with this.

01:09:30.903 --> 01:09:32.283
<v SPEAKER_1>Don't say Ragnarok.

01:09:32.283 --> 01:09:35.263
<v SPEAKER_2>No, I think it might be Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

01:09:35.263 --> 01:09:35.863
<v SPEAKER_1>No, that's fine.

01:09:36.103 --> 01:09:37.363
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't fiercely disagree with that.

01:09:37.363 --> 01:09:38.503
<v SPEAKER_1>A lot of people like that game.

01:09:38.503 --> 01:09:40.003
<v SPEAKER_1>I feel like I'm an outlier on that game.

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:44.423
<v SPEAKER_2>I absolutely like hear all your points and it often comes up on the Discord.

01:09:44.423 --> 01:09:55.243
<v SPEAKER_2>This game is being endlessly debated and discussed, but I just thought in terms of the right amount of stuff for the amount of world they had, I thought that was really well judged.

01:09:55.243 --> 01:10:02.743
<v SPEAKER_2>Just the sensation of being Spider-Man, the movement and the combat, I thought was even more polished than it was before.

01:10:02.743 --> 01:10:04.723
<v SPEAKER_2>I know you have problems with the parries.

01:10:04.723 --> 01:10:06.563
<v SPEAKER_2>I know that.

01:10:06.563 --> 01:10:08.383
<v SPEAKER_1>Why does Spider-Man even have a parry?

01:10:08.383 --> 01:10:09.383
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:10:09.383 --> 01:10:11.463
<v SPEAKER_1>Show me the comic where he's parrying.

01:10:11.463 --> 01:10:12.143
<v SPEAKER_2>I like it.

01:10:12.143 --> 01:10:19.523
<v SPEAKER_2>I even like kicking the shit out of like five symbiote bosses at the end in a row over and over again.

01:10:19.523 --> 01:10:22.323
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I even, I do not have a problem with that.

01:10:22.323 --> 01:10:23.303
<v SPEAKER_2>I really like the story.

01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:40.543
<v SPEAKER_2>I just, I think all these games, they do the story really well in terms of how they see the villains, and they have the kind of A-plot up front, and then the bigger threat comes out of it, and I think they just give these stories the amount of time they need to breathe.

01:10:40.963 --> 01:10:43.443
<v SPEAKER_2>I've come to really enjoy the whole series.

01:10:43.523 --> 01:10:56.263
<v SPEAKER_2>I think it's a real achievement for Insomniac, who aren't a developer I'm traditionally super, super in love with, and technologically just sort of unparalleled, really.

01:10:56.263 --> 01:11:05.783
<v SPEAKER_2>How good it all looks, that city, makes me really excited for what the fuck is GTA 6 going to look like, because this is already pretty stellar.

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:12.623
<v SPEAKER_2>I know it's a different studio, but in terms of the bar is pretty high on this generation cities.

01:11:12.623 --> 01:11:16.723
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I really liked it, thought it was a very pleasurable 20 hours or whatever.

01:11:16.723 --> 01:11:18.123
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's fair enough.

01:11:18.343 --> 01:11:21.003
<v SPEAKER_1>It wasn't quite for me, but that's okay.

01:11:21.003 --> 01:11:23.743
<v SPEAKER_1>I do wonder if I played it too close to Miles Morales as well.

01:11:23.743 --> 01:11:26.143
<v SPEAKER_1>I should have given it a bit more time.

01:11:26.143 --> 01:11:29.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think it's a funny one.

01:11:29.663 --> 01:11:32.923
<v SPEAKER_1>There's just some things that are wrong about it.

01:11:32.923 --> 01:11:35.023
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it's just the parry is not quite right.

01:11:35.023 --> 01:11:44.983
<v SPEAKER_1>I think they don't quite know how to add to the formula without accidentally subtracting from the game and there is like the aggressive pat the ox sequences in the game as well.

01:11:44.983 --> 01:11:45.963
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:11:45.963 --> 01:11:46.503
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't know.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:49.143
<v SPEAKER_2>There's some of the better examples of those though, I think.

01:11:49.543 --> 01:11:49.943
<v SPEAKER_1>They are.

01:11:50.543 --> 01:11:51.923
<v SPEAKER_1>The fair one is good.

01:11:52.283 --> 01:11:58.863
<v SPEAKER_1>You have to be a real stick in the mud to not accept that that's a really nicely done little sequence.

01:11:58.863 --> 01:12:02.243
<v SPEAKER_1>I wasn't really into the way they did all the Symbiote or Harry stuff in this.

01:12:02.243 --> 01:12:06.323
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think that quite landed for me, unfortunately.

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:08.243
<v SPEAKER_1>I just love the story of the first one so much.

01:12:08.343 --> 01:12:13.303
<v SPEAKER_1>I thought that was just the idea of Doc Ock being this villain in Plain Sight, you were just waiting for it to happen.

01:12:13.303 --> 01:12:15.483
<v SPEAKER_1>That was really nicely done.

01:12:15.483 --> 01:12:22.943
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, and also the fact that they had to basically delete cops from the game and then never have any cops to explain what happened to that.

01:12:22.943 --> 01:12:34.063
<v SPEAKER_1>That feels very like corporation wrestling with the complicated political times at the moment, because it was a talking point, so now you've got loads of Craver the Hunter's dudes wandering around.

01:12:34.103 --> 01:12:35.403
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think that...

01:12:35.403 --> 01:12:38.643
<v SPEAKER_1>This is a lot of it that just didn't quite work for me.

01:12:38.643 --> 01:12:40.323
<v SPEAKER_2>All cops are invisible.

01:12:41.503 --> 01:12:42.603
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:12:42.603 --> 01:12:45.283
<v SPEAKER_1>So, yeah, it is what it is.

01:12:45.283 --> 01:12:49.063
<v SPEAKER_1>Astro Bot is mine here, Matthew, for sure.

01:12:49.063 --> 01:13:02.503
<v SPEAKER_1>Now there's a little bit of distance from when it came out, actually, in me doing some of those fucking bonus levels where the camera didn't quite give me all the information I needed to finish them properly, even though I did in the end, much with a lot of anger, a lot of swearing.

01:13:02.923 --> 01:13:13.563
<v SPEAKER_1>Astro Bot is still a joy machine, it provided a lot of delight, but I still need to play Returnal and I do want to play more of that, and I wonder if that could be my favourite game with a bit of time.

01:13:13.563 --> 01:13:20.363
<v SPEAKER_1>That's still probably the coolest, exclusive this generation, as a punt, it's quite interesting.

01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:23.423
<v SPEAKER_1>What is your favourite PS5 third-party game so far, Final Fantasy?

01:13:23.423 --> 01:13:25.743
<v SPEAKER_2>Difficult, there's loads of stuff I've liked.

01:13:25.743 --> 01:13:27.963
<v SPEAKER_3>Is it Final Fantasy VII Rebirth?

01:13:27.963 --> 01:13:28.523
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

01:13:28.543 --> 01:13:29.103
<v SPEAKER_1>Interesting.

01:13:29.103 --> 01:13:29.843
<v SPEAKER_2>It might be.

01:13:29.843 --> 01:13:30.883
<v SPEAKER_2>That's really up there.

01:13:30.883 --> 01:13:38.683
<v SPEAKER_2>No, obviously we're in the midst of deciding, working on our Game of the Year lists and I'm weighing up all kinds of stuff.

01:13:38.683 --> 01:13:41.923
<v SPEAKER_2>So this could very well change.

01:13:41.923 --> 01:13:49.203
<v SPEAKER_2>I think why I wrote down Rebirth was also because it feels very PS5, it's exclusive to PS5 at the moment.

01:13:49.203 --> 01:13:55.603
<v SPEAKER_2>It's obviously a remake and in conversation with one of the definitive PlayStation games.

01:13:55.603 --> 01:14:07.663
<v SPEAKER_2>Just for the purposes of this episode, and playing the PlayStation game properly, I thought Final Fantasy VII Rebirth felt apt just for being the most game this year.

01:14:07.663 --> 01:14:10.783
<v SPEAKER_2>Just everything, everything.

01:14:12.303 --> 01:14:18.643
<v SPEAKER_2>Even more on PS5 Pro apparently, even shinier, even better.

01:14:18.643 --> 01:14:20.103
<v SPEAKER_2>Let's ask Digital Foundry.

01:14:20.103 --> 01:14:21.783
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, they say it's good.

01:14:24.603 --> 01:14:27.923
<v SPEAKER_2>You know me, I'm easily won over by the stuff.

01:14:27.923 --> 01:14:30.323
<v SPEAKER_2>I admire people who make fuck loads of stuff.

01:14:30.323 --> 01:14:36.103
<v SPEAKER_2>I like people who make loads of games, and I like people who when they make games, fill it full of stuff.

01:14:36.743 --> 01:14:43.603
<v SPEAKER_1>If you've got 800 mini games, and each of those mini games has its own 30 second theme tune, it's an absolute banger.

01:14:43.603 --> 01:14:45.963
<v SPEAKER_1>You have unlocked the key to Matthew Castle's heart.

01:14:45.963 --> 01:14:46.263
<v SPEAKER_1>Well done.

01:14:46.263 --> 01:14:46.543
<v SPEAKER_2>100%.

01:14:46.963 --> 01:14:49.643
<v SPEAKER_2>That is so true.

01:14:49.643 --> 01:14:53.243
<v SPEAKER_2>That's not the only key to my heart, but that is a key to my heart.

01:14:53.303 --> 01:14:54.143
<v SPEAKER_1>It's a route there.

01:14:54.143 --> 01:14:55.823
<v SPEAKER_1>Otherwise, have a murder mystery in your game.

01:14:55.823 --> 01:14:56.623
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, yeah.

01:14:56.623 --> 01:15:00.923
<v SPEAKER_2>That's all this kit doesn't really have, is it doesn't have a murder mystery side quest.

01:15:00.923 --> 01:15:01.983
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's gutted.

01:15:01.983 --> 01:15:03.383
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, I don't think I did the last one.

01:15:03.383 --> 01:15:04.303
<v SPEAKER_1>Who killed Aerith?

01:15:04.303 --> 01:15:06.163
<v SPEAKER_1>The problem is everyone knows.

01:15:06.163 --> 01:15:10.543
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, I've not played the end of this one, so who knows what nonsense awaits.

01:15:10.543 --> 01:15:13.603
<v SPEAKER_1>I will do before the end of the year, though.

01:15:13.603 --> 01:15:15.443
<v SPEAKER_1>For me, it's a bit of a tie.

01:15:15.443 --> 01:15:19.803
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it's probably FF16, probably.

01:15:21.563 --> 01:15:25.123
<v SPEAKER_1>But Deathloop is up there, Guardians of the Galaxy is up there.

01:15:25.643 --> 01:15:27.463
<v SPEAKER_1>It's probably FF16, honestly.

01:15:27.463 --> 01:15:30.283
<v SPEAKER_2>I love that you're the world's biggest Guardians of the Galaxy, Stan.

01:15:30.283 --> 01:15:31.323
<v SPEAKER_1>That's like my thing now.

01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:36.603
<v SPEAKER_2>That's like an 8 out of 10, which every time you talk about it, is creeping towards being more of a 9 out of 10.

01:15:36.603 --> 01:15:38.543
<v SPEAKER_1>No, but it's not because the combat is not quite good enough.

01:15:38.543 --> 01:15:41.983
<v SPEAKER_2>It can never be, but just in terms of the reinforcement of it being good.

01:15:41.983 --> 01:15:47.303
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, it's that thing of, I don't know, again, there's no Naughty Dog games this generation, and they made one.

01:15:47.303 --> 01:16:05.223
<v SPEAKER_2>I think there is, but I think a lot of the games we cover on this podcast, the older games that we come back to, of that kind of ilk of Guardians of the Galaxy, they do get like a kind of, there is like an affection creep, which with time you just become more and more locked down in like, this is a good thing.

01:16:05.223 --> 01:16:07.543
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you think, what do you think of that?

01:16:07.543 --> 01:16:09.923
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, Guardians of the Galaxy, what do you think of my take on that?

01:16:09.923 --> 01:16:19.323
<v SPEAKER_1>And that game generally looking like back at it, like three years ago, do you think that's a fair, am I like being fair in how I'm like positively appraising it?

01:16:19.323 --> 01:16:21.243
<v SPEAKER_1>Or is it just, am I overrating it?

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:29.843
<v SPEAKER_2>I think there's quite a big gulf between it and A Naughty Dog, but there is no Naughty Dog to kind of like, step in and sort of show us the stuff.

01:16:29.843 --> 01:16:38.883
<v SPEAKER_2>So, you know, if they're gonna vacate that position, then absolutely this game can come in and it does do a lot of good, it's got a lot of great character work which is completely of its own.

01:16:38.883 --> 01:16:42.963
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, it's hugely lush in terms of the way it builds out that world.

01:16:43.383 --> 01:16:45.663
<v SPEAKER_2>For me, I don't think it like…

01:16:45.663 --> 01:16:55.903
<v SPEAKER_2>It doesn't quite have the Naughty Dog source in like hiding, you know, how it's doing a lot of its kind of tricks and, you know, like the Naughty Dog things are just so seamlessly done.

01:16:56.343 --> 01:17:01.283
<v SPEAKER_2>That's like the missing ingredient as well as the combat being a little bit like…

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.643
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, and so it must remain an 8 out of 10.

01:17:03.683 --> 01:17:17.523
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, but I'm not, I'm not, knock it, I absolutely like, you know, I love, I love that Guardians of the Galaxy is sort of a weird, not core text, but a text in the Back Page canon.

01:17:17.523 --> 01:17:18.783
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, it is, it is.

01:17:18.783 --> 01:17:30.743
<v SPEAKER_1>So, yeah, but you know what, there is a game from this year, a PS5 third party game that I won't spoil, that is, I mean, I'm playing two of them at the same time at the moment, that is creeping up to potentially take this spot.

01:17:30.743 --> 01:17:33.083
<v SPEAKER_1>So we will see how that goes.

01:17:33.183 --> 01:17:35.763
<v SPEAKER_1>But again, save that for Game of the Year.

01:17:35.763 --> 01:17:40.663
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, Matthew, let's take a quick break and we will come back with a brief bonus category section.

01:17:40.663 --> 01:17:41.163
<v SPEAKER_2>Let's do it.

01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:09.110
<v SPEAKER_1>Welcome back to the podcast.

01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:11.990
<v SPEAKER_1>Don't worry, it's almost over, but we're gonna do some bonus categories here.

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:20.230
<v SPEAKER_1>I've got some awards for various different bits of PlayStation characters, iconography, that sort of thing to go through with Matthew here.

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:22.790
<v SPEAKER_1>I just thought it'd be funny to ask him some of these questions.

01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.050
<v SPEAKER_1>We'll do them in a relatively quick format here.

01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:27.730
<v SPEAKER_1>So Matthew, who is the best PlayStation mascot?

01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:32.030
<v SPEAKER_2>He's not first party, but I think it's Kazuma Kiryu from Yakuza.

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:33.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, right, I never really thought of him as...

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:37.710
<v SPEAKER_2>I think his story is so entwined with PlayStation.

01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:38.830
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's true.

01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:45.310
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it's now very widely available everywhere, but then that's true for almost all games, isn't it?

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:47.470
<v SPEAKER_3>Yeah, and he was there from the beginning.

01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:52.430
<v SPEAKER_2>Your journey through these consoles could have very easily been by his side.

01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:54.710
<v SPEAKER_2>I will never think that guy in Xbox.

01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:55.950
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I understand that.

01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:57.130
<v SPEAKER_1>That makes sense.

01:18:57.190 --> 01:19:03.030
<v SPEAKER_1>I have to say Nathan Drake here, because, you know, it's sort of like, I wouldn't pick one of the platforming icons.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:06.430
<v SPEAKER_1>They've all got a little bit of cursed energy about them.

01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:09.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Nathan Drake was the right character for the right time.

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:22.530
<v SPEAKER_1>If we judge it by the criteria of who's the one person in the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale roster who you're not like, eugh, and Nathan Drake is that character, so he wins by default for me.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:23.130
<v SPEAKER_2>That's fair enough.

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:24.790
<v SPEAKER_1>Worst PlayStation mascot, Matthew.

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:26.070
<v SPEAKER_2>Do we still count Spyro?

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:26.950
<v SPEAKER_1>That's interesting.

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:29.690
<v SPEAKER_1>That's quite harsh when you got Knack on the board, you know?

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.010
<v SPEAKER_3>Oh, Knack is shit.

01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:33.110
<v SPEAKER_3>Spyro is just a real...

01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:35.010
<v SPEAKER_2>He's just such a nothing, you know?

01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:37.370
<v SPEAKER_3>I just don't know what that guy's vibe is at all.

01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.870
<v SPEAKER_2>He's just like a...

01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:40.370
<v SPEAKER_2>Like, what he is is all he is.

01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:41.850
<v SPEAKER_2>He's just a dragon, you know?

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:42.570
<v SPEAKER_1>Little dragon.

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:44.370
<v SPEAKER_2>He's not like a sarcastic dragon.

01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:45.490
<v SPEAKER_2>He's not like a cheeky dragon.

01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:46.690
<v SPEAKER_2>He's just a dragon.

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:48.490
<v SPEAKER_1>You know that the character design's quite nice?

01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:50.510
<v SPEAKER_1>His little purple design, his eyes.

01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:52.790
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it's like well-drawn, I think.

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:54.370
<v SPEAKER_3>I was looking through him.

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:55.870
<v SPEAKER_2>I had them up on tabs today.

01:19:57.610 --> 01:20:02.110
<v SPEAKER_2>All of the dire, platforming mascots of PlayStation history.

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:05.970
<v SPEAKER_2>This is the one I was just looking at thinking, I just feel nothing for this guy at all.

01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:08.110
<v SPEAKER_1>Even, you think Spira above Croc?

01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:09.870
<v SPEAKER_3>Is he a serious contender?

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:10.730
<v SPEAKER_1>No, not really.

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:11.850
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, he's crying.

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.810
<v SPEAKER_2>They are like, they're a sorry bunch.

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:25.330
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Nack's the worst because he made no sense in the era he was born into and the world said no and they still made Nack too.

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.250
<v SPEAKER_1>That's why I think it's got to be Nack, personally.

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:29.410
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that's a very strong case.

01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:33.410
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, listen, I've said my piece on a lot of these characters before.

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:36.570
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, today the spotlight landed on Spiro.

01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:38.610
<v SPEAKER_2>Tomorrow it will be fucking Crash.

01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:39.430
<v SPEAKER_1>Sly Cooper.

01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:42.710
<v SPEAKER_1>Sly Cooper's all right.

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:45.210
<v SPEAKER_1>Sly Cooper's got a bit more of a USP, you know?

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:46.510
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, right.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:49.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, stealth game in a post-Metal Gear age.

01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:50.750
<v SPEAKER_1>Anyway, enough about that.

01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:54.550
<v SPEAKER_1>PlayStation game most deserving of a remake from any generation, Matthew?

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:55.850
<v SPEAKER_2>Bushido Blade.

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:56.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, right, okay.

01:20:56.530 --> 01:20:57.350
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I can see that.

01:20:57.350 --> 01:21:01.130
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, one on one fighting, but like one hit kills.

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:06.410
<v SPEAKER_2>I just think that could look really fucking gnarly with like modern gore tech.

01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:07.310
<v SPEAKER_1>Bodies are sliding off.

01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:14.650
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, imagine like you did have a game that looked as nice as Tekken 8 this year, but it was like bits of body parts flying off.

01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.550
<v SPEAKER_1>I think that would genuinely horrify people.

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:19.890
<v SPEAKER_2>Like the idea of like nicking someone's neck and that being game over.

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:21.870
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, and then just the blood gushes.

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:26.270
<v SPEAKER_2>And like photorealistic Nidhogg, that's what I'm picturing.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:30.270
<v SPEAKER_1>All the budget goes into animation.

01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:31.730
<v SPEAKER_1>That's where all of the budget goes.

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:36.030
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like precise blade, slicer stabs, like character reactions.

01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:42.710
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like the budget for the game is like 200 million and 160 million is animations.

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:48.990
<v SPEAKER_2>All the levels are just slowy places because you just want to see that blood everywhere.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:53.350
<v SPEAKER_2>That stuff's easy because Nidhogg obviously has that sort of sword fighting.

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:58.090
<v SPEAKER_2>I like that thing you do in Nidhogg where you stick the sword in and then you kind of jiggle it up and down.

01:21:58.090 --> 01:22:00.690
<v SPEAKER_2>I want to be able to do that like the old up and down.

01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:01.890
<v SPEAKER_2>They're on my sword.

01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:02.810
<v SPEAKER_2>Let's have some fun.

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:03.670
<v SPEAKER_1>Nice.

01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:07.210
<v SPEAKER_1>That's a very good and deranged suggestion.

01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:13.910
<v SPEAKER_1>There are so many games that you could put into this, but I do really think it's time to give dinosaurs another chance to do Dino Crisis.

01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:14.190
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:15.070
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:24.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Because we just haven't seen the, imagine the alien isolation fidelity, but on dinosaurs and imagine it's loads of different dinosaurs.

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:30.210
<v SPEAKER_1>Imagine it's like Resi 7, first person or something and it's really high fidelity.

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:40.050
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm not saying you do the original Dino Crisis story necessarily because I think in that documentary, Mikami was like, make it more like Resi to the devs who didn't know what they were doing with it or something.

01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:43.330
<v SPEAKER_1>That's a vague recollection of what that story was behind that game.

01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:47.090
<v SPEAKER_2>Young Shootakumi does fucking shit in the bed.

01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:49.410
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, not really, not really his sort of vibe.

01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:55.790
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Capcom doing a new scary oriented Resi 2 remake ass Dino Crisis.

01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:58.230
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like such a big win.

01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:00.890
<v SPEAKER_1>The world ignored Exo Primal, but I liked it.

01:23:01.090 --> 01:23:04.150
<v SPEAKER_2>So it made me feel a bit like about dinosaurs.

01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:16.490
<v SPEAKER_2>One thing they definitely could do by doing this is reclaiming the Velociraptor as a scary monster, because I think it has been so completely defanged in pop culture by Jurassic World.

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:22.390
<v SPEAKER_2>When they made it like Chris Pratt's mate and gave it a name, you're like this thing, they fucked me up as a kid Velociraptors.

01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:24.890
<v SPEAKER_2>I was so scared of them, the idea of them.

01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:29.090
<v SPEAKER_2>And now they're just like, it's your boy, so come and fight the other dinosaurs for you.

01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:30.210
<v SPEAKER_2>And that blows.

01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:34.330
<v SPEAKER_2>So a game which is like, we're going to make Velociraptors fucking evil again.

01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:39.030
<v SPEAKER_2>Stick that on a red cap, make Velociraptors evil again.

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:47.090
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I just love to, I love it if like this, there were just sections though where it was like, it was time for like, it's like the Triceratops session.

01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:49.930
<v SPEAKER_1>And like, this thing will run at you and gore you.

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:51.810
<v SPEAKER_2>And do like the nastiest.

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:53.350
<v SPEAKER_2>But particularly Velociraptors.

01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.770
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, that's it.

01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:53.890
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:23:53.890 --> 01:24:01.690
<v SPEAKER_1>And imagine like the, the Pteranodon one where it's like, you see just shadows in the trees and then they all just come down at you and start screaming or whatever.

01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.550
<v SPEAKER_1>Just that, that sort of thing I want to see.

01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:07.810
<v SPEAKER_1>Just like high fidelity really fuck you up dinosaur scares.

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:13.870
<v SPEAKER_1>And then you build up to like the fucking gigantic T-Rex reveal at the end of the game or something.

01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:15.950
<v SPEAKER_1>I just think that's what we should be doing with them.

01:24:16.650 --> 01:24:21.050
<v SPEAKER_1>That's what Capcom should do once they fucking remade Code Veronica or whatever they're doing next.

01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:22.270
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah.

01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:22.910
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:26.270
<v SPEAKER_1>PlayStation game most deserving of a simple remaster from any generation.

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.790
<v SPEAKER_1>So the looks and mechanics of it are preserved.

01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:30.030
<v SPEAKER_2>What do you think Matthew?

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.170
<v SPEAKER_2>Xenogears or Xenogears.

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:33.910
<v SPEAKER_2>Just so that we can play it easily.

01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:37.750
<v SPEAKER_2>Because if you want to play this game now, you've just got to like pirate it and that sucks.

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:42.110
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah or get it on USPSN store or whatever.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.890
<v SPEAKER_1>I've done that.

01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:43.710
<v SPEAKER_1>It's a pain in the ass.

01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:46.930
<v SPEAKER_2>I can't reset my Vita and lose all the stuff on it again.

01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:49.670
<v SPEAKER_1>No, not a man of your age.

01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:50.870
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think that's fair.

01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:54.730
<v SPEAKER_2>I haven't got another regional transfer in me.

01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:57.830
<v SPEAKER_1>But the last one might kill him.

01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:59.170
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, this is easy for me.

01:24:59.170 --> 01:24:59.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Ico.

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:00.850
<v SPEAKER_1>It's got to be Ico.

01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:02.170
<v SPEAKER_1>Genuine classic.

01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:03.190
<v SPEAKER_1>Lost of time.

01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:05.410
<v SPEAKER_1>Only re-released on PS3.

01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:07.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Already been remastered by Bluepoint.

01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:08.570
<v SPEAKER_1>What are we doing, lads?

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:12.270
<v SPEAKER_1>Get that on PS4 or PS5 1999.

01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Done.

01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:15.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Let's just get that playing natively on PS4.

01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:21.430
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Ico is the one where I'm like, how is there no easy way to play this massively influential game?

01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:24.130
<v SPEAKER_1>That's a strong feeling on that one, Matthew.

01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:28.890
<v SPEAKER_1>I know that you are, for me to read, as number one enemy as established.

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:32.210
<v SPEAKER_1>So what is the best PSN game, Matthew?

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:36.650
<v SPEAKER_2>I struggle with this because it's just a downloadable only game, right?

01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:40.670
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, it could have been physically released, but it has to have the profile of a download game.

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:41.690
<v SPEAKER_3>Does The Witness count?

01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:42.990
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I'll give you that.

01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:44.770
<v SPEAKER_2>It's a downloadable game on PS4.

01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:45.950
<v SPEAKER_2>I played it loads.

01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:47.010
<v SPEAKER_2>I know it's wanky.

01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:50.750
<v SPEAKER_2>I know we all roll our eyes at Jonathan Blow and he's a bit of a pain in the ass now.

01:25:50.750 --> 01:26:00.970
<v SPEAKER_2>But walking around that weird ass island doing abstract puzzles and discovering redacted puzzles all around me was a really exciting moment.

01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:03.330
<v SPEAKER_2>I still think that island looks rad.

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:09.810
<v SPEAKER_2>I booted it up this year for something for work and had a little trot round it going, this is quite cool what they made here.

01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:11.910
<v SPEAKER_2>It's the wanky old Witness.

01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:14.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Sometimes I just can't play a game after seeing the developer's tweets.

01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:15.490
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you know what I mean?

01:26:15.490 --> 01:26:16.690
<v SPEAKER_2>There is, yeah.

01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:26.470
<v SPEAKER_2>If anything, he needs to spend a little bit of time on lovely Witness Island just chilling out amongst all the browning leaves and all that stuff.

01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:30.230
<v SPEAKER_1>Whenever I see his tweets shared, that's never a net gain for me.

01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:30.910
<v SPEAKER_1>You know what I mean?

01:26:31.890 --> 01:26:33.010
<v SPEAKER_1>It's never ideal.

01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:44.310
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm going to take Wipeout HD here because over the course of its history, I think this has been a great dependable switch-on zone mode, put on a podcast, tune out kind of thing.

01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:51.010
<v SPEAKER_1>I probably play Wipeout HD twice a year for about 15 minutes each time, but it's always a good time.

01:26:51.010 --> 01:26:57.250
<v SPEAKER_1>You probably think I'm just kowtowing to those UK PlayStation fans on Real Mark Matthews.

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:59.370
<v SPEAKER_2>This isn't a draft, so it doesn't matter.

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:03.730
<v SPEAKER_2>If this was a draft, fuck it, I'd pretend I like Wipeout too.

01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:06.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I just think it's really stood the test of timers.

01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:14.810
<v SPEAKER_1>Because I think they're PSP tracks that were redone on PS3 and then re-released on PS4.

01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:15.990
<v SPEAKER_1>It's had quite a journey.

01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:19.670
<v SPEAKER_1>Some of the stuff is almost 20 years old, but it's still pretty timeless.

01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:27.390
<v SPEAKER_1>And I think when you think about how there are no more new Wipeout games, you arguably don't need one because it sort of does everything and is the best one.

01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:28.750
<v SPEAKER_1>Such as it is, Matthew.

01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:30.730
<v SPEAKER_1>Most overrated PlayStation game?

01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:33.930
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm going to take generally the Ratchet and Clank series.

01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:34.510
<v SPEAKER_1>Interesting.

01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:39.890
<v SPEAKER_2>Obviously, I'm not into the earlier platforming games, but I think most people can play those now and go.

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:42.130
<v SPEAKER_2>They're pretty ropey, so that's fine.

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:45.570
<v SPEAKER_2>Ratchet and Clank, I think, because it's still like a going concern.

01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:49.710
<v SPEAKER_2>People still making these games and sort of going nuts for them.

01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:52.450
<v SPEAKER_2>I've just never really got it.

01:27:52.450 --> 01:28:01.190
<v SPEAKER_2>I never really got the wacky weapons and holding fire while things endlessly explode into loads of nuts and bolts.

01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:06.410
<v SPEAKER_2>Very shiny graphics, but it's just not really doing anything with it that I'm interested in.

01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:11.250
<v SPEAKER_2>And the tone of it, I just, I hate the writing and the story telling and the characters.

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:18.010
<v SPEAKER_2>I hate the Saturday morning thing I find so grating, so crushingly unfunny, these games.

01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:23.810
<v SPEAKER_2>I properly played that last one because I thought, these are games I've only ever really dabbled with and sort of sniffed out in the past.

01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:27.290
<v SPEAKER_2>So I gave whatever the last one was.

01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Rift Apart.

01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:29.350
<v SPEAKER_2>Rift Apart, you know, a proper go.

01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:33.070
<v SPEAKER_2>And I just, it's so not for me.

01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:36.190
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't understand how like my peers are into this.

01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:41.190
<v SPEAKER_2>I just don't get it because it's so childish and charmless to me.

01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.090
<v SPEAKER_1>No, that's fine.

01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:44.690
<v SPEAKER_1>I think here's a thought exercise.

01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:48.250
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you think if you and I were both given like 10 grand each, right?

01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:50.410
<v SPEAKER_1>And we had to write the next Ratchet and Clank game.

01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:50.950
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, yeah.

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:54.750
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you think we could make Captain Quark dialogue like funny?

01:28:56.490 --> 01:28:59.830
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you think it would be like a win for the game if we did that?

01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:03.650
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, that's the final set piece in Mission Possible 8.

01:29:03.670 --> 01:29:06.250
<v SPEAKER_2>It is to just try and land some Quark dialogue.

01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:07.230
<v SPEAKER_2>Good luck, Tom.

01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:09.190
<v SPEAKER_2>It's your toughest mission yet.

01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:12.730
<v SPEAKER_1>Because he's just Zack Brannigan, but not funny.

01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:15.270
<v SPEAKER_1>I think you and I could give that a proper go.

01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:18.330
<v SPEAKER_1>I think we could, there might be a bit more.

01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:24.410
<v SPEAKER_1>The reason Zack Brannigan is funny and Captain Quark is not, is because Zack Brannigan is basically a disgraceful sex pervert.

01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:26.670
<v SPEAKER_1>And that's funny, it just is.

01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:29.070
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I mean, maybe it's just an impossible task.

01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:34.190
<v SPEAKER_2>Maybe the writing and that side of it is just meant to be aimed at very young children.

01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:36.530
<v SPEAKER_1>No, we could have a go at it.

01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:38.010
<v SPEAKER_1>We could nail this, I think.

01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:45.290
<v SPEAKER_2>I've just listened to podcasts where game writers who've worked on this game have talked about working on these games.

01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:50.430
<v SPEAKER_2>There are like six writers or something working on a Ratchet and Clank.

01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:52.230
<v SPEAKER_3>I'm just like, and this is what?

01:29:52.230 --> 01:29:53.170
<v SPEAKER_3>And this is what we got?

01:29:53.170 --> 01:29:53.830
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, anyway.

01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:57.670
<v SPEAKER_1>We could put some Episode 200 energy into Captain Quark, I think.

01:29:57.670 --> 01:30:00.090
<v SPEAKER_1>I think we could really land the plane on that one.

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:06.290
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, if anyone from the Sony X listens to this, obviously, apologies for what I just said about Ratchet and Clank.

01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:08.550
<v SPEAKER_2>But also, 10 grand?

01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:09.150
<v SPEAKER_2>It's not a lot.

01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:09.910
<v SPEAKER_1>10 grand?

01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:10.610
<v SPEAKER_1>10 grand?

01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:11.930
<v SPEAKER_1>That's so arbitrary.

01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:12.410
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, good.

01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:15.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, me and Matthew are now the lead narrative designers on the next Ratchet and Clank game.

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:17.250
<v SPEAKER_1>So look forward to that.

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:17.850
<v SPEAKER_1>Should be good.

01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:19.850
<v SPEAKER_1>10 grand, in the bank.

01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:44.790
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, most overrated PlayStation game, going by review scores, it probably is Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots, because if we just think about how many cutscenes are in that game, I mean, this is gonna come out so sourly when they do the new version of HD and people realize just how grueling it is to sit through all those cutscenes, people will properly turn on this game.

01:30:44.790 --> 01:31:01.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, you remember the little snatches of stealth in the first two levels, you remember Shadow Moses done in PS3 Vision, but I think you just forget the stop-start nature of it and how much hard work that is, the briefings on the planes, and it costs something ridiculous, like 93 Metacritic.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:10.790
<v SPEAKER_1>I think this is borne out by the fact that you and I have had no real problems revisiting MGS1 and 3, but I don't know, it's not like we're tempted to do 4, is it?

01:31:11.530 --> 01:31:17.390
<v SPEAKER_2>It's just cos it's locked on, like, you know, it's quite hard, just the physical act of playing it is trickier.

01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:30.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, but my PS3 is plugged in, I could do that right now and I just, I've given it a go over the years again, it's just not, I don't know, everyone who gave it an 8 at the time was very brave, but they were very correct, you know, they got the wrath of the internet, but they were correct, dammit.

01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:33.090
<v SPEAKER_1>Most underrated PlayStation game, Matthew.

01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:38.830
<v SPEAKER_2>People may disagree with this, cos it is reasonably critically acclaimed, but I don't think it's critically acclaimed enough.

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:40.170
<v SPEAKER_2>I've picked Death Stranding.

01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:41.850
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, okay, that's a good pick.

01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:58.530
<v SPEAKER_2>I was so blown away when I finally played this, at how interesting and different it was, the crazy vibes of hiking across, you know, that slightly Icelandic looking terrain, the amazing music choices, just the strange sort of simulated hiking of it.

01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:09.430
<v SPEAKER_2>Most importantly, the collective infrastructure that builds as everyone is kind of improving their individual world, they're secretly feeding stuff into other people's worlds.

01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:13.290
<v SPEAKER_2>I thought this was a game of like huge original ideas.

01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:14.290
<v SPEAKER_2>So exciting.

01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:17.310
<v SPEAKER_2>And I just think it was really misunderstood and misjudged.

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:24.070
<v SPEAKER_2>I think loads of people were just like, it's all just, you know, shit grenades and pissing in rivers and it is that.

01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:31.490
<v SPEAKER_2>But I thought this game, you know, is like legitimately brilliant.

01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:38.210
<v SPEAKER_2>And we haven't yet done an episode where it can kind of come up in our like Game of the Year lists or anything.

01:32:38.210 --> 01:32:42.030
<v SPEAKER_2>We haven't covered this period in our Game of the Year episodes.

01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:48.970
<v SPEAKER_2>But it's going to be super high on mine because I think it is, I think it's like legitimately genius in loads of ways.

01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:50.870
<v SPEAKER_1>It's a proper love or hate to this game.

01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:51.190
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:55.250
<v SPEAKER_1>Like it's, I've had so many people be like, it's just fucking walking similar.

01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.290
<v SPEAKER_1>It's just like fucking what if climbing was hot?

01:32:57.290 --> 01:33:00.290
<v SPEAKER_1>So many people have been like that, like that about this game and I've talked about it.

01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:05.930
<v SPEAKER_1>And then there's people like you or Andy Kelly who are like, this is miraculous and changed my life about it.

01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:07.250
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, okay.

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:08.530
<v SPEAKER_1>I got to play this at some point.

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:10.890
<v SPEAKER_1>It's outrageous that I haven't really.

01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:11.510
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:12.590
<v SPEAKER_1>Good stuff, Matthew.

01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:16.550
<v SPEAKER_1>So my most underrated PlayStation game is MotorStorm Pacific Rift on PS3.

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:17.450
<v SPEAKER_1>Just a banger.

01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:18.970
<v SPEAKER_1>Just much better than the original MotorStorm.

01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:29.290
<v SPEAKER_1>Has the same like terrain deformation, massive variety of different vehicles you can race around these different environments, but in this like tropical volcanic locale this time, this island.

01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:36.510
<v SPEAKER_1>Just some absolutely phenomenal tracks and really good fun, like arcadey racing you can get into even if it's not massively your sort of thing.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:43.150
<v SPEAKER_1>Like just the vibe of it is much closer to something like Mario Kart than it is to something like, I don't know, fucking Gran Turismo or whatever.

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:46.970
<v SPEAKER_1>It's just really quite a fun, oriented, silly racing game.

01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:49.650
<v SPEAKER_1>We whack the boost button like so much of the time.

01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:50.830
<v SPEAKER_1>Really thought this was great.

01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:54.230
<v SPEAKER_1>It might be a bit weird if they just like re-released it by itself on PS5.

01:33:54.230 --> 01:34:12.110
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think they ever willed anything like that, but revisited it a few years ago and I think this really was kind of ignored as the first one was a great launch game showcase and then the second one just wasn't really much, it just wasn't, didn't get much attention in like 2008, which, you know, was one of the all-timer great game years.

01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:14.670
<v SPEAKER_1>So, yeah, that's up there for sure.

01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:24.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, otherwise, I don't know, I put down the last guy, that PSN game that only I remember, the Google Maps game, the Google Earth game, such as it is.

01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:27.190
<v SPEAKER_1>Most cursed PlayStation game, Matthew, what do you got?

01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:31.710
<v SPEAKER_2>I wrote down that that's Star Wars Masters of Terus Kazi.

01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:36.990
<v SPEAKER_3>But more like again, it's a game with like a shitty reputation.

01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:39.030
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't even know if I've played it, to be honest.

01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:40.830
<v SPEAKER_1>It's so bad, so bad.

01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:48.650
<v SPEAKER_2>But I just remember this getting its face kicked off in Games Master, but it was, I just remember it being very heavily promoted.

01:34:48.650 --> 01:34:53.330
<v SPEAKER_2>Like in my local video shop where you could rent PlayStation games, there was like a big poster of it.

01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:58.890
<v SPEAKER_2>It would get advertised in Games Master, despite the fact that they'd given it like 25% or something.

01:34:58.890 --> 01:35:08.730
<v SPEAKER_2>It just, it felt like someone was trying to force feed everyone some terrible Star Wars thing, even though the thing they were trying to feed you through had said like, don't touch this.

01:35:08.730 --> 01:35:11.730
<v SPEAKER_2>And I think that's what gave it like a slightly cursed energy.

01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:25.730
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, again, just watching footage of this or just looking at screenshots of it, just how strange it is, the idea of these best friends kicking the shit out of each other in this fighting game is just very odd.

01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:29.570
<v SPEAKER_2>For some reason, Smash Brothers doesn't have that same hang up.

01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:33.130
<v SPEAKER_2>But I don't know, I don't want to see Han Solo and shoot back a fight.

01:35:33.130 --> 01:35:34.070
<v SPEAKER_2>That's weird.

01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:37.410
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, well, I mean, I bought it and played it and it's fucking terrible.

01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:39.750
<v SPEAKER_1>That was like probably the worst thing I bought during the pandemic.

01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:41.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Master's Terrace Cursing.

01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:44.690
<v SPEAKER_2>In the pandemic, that was during childhood.

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:47.770
<v SPEAKER_1>This was 2020, it was a bad year.

01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:54.470
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I sort of in some ways, I think that I've made some really bad choices around the fact that the PS3 can play any PS1 game.

01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:57.430
<v SPEAKER_1>So no matter what version of the PS3 you've got, it will do that.

01:35:57.430 --> 01:36:01.170
<v SPEAKER_1>So I've made some tough choices over the years.

01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:09.310
<v SPEAKER_1>I think I did a very dark moment considering buying the infamous PS1 Hagrid Harry Potter game, but it didn't happen, thankfully.

01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:13.590
<v SPEAKER_1>My most cursed PlayStation game though, I think Matthew's been a tiny bit conservative there.

01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:16.810
<v SPEAKER_1>Some weird stuff on PS, on PlayStation.

01:36:16.810 --> 01:36:21.150
<v SPEAKER_1>Has to be, I've not played it, but I've watched bits of it on YouTube.

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:34.090
<v SPEAKER_1>Has to be the rhythm action game, Dog of Bay, with the set in some kind of nightclub, where the women are anthropomorphic dog women, and it's furry content, and it's really cursed.

01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:40.590
<v SPEAKER_1>That has to be the most cursing, because you look at it, you're like, I can't believe this even got made.

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:42.230
<v SPEAKER_2>What platform was that on?

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.490
<v SPEAKER_2>Not that I'm interested.

01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:44.510
<v SPEAKER_1>PS2.

01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:45.190
<v SPEAKER_1>Some PS2.

01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:49.930
<v SPEAKER_1>I only know about it because it was reviewed in the import section of Play Magazine years ago.

01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:52.110
<v SPEAKER_1>I think they gave it 90 percent plus or something.

01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:53.230
<v SPEAKER_1>It was really bizarre.

01:36:53.230 --> 01:36:54.390
<v SPEAKER_1>Otherwise, it might be Mr.

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:57.590
<v SPEAKER_1>Mosquito, which you can now play on PS4 actually, or PS5.

01:36:57.590 --> 01:37:02.450
<v SPEAKER_1>That's like a game where you play as a little mosquito, and getting into all kinds of wacky situations.

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:04.290
<v SPEAKER_1>A bit cursed, not like the most cursed.

01:37:04.290 --> 01:37:05.870
<v SPEAKER_1>Dog of Bay is more cursed.

01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:10.330
<v SPEAKER_1>LSD Dream Emulator, which is a great watch it for 10 minutes game on YouTube.

01:37:10.630 --> 01:37:11.650
<v SPEAKER_1>That's cursed.

01:37:11.650 --> 01:37:13.570
<v SPEAKER_1>BMX Triple X, that's cursed.

01:37:13.570 --> 01:37:16.390
<v SPEAKER_1>We were like, you know what's not working about this franchise?

01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:20.810
<v SPEAKER_1>Dave Mirra, it's time to have some pointy PS2 breasts to sell this game.

01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:21.570
<v SPEAKER_1>So cursed.

01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:22.710
<v SPEAKER_1>That's really cursed.

01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:27.570
<v SPEAKER_1>But of all the games that actually played, it has to be PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:38.830
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, just taking the punt on the PlayStation character roster, at the end of the PS3 generation, arguably the nadir of the entire PlayStation enterprise.

01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:44.130
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like, just like five or six years later and that would be such a different story.

01:37:44.130 --> 01:37:47.470
<v SPEAKER_1>But it was so the wrong time and it's so cursed.

01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:51.350
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like, no, I don't want to play as Noriko.

01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:54.010
<v SPEAKER_2>Who's the biggest no-hoper in that roster?

01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:56.690
<v SPEAKER_1>Let's look it up, just so I make sure I get this right.

01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:59.270
<v SPEAKER_1>It's weird, like the Big Daddy from BioShock, isn't it?

01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:03.410
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, it's got to be like some Killzone guy, right?

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:06.590
<v SPEAKER_1>I think there might be a Hellgan in it.

01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:09.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh my god, it's like such a murderous row of nobodies.

01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:15.830
<v SPEAKER_1>You've got Emmet Graves from Starhawk, I can't remember his.

01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:21.510
<v SPEAKER_1>Fat Princess from the game Fat Princess, that's not dated conceptually well.

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:28.370
<v SPEAKER_1>You've got, I think like you've got Good and Bad, Cole McGroth from Infamous, that's rough, that's just a bold dude.

01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:31.950
<v SPEAKER_1>Colonel Raddock from Killzone, who I know is your favorite character, Matthew.

01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:35.850
<v SPEAKER_1>Dante, but not the PS2 version, the DMC Devil May Cry version.

01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:44.270
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, we are on the record as DMC is a great game here, but that's not the version you want when you're doing, this is going to beat him up, surely.

01:38:44.290 --> 01:38:55.890
<v SPEAKER_1>But we're not even like that, Isaac Clarke from Dead Spaces in it, like wild, Cat and Dusty from Gravity Rush, a game I know you love, Matthew, Kratos Fine, Noriko from Heavenly Sword is a bit duff, ultimately.

01:38:55.890 --> 01:39:06.450
<v SPEAKER_1>Got Raiden from Metal Gear, but not Snake, that's tough, and Sir Daniel Fortescue from Medieval, Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal, Spike from Ape Escape.

01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:14.130
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, those are up there, Matthew, but I think Colonel Raddock, Cole McGrath, Evert Graves, those have got to be the worst ones.

01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:15.450
<v SPEAKER_2>Evert Graves.

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:17.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Evert Graves.

01:39:17.530 --> 01:39:18.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, so cursed.

01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:19.810
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, almost there.

01:39:19.810 --> 01:39:22.770
<v SPEAKER_2>Evert Graves has entered the fray, shrug.

01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:24.030
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, exactly.

01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:27.110
<v SPEAKER_1>Most cursed PlayStation peripheral or hardware innovation, Matthew?

01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:28.850
<v SPEAKER_2>It's not cursed in the traditional sense.

01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:36.770
<v SPEAKER_2>It's pretty conservative what it was trying to do, but I really didn't like PS Move and all the faff, the cameras and all that jazz.

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:42.690
<v SPEAKER_2>I just thought it was too much work, and then its subsequent role in PSVR also unsatisfying.

01:39:42.690 --> 01:39:43.230
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:53.190
<v SPEAKER_1>It's funny how much more elegant playing the Quest 3 is now compared to that, because there's something about those Move controllers that just made the whole thing feel a little bit off or budget.

01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:54.050
<v SPEAKER_1>You know what I mean?

01:39:55.530 --> 01:39:58.090
<v SPEAKER_1>Even though they were functionally absolutely fine.

01:39:58.130 --> 01:39:59.030
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I do agree.

01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:00.910
<v SPEAKER_1>There was something not quite...

01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:04.230
<v SPEAKER_2>It's not really peripheral hardware, but it's not a game either.

01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:11.930
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, I do have very special memories of watching Andy Kelly do his home column every month.

01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:19.730
<v SPEAKER_2>And just all I know about PlayStation Home, I know from like the five minutes I'd see of it with Andy in the games cage.

01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:24.670
<v SPEAKER_2>And it was always just this sort of totally artless wasteland.

01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:29.250
<v SPEAKER_2>It's so awful PlayStation Home.

01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:31.230
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know if it was meant to be aspirational.

01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:34.290
<v SPEAKER_2>It was like the most cursed shopping mall ever.

01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:42.130
<v SPEAKER_1>Every now and then I'll see something doing the rounds about how amazing PlayStation Home was for X, Y and Z, like five people who are still in it.

01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:46.190
<v SPEAKER_1>And I'm just like, I'm sorry, but I played the beta and it was like the worst thing I've ever done.

01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:48.870
<v SPEAKER_1>Like it was so bad.

01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:53.850
<v SPEAKER_1>It was such an ill-conceived misfire of a thing.

01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:56.750
<v SPEAKER_1>It summed up the PS3 era perfectly.

01:40:57.170 --> 01:41:03.270
<v SPEAKER_1>My most cursed one has to be Wonder Book, the augmented reality peripheral for PS3.

01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:09.950
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with doing like a book, like object and then the game displays content on the book.

01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:14.090
<v SPEAKER_1>But again, this was the end of 2012, end of the PS3 era.

01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:18.990
<v SPEAKER_1>It was never going to go on in any particularly impressive way.

01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:23.250
<v SPEAKER_1>And you just know that there's about a million of these in charity shops across the land now.

01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:25.890
<v SPEAKER_1>They're just all collecting dust in people's lofts.

01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:26.650
<v SPEAKER_1>Tough.

01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:30.510
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, best decision made by Sony in the course of its history, Matthew.

01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:47.010
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm hoping you've got a more sophisticated one, but in terms of a key moment, like choosing to dunk on Xbox at E3 2013 felt like a huge crossroads moment where they sort of instantly established like the PS4 was going to be the place to be for the next generation.

01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:48.190
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, pretty important.

01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:51.390
<v SPEAKER_1>The only one I got above that is DVD player in the PS2.

01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:53.030
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that is big too.

01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:56.350
<v SPEAKER_1>That's just like an instant generation winner right there.

01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:57.170
<v SPEAKER_1>They just did it.

01:41:57.170 --> 01:42:01.770
<v SPEAKER_1>Absolutely crushed Nintendo, that generation, and everyone wanted one of those things and they were really expensive.

01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:04.670
<v SPEAKER_1>And the PS2 was cheaper than some DVD players.

01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:06.970
<v SPEAKER_1>It was a win all around, really.

01:42:06.970 --> 01:42:09.690
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, PS4 is just a games console was the other one I had Matthew.

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:11.710
<v SPEAKER_1>So I think we're tied on that.

01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:17.350
<v SPEAKER_1>PlayStation game you would send back in time to yourself in 1994 to blow your tiny mind.

01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:24.610
<v SPEAKER_2>I think from a pure visual perspective, which might be a bit basic bitch, but probably Horizon Forbidden West.

01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:25.510
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, all right.

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.990
<v SPEAKER_1>Interesting.

01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:34.210
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, like it just in terms of like, oh my God, like even now when I look at that, it's the best looking video game in terms of just like raw.

01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:41.590
<v SPEAKER_2>Look at what I'm throwing around, flying around in the clouds when they did the DLC Burning Shores.

01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:50.370
<v SPEAKER_2>Like that has these amazing clouds you fly through and this giant island-sized boss at the end, which is just like how the hell is this thing happening?

01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:54.590
<v SPEAKER_2>Is that too boring to try and dazzle my younger self with graphics?

01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:55.450
<v SPEAKER_1>No, I think that makes sense.

01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:57.090
<v SPEAKER_1>How old were you in 1994?

01:42:57.090 --> 01:42:57.530
<v SPEAKER_2>I was six.

01:42:58.830 --> 01:43:00.850
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, like nine.

01:43:00.850 --> 01:43:03.210
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I think something like Horizon would really appeal to you.

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:11.710
<v SPEAKER_1>I only picked Astrobot because as a Sonic the Hedgehog-loving child, I would have been utterly like...

01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:14.590
<v SPEAKER_1>I would have just had a heart attack or something.

01:43:14.590 --> 01:43:16.770
<v SPEAKER_1>It would have just been inconceivable to me.

01:43:16.770 --> 01:43:23.370
<v SPEAKER_1>So that someone could make something with this much fidelity that also appealed to a child's brain.

01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:29.270
<v SPEAKER_1>I would pick Astrobot on that level, Matthew, but I think Horizon makes sense to the sheer oomph.

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:30.150
<v SPEAKER_1>So yes, okay.

01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:37.690
<v SPEAKER_2>I wonder if there's any game which if you sent yourself in 1994, you'd be able to glean from it something to improve your future.

01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:39.310
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, like if there's any game...

01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:40.610
<v SPEAKER_1>Trump's going to be president.

01:43:40.610 --> 01:43:48.530
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, yeah, or like if there is any game which has enough information about what has happened in real life that you could use it to exploit the stock market.

01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:50.370
<v SPEAKER_2>Is there any game where Amazon's big?

01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:50.910
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:52.770
<v SPEAKER_1>Or like Netflix is big or something.

01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:54.090
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, so you just know to get in.

01:43:54.090 --> 01:43:55.370
<v SPEAKER_2>Because I often think about that.

01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:59.830
<v SPEAKER_2>Like, oh, if only you'd got in on Amazon, you know, when you were seven.

01:43:59.830 --> 01:44:00.370
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, that's the thing.

01:44:00.370 --> 01:44:10.970
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like, I think like GTA 6 will be that game because that will tell you everything about like what Rockstar perceives about this era that's worth kind of skewering or talking about.

01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:12.510
<v SPEAKER_2>But it will be one step removed.

01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:20.130
<v SPEAKER_2>It's not like you won't be able to play GTA 6 and then, you know, you won't be investing stocks in fucking Perseus, you know?

01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:23.530
<v SPEAKER_1>That's true.

01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:26.710
<v SPEAKER_1>But I'm more thinking like giving you ideas of general trends.

01:44:26.710 --> 01:44:32.070
<v SPEAKER_1>Like what game is there that tells you, by the way, Donald Trump was elected in 2016.

01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:34.030
<v SPEAKER_2>Netflix stock popped off.

01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.810
<v SPEAKER_2>That's what I'm saying.

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:37.390
<v SPEAKER_2>I was just hoping there might be a game out there.

01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:43.130
<v SPEAKER_2>Maybe like, do any of the football games have actual results from football matches that you could bet on?

01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:43.850
<v SPEAKER_1>No, they don't.

01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:49.810
<v SPEAKER_1>But I was going to say that like the football games, the adverts in game might give you an idea of which businesses are still thriving.

01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:50.690
<v SPEAKER_1>In 2024.

01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:53.050
<v SPEAKER_2>Mom, I've got a good feeling about Betfred.

01:44:56.610 --> 01:44:57.350
<v SPEAKER_1>That's good.

01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:58.970
<v SPEAKER_1>I love that thought exercise.

01:44:58.970 --> 01:45:00.390
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, God.

01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:03.510
<v SPEAKER_1>It's got to be like a better answer to this.

01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:07.350
<v SPEAKER_1>It's not quite a whole episode in that, but god damn.

01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:09.850
<v SPEAKER_1>What a great thought experiment.

01:45:09.850 --> 01:45:10.330
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:13.850
<v SPEAKER_1>Demo game hall of famer on PS1 or PS2, Matthew.

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:21.930
<v SPEAKER_1>So a game where your relationship with it is primarily shaped by experiencing it via a demo with them either with the console or official PlayStation magazine.

01:45:21.930 --> 01:45:24.790
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, this is where Siphon Filter comes back in.

01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:33.470
<v SPEAKER_2>I can tell my exciting story about how we set people on fire in the Siphon Filter demo like everyone else who played the Siphon Filter demo.

01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.890
<v SPEAKER_2>There you go.

01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:34.730
<v SPEAKER_1>Good choice.

01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:35.130
<v SPEAKER_1>Yep.

01:45:35.130 --> 01:45:35.330
<v SPEAKER_1>Good.

01:45:35.670 --> 01:45:37.250
<v SPEAKER_1>I feel nourished by that.

01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:43.190
<v SPEAKER_1>For me, it's Airblade on PS2, which I think is a criterion game.

01:45:43.450 --> 01:45:46.430
<v SPEAKER_1>I think it was, and that's got absolutely banging music.

01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:49.670
<v SPEAKER_1>It's basically like Tony Hawk Pro Skater, but you got a hoverboard.

01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:52.070
<v SPEAKER_1>I only ever played it in demo form.

01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:58.030
<v SPEAKER_1>I think I might have meddled with, I think I might have rented it and then not got massively into it.

01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:59.970
<v SPEAKER_1>It got sixes and sevens, I think.

01:45:59.970 --> 01:46:03.070
<v SPEAKER_1>It wasn't beloved, but Airblade was a top.

01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:04.890
<v SPEAKER_1>I played that demo 50 times.

01:46:04.890 --> 01:46:09.870
<v SPEAKER_1>It had a great time going around that one level, designed to show off what the game could do.

01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:10.450
<v SPEAKER_1>That was good.

01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:19.030
<v SPEAKER_1>On PS1, got to be the classic cooler world, playing as a beach ball and avoiding spikes on these quite basic puzzle environments.

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:25.050
<v SPEAKER_1>That was a good time to have in a demo disc that I would never ever need to experience the full game of.

01:46:25.050 --> 01:46:26.330
<v SPEAKER_1>And indeed I haven't, Matthew.

01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:27.670
<v SPEAKER_1>So here we are.

01:46:27.670 --> 01:46:29.630
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, almost there.

01:46:29.630 --> 01:46:32.490
<v SPEAKER_1>Most Nintendo-like game released on PlayStation.

01:46:32.490 --> 01:46:34.750
<v SPEAKER_2>I was going to say Tearaway.

01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:36.330
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, it's a good choice.

01:46:36.330 --> 01:47:11.050
<v SPEAKER_2>Not just because it's a bright, colourful platformer, but I think from the way that Medium Oil Cure just made the most of quite a weird piece of hardware, it felt like Nintendo going all out to try and show you that Wiimotion Plus was good, or this is what, here's a game that uses both screens, just a touch screen, the microphone of the DS, and Tearaway felt like the only Vita game that had half decent use of the backside touchpad, one of the weirdest pieces of hardware, inputs ever.

01:47:11.050 --> 01:47:15.370
<v SPEAKER_2>Like oh, a touch screen you can't see, that's interesting.

01:47:15.370 --> 01:47:21.870
<v SPEAKER_2>But you could like punch your fingers through into the game, and it used the camera, and you know, it just did everything.

01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:29.710
<v SPEAKER_2>I want more of that from Medium Molecule, less of the user-created stuff, more just make me one awesome game, and I'll play that quite happily.

01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:30.350
<v SPEAKER_1>Fair enough.

01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:40.590
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Astrobot is probably it by default, because it's literally mimicking how Nintendo has done third-person platforming, or platforming more generally.

01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:45.510
<v SPEAKER_1>Weirdly though, I think that the original Jack and Daxter feels like something rare would make.

01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.970
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:53.710
<v SPEAKER_1>That's like the closest to a game that would have been released on a Nintendo system at the time it was released in, but not by Nintendo itself.

01:47:54.010 --> 01:48:00.370
<v SPEAKER_1>There's a very rare energy to the original Jack and Daxter, in terms of collectibles, world design, that kind of stuff.

01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:04.550
<v SPEAKER_1>Even the characters and the attitude of it is not out of the realms of possibility.

01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:06.910
<v SPEAKER_1>But otherwise, Astro Bot by default, I think Matthew's nailed it though.

01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:10.390
<v SPEAKER_1>The Tearaway and the way it uses the hardware is a really good pick, Matthew.

01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:18.190
<v SPEAKER_2>Do you think it's a bit of a bummer that Jack and Daxter decided to go down this more dystopian route?

01:48:19.450 --> 01:48:30.310
<v SPEAKER_2>Is there a version where they don't do that and they still have a really lively 3D collectathon just with amazing graphics because it's survived through several generations?

01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:34.670
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, I think Ratchet and Clank ate their lunch a little bit on that.

01:48:34.670 --> 01:48:41.470
<v SPEAKER_1>But at the same time, they just became too preoccupied with the GTAification of the PS2 era.

01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:44.250
<v SPEAKER_1>That's why Jack and Daxter pushes in that direction.

01:48:44.290 --> 01:48:46.490
<v SPEAKER_1>Then at a certain point, it's too late to go back.

01:48:46.590 --> 01:48:52.990
<v SPEAKER_1>But you're right, it's like one of the all-time low-key, duff, creative choices that because it wasn't a good shooter.

01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:54.450
<v SPEAKER_1>It wasn't a good open world game.

01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:58.130
<v SPEAKER_1>Like it looked nice, the Jack and Jack 2 renegade, but it was not fun.

01:48:58.130 --> 01:49:00.930
<v SPEAKER_1>It was one of the most frustrating games on PS2 for sure.

01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:03.630
<v SPEAKER_1>And the original was so, so good, so well judged.

01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:04.910
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, I don't know.

01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:10.470
<v SPEAKER_1>I think that Jack and Daxter came along to be a slightly less interesting version of that type of thing.

01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:15.170
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't think Naughty Dog, as they are now, could ever reverse into doing another Jack and Daxter.

01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:24.850
<v SPEAKER_2>I think what it would do, if you've spent five years animating lead pipe on dog skull, I don't think you can then make a children's platformer.

01:49:24.850 --> 01:49:29.310
<v SPEAKER_2>I think it would just shatter your mind into a thousand pieces, a bit like the dogs.

01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:32.030
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, absolutely.

01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:33.310
<v SPEAKER_1>Good observation, Matthew.

01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:35.150
<v SPEAKER_1>Toughest hang in any PlayStation game.

01:49:35.150 --> 01:49:36.050
<v SPEAKER_1>What do you got for this?

01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:37.570
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, quite a few for this.

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:42.650
<v SPEAKER_2>To go back to Ratchet and Clank, Docs and Nefarious just fucking blows that guy.

01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:45.450
<v SPEAKER_2>He sucks.

01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:47.970
<v SPEAKER_2>Kimahri in Final Fantasy X.

01:49:47.970 --> 01:49:50.030
<v SPEAKER_1>Even more the Wocker.

01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:52.450
<v SPEAKER_2>I hate cat people.

01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:59.570
<v SPEAKER_2>The drunk priest or drunk guy, Reverend Swanson in Red Dead Redemption 2.

01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:01.290
<v SPEAKER_2>Always a bad hang, that guy.

01:50:01.290 --> 01:50:04.750
<v SPEAKER_2>Just, what's this sad alcoholic going to do next?

01:50:05.210 --> 01:50:08.470
<v SPEAKER_1>There's an Irish guy in the original Red Dead, he's a tough hang as well.

01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:10.970
<v SPEAKER_1>And that Gravedig is a tough hang in Red Dead Redemption as well.

01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:14.050
<v SPEAKER_2>Why do you think John Marston himself is a particularly nice guy?

01:50:14.050 --> 01:50:16.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, he's not like the nicest guy, but he's pretty cool.

01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:19.650
<v SPEAKER_2>His voice is quite grating.

01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:21.610
<v SPEAKER_1>You don't like John Marston's voice?

01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:22.730
<v SPEAKER_1>That's outrageous.

01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:24.910
<v SPEAKER_3>I don't know, I don't think he's cool.

01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:26.130
<v SPEAKER_2>I think he's believable.

01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:28.310
<v SPEAKER_2>I think he's quite a well-drawn character.

01:50:28.670 --> 01:50:36.130
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't think he's like, he's not a Clint Eastwood alike, or he's not like Lee Van Cleet, he's just a bloke.

01:50:36.130 --> 01:50:38.050
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, he talks too much to be a Wild West hero.

01:50:38.110 --> 01:50:40.350
<v SPEAKER_3>God, I'm just trying to do some shit.

01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:42.670
<v SPEAKER_3>You know, and you're like, yeah, yeah.

01:50:42.670 --> 01:51:00.250
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, that's because he's got to be, I mean, it's not like you can take Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven and make him an open world game character, because he's got to have barks that relate to like a horse running him over or whatever, and it's hard to make a character durable enough to survive that transition, you know?

01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:10.450
<v SPEAKER_2>You could say, god damn it, over and over again, that would be his only bark, and everyone would be like, did you play that weird Unforgiven game where he says, god damn it, about everything?

01:51:11.670 --> 01:51:14.210
<v SPEAKER_1>Rockstar Games generally have a lot of tough hags, don't they?

01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:16.030
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, they do.

01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:30.950
<v SPEAKER_1>Right, Trevor, you know, that psycho boy from Bully, I can't remember his name, and just many of like the, like Lazlo in GTA V itself, and just, they're just, they are not short of them, and yeah, they're everywhere.

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:36.590
<v SPEAKER_1>Like all the FBI guys in GTA V, I think Loki are like the stinkiest GTA characters.

01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:46.510
<v SPEAKER_1>They're rubbish, they're not funny, and they're so annoying, and they absolutely take over GTA Online as well, so you hear them so much.

01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:47.170
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, tough.

01:51:48.110 --> 01:51:52.910
<v SPEAKER_2>My final tough hang is the little girl Haruka in Yakuza.

01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:54.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, brutal, but correct.

01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:57.830
<v SPEAKER_2>Just don't get a kid out of my cool gangster game.

01:51:57.830 --> 01:52:03.730
<v SPEAKER_2>I know it's a big part of Kiryu's story, but I'm not interested in him as a fucking child minder.

01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:05.210
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, fair enough.

01:52:05.210 --> 01:52:06.550
<v SPEAKER_1>I kept this quite simple actually.

01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:14.530
<v SPEAKER_1>I got it down to, I think Wakka is fair objectively and Daxter, definitely.

01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:18.550
<v SPEAKER_1>Issun in Akami never shuts the fuck up.

01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:22.610
<v SPEAKER_1>That old, in fact, there's a lot of bad characters in Akami.

01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:28.450
<v SPEAKER_1>Because Amaterasu just sits there, and loads of other characters are talking, and you have the constant sound effects.

01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:29.630
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that's the joke, isn't it?

01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:32.710
<v SPEAKER_2>She's just stoically absorb everyone else's bullshit.

01:52:32.710 --> 01:52:35.170
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's it.

01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:40.930
<v SPEAKER_1>But you as the player also have to absorb that bullshit, so the game is punishing you as well.

01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:43.990
<v SPEAKER_1>And of course, Steve Trevor from Resident Evil Code Veronica.

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.570
<v SPEAKER_1>That guy fucking sucks.

01:52:45.570 --> 01:52:47.490
<v SPEAKER_1>Absolute Hall of Famer asshole.

01:52:47.490 --> 01:52:49.570
<v SPEAKER_1>He's the worst.

01:52:49.570 --> 01:52:51.530
<v SPEAKER_2>We've got to do another tough hang.

01:52:52.050 --> 01:52:54.130
<v SPEAKER_2>That's got Excel written all over it.

01:52:54.130 --> 01:52:54.730
<v SPEAKER_1>Definitely.

01:52:55.210 --> 01:52:58.350
<v SPEAKER_1>2025, it's in the pipe.

01:52:58.350 --> 01:53:02.830
<v SPEAKER_2>I know we go over some of this old ground, but I'll dredge up some new tough hangs.

01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:05.490
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, there's definitely been some more in the last few years.

01:53:05.590 --> 01:53:10.270
<v SPEAKER_1>So yeah, that woman, what was in PT, perfect.

01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:12.610
<v SPEAKER_1>Greatest hang in any PlayStation game, Matthew.

01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:14.710
<v SPEAKER_2>I think Sully's quite good hang.

01:53:14.710 --> 01:53:16.150
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, Sully's a great hang.

01:53:16.150 --> 01:53:17.550
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:20.450
<v SPEAKER_2>He's quite uncomplicated and fun.

01:53:20.670 --> 01:53:24.070
<v SPEAKER_1>More and more over the games as well, he becomes like a better and better hang.

01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:34.610
<v SPEAKER_1>By Uncharted 4, I savor every moment with Sully because I'm like, well, I've got to drive around this environment and get every single bark because this is the last game I ever get to hang out with Sully in.

01:53:35.070 --> 01:53:42.770
<v SPEAKER_1>And the only time we've ever been able to hang out in a casual environment where we're not being shot at, we don't have to run somewhere, we can actually just drive around and hang out.

01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:46.450
<v SPEAKER_1>So that's the best litmus test of a good hang, isn't it?

01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:49.270
<v SPEAKER_1>So I think, yeah, that's good, that's good.

01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:54.390
<v SPEAKER_1>I was otherwise going to pick Solid Snake Matthew, who I just always enjoy his company.

01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:55.410
<v SPEAKER_1>He's good.

01:53:55.410 --> 01:53:58.990
<v SPEAKER_1>But Sully is, well, it's a hall of famer, it's a good choice.

01:53:58.990 --> 01:54:02.150
<v SPEAKER_1>PlayStation game you love mostly for its music, Matthew.

01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:03.710
<v SPEAKER_2>You picked it earlier, Persona 5.

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:05.150
<v SPEAKER_2>I think it's up there.

01:54:05.150 --> 01:54:10.910
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, I like Persona 5 as a game, but its music is such a big part of it.

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:13.110
<v SPEAKER_2>Just how cool it sounds.

01:54:13.110 --> 01:54:15.650
<v SPEAKER_2>Just that battle theme will always cheer me up.

01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:17.270
<v SPEAKER_2>I listen to it all on YouTube.

01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:22.650
<v SPEAKER_2>I was going to do a bit and say destiny for this, for hope for the future.

01:54:22.650 --> 01:54:23.350
<v SPEAKER_2>Which is true.

01:54:23.410 --> 01:54:26.630
<v SPEAKER_2>It's a PlayStation game I only love for one track.

01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:30.590
<v SPEAKER_1>I just want to retroactively add Paul McCartney, as my toughest hang in any PlayStation game.

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.070
<v SPEAKER_2>What a hang.

01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:33.890
<v SPEAKER_2>Hope for the future.

01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:39.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Did you see we had at least one person in the Discord who was like, yeah, I think Matthew's right about hope for the future.

01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:40.930
<v SPEAKER_1>It's actually like really good.

01:54:40.930 --> 01:54:45.030
<v SPEAKER_1>And I was just like, oh, my God, people have people will just have any opinions now.

01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:46.750
<v SPEAKER_3>You know, that is a lot.

01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:47.650
<v SPEAKER_2>But you respect me.

01:54:47.650 --> 01:54:49.470
<v SPEAKER_3>Why can't you respect them?

01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:51.310
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, I was.

01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:52.090
<v SPEAKER_1>I know you.

01:54:52.090 --> 01:54:54.310
<v SPEAKER_2>Do you not respect my destiny opinion?

01:54:54.310 --> 01:55:04.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, I do respect it because I understand your whole deal and how like and like your weird music, like how it's like Danny Elfman, Randy Newman or Bust for you.

01:55:04.890 --> 01:55:07.450
<v SPEAKER_1>Like that's like that's how you kind of explain the prism through which you.

01:55:07.450 --> 01:55:11.410
<v SPEAKER_2>That paints me in such a curse like Danny Elfman particularly.

01:55:11.410 --> 01:55:11.990
<v SPEAKER_1>Sorry.

01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:13.370
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, John Williams as well.

01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:23.870
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm just saying that like you're just so, it's such a, considering how broad your taste, like how much you will watch, read and play anything, I think you have the appetite for that.

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:24.390
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:26.330
<v SPEAKER_1>Just with music, you're so specific.

01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:28.770
<v SPEAKER_1>It's almost like I just understand what you're holding in this.

01:55:28.770 --> 01:55:42.250
<v SPEAKER_2>I actually have more eclectic music tastes than I let on, but it's like the last bit of my personality, which I haven't sort of pimped out for entertainment value on the podcast or in my work.

01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:44.870
<v SPEAKER_2>It's like the one bit which can remain private.

01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:45.250
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:47.510
<v SPEAKER_1>I just allow you to, I respect that.

01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:57.450
<v SPEAKER_2>But at work, there was like, when are you going to, because we, you know, different people can, we've got a speaker in the office that plays music, and different people play their playlists on Spotify through it.

01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:58.590
<v SPEAKER_1>A lot of pressure.

01:55:58.670 --> 01:55:59.330
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:55:59.330 --> 01:56:04.710
<v SPEAKER_2>And often people, you know, Matt Elliott will often say to me, like, hey, why don't you play one of your playlists?

01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:07.630
<v SPEAKER_2>And I have got playlists, but I just, I can't do it.

01:56:07.630 --> 01:56:09.550
<v SPEAKER_2>I can't kind of put myself out there like that.

01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:12.170
<v SPEAKER_2>It's just hope for the future, ten times in a row.

01:56:12.170 --> 01:56:30.570
<v SPEAKER_1>Hope for the future is like a, that's fair ground to make fun of you for, I think, but it's, but otherwise, well no, I mean, it's just, it's just because to me it seems so honking, but I take your point that it is just a normal Paul McCartney song that is made cursed by the Star Wars Holiday Special Ass presentation of that video.

01:56:30.570 --> 01:56:31.090
<v SPEAKER_1>Fair enough.

01:56:31.090 --> 01:56:33.470
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, moving on then.

01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:36.430
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, my playstation game I love mostly for its music.

01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:37.950
<v SPEAKER_1>It's gotta be Ridge Racer Type 4.

01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:40.030
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, I also wrote that down.

01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:41.310
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, the racing is great in that game.

01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:48.070
<v SPEAKER_1>We both played it and we were like, well, I could see why this would be really good, but the music and the menus were really why that game was amazing.

01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:51.010
<v SPEAKER_1>You know, which is a weird thing to say, but it is true.

01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:52.990
<v SPEAKER_1>Music is just so good in that game.

01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:55.270
<v SPEAKER_1>I also put Luminance for this, Matthew.

01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:56.670
<v SPEAKER_1>You could also put Tetris Effect for this.

01:56:57.110 --> 01:57:02.390
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I felt like I'd covered Tetris Effect in my early bit, so I didn't want to just repeat myself.

01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:03.030
<v SPEAKER_1>Absolutely.

01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:04.070
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, fair enough.

01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.890
<v SPEAKER_1>Last two categories.

01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:09.950
<v SPEAKER_1>Best looking PlayStation game in respect to the limitations of the console hardware, Matthew.

01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:12.630
<v SPEAKER_3>I think maybe Metal Gear Solid 1.

01:57:12.630 --> 01:57:19.070
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, it's because it's recent in the memory, but also it uses every bit of that system's capabilities to its fullest advantage.

01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:22.030
<v SPEAKER_2>It just looks so sophisticated for its time.

01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:25.830
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, like the best cracks in the wall and blood splatter.

01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:28.470
<v SPEAKER_2>We talked about this on the Patreon episode.

01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:30.190
<v SPEAKER_2>Was it Patreon episode?

01:57:30.190 --> 01:57:30.490
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:57:30.490 --> 01:57:32.130
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that's the real deal.

01:57:32.130 --> 01:57:33.210
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, that's fair.

01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:39.050
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm going to put Akami for this because at the end of the generation on PS2, that was really, really good.

01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:47.090
<v SPEAKER_1>But there were loads of games at the end of the PS2 generation that I thought were pretty phenomenal in presentation and showed how much you can achieve with it.

01:57:47.090 --> 01:57:54.510
<v SPEAKER_1>I think, actually, at the time, I think I thought all the Rockstar games looked a bit jank because the character models were so stylized.

01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:56.910
<v SPEAKER_1>But I've come to really appreciate that style.

01:57:56.910 --> 01:58:00.050
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Bully is a really amazing looking game on PS2.

01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:09.790
<v SPEAKER_1>Shadow of the Colossus, Ico just did great things with filters and textures that trick your brain into thinking you're looking at moving paintings or something.

01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:12.030
<v SPEAKER_1>Just really powerful stuff.

01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:18.470
<v SPEAKER_1>This is a less imaginative answer, but Uncharted 3 on PS3 was fucking amazing.

01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:24.890
<v SPEAKER_1>I still think that's like to look at now, to go into that pub with all the Mitchell Brothers at the start and see all the detail.

01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:28.070
<v SPEAKER_1>It's not really far off what you can achieve now with games.

01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:30.370
<v SPEAKER_1>The scale of it is much more narrowed down.

01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:37.790
<v SPEAKER_1>But considering that's a 12-year-old game, it's pretty amazing what they were able to get out of PS3 with that thing.

01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:41.470
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay, Matthew, last category, top PlayStation waifu.

01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:42.390
<v SPEAKER_1>What have you got for this one?

01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:45.410
<v SPEAKER_2>Tifa from Final Fantasy VII.

01:58:45.410 --> 01:58:47.890
<v SPEAKER_1>I've got, shamefully, I've also got Tifa.

01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:51.210
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, I mean, I think by default it's Lara Croft, right?

01:58:51.210 --> 01:58:56.770
<v SPEAKER_1>But I think over time, accumulatively, I think it probably is Tifa for me also.

01:58:56.850 --> 01:58:57.910
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

01:58:57.910 --> 01:59:03.930
<v SPEAKER_2>Tifa, I could actually imagine myself having a conversation with and having a bit more in common with her.

01:59:03.930 --> 01:59:11.110
<v SPEAKER_2>Lara Croft, I think, would just be sick of me, because she just lives such an active lifestyle and I'm so not that person.

01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:16.270
<v SPEAKER_1>That's me looking on Tinder and people who have workouts frequently.

01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:25.150
<v SPEAKER_1>I might as well not even swipe because we're so far apart from like, I need someone who, someone self-loathing when they're exercising.

01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:29.030
<v SPEAKER_1>That's like my whole vibe and I can't be doing, I agree.

01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:30.910
<v SPEAKER_1>Lara Croft would be sickened by me.

01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:32.330
<v SPEAKER_1>We look like different species.

01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:34.030
<v SPEAKER_1>She would just be absolutely appalled.

01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:38.970
<v SPEAKER_2>I think the class thing as well, because all her friends are probably quite posh.

01:59:40.050 --> 01:59:43.290
<v SPEAKER_2>I just think, I don't know, they'd be like, you do what for a living?

01:59:43.290 --> 01:59:44.590
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm like, a games journalist?

01:59:44.590 --> 01:59:46.790
<v SPEAKER_2>Do you know what that is?

01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:49.050
<v SPEAKER_2>Just awkward.

01:59:49.050 --> 01:59:53.370
<v SPEAKER_1>Being honest, actually, it probably is Chloe from Uncharted 2 as well.

01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:54.330
<v SPEAKER_1>Uncharted 4, Chloe.

01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:58.370
<v SPEAKER_1>Uncharted Lost Legacy, Chloe.

01:59:58.370 --> 02:00:01.630
<v SPEAKER_1>Chloe was like Claudia Black's voice, first of all.

02:00:01.630 --> 02:00:05.170
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, men of our generation and a little bit older.

02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:12.450
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Claudia Black, there's some fireworks that that voice makes go off in your brain for whatever reason.

02:00:12.450 --> 02:00:15.990
<v SPEAKER_1>Maybe I'm speaking personally here rather than universally.

02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:21.450
<v SPEAKER_1>But then combined with the specific attitude of the character, I think she's up there too.

02:00:21.690 --> 02:00:23.830
<v SPEAKER_2>But again, an adventurer.

02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:29.250
<v SPEAKER_2>She'd be happy watching 10 straight episodes of Day of the Jackal on Now TV.

02:00:29.250 --> 02:00:31.370
<v SPEAKER_2>Probably not.

02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:32.510
<v SPEAKER_1>I think Elena would be.

02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:34.090
<v SPEAKER_1>She's happy to settle down, I think.

02:00:34.090 --> 02:00:34.810
<v SPEAKER_2>That's fine.

02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:37.050
<v SPEAKER_2>That's absolutely fine.

02:00:37.050 --> 02:00:37.610
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

02:00:37.610 --> 02:00:39.570
<v SPEAKER_1>That is enough on that category.

02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:40.570
<v SPEAKER_1>Let's never talk about it.

02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:42.770
<v SPEAKER_1>Again, thank you for listening to the podcast.

02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:47.190
<v SPEAKER_1>That was a lot of information in two hours, but I enjoyed it, Matthew.

02:00:47.190 --> 02:00:48.530
<v SPEAKER_1>Where can people get you on social media?
