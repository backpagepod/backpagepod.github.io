Hello and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, it's a gloomy bank holiday Monday at the end of a long weekend. Gloomy as in the weather outside. However, the games we're discussing this episode, quite exciting, Doom the Dark Ages we're gonna kick off with.
We're also returning to that game, Hundred Line, is it called, or The Hundred Line?
The Hundred Line, Last Defense Academy.
And you've also been playing a new Metroidvania that I keep getting ads for on Instagram, which I attribute to your WhatsApp messages, actually. Oh, weird.
Yeah, so I've played a little bit of Siege and the Sandfox, and I also have some thoughts on Blades of Fire.
Of course, yeah, the new game from your guys at MercurySteam. You are the world's number one MercurySteam fan. So look forward to hearing about those.
I've only played Doom for this episode, but it's a big release. So I think it's OK to hang an episode off of that.
I think so.
Indeed. So let's get into it, Matthew. Doom the Dark Ages.
Should we talk a little bit about the history of Doom and how we kind of feel about it? Because I guess like the new Doom game. So Doom 2016 comes along and it is sort of like reset after a long gestating Doom 4 project doesn't really kind of come to fruition.
And then when it does kind of come back, it's it's Doom as you remember it. But the actual mechanics are contemporize. There is a use of melee finishers to restock your ammo and health.
And I kind of like I would say a momentum of chaining like finishers together basically to sort of like clear out rooms of enemies. And quite an interesting notion, basically flashing enemies and then like a cool animation happens and the enemy dies. Then you kind of keep moving.
It was like these little punctuation points in the combat. Then Doom Eternal comes along 2020 big pandemic game for a lot of people, I'm sure. And basically that that game is similar to Doom 2016 but layers on a lot more in the way of movement and dashing and just kind of like speedy combat and always moving kind of combat and making sure you're aware of what's sort of like going on in all directions at all times, basically circling the environment and doing all this kind of like mad shit.
It's just very, very fast paced and it turned out maybe a bit more divisive than I was expecting from when I played it. I thought it was magnificent Doom Eternal and preferred it to Doom 2016. And yeah, I think the pace of it maybe upset people.
Is there anything you want to add to that, like about the kind of how people feel about Doom 2016 and Eternal as a kind of set up to this conversation around the Dark Ages?
Yeah, it's interesting. They're very different games, but you can see the through line. You know, certainly the idea of building the game around these quite intense pressure points in Doom 2016 where you'd be locked in an arena and you just have to deal with an onslaught for a certain amount of time.
And then they made the nature of that onslaught and how you deal with it that much more complicated in Eternal. It's been a bit of a blind spot for me. I really loved Eternal and it was only really in the run up to the Dark Ages that I heard a lot of people saying, oh, I hope Dark Ages is steps away from Eternal because I didn't really like that, which I genuinely wasn't sort of aware was a sort of stance.
I thought everyone was kind of in on Eternal.
Agreed.
But that's just because I liked it and I assumed if I liked it, then it would probably click with most people because for some reason, I have generic everyman tastes in my head, but obviously not. I'm obviously way more hardcore than I thought I was in my appreciation of Eternal. I've got a lot of fondness for that game also because it gave me some very juicy YouTube wins when I was on Rock Paper Shotgun.
A real pleasure covering that game. I think I quitted myself OK in the footage because it's one of those games where people are looking for a reason to not listen to someone if it looks like they don't know how to play it. I managed to get away with it, I think, which is not bad considering I was playing the PC version with a fucking controller.
Suck on that mouse and keyboard nerds.
Yeah. I didn't realize there was this sentiment either. Then it's interesting because I think that in describing the difference between Doom Eternal and Doom Eternal in the Dark Ages, they went with basically players...
In Doom Eternal, you're a fighter jet and in this, you're like an iron tank basically. So you are slow moving, thumpy, deadly. You feel the physicality of the Doom Slayer, whereas in Doom Eternal, you're just incredibly quick paced.
You're just rapid dashing around the arena, bombing enemies and running in these circles and taking people out. What I liked about Eternal is that it was very Twitch-based, but it felt fair. And I thought the pace was as fast as you could make it without it becoming unreasonably difficult.
And that was a game where I did a lot of the optional combat challenges. I think I might have done pretty much all of them, where you basically activate some optional enemies in the level and then defeat them. And some of those were so hard, but I always thought they were fair.
And that's what I liked about it. So like you, I was surprised to learn that there were Philistines. I mean, sorry, I mean, normal human beings who do not like Doom Eternal, people who definitely have taste in first-person shooters, and I'm not, nor would I cast any aspersions in that respect.
But it does feel like they've got their own way a little bit with doing the Dark Ages, which is definitely a reset from that. You can't, there's no like dash command or anything like that. You don't really, you barely jump in the game.
It's very much a game of like, in the kind of like classic Doom fashion, a lot of different slow-moving projectiles, some quick-moving projectiles going towards you, and you kind of like dodging them or using this new Shield Sword ability that you have to kind of like block them, or in some cases, when the orange fire turns to green, parrying them and sending those attacks back towards enemies. And so, yeah, it's interesting, because I think I thought at first when I started playing this that it was a step down in intensity from Doom Eternal. And then I think what I realized is that you need to get through about four or five levels before you realize that it is about as intense, but it takes a while to get to the point where you understand exactly what the combat rhythm is and what the complexity is and how you deal with everything the game throws at you.
And I think it may be like butters up the runway, basically, to make it feel like it's going to be less hardcore than it actually ends up being. That's how I feel after finishing nine out of the 22 levels in the game, Matthew. But you've had it a lot longer than me.
So what do you think? Is that a fair take? And what do you think of doing the Dark Ages in general?
It definitely reaches a similar place of intensity, though, because it's not as much about crazy aerial movement. You know, you are just a lot more grounded in this, but you're having to definitely keep on your toes, definitely seize opportunities quickly. And I think that's where it is similar to Eternal.
There's a little bit of like a very fast problem-solving mentality is at the kind of heart of both games in terms of prioritizing enemies, knowing that some weapons can take down certain enemies quicker, not to the same degree that they did in Eternal, where it felt very much like certain weapons were just matched to certain enemies. But here, like some of that remains, that you know, if I see one of those electronic plasma shields, you know I'm getting one of the big electronic bad boys out. That's the way of things.
What I think it does do is maybe like onboard you better, there is more of a build up over probably like the first act in terms of like introduction of weapons, introduction of enemy types, just the general kind of size of the battlefield. You know, they don't start getting quite really unworkable until probably about where you are now. And Eternal was quite full on like from the off.
It's how I remember it anyway. Eternal kind of like forced you to engage with all those interlocking systems in every fight or you just weren't getting anywhere. And here I feel like it's a lot more flexible, you know, certainly in the first half of the game.
I wouldn't be surprised if there were different people, you know, say said they got to the end of this game only using two different weapons and that everyone is pairing of weapons was different. Like I still think that's feasible. So a little bit further than you are, I'm on like mission 18, so I'm quite nearly in now.
I had a really great trip through the first 12, 13 levels of this. I really like the drip feed of things, the gradual escalation. I really liked getting my head around these slightly flatter battlefields and how you have to tackle those differently.
I will say it's slightly dried up in terms of like big surprises or big gameplay twists, maybe in this like third act. I won't spoil it for people who haven't played it, because it goes to a different kind of location which you haven't seen in the games before. And it almost uses that sort of palette swap, I guess, as like, well, this is new, isn't it?
Like, you've never been here before. But I do feel like I've kind of, I feel like I've seen everything it has to offer at this point. And it has slowed my progress a little on this final stretch.
But there was a point where I thought this was just absolutely flying, cooking. It was absolutely brilliant. I think I messaged you saying, oh, this is just so good.
But I don't think it, just by dint of being a 22 level campaign, I just don't think you can sustain it.
It's a really interesting game in terms of pacing, because I think that, so what's interesting is, is it does have what I would describe as traditional New Doom levels in terms of, like relatively, nearly a first person shooter maps with a few secrets to find off on the sides. And then I think it has, I've played through two of them, but I understand there are three. What you would describe as open world levels basically, or at least, at least wide linear.
They are, you have like multiple objectives in different places and then what order you tackle them in and some of the secrets you find is, is left to you to unpick largely. And so what that means is there are some levels in this where you can, I would say reasonably double the length of the level by going to find every secret in it. And so that I think actually means that the campaign length can extend for multiple hours longer, which my memory of Doom Eternal is a little hazy because COVID has happened since then, and a lot of other things.
But I don't remember Doom Eternal levels ever feeling that prolonged. There are levels in this where I feel like I spent more than an hour in a place, or like 90 minutes in a place. And so what you get for that is what I would describe as phenomenal little mini dungeons for you to unpick, sometimes mini levels within the levels with like optional enemies to kill and bonuses to get.
And they're fantastic, they're great, but it does mean that I can just feel it stretching out and being the longest game. I feel like I've been playing it for a while already and I'm still under halfway through it, you know. So did you know that as you were going through the levels as well, the way that they've laid in optional stuff?
I think maybe that's part of it, in that I've been pretty thorough. I think in all those levels I've done, I think the completion rate is mostly 100% across them. A few of them are like dipped down only as low as like 90%.
Because I missed like one bit of fucking gold or something, which is incredibly irritating. And because of that, I've seen as much Doom The Dark Ages as there is in this game. And there is loads of it.
And I don't know if they've struggled or had a challenge to gauge the pacing of the main campaign when there is so much optional stuff. Like I absolutely love it when you go into some weird little area and all of a sudden, it spawns a collection of enemies in a space, the kind of space that you haven't sort of experienced them in, or a combo of enemies where you're like, oh shit, I've never had to deal with this and this at the same time.
Yeah.
But because they have so many of those, they do eventually run out of combos. And short of being like, here's five Hell Knights, there are only so many sort of variations they can do. I think what I liked most about the side content is that, generally speaking, it feels like a lot of it takes you into underground areas or caves or little side bits.
And I quite like suddenly having the kind of enclosed space. I quite like the intensity of that. The switching from very big open battlefields, which have a very different feel to anything in Doom 2016 or Doom Eternal.
To basically a flat field, but with like a hundred things to shoot. And you're like, oh, OK, I just have to get my head around that. I, you know, I...
In those claustrophobic spaces, it suddenly maybe becomes a bit more like Doom Eternal. Well, you're locked in here. There's not much space for you and this thing to coexist.
So you really have to take it down as fast as possible. You really have to be on top of like all your resource management to just get through that. Where out in the air, like, I can kind of breathe a little bit.
Not too much because I imagine the atmosphere is disgusting and you wouldn't want to be breathing that shit in.
Yeah, I like those spaces too, because what I like as well is that you know, as you know, it's very much like a flat, flatter sort of like level design for Doom, the Dark Ages more generally than what you're expecting with the amount of platforming that you did in Doom Eternal. It's a complete left turn from that. But I would say that some of those optional areas and the way that they're designed do give it the levels a little bit of verticality, which I think is needed and does help.
I would say that one thing that I thought was maybe a little bit too kind on the player was the map just tells you where all the secrets are. And I didn't realize that until after I finished Siege part one, which is the first open world level that you play. And that was a wonderful level to play without knowing where everything was.
But it was right at the end of that level when I was doing the mop up that I realized that the map did just tell me where all the secrets were. And I do think that that should be a thing they ask you at the start of the game is do you want tips on where to find this? Because otherwise we won't gray out the areas where the secrets are, which are, it's really plain on the map where the secrets are going to be.
And we won't tell you which secrets they are marked with icons. I think they should have given you an option for that in the difficulty section. Because I think it does diminish the feeling of discovery where you can just simply tick them off.
I have been doing that. I cottoned on to the map thing almost instantaneously. And I think because I was aware Doom always has secrets, so I thought I'd go in the map and see how thorough is this actually going to be.
And once I knew the spell was broken, I couldn't not bring up the map. And I've seen reviews where people have said, I'm just bringing up the map every 20 seconds to see where things are. And it's like, yeah, I am doing that, which is kind of grim.
And as long as the option remains, I just can't train myself not to do it. And it definitely makes those spaces seem less interesting as a result. It was funny because I saw your, it was either a Discord message or a tweet or something about the secret areas impressing you in this.
And I was like, I mean, they're right there on the map. I mean, nothing's kind of surprised me in terms of its location. Like some of the actual nature of those side areas, you know, it's been fun.
I definitely agree with you on that. But yeah, the map thing, it's like, it's kind of my fault, but it's also the game's fault. It's just a bit of a self-own all round.
It's them not quite trusting the player. And once, you know, not to blame anyone, but I'm going to blame the critics of Doom Eternal for that Matthew, because they were cowards as previously established, but nobody joking. I think it's just, first of all, putting, you know, guides and walkthrough writers out of business, because you can just literally look in the menu and it has a walkthrough for you.
But I thought that the whole thing with Doom Secrets was that they were like quite hard to find back in the day, and that was part of the DNA of them. So, yeah, I think it's, yeah, you're right. I did post that literally when I got to the end of Siege Part 1 and thought what an amazing map that was to pick.
It had so much more in it than I thought it did just from following the quest icons. You know, it had so much more there. And that is part of the game.
It's something the game does really well. Honestly, it honestly is. And, if they hadn't had that map feature, I think you would agree with me more that that is a great part of the game.
But you're right. You can't see it that way because to you it's just the game.
The only part that I got to experience absolutely as they intended is the only thing they don't put on the map, which is those wolf statues you have to shoot. Have you come across any of those?
Yeah, I did the first. I've just done two sets of those.
So there's a few levels where there's like three wolf statues and they don't appear on the map and they are just positioned in like really arsehole places just out of your line of sight or places you wouldn't naturally look. I think the longest I spent in a level was 90 minutes because I spent half an hour running laps of it at the end trying to find one wolf statue.
Right.
It either gives stuff up too easily or makes me run laps of an empty level for half an hour and the sweet spot is definitely in the middle.
I would argue the sweet spot is they should still have that wolf thing in there but you shouldn't be compulsively chasing them.
Yeah.
It should still come down to you to find them but the game has like, yeah, it's babied you too much with the rest of the collectibles so it's no longer satisfying you as a challenge.
It's terrible. I'm so busted.
No, it's not just going to be you, that's going to be everyone who plays this and realises that map that is there. It's just a shame, you know, it's the missed opportunity I think.
One thing that does make me laugh about the Secret Content is that when you find it, it plays like a guitar strain, you know, like a bassy noise, like daaaang, and it's so bassy that, because it comes out of the PlayStation 5 controller if you play it, it's so bassy that the fucking controller distorts, it like crackles because it can't actually play it, you're like, this game is so sort of like metal and badass, but the controller just, like, the birthday card quality speaker inside the PS5 controller, it's just like, fucking kill me, please, please don't pick up any more gold.
Yeah, it has big, if anyone's ever played the GBA ports of Final Fantasy games, like 4, 5 and 6, the way that the music tries to crush down, like that's what the SNES can do basically for coming out of that little purple speaker. It's a very similar experience of like, I'm not sure you can handle this, dog. I think this is beyond your grasp.
First thing I did was turn down the speaker volume because it was so loud and it was just like, oh man, that is just like, that's a bit much, I think. Yeah, so let's talk about the combat in more granular detail, Matthew, because some might say this is the Mario Kart world of first-person shooters, big, wide, flat maps to drive between, and loads of visibility of everything in front of you. So as you know, it's a game where you will sometimes have what feels like, or literally is, a hundred things in front of you to kill.
And they can range from what are basically living gun turrets, like incredibly disposable enemies, whom you can chuck your shield saw at and kill instantly. And then sort of everything in between really. Enemies that take a lot of damage, enemies have armor you have to crack before you can take them down.
Flying enemies, enemies that are pelting projectiles at you, like literal tanks where you can deflect their fire back at them, parry back at them with the shield saw and take them out that way. And so it basically results in this combat system where you are, I would say, managing crowds way more than you ever did in Doom Eternal. That's really like what the combat system is about.
And what that came down to for me was understanding which weapon is best equipped to take out which kind of crowd and then kind of picking apart each layer of what's in front of you based on that. And at first I thought that was too inert, a combat, sort of like a principle to build the combat system around. Simply because they've taken glory kills out of Doom the Dark Ages with the rare exception of there are certain types of bosses whom you kill and then Doomguy rips his punches through, steals their heart, takes their heart out and gets a permanent stat boost basically.
Every one of those lovely the game pauses for a minute while a kill animation happens has basically been removed from the game. They've taken all of those out and you do still have those moments, so instant kills, but they are basically just a regular melee attack and you keep moving. I think they've done that to preserve the momentum of the game, to not have you locked into it too much.
But what it does mean is that a certain part of the design language of Doom Eternal and Doom 2016 was those animations and the pause they gave you in combat before you pick yourself up and kept going again. It was like, right, I'm still alive, I'm taking this guy out and in half a second, I'm going to have to keep moving again. And without that, it does mean that the combat initially, I think, lacks a little bit of a...
It feels like it needs something else at the center of it. Like it's just a little bit too... It's like part of the onboarding thing, like you say, it's really just giving you very slowly building up your arsenal.
And then you do reach a point about five levels in where you have closer to a full arsenal and then the game, I would say the kind of rhythm of it and it basically being a game of managing all those layers of crowds and you understanding how to do that and how intense that can get, combined with an increasingly colorful arsenal as a result of the upgrades that you can unlock, means that it does have, the combat system does have like an identity of its own and like we say, an intensity of its own that I think means it is ultimately a success. I wonder what your thoughts were on that.
I agree with a lot of that. I think it is quite hard to talk about the combat without recognizing the role the shield plays in the middle, which is actually quite a precision tool in the middle of your moveset because you can sort of charge with it to attack, sort of home in on an enemy, which basically sort of replaces the kind of grapple hook that was attached to the shotgun in Doom Eternal. So you can kind of get around the battlefield quite fast.
It's a bit of an emergency exit for quite a slow moving character, which I really like. Then you've got throwing it at enemies, which can destroy superheated armor, which is like a kind of key part of peeling back the layers on certain enemy types. My favorite thing is when you throw it at flesh and it basically becomes like a buzz saw that sticks in someone, and it hurts them a little bit, but it mostly sort of takes them out of the action for like five seconds.
So it's kind of like you wait just your horses, you wait there for a second while this thing kind of churns into your chest, and I'll focus on these other things. There are power ups you can get that mean your weapons begin to combo with it. There's one where you shoot at the rotating shield and it ricochets shots off into other enemies, so the whole thing becomes this little kind of kill fest.
But I definitely have certain things where I'm like, well, I know I don't really want to be dealing with that right now, so I'm going to put the shield in that, and then we just don't have to worry about what's happening on the left side of the screen for a few seconds. And that feels like that kind of problem-solving magic. In terms of the broader battlefield stuff, you have these really open spaces that it's quite hard to ever be standing in a position where you have the whole fight in front of you to kind of look at.
One of the things I think you have to get your head around quite quickly in this game is that if you move into the middle of the crowd, there will be crowd behind you, and then all of a sudden, you're just getting fucked from every angle, and it's a bit of a nightmare, and you might think the game is shit.
Mmm, that's true.
But I think you just have to glean that that is a bad tactic. It's quite obvious that that will end you quite quickly, and I ended up seeing it more like, almost like I'm this giant broom of death sweeping around the battlefield, and I almost work out a route round. I'm like, well, I'm going to go down the left side, and we're just going to clear that out, and then we're going to loop back around and deal with these people.
And it's kind of, have you ever seen someone icing a cake with one of those flat things, where they swirl it around, and it's just like one move, and you're like, and this is how we get everyone all at once. I sort of think of it like that, except instead of icing, I'm like chewing flesh with bone shards from a ravager. I really like that it gives you a couple of guns, which are like, bullets are going to go everywhere.
And this is like quite a good thing for just getting rid of like 20 people at once. A lot of those things then have an element, which supercharges them and makes them even, you know, like, if you use this thing, when you're kind of already in a bit of a sort of flow state, it's going to hit twice, twice as fast and hit twice as hard, and then you're really cooking. There was nothing like that in Eternal, like Eternal is so surgical, there was never a moment where I felt like I was just emptying, just standing there, mini gunning down fucking tens to twenty, fifty people all at once.
Yeah.
Like working out that that is valid, tactical approach, and also just really fun, is kind of like this game at its best for me in terms of, I finally have a kind of foothold in this battlefield, and I'm watching like physics enabled flesh go left, right and center. I mean, that's that's that's gold, right?
It is, yeah. And it is really satisfying the way that enemies response to the, yeah, to the way you shoot them. Basically, white, white sort of like skin turning to like flesh, basically like muscle color as the flesh skin is peeled off with you firing loads of like ground up skulls at them basically.
And I think as well, like when you first get those weapons, some of them feel a little bit inert until you do get a couple of those upgrades. And then suddenly, the skulls are like, you're chewing through them like twice as fast. And there's a lovely little yellow sort of flash in the, the weapon itself and the rate of fire speeds up.
And you're right. It does become exciting to be the icing on the cake, be the broom. Should have been the tagline in this game, be the broom, be the broom.
Circling these enemies. And what's really interesting about that is that, as you correctly identified, I didn't really point out, the shield saw is really key to, you know, a lot of how you deal with the enemies. It is good for clearing out all kinds of enemies.
Like you say, there's an element of, I will lodge this here in you, this, this bullshit invisible enemy. Just to stop you from being invisible and also to stop you from attacking me while I'm mowing down a lot of your less skilled lads that surround you. But like the shield saw can also kind of trap you.
If you do, it can be very tempting to just like do the homing attack with the shield saw, barrel towards an enemy, smash them. And then like you say, find yourself in the middle of the battlefield being shot at from different sides. And I will say the game, whether deliberately or not, does not give you much information about who is shooting you behind you and how many people there are.
And so that, which I think I would probably level as a light criticism towards it, because I think it could use a little bit of like turn the fuck around, you're about to die. Especially because even though you have like a hundred health to start with and 50 armor, really you have about five health and like some enemies will take two of that health off you and most enemies will take one of that health off you. You'll see like a hundred and ten health go to about like ten in like a second.
When I get one shard of armor, I'm like what's the fucking point? Like we may as well just not pick that up. You know it, I know it.
That thing is not sticking around for long.
Yeah, I would say that a power up shouldn't be a rounding error. You know what I mean? I would say that's like one thing I would say about this game.
Yeah, so it's really interesting because it is always the most tempting. It's just to like, yeah, get the shield, sort of prep the shield, and then bow towards the enemy, like, right, I'm going to get up close and fuck this guy up. And the game tells you don't do that because it'll be like, the really big guys will start hitting you with flames, which you can't really block effectively, and they completely fuck you up.
And you realize that keeping your distance is often the best approach, but it requires a little bit of discipline. So yeah, I would say that while Doom Eternal's combat system for me, and 2016, but I've not played it for a long, long time, they clicked for me straight away. And I knew exactly what was great about them.
This was much more of a learning process of what is it they're going for? Is what they're going for exciting? And how do I learn how to get the most out of this system?
And I think I ultimately came down that I don't think the combat is as good as Doom Eternal, but it's like close enough that it's not really a huge deal. What do you think?
Yeah, and it's its own thing, you know? Actually Doom Eternal is so much more clearly a sequel to Doom 2016 than Dark Ages is a sequel to either of those. I like that a team that is very confident in abilities kind of has nothing to prove, decide to try something quite different.
And, you know, I don't think it is as sophisticated or quite as thrilling as Eternal, but that's okay. I've played Eternal and I really liked it. You know, I don't need another load of Eternal, really.
That's that's absolutely fine. I think there are definitely like weaknesses that emerge over time. Like I say, you just get a little bit too familiar with things or new enemy types stop turning up.
So in terms of enemies, you've almost got like three types, the absolutely basic fodder, then you've got like medium sized threats, and then you've got things which are often introduced as a self-contained boss fight and then become a generic enemy, you know, in the subsequent levels.
Yeah.
And I do feel like that third tier, the really nasty stuff that comes more into play in the second half of the game, they are a little limiting in combat in the way that the other types aren't. They definitely rely a lot more on parrying to open up windows to attack them, and they're basically invincible for various bullshit reasons until that happens.
Yeah.
In those moments, it's almost like, you remember the Marauders from Eternal, which everyone kicked off about, where you had to like shoot them just as their eyes glinted green, which feels like the beginnings of all the parrying business in the Dark Ages.
Yeah.
Let's do that enemy, but a whole game. And it mostly works. The green projectile is quite slow, quite clear, very generous hit window, all that stuff.
It's just very fun to spang stuff back in people's faces. But when there is an enemy and you're like, we're just, I'm just waiting for you to do an attack. So I've got a chance to do something here.
Like you're shooting your regular projectiles at me. I need you to do a green projectile just so we can actually start having a fight. They are a little tiresome and they sort of, I wouldn't say you completely stink up the joint in the later acts, but your heart sinks a little bit of this is going to be a fight about that thing.
Because then you basically have to take out everything apart from that and then deal with that on its own terms.
Right, right.
It's quite hard to weave that in. In the same way with the, you know, the Marauders, of which there are maybe only like four or five in the whole campaign in Eternal, but they stuck out like sore thumbs because they were a pain in the arse. Yeah, here there's just a couple, there's this fucking witchy thing they add later on that like teleports around.
Its aim isn't to be a good hang. It's part of the legions of hell, like it's out to get you and great job. You get me a lot and that's the thing I die to most often.
But for me, the game is at its best when you've got, is it the arachnotrons, which are like the brains on legs, the big charging hell knights, those lads that throw their green crosses at you. Because all of those things, you can attack them on their own terms, but the parrying will really fuck them up. And whatever you're doing, you're hurting them, which just isn't true of the biggest bads in the game.
I mean, I guess like you are deeper into this and can speed this more. One ability I did at least unlock that I really liked was for the mace. I unlocked the mace can now shatter orange armor, basically, or shatter like the layer of armor and on certain enemies.
And a lot of the big enemies do have armor that you have to break before you can really do damage. And you can break that by parrying, like you say, the attacks back at them. But once you get that with a mace, it is quite satisfying to go up to one of the big lads, smash the armor off with your regular mace attacks, and then take them out.
You're like, OK, I managed to upgrade as a kind of like way around this slightly annoying restriction you've implemented on these big enemies. However, where you are now, I imagine you've encountered many more types of big enemies, Matthew, and I imagine some of them are frustrating on their own terms.
Because they always bring the same pool of enemies back, but they radically like redesign them for each iteration. It's quite interesting seeing like who rises and falls on like the enemy power rankings. Who was an absolute pushover at Eternal, who's now like a pain in the ass here.
Because I used to really like shooting the, you know, the Revenants, like the skeletons with like the jet packs. In Eternal, like I used to jump and I'd have the perk or whatever that let you slow down time when you aim down the rifle. And then I'd snipe off its little shoulder mounted rockets, which basically is what triggers it for a glory kill.
And whenever I saw a Revan, it was like, well, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to shoot you in slow motion. It's going to be really fun.
I might even keep it for later in the fight as a little kind of treat, a little pick me up. Well, I'll deal with you because I know that I can definitely get you. But in this one, they're a huge pain in the arse because again, they become sort of ghost revenants until you ping in a green skull back in their face.
And because of that, they've definitely gone down on the power rankings. They no longer have like the juice.
Well, I thought you could, when they're not in their ghostly form, because they come out of it sometimes, you can just, you hit them with the shield saw and they are locked in place in their corporeal form while you shoot them. That's cool.
That is on me. But when it goes into ghost form, I'm like, oh, because it has like a couple of attacks it can do. And it's like, I hope you do the fast one with the green projectile just so we can get through this a bit quicker.
Who's currently top of your power rankings?
God, you know, I do, even though they annoy me sometimes, I do really like the brains on legs things, whatever they're called, because they have, the thing they do that is bullshit, but I think is adds to the combat sort of mix is that when they're very far away, they've got a really deadly like ranged attack, like rapid fire attack. And so you'll sometimes be in a wide open space where you have to dash between bits of cover just to avoid this cannon fire. And yet when you're up close, you absolutely shred through them.
So I like them as a bit of like a bit of combat design.
Up close you realize that they're just like a like a bowl of blamange. I'm just going to machine gun into this blamange and it's absolute toast. Too much cake.
I'm thinking a lot about cakes and desserts when I'm playing Dark Ages.
I'm sort of a bit like, oh, this is like sort of baby Andros sort of like true form basically. There's a bit of that about them, I guess. I don't know if I love any particular enemy type in it.
I think I do definitely value, like you say, that the game will make an event of when it brings a new one in. It's like when the jetpack lads turn up, it's a bit like it's me kind of situation because it appears right at the start of like a section and then it will appear frequently throughout. And I think they're good at being like, we're bringing this one back and it's kind of cool.
In general, I think at first, I thought I was just going to really like bristle at the crowd control element of it, because I thought, and almost like kind of Moba-y because there's a lot of like little lads to kind of shred up before you fight the big lads. I was worried it just wasn't going to be, it was going to be too passive at interaction for a first-person shooter. But then you've really got much more to do than that.
And some of the weapons they had are just pretty cool as well. Like the gun that fires a cannonball on a chain, that gun fucking rules. I mean, that's a weapon that you really want to mostly use against like one-on-one sort of more powerful enemies.
But it turns up just as I was really craving a bit more heft from the firearms and I was worried that a little bit, a few too many of them were like the rapid fire clear out lots of guys' guns. And I really wanted something that had a bit of like a bit of oomph to it.
Right.
And I think the game is good at like bringing those in. Not sure how you thought about the complete armoury once you got there, Matthew. Yeah, I think that's something the game gets better at for sure, quite quickly.
I do really like that one. And it's got some quite good upgrades where it becomes supercharged, you know, if you like parry or something like that.
So good.
You know, if you do parry close to an enemy, you're right next to it, ready to like drop this horrible thing in its face. Also, just the visual design of a big ball on a chain is very funny.
Yeah, rules.
I'd like to have seen maybe a few more things like that, as much as I like the gun that chews up skulls and shoots out the shards. When you see something you're like, what the hell is this thing gonna do? Like, I want that reaction a bit more maybe than they got.
I won't spoil how they tackle the BFG issue, because it's quite a funny joke when it happens. It feels like something which is very, very funny initially, and then you're like, I would have maybe have done something different, but I'll let you get to that for yourself.
I really like the Impaler and Super Shotgun in that they are sort of like two solutions to the same problem, of like, I need something that can fuck someone up rapidly, because especially when you get them, you have again really only had like chip damagey weapons, and so you're really ready for something a bit powerful. So when you get the Impaler in the games, like if you hit enemies in the head with this, then it's basically like a harpoon gun of sorts really, or like a rivet gun or something. When you hit them with that, they basically, it's not an instant kill, but you can take down enemies very quickly if you aim them correctly and it has an upgrade where you can slow down time where you're aiming.
That's really good. Yeah, it is. Likewise, when you get the Super Shotgun, you really crave like, when I am up against one of these really fat dudes, he's setting me on fire with loads of flames and I've got myself into trouble because I did like a little shield saw charge into the frame.
I really just need something that's going to delete this guy instantly. That's what the Super Shotgun does. So I like as well that they've really thought carefully about how the ranged and close range weapons suit the type of combat paradigm they've built.
It's just one of those things where it just ended up being way more considered than I initially assumed it would be. However, I am really keen to know how I'll feel about it once I get as far as you are because I could see how you might burn out on it through sheer game length. It is quite a generous game in terms of the amounts of stuff.
And I will say, I don't know how you feel about this, I think it's like the best set of levels they've ever built in terms of the visual palette of them a little bit, but more just, they do a lot with flat levels. They're just all so different from each other. And yeah, like I say, if you take out the sort of element of the map telling you where everything is, I do think the intricate design of them is quite special.
And I really think they've gone all out in terms of trying to bring scale to this game without damaging the pace of it too much. I don't know, I was just quite impressed with how they approach the level design in this, you know?
Have you done Giant Mech Suit or Dragon yet? I can't remember how quickly that comes around.
Yeah, I've done one section of each for those.
How do you sit on those? Because I thought, in the previews, people were a little cooler on it back then. It felt like we might be heading for a bit of a Batmobile in Arkham Knight, of people like, oh, why have they crowbarred this in?
They certainly don't dominate the discourse, which I think is a testament to the fact that they're not very long. I will say I quite like them as palette cleansers. I need them so I'm not just doing the same battlefield stuff again and again, and I can understand why they've mixed them up.
But what was your first taste of them like?
I'm sympathetic to vehicle sections, Matthew, I will say. I think I'm open-minded. I do think they're better when they are shorter, and I do think that the dragon stuff in this is significantly better than the mech stuff in this.
I think the mech stuff could do with a little bit more in the way of variety but also just things like, I wish I had more cool animations. I wish there were bits where...
Right.
You know how with the dragon, when you control the dragon, you will circle these really big motherfucker enemies, and then you'll be able to do a finisher and you'll watch the camera cut to you watching the dragon basically spit lava in or pull its head round and snap its neck.
Yeah.
They're really cool little finishers to punctuate those moments. The mech bits don't seem to have those bits. They've got a really powerful...
You do finishers but it all happens in first person and it's not hugely visually different from any of the other punching that you do. But I wish I had a bit more where the camera cuts to third person and then the mech would bend one of those big monsters on its knee and snap it in half or something. I wish I had something like that where it's like...
Did a little dab.
But that's what I mean is like, let's say like five different animations that could play out depending on which enemy you killed or how you did it. I wish I had something more like that because it does feel like... That feels a little bit more like I'm just doing the same thing over and over again.
Whereas the dragon is interesting because it uses a mode of traversal through the world really. Like it's a vehicle. You get through to different parts of the level using it, but then it kind of like becomes this...
I guess I'd say somewhere between something like Rogue Squadron and Panzer Dragoon where you are doing these very basic sort of like dodgers of attacks to do a sort of like counter laser fire thing to destroy ships and destroy other types of enemies. It's pretty simple stuff, but I'm pretty fond of the dragon bits. I think they're really cool.
They look good and crucially, they don't go on for very long.
Yeah, the levels that they use them tend to play out a little bit like that Halo Reach level where you're flying between the different skyscrapers.
I fucking love that level design. That kind of structure.
There's four airships the dragon has to take down and each airship you'll have a little dragon fight and then you'll land on it and clear it out as the Doom Slayer and then he'll end up thumping through the back of the ship and then landing on the dragon as it swoops under him. For a game which has a little bit more story and cutscenes and stuff, it's not actually that invasive, that stuff in the levels when you're playing them. The few flourishes they have, they have a bit of wide-eyed schoolboy imagination of imagine if you jumped out of the back of this airship and your dragon caught you and then you're instantly chasing another thing down a canyon or whatever and there's something quite sincere and goofy about it that I can't object to it too much, really.
Yeah, like you say, they're sparingly done, more than a third the way through the game and there's only been one of each so far in the game. They know better than to let the whole thing take over. I mean, that's the contentious thing about Arkham Knight, right, is it does basically take over the game.
They're not even close to doing that in this. So, yeah, I respect it as a bit of variety and I don't have much time for people who complain about vehicle sections not being as intricate as the 90% of the game that is a first person shooter when guess what? That's something they've been building for years and know how to do.
I welcome them having a little bit of a palate cleanser and trying something different because why not? It's the third game in the series and if there's something you can, everyone should appreciate about Doom more generally, is they do reinvent them each time, that they are fiercely focused on single player experiences and those being like high value single player experiences. That's exactly what I think we should celebrate in games, is people doing what they're good at, doing it really well, but also mixing up the toy box every single time, and crucially not weighing it down with a load of live service bullshit.
This is like, put this side by side by Marathon, I played a few weeks ago, I take this a thousand times out of a thousand. It's really cool that this is what they've chosen to do. Where else can you get a single player first person shooter to this high standard?
You really have to look at indie games now for great first person shooter campaigns outside of the odd Call of Duty having a good one. I love that they're doing their thing and I love that they change it up each time. It has resulted in a game that maybe does not quite scale the heights of Doom Eternal but then that was one of my favorite games of the last generation.
So I kind of mind it being an 8 out of 10 or an 8.5 out of 10. That's where I'm at with it at the moment.
I think that's probably where I'm going to land with it. If it ends on something truly spectacular that combines the Doom Slayer, the Dragon and the Mech in some absolutely indecently violent takedown, then I might laugh about it. But yeah, it's good.
I kind of like rooting for this team. I think they've made three great games across the board. I like the chap.
Is it Hugo Martin? Yeah, I get good vibes off him and I know that he's the one who's sort of like quite into the Doom lore and has made this a bit more of a sort of story campaign. But honestly, there's not much of it.
The first act is a bit more story heavy than the others, but you can go for missions without a cutscene. It feels that way. So I think he's balanced it pretty well.
And you know, he's earned his right to have a bit of fun and mess around with the series. And they don't take anything for granted. Like, just everything is so sort of like high quality.
Just the sound effects, different pickups make when you grab them, are just the meatiest, most satisfying sound effect you can imagine, unless it's blasting out the speakers of the PS5 controller, of course. And like, you know, visually, just, you know, absolutely gorgeous, the amount of stuff flying around in this and all the physics-y bits of flesh, and the couple of power-ups that do let you occasionally have a little bit of slo-mo. Like, when you're throwing the shield, if you hold throw without letting go, the game slows down a little bit to let you aim the shield.
And in those moments, you can actually just see, like, all the churning chaos moving and accidental bullet time, but I… It just makes you realise that they are… It is quite, like, next-level stuff.
It really is. And, you know, they are… They add more story to this one, but without being arrogant enough to think that they…
It's a good idea to interrupt you mid-level with a cutscene. They never, ever do that. It's just…
It's very church and state about how it does story and gameplay. And I think that that's smart, because then I think you can basically opt out of the story if you don't want to participate, but for everyone else, it's really just a brief cutscene, and then you kind of like carry on, really. I too am rooting for them.
I really am. I think they're just… These are like a net gain for video games, for sure.
And in like a landscape where everyone's trying to make an extraction shooter, this is… I think this is more what people actually want to play. I just do.
I just do. Yeah. Or at least people who, I guess, share our World of Eon games, Matthew.
But yes. Okay. So that's Doom the Dark Ages.
Nice meaty chat there, Matthew. All the other games are games that you've played. So which one do you want to start with, pal?
Let's do a little bit on the on the hundred line because I talked about this quite a bit in our game of the year, whatever it is, Hotter Colder List. What did we call that thing?
Yeah, it was the Game of the Year 2025 Check-in, colon, which games have the sauce or the juice or the gravy?
Yes. Good.
That was the name of the episode, I believe. Yeah.
Yeah. So at the time, I was playing through the campaign of this game, which let me remind you, is a strategy RPG with extensive visual novel elements from the directorial pairing of Kodaka, Kodaka, Kodaka, Kodaka, and Mr. Uchikoshi, who made Zero Escape, Mr. Zero Escape and Mr. Danganronpa. And they've made this this game where you're kind of defending a school for 100 days.
And I made it through the 100 days and got to basically got to the content, which extends this game from a 30 hour campaign to potentially 150 hour campaign. It's an absolute monster. It's quite interesting reading the reviews of this because people have been not wanting to like spoil it.
But I think that the fact that they have publicized that it has 100 endings, if you're playing the main campaign, there's like no choices in it. And you're like, oh, OK, how's this going to have 100 different endings, you know? So I think it's OK to say that you finish the campaign and then you begin afresh.
And on your second time through, you begin making decisions to try and alter your fate of that first campaign. And in making those decisions, it branches out in the style of a zero escape game. Now, those branches are as substantial as some self-contained visual novels.
I've probably played like 50 to 60 hours of this now. I've played through a couple of strands, almost to completion, because there's a few to be continued that won't carry on until you've made progress in another branch, is how Zero Escape did it. But the branches, it feels like each one is trying to tell a very specific story, and that's where it gets a bit too spoilery.
So I'm not going to save the nature of those stories. What is interesting is that they're always told through across this hundred day campaign, you know, or as many of the hundred days as the characters survive in this particular branch of the storyline. And it always has this strategy RPG element where whenever someone attacks a school, you send out all the students to sort of fight them in a kind of fire emblem battle.
And that was a bit where I was like, is this, does this system necessarily have the juice, sauce or gravy to sustain itself for like, you know, 150 hours of this strategy RPG? I didn't know if it had the stuff. What I actually think it does quite well is because the circumstances of each branch are very different in terms of certain characters permanently die in one branch, they might not die in another.
You may end up allied to certain characters and not others. And because of that, the actual formation of the team that's going into the battle is constantly changing. The guy who basically single-handedly got me through my first campaign playthrough, on the next strand I did, he died in day five, so I could no longer rely on that old trick.
I feel like what they're going to do across all the branches is make you fully dig into every single character, both narratively and as a mechanical presence on the battlefield. I think that's pretty neat. It's actually way more sophisticated than I thought it was going to be.
I thought it was going to struggle to justify having so many iterations of the same basic idea, but the three or four I've done have all been quite different and you come out the end liking different characters and then when you go then rewind the clock all the way back to day one again you're like oh these fucking guys they've been dead for like ten hours in my last story I forgot about them and you get to have like a little kind of meeting with them again and sort of kick it all off and I can understand why some people are going nuts for this. It is a huge time commitment whether it's gonna stick the landing and and like justify it. I've seen some people say after 150 hours that it isn't quite as spectacular as they hoped.
At the moment I'm really enjoying just absorbing it and seeing where it takes me and I think especially if you've played any of their previous work there are strands that riff on certain things they've done in other stories. I'm not gonna say there is a whole Danganronpa hidden in this game but there's something kind of approaching that and that's super interesting as a as a fan of these things.
Oh that's I mean you are so the right person for a game that is just 30 hours for the initial time investment and then somehow there's a further 120 hours of content to knock through after that. You are so the person who's got the content eat in discipline to kind of just like chew through all that game. Is it kind of like is there like a near automata esque element to stacking up all these different strands?
Is that what the kind of like is that what the gradually pieced together picture is?
Yeah, I think so. You'll learn different things in different strands and certain pieces of information but that is how Zero Escape worked as well. I guess the...
Yeah, that's a good frame of reference. That was a game where, you know, the more of it you played and the more kind of go-arounds you had, the more you kind of understood of... Made the stuff you'd already experienced seem even richer and this has a bit of that too.
You realize something is actually way more tragic than it first appeared because you now know this about them or whatever. So one benefit it has over Nier Automata, which I still think makes you redo certain... You know, enough of the same stuff that you're like, oh, God, this better pay off.
It does, but...
Definitely.
Yeah, but this... They are quite different. You know, they branch off quite violently at the start because I think they want to establish like, look, this is, you know, we're going to some really different places here.
And I think also the 100 day thing works quite well because, you know, while it might be a 10 hour story, it's split over 100 days. They are like self-contained little like units, you know, that they start with a little kind of, it's morning, animation, it goes ding dong, bing bong. I've heard that about 500 times now, which is slowly driving me insane.
You know, a day, you know, and a day might contain a conversation, it might contain a battle, it might contain free time to go and explore and do some like, personery, character leveling. But they're so short, you're like, oh, I'll have another day. Oh, I'll do another day.
I'll do another day. And the next thing you know, like you really have just lost, you know, a whole real day to the game. When you're looking at day 10, you're like, fuck me, I've got 90 days before we get to the end of this, it's gonna take forever.
But it just, it moves pretty fast and it's like, bitty enough that you're like, oh yeah, num, num, num. Yeah, I'll sort of gobble this down. Incredibly more-ish.
I think that might be what gets me through to the end of this one.
Yeah, I wonder if this is gonna be one of those games where about like five people have it on their game of the year list at the end of the year. But those people are like, I swear to God, this is the best game I played this year by miles. But you had to be-
It gets absolutely bazooka to death on the computer game show.
Who's gonna play it? Is it a Farley game? Is it that kind of vibe?
Whoever picks it, I think Dave Kerb stomps it and its journey ends there. Day three.
Yeah, up against EAFC 26. Just get absolutely annihilated.
It has that side. This is niche as hell.
To that point, I saw Ashley Day sharing that I think. He shared a Nintendo Live thread that said this is a game of the year contender, for sure. But it's kind of hiding in plain sight a little bit and Ash was like, yeah, that is what this game is.
So I can definitely see that a certain type of person is going to say this is the best game of the year at the end of the year.
Yeah, wankers.
No, not at all. I still won't play it because it's only because the time commitment is so steep. If you told me it was like 15 hours and then it was 50 hours to see everything after that, I would legit consider it.
But I think I'm happier just having you as my correspondent to tell me what's going on in this kind of because you are just the most patient man in the world with this stuff. So I respect your ability to just throw time at things. Yeah, interesting to hear about though.
I have been playing it over the weekend and there's other stuff I want to play. And I'm like, I just can't tear myself away from it. But I also know that I'm making basically no progress.
Am I even 20% through? I don't really know. It's a big ask.
It's quite off putting. Like they've said, oh, you could just play the campaign once. And we've written it so that that's satisfying in its own right.
I just don't think that's true. I think you get to the end and be like, well, I really want to know what was going on with all that weird stuff that just happened. Oh, that's going to take 120 hours.
Like, oh, God.
Yeah, interesting. Yeah, I guess it's a proper, you know, sort of separating out the wheat from the chaff element to that kind of storytelling. But hey, I'm the chaff, so be it, you know.
Archipel documentary about it a couple of days ago, like a little interview with them. And one of them says, I think it's Ishikoshi says, this might be the last time this scale of story is attempted like without AI. And we really kind of pride ourselves on this being like a, you know, properly handwritten.
Every hour of this game we've kind of created and shaped, you know, and it kind of goes against all the tidal wave of shit that's incoming. Like this kind of exercise is something people will be able to do with this technology going forwards. So, you know, we may as well do this right this one time, and hopefully not go bankrupt doing it.
I think it's doing all right, you know, because it was doing all right in the... I don't know where it is now, but when I last looked at the Switch top sellers, it was in there, post the update they did to keep every kind of dogshit clock app out of the charts, which was much welcome. And it's like 3,000, it's nearly 4,000 reviews on Steam.
I think it's getting there, you know, I think it's doing okay. It's probably going to benefit from it being slightly quiet for a quiet summer, so.
I don't feel like it's reached the place where it will get a surprise nomination at the Game Awards, which can be like absolutely electric for a game like this. You know, like it has the fervour around it, everyone who plays it, but getting it into the hands of the masses is just a whole other challenge.
The Door Dash Award for Most Complex Storyline or something similar, basically.
I just want to hear, because it's got some great musics. It's the... Oh, I can't remember the composer's name, but it's the No More Heroes composer does the music for it.
So it's got very synthy, cool, weird, dreamy stuff going on. And I'd love to hear that as part of the Game of the Year Medley at the Game Awards, to stick on an endless loop on my playlist, along with the Bilateral orchestral sound track.
Welling up at the Bilateral theme. Okay, well, nonetheless, I look forward to it getting one of the Matthew Castle's Alternate Game of the Year Awards in that particular episode, that should be good. Side note, I just read, I think it's in the Death Stranding 2 issue of Edge, their time extend on No More Heroes.
And there's an extended sort of like Don Quixote sort of like comparison in it. And as I read that, I thought, ah yeah, I am a dumbass. Because that's not a book I really know anything about or a character I know anything really about.
But the entire piece hinges around it. I'm like, I like that. It's very like early noughties Edge.
Because I feel slightly too dumb to read it. And I thought, I appreciate that. I'm pleased that that can still, that's still happening in print media these days.
Just a complete side note there, Matthew. Okay, good stuff. So, Hundred Line then on Switch and PC.
So, yeah, we'll kind of keep an eye on that. I'll keep checking in with you on that, Matthew. And because it is like, it is an ordeal for you.
And I think it is going to take you all summer to probably get through it. So, or at least like the next month or so. So, let's talk about it again very soon.
Okay, is it your final game of the episode, Matthew?
Well, I've got two more, but I've played a little bit of Siege and the Sandfox. I'll give that a little shout out.
Go for it, of course.
It's this stealth Metroidvania that's been, I feel like it's almost been around 10 years or something. I swear this was at res.exe pre-COVID, for even sitting on a lot of people's Steam wish lists for five years, forgetting that it exists. Kind of a Prince of Persia, both in 2D platforming style, but also it's got an Arabian Nights setting.
Big hook of it being that it's fundamentally a stealth game. You don't, at the point that I've played it, have any combat abilities. You can cosh people over the back of their head.
So imagine, what was the 2D stealth game? Mark the Ninja? Yeah, I think that's right.
If you imagine that, but in a proper open 2D Metroidvania map, it's sort of the pitch. It's kind of OK. It's got quite a handsome game.
I like the caves and sort of mysterious, Arabian, bizarre environmental art. That's all quite nice. Almost like Prince of Persia has like a voiceover that's kind of narrating what you're doing.
Oh, he did. He climbed up the ladder and went through the door or whatever. And so it's kind of telling your actions as a story, which is quite nicely done.
I will say the actual stealth systems for a game which is based around stealth are pretty threadbare at the moment. There's like shadowy areas and when you see enemies in their line of sight, they come and get you. And when their backs are turned to you, you can cosh them.
But that, you know, I haven't got anything more than hiding from patrol patterns and coshing people. So it's, you know, stealth wise, it's not really much more complicated than like the Ocarina of Time hedge maze at the start of the castle. Brutal.
Yeah, well, it's not Metal Gear Solid. It's quite like if a person doesn't see you, you went. And you're like, okay, I mean, I guess that is fundamentally what stealth is.
If you strip it all away. But you like to have a few more toys. Maybe that will come with other upgrades.
The real bummer with this is that when the guards do see you, their alert phase in AI is quite basic but really prolonged. You end up hiding in the shadows, just waiting for a load of little 2D guys to call off for like 10, 15 seconds too long. I feel like other people have kind of gotten around that.
Like by having AI guards that are more persistent or can follow you or have a better move set, so they can kind of like put pressure on you constantly. Here, it's quite easy to escape things. And then you're just waiting for everyone to call down because it's designed in such a way that you can't really improvise.
Like it feels like there's a solution, but the solution requires enemies to be in their original spots, which they'll return to eventually. And it's just been a long time since I've waited for like an alert phase to call down like this. And it made me realize that we don't really do this anymore in games, which is not very fun and seems quite bad.
So I don't know if that is what's stopped me playing more at the moment, or whether it's playing 400 days of Hundred Line, maybe a little bit both.
False advertising.
Yeah, so there's that one. I don't think you need to worry yourself about that one.
Well, when I was being served the ads, the one thing I did think was nice about it is the 2D animations were lovely in it. I thought it was a very handsome game. But yeah, I can't say any of that otherwise appeals.
I sort of think if you're going to make a sort of side scrolling game of any kind now, you need to have some kind of USP to it.
Well, I think Stealth is the USP.
Right, but it's by no means the first game to do that, right? I mean, just off the top of my head, I can think of a game like Inside has Stealth elements as side scrolling, for example. Or like, I'm trying to think, does Nine Souls have a Stealth element to it?
I don't really know. It's like a recent side scrolling game of Note that seemed pretty excellent.
I was interested in it and excited for it because so many of the bigger Metroidvanias are now sharing a lot of DNA with Dark Souls games, or they've all got nightmare difficult combat, and that isn't necessarily my speed. So the idea of like, oh, a whole Metroidvania where a lack of conflict is the pitch. You know, I was quite excited for it.
And I was hassling PRs for a review code for this one because I genuinely wanted to cover it. I thought it looked really good and the pitch was really sound. It's just a little bit of a kind of be careful what you wish for because when you can't kill people easily, you have to wait for them to call off, which isn't necessarily the killer gameplay loop you think it is.
Right, yeah. Did you manage to sort out Keymailer in the end with that, Matthew? No.
No, okay, that's a shame.
PR very kindly sent me a code for this though, so sorry for being a bit cool on it.
It happens, such as it is. And so what's your final game?
My final game is Blades of Fire, which is the MercurySteam action adventure. I've really been looking forward to this in like the two months that it's been formally announced. It seems to be the bit of MercurySteam that made Castlevania.
I think it's the Castlevania team, like director and everything. And I love Castlevania Lords of Shadows. I really liked that studio's art design, world vision, sense of chunky action.
They just had a lot of fun with quite tired tropes. And so the idea of them doing like another fantasy action adventure, you know, I was just intrigued to see what they'd come up with. Are you at all aware of this one?
Have you followed it at all?
Yeah, a little bit. So I thought it was interesting how tight the turnaround was from announcement to release. But just from my brief publisher experience, there's a lot of people thinking that like a year long publicity cycle no longer works.
They're trying to bolder things. But I don't know, a lot of it. I was never quite convinced by the science of how people talk about that stuff.
But regardless, it does feel like it's a little bit stealth launched. I think maybe it being on the Epic Games Store doesn't help. What I do know about the game, Matthew, is I believe there was an old predates Demon Souls game that MercurySteam made that is kind of in this vein, a third person kind of a combat game and pre-Castlevania, obviously the Lost Shadow games.
And I believe that in some ways it's kind of a spiritual successor to that.
That's, yeah.
Yeah.
So that was, that was, I think 2001's Severance Blade of Darkness on PC.
Right, right, right.
Which was made by a studio called Revolat to close down after the game. But I think members of Revolat went on to form MercurySteam. So it is a spiritual successor in that it is a, yes, a third-person hack and slash game set in a, you know, quite a broad, fancy world.
Very like sort of Conan, you know, it's very like big burly warriors and evil kind of rasping villains and all this kind of stuff. There are some, some quirky characters along the way, but it's, I wouldn't say like tired or trite. It's just deliberately trad and, and-
Meat and potatoes.
Yeah, it is that. The kind of the hook of the game is that like an evil queen has cast this curse, which has turned all steel into stone, which in effect has basically removed all weapons from every, no one has any weapons anymore because they've all turned into stones. And you are like a magical forging guy who has this legendary hammer, which means you are one of the only people who can forge new weapons.
And it's not like an RPG with lots of like stat management, but you forge new swords as you go through the game in this sort of forging minigame, where you custom design the weapon from this great big shopping list of like parts and materials. And it creates like a very specific one of a kind, probably million varieties you could make. But you kind of craft the exact sword you want and then you smith it.
And there's this minigame where you have to sort of hit metal to sort of make these little metal bars fill in the outline of your weapon. And the kind of closer you get to the outline, the more durability the weapon is going to have. So you kind of make these weapons, you then can name them anything.
So you're not finding any loot in the world. You're making it, you're naming it. You feel some sort of ownership over it, I think is the kind of pitch.
That's fun.
Yeah, it is fun. It's a nice little thing. And then it has this quite unusual combat system.
It's like God of War, sort of third-person perspective, but in quite tight on the main character's back. But the four face buttons are like the four directional swipes, and enemies are very sort of directional coded. So like, you know, if they're armoured on their head in their chest, you know, you can attack left or right to hit their arms, or if they've got like weak legs, you can attack down to hit their legs.
So there's a little bit of like match the direction to the to the enemy type. I wouldn't say it's sort of soulsy. There is, there is like a sort of stamina management.
And, you know, when things get on top of you, you die pretty fast. But when you get into the swing of it and you build like a really good weapon and you start learning the timings of those weapons, which are obviously going to be quite specific to the weapon you make, like it changes the speed of the swing and everything based on what materials you put into it. But you can absolutely like whomp people in this game.
And it's got like a really gooey, gruesome approach to sort of like arms coming off and heads getting splattered with hammers. And once I kind of got into the groove with my first hammer that I built, I was running around this village splatting heads because when the enemies ran towards me, I could always gauge or if I start doing my big overhead swing now, it'll hit him just as he gets close enough. And so I just explode like 10 heads in a row.
That is a good time. That's like enough for me to go, this was a worthwhile experience. And that has continued.
Like I'm still really enjoying taking off arms and heads with these things that I've lovingly forged. But the thing I really love about it is the world is very dense, it's very knotty, it's like a sort of warren of corridors and hidden passages and cracks you can squeeze through and staircases that loop back round. Very Dark Souls-y as everyone now knows.
But of a density which I can't say I've seen in many other games. So like the environments are just very pleasing to explore. At the end of routes you're always finding chests which have like permanent health or stamina upgrades in so the only way you can level up your character is by exploring.
And that's quite a fun payoff. You know, it has more of that Metroidvania DNA in it maybe from like Lords of the Shadow than I was expecting. And it's really been...
I've had a great time with it so far. Like I'm really, really enjoying it. And I saw some critics come out for it in a big way and say, this is really great.
And I saw some other critics posting slightly sneery tweets about what I thought was dog shit. I don't know what that person was smoking and all this kind of stuff. And you're like, well, I think this is like a weird seven that a few people aren't going to necessarily enjoy or understand.
I think it's more revealing about the grumps who aren't in on it personally than the people who are kind of getting behind it.
Get them, Matthew.
I just... it's not amazing, but I'm having as much fun in it as I've had with like a lot of things. I'm enjoying it as much as I'm enjoying Exposition 33, easily.
But it seems to have just completely come and gone. Yeah, I just... If you like exploring very twisty environments, very atmospheric, looks pretty good, chopping off skeleton heads and things with flesh and blood as well, which is a bit more satisfying.
I think it's got the stuff. Whether it's got it in the long run, I don't know. You know, we'll have to wait and see.
I bet it's just going to get like a fucking 3 in edge and it will be heartbroken. It has that air about it, you know?
That's funny because it does have, I think it's like mid 70s on Metacritic and some people are really down on it. Got an IGN 5, got 5.5 from Gamerformat.
That's tough. That's the sat game dead as far as most people are concerned, you know?
Yeah, exactly. That will kill it at birth, unfortunately, which is a shame because like you, I want to see MercurySteam do well. In, you know, in lieu of them being acquired by Nintendo, which is what I hoped would happen after Metro Dread came out, thereby securing their future to make excellent Metro games the rest of time.
You know, I do want them to do well and yeah, it feels like this game has vanished without a trace and I will play this. I'm just waiting for it to unlock on the old Epic Games presser game.
I will play it if I'm absolutely giving it for free. Yes, what an endorsement. It's good, like, I bounce off, you know, Souls likes very, very easily and I just think it's...
Sounds a bit unusual, that's a thing.
Yeah, and the difficulty is just so right and you can have these runs where you just absolutely beast it and it allows you to feel incredibly powerful in a way that Souls games rarely do in their opening hours. Really lets you just like run circles around people, but also feel like, well if I die at any moment, because when you die, the sword, you drop the weapon. So the thing that you made and it is very precious, you have to get back to where you died to pick that up.
They remain there for multiple deaths as far as I can tell, so it's not like you've got one shot to get back there. So it has a bit, it has like Soulsy ideas in it. I think the reason I'm quite high on it at the moment is because I've just done this level in it called The Crimson Fort, which was this like wooden monastery on top of a mountain.
And the level design just, it really took me like under through, on the rooftops, back down through the attic. You know, there were all these weird little routes around it. I felt, you know, on the map, it didn't look big at all, but it felt as complex as like almost like a Resident Evil mansion or something.
That was really fun. And it also did, speaking of Resident Evil, something which I've not seen one of these games do before, but you know, imagine a Dark Soulsy boss, you know, health bar the size of the screen. They've got an ominous name above the health bar.
You know, they're five times bigger than any other enemy. But this one, like three roams around the whole castle that you're in. So it's not like there's not one area where you have to fight with it.
Well, initially there's not. But like, so you keep meeting this thing, but it's just like Mad King who did some sort of dark spell to basically make him immortal. So whenever you kill him, he spawns again, but he's gone mad because he can't leave his castle.
So he's sort of stuck there forever more. But it means there's like permanent boss in that, sort of doing a Mr. X routine around his castle.
I was about to say Mr. X. I was about to say. I was dying to say it.
Yeah.
That's good. That's fun.
I like that.
You know? I'm into it. Any game that does a Mr. X, that's like instant castle points.
Yeah, I can see that. I wonder if like the name and the fact it's not made in Asia is like the reason for like sniffy tweaks maybe.
I mean like, the character models, you know, when you see screenshots of them, they're like fine. I think the game environments are pretty nice, but they're, you know, they're not like Kratos level good. You know, they're a bit kind of chunkier, a bit more stylized, quite like the heroes in Lords of Shadow actually.
Like if you told me this had once been a Castlevania thing, I might actually believe you. That stuff, that does matter. When you kind of look sort of 3D and a little bit AAA, you know, people are in that mindset and that's how they're judging it.
And it's absolutely as good as it needs to be. But is that enough?
We all want fucking AA games to come back in the industry, not to fucking sink. So surely, you know, got to get behind them really, if like that's gonna happen. Got to get behind the ones that are doing it, that aren't just called Expedition 33.
Yeah, so I'm kind of, I'm excited to play more.
Fine, I'll fucking buy it Matthew. I'll buy it on PS5. No, we've got to get behind MercurySteam or who else.
This is what we're here for. This is what we do on this podcast.
I think it's only on the Epic Store.
It's on PS5 as well.
Oh, yeah, I've been playing on PS5, yeah. I'm saying it's not on Steam, which is like also quite a tough break.
Yeah, you're a gamer like to, they go four out of five. So they seem to appreciate how original it was. I'm definitely intrigued by it.
And yeah, you can see people also struggling to figure out which bucket to put it in, whether it is like the Souls bucket or is the God of War bucket. And that too is probably not totally working in its favor, as people not being able to exactly nail down what it is from immediately looking at it, you know? So yeah, a game to understand what's in there.
I tried my best, I think I put it in five different buckets. I put it in Dark Souls bucket, Metroidvania bucket, God of War bucket, I don't think Edge will like it bucket.
Yeah, well Matthew believes that it's got the sauce, the juice, the gravy, you know, all three. So that's, I'm in, I'm curious to play that. It's going to be a perfect kind of like quiet sort of summer game.
I say that the Nintendo Switch 2 Matthew is under two weeks away from release. So that's bizarre as now that's sneaking up. I saw Miyamoto into it today, but he was promoting the theme park.
So I was like, should he be promoting the Switch 2? Like that's how I like it.
Miyamoto is just the theme park guy now. It's kind of like, I'm glad he's enjoying that, but it bums me out.
Indeed. Well, I'm sorry that I could only get through one game for this episode. We did both to get keys for the Onimusha 2 remaster and we will come back to that and talk about it at some point.
But I did think in the short term, I should just play more Doom and talk about that. So it's nice to get into a big chunky Doom chat, Matthew. That was fun.
It was Doom as well on Game Pass as well. And I will say a great way to while away a bank holiday weekend, honestly. Just been very enjoyable.
So yes, good stuff.
Wes Anderson and mulching demons. I bet Wes Anderson wouldn't like Doom.
Everything a person could want before a 4.45 wake up time to go to the fucking US. Embassy tomorrow. What a glamorous life I lead.
Well, Matthew, very enjoyable podcast as always. So where can people get you on social media?
I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and my now neglected Letterboxd.
Well, Matthew will still review Mission Impossible franchise entries on there, though. So fear not. I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. And yeah, if you want to follow the podcast, The Back Page Pod, if you'd like to support the podcast, I guess like bang the We're Independent Media drum again, patreon.com/backpagepod. If you'd like to chuck some money our way and get two additional podcasts a month.
Next week, Matthew, can you talk about the guest you've got on next week? I'm not on the episode next week, but I think it's going to be pretty good.
We should be talking to, well, I should be talking to Geraint Evans previously of NGC and Games Master, now of PQube. Someone I've met on my very first day at Future. I've been a big fan of his.
Absolutely loved his time on Nintendo Mags. I think this is the first person we've talked to who also worked on Games Master for a decent stint. So yeah, looking forward to digging into both NGC and Games Master.
And I thought we'd talk a little bit about covering console launches as well, because he's covered quite a few, you know, in lieu of Switch 2, because we're not going to have a Switch 2 episode for that Friday, which is the 6th. So yes, it's going to be me and Garen having a fun chat. Hopefully, if you enjoyed the Tim Weaver one, it'll be much like that.
And one week later, we will have our Nintendo Switch 2 hands-on episodes. So we'll talk about Mario Kart, talk about that 10 quid thing that should have been free with a console and all that stuff. I'm looking forward to that, Matthew.
Really excited to get that in my hands, the Switch 2. So, yeah, should be good. Yeah, I am also plotting a full Donkey Kong Bonanza episode for when that comes out, Matthew.
The stakes have never been higher.
They have never been higher.
Donkey Kong Bonanza vs Astrobot, it will be called. A fight to the death, colon, which one has to juice, sauce or gravy? Look forward to that episode in July.
Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
