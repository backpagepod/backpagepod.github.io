Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Off air just now, we were talking about the fact that you're about to hit a certain age milestone. Do you want to address that on the podcast, or just move straight on, pretend it never happened?
No, I was just saying that I've never really felt the age thing. I think that's largely tied to working in games journalism where everyone seems to be somewhere between 21 and 40, and you can't really tell, like what anyone is, everyone's just a sort of general age for two decades. But yeah, I'm 40 next week, and just sort of registered with me a bit.
It's coincided with a spate of my feet aching a bit, because I think I bought the wrong size shoes, you know, and I had to buy a load of new clothes for a, I went to a fancy party, someone else's 40th. So I had to buy some new clothes, which that then leads to the inevitable dealing with being slightly heavier than when I last bought clothes. And it's just a little perfect storm of, my feet are going to fall off, and then my large body is just going to be rolling around on my 40th birthday.
That's what I've got in store for me.
Oh, okay, well, good. I'm optimistic about the future based on that. No, I totally get what you mean as a man who sort of feels like I'm entering my perpetual decline era.
And I remember going to Christmas party in the end of 2021, and it felt like, oh, I'm definitely gonna get COVID at this, and then somehow didn't. But I remember putting on suit trousers I'd bought in like 2018 or something. And then basically when I went to sit down, my entire ass was sort of like presenting itself because of the way the trousers were like slipping down due to my oversized waist.
And then luckily having like a long enough suit jacket to cover up my gigantic ass. And then, you know, that was not like the best of times. So by doing this, understand the head space that you're in, Matthew.
Not easy, is it?
This 40th dinner I went to over the weekend, there was a seating plan, and I actually ended up sitting away from Catherine. They kind of mixed everyone up, partners and things, so that I guess people would talk to people they hadn't met or didn't know or whatever. And they put me between two incredibly petite women, which was just like the worst possible combination for me.
I need more of a lead in, like I need like a medium sized man between like the petite lady and me, so that you've got like evolution of Matt, you can sort of see that transition and it doesn't scare you as much. But when it's like, like right there in the middle of two quite small people, and I was very aware of my elbows, I was really squeezed in, it was an emotional seeking arrangement.
Well, what happens is, is you fight the two of them, they're like martial arts specialist and then the boss battle with you is like much harder. That's how it works Matthew. So you can beat the petite women, you can take on Judge Castle one-on-one combat.
So just do lots of dodge rolls and hit them from behind.
I actually have got big Yakuza boss energy, like the idea that these two tiny ladies will do the fighting because I'm too busy eating my prawns with mango salsa or whatever it was. I need to finish my dinner before I can have my big fight. So, yeah.
I've been sat on my ass for two months because I knew I was going to go and do something different and was waiting to see which of the things it would be. And I feel like I ate a dairy milk bar every day. And it's just definitely unsustainable.
And as I'm about to re-enter the workforce, like my dairy milk bar days are just over now. And it's a little bit of a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts moment for me. So, that's tough.
But at the same time, I do wonder, I just went on a press trip as well. And I did think, I don't genuinely don't know. But am I much fatter than when my colleagues last saw me two months ago?
I've got no way of really knowing. So, that was like a thing. I was like, oh, I don't know.
You know, would they point it out even if I was? I don't really know. But these are the things that large men go through psychologically.
So, yeah.
I'll tell you what I got into talking about dairy milk.
Oh, yeah.
Which for Easter, they do those Cadbury's dairy milk, but it's got mini eggs embedded in it, which is so daft because mini eggs are just more Cadbury's dairy milk. So it's just chocolate studded with chocolate. I guess the shell is new.
It's like chocolate full of sugar shell. Yeah, I've had a couple of those. They've been quite good.
Look at that, me saying couple. What a lie.
They're fucking great. I would estimate I've had at least four of those bars in the last month.
Yeah, that's really four. I've had four too.
And then at least three of those bars that just have cream egg in them, which are not even not better than eating a cream egg, but you know, just sort of like, again, just, oh, it's Easter. I need to eat this now. And that's like what compulsive eating does to you really.
So until next year when me and Matthew go on the big men injections, they do it as or whatever. This is such as it will be basically. So yes.
Okay. That's a weird start to this episode, but that's fine because I think this episode is going to be quite cursed, but quite fun, Matthew. So I wanted to do something I thought about.
Sorry, not about. I've been playing so much fucking about. That's just on my brain.
A little bit further up in the alphabet. Atomfall is coming out and it's out by the time you're listening to this actually. A game from Rebellion, a survival game set in a kind of alternate history, Britain.
A little bit of threads to it, a little bit of Wicca Man to it. Basically the kind of British stuff that gets a certain generation or two excited in media more generally. They're kind of like, I guess people are about 5 to 10 years older than us in particular, but people have memories of watching Cold War nuclear war films and things like that and being spooked by stuff more generally as children.
I think I dig this kind of setting. I was curious about it too, because a lot of people are saying, oh, it's like a British spin on Fallout, a lot of talk of hitting enemies with cricket bats, that sort of thing. I didn't want to dedicate a whole episode to it though because I thought it's maybe like the kind of thing we'd normally do and what we've been playing.
But I do think it might be fun to use that as a jumping off point Matthew, to talk about Britain in games more generally, the portrayal of Britain, and to build a little canon of British games, both good, bad and iconic basically, just to sort of cover that sort of whole run of things. And I think you were kind of up for the idea as well Matthew, what did you think of this episode pitch?
I think it leans into everything we like, namely video games are very region specific, good potential of cursed things. Though saying that, a lot of my picks aren't really cursed at all. But it's quite fun seeing how different things depict a place.
I actually used to do a regular in the retro section of NGamer, which was called Around the World in 8-bit days, which I was always quite pleased with as a name. And the idea was each month, it was a different, sometimes city, often country. And I just showed how that one country was represented in loads of 8-bit, and to be honest, 16-bit games, further weakening the strength of that title.
But the easy ones were often how countries looked in the background of street fighter stages. So I've always had definitely an interest in, particularly how people overseas depict other countries, how they boil them down into what used to be quite simplistic abstract versions, but now with modern graphics, obviously crazy photoreal things. So yeah, I think it's a fun topic.
Yeah, for sure. And Atomfall is a good sort of jumping off point because it's a sort of setting you don't typically see in games. So it's basically set in the early 60s, five years after the wind scale nuclear disaster in Northern England.
It's like a fictional quarantine zone basically. And you go through this environment, uncovering the mystery of what's happened. You play an amnesiac character scavenging goods and crafting things to survive, encountering outlaws and the like, and making fragile alliances with different characters to try and progress or survive and escape this area basically.
And so you get a lot of the story telling delivered in note form, I would say. You get a lot of notes that say, here's a lead you can follow. And then it's like a detailed clue as to where you can go next as opposed to a map marker.
So there's a little bit of player investigation to it, maybe more than you're used to from your typical video game side quests. And you encounter British iconography like a red telephone box, particularly striking. But you know, kind of wicker man-esque stuff like I say as well.
Just bits and pieces around this world that let you know you're not in the middle of fucking Arizona or wherever. Or like a setting, a more well-worn American setting you might have seen in a video game before. It's just a little bit different as a take.
I was curious Matthew, how you've been finding the game so far. We've played a similar amount, which is not loads, but enough to talk about a little bit, I think.
Big part of it was just getting my head around what it actually was because I hadn't been following it massively and I'd heard the British Fallout thing, so I assumed it would be quite sandboxy, lots of RPG systems. I think actually the thing that surprised me the most is it's quite kind of pared back. There's not loads to it.
There is character progression. You get these little skill boosters and you have to unlock skill books to buy kind of perks, I guess, that improve your characters, but you're not like levelling up or anything like that. So your character is sort of slowly evolving.
You're right in that it has this quite organic freeform quest system. Like there's no map markers. You might be able to turn them on on lower difficulties, but on the stand difficulty there's no map markers.
So it's all about reading documents or feeling your way through. And that's actually one of the elements I think is more successful about it. It feels like you can enter quest lines at multiple places depending on what you find.
Like it isn't just, you find the original quest giver and then you're off. Like you may accidentally stumble on to a hidden bunker and in that bunker you pick up a newspaper and that might have been step three or five of another quest and then you're quite close to the end of that quest if you choose to follow it. So it's quite elegant in that way.
But you do have to get your head around this quite like limited scope, like it does feel quite small. Like geographically it's cut into specific districts.
Is it five districts? Four districts?
I mean, I haven't seen the full extent of it yet. I've been to three, I think, and like there's loading between them, but in themselves they feel not massive, like maybe like a couple of minutes to like sprint across. And there are enemies and there's some like light stealth.
I wouldn't say the stealth mechanics are like hugely complicated, but at least in how I've been playing it, once you've kind of triggered enemies, that general district becomes like quite hard work because everyone just sort of chases after you all over the place. And you know, you almost have to go away and let them kind of call off a bit. So it's, I don't want to say budget, because that sounds like a criticism and a bit sneery.
It's not that. It's deliberately very small in scale. I've been really struggling to find a game that it reminds me of.
I think I said to you, it feels like a sort of 360 game that Xbox have done that backwards compatibility pass on, and then you've used the frame rate boost to get it to 60. Like, it feels quite old.
I think it looks nicer than that. I think it looks more like a PS4 game.
Yeah, that's horrible. Yeah, again, I don't really mean that, and I like, oh, it feels cheap, but just the sort of some quite empty buildings with not a lot going on in them. There's not like, this sounds really noted, there's not loads of prop variety that I found.
It's just little things like that that show you like, oh, this isn't Fallout or Skyrim or that kind of thing. It's definitely got strong vibes. You know, if you had any dealing with the pop culture, it is drawing from 60s, 70s British sci-fi, read any like John Windham stuff, Day of the Triffids, Scarfolk, all that stuff.
Earlier, Doctor Who as well. That's the thing it most reminds me of. I guess like 70s Doctor When's like John Pertwee.
But like, you know, where they'd film British TV out in the Yorkshire in these sort of abandoned quarries. And there'd be lots of army men in there, those kind of green jumpers that people seem to wear around barracks. There's a lot of that.
And, you know, I think isn't there a guy in Doctor Who called the Major or the Brigadier or something? Yeah, this game is Brigadier as hell. It's really that.
That's the thing it really reminded me of. If you have a nostalgia for that, that's quite cool. But I think if you're expecting something maybe a little bit more fully realized as like a Fallout game, like a complete world that seems to have its own kind of politics and everything, I don't think it's quite that.
Yeah, I think I agree with that. I think this is actually what AA is and what people think AA is now is actually AAA, which what I mean by that is there's quite a gulf in production values between this and Avowed, for example, and Avowed is the game that everyone is calling AA. And I'm just like, it's not.
It's just that what AAA is has become so expensive and warped. We just don't and we know nothing about video game budgets publicly, that we have no idea what we're talking about when we throw these terms around. But I think this is actually what it looks like when you make something that's a little bit limited in scope, a little bit different, but maybe not the highest end execution of that idea.
Like where you maybe feel like it, if you did have sort of an extra couple of years, more time, more money, maybe it does reach that next level of being a bit more like a fallout kind of thing. But to me, it felt like a bit of, I would say, a survival game with a skin to it. You know what I mean?
It doesn't have like hunger meters or anything like that, but you do die very quickly. Like fall damage is pretty severe in this. So you are like, you know, you're scoffing down like whatever tins of spam and bread and cakes and all the food stuff is very sort of, you know, Britain sort of village fate coded, I'd say.
And you're warfing that stuff down. There's a lot of crafting, like crafting seems to be how you get any kind of foothold in this world. Like you get like some junk weapons, but you can start crafting sticky bombs.
And then all of a sudden, you know, you can probably take down a few bandits at once. And that kind of takes off a bit. So yeah, it is very much its own thing.
And you know, maybe it's wrong to try and pigeonhole everything, you know, it would have been easy for it to be like Fallout to say that. But yeah, I can kind of see what they've done it because they obviously have Sniper Elite as this like big ongoing thing. And you probably want like another string to your bone, see if you can launch something else, but you don't want to bet like the whole studio on it.
So it's kind of feels like a Sniper Elite sized game. Like it's the difference between like a 15 hour sort of open world RPG and hundreds of hours. It can be done in, people say I'm only a few hours into it.
Yeah, I think that scale wise, especially think of it as something like, obviously the structure is completely different, but like Deathloop, for example, where you go to a handful of districts that are, you know, kind of like connected. Here they are literally connected by an area called the Interchange, which is basically just a really, really long series of corridors that you walk through. It feels like it takes ages to get through them.
And then yeah, the districts are like notable. They have their own identity and reason to exist, but they are quite, like Matthew says, are not gigantic necessarily. They are like small levels really for you to explore rather than an open world.
And yeah, I agree. Having another strength bow is a good idea for success. I think it will be.
It being on Game Pass is such a good fit for it as well, because you can immediately just jump in and see if it's your sort of thing. Does a few other things that are interesting. So enemies don't attack you on site necessarily.
There's a bit of a like back away, and then like these outlaw guys won't necessarily attack you. So that's like a little bit interesting, trying to simulate what it would be like if you did encounter these people out in the world. I think that I wish it had a little bit more in terms of builds to explore.
Like when you look in the upgrades menu in the game, it's very, they're very, very mild. First of all, they don't let you upgrade all of your powers straight away, but they're all very, very mild, like a slightly more powerful kick or a health boost or something like that. It's not like you're crafting, it's not like you're unlocking magic powers or anything.
It's very, very light stuff. It's quite, yeah. Yeah, if it was like a spinoff of Sniper Elite, it would almost make sense to me because it just feels like it's grounded a little bit more in realism than maybe you might be expecting from the setting.
Yeah. The size of the districts at time, it might be comparable with how some of the levels work in Dishonored in terms of scale. And sometimes I did find myself slipping into like, oh, is this meant to be a bit immersive to me?
Like, I can crawl through this window or I can sneak through this grass or I can go all the way around here or the fact that there are all these different entry points into every quest. But the actual core powers aren't really interesting enough. And like you say, like, unless the last tier of unlocks, which I haven't bought yet in in-game, are like really out there.
Your character, you know, you're not getting a Dishonored style kind of toolkit to cause havoc with. You know, it's it's very much like, you know, you're going to be crafting, throwing explosives at people or hitting them with cricket bats or bows. And, you know, all this skill system is just going to make all those slightly softer to sort of engage with.
So that's, yeah, that's kind of shit. Because I saw a couple of you say like, oh, it's actually an immersive sim. I was like, is it?
I'm not sure about that.
I'm not sure about that. I think it's just quite a simple survival brawler kind of game.
Yeah.
I think it does all the things that survival games do, right down to the fact that I've never, I've never seen good crafting in a survival game, the close, or any game really, like the best.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, wait. Oh, sorry. Wait, wait, wait.
Well, yeah. Okay. So there is like a tangibility to the way Zelda does it, that is superior.
I agree. If Nintendo can do it, like we all know that's just a fact.
Yeah. Maybe not when it comes to like actually using the system to attach things to other things.
Well, let's look at the draft results and see who agrees or disagrees with this.
Yeah. Well, if you'd swap Smash Bros. with Mario Kart, maybe it would be a better shot.
Anyway.
Anyway, that's not so abstract.
I think it's... I've always resented how successful survival games are because when I was on PC Gamer, there would always be a new one that would just like jank as fuck, that just would explode with thousands of people buying it. You hear so many times here people online complaining about games not being polished enough, AAA games, and they release.
And yet, an early access will buy any old dogshit and not really quantify what good looks like versus the thing they just bought. And it's really irritating to see these games take off when they had no animations, barely any mechanics, but a really long roadmap of, oh, we'd like to do this, we'd like to do that. And some of those games do bear fruit and turn into successful, and they're interesting, and they're cool.
Things like The Long Dark, DayZ. These games definitely exist, but there are tons of them that no one remembers. And so I always hated when those games came out of the woodwork and were just absolute dog shit.
This is not that. This is like perfectly, perfectly fine. And like, it's pretty polished.
And like, I think that if you, I think even though the setting is not the deepest thing in the world, in terms of it's not constantly wowing you with props, like Matthew says, it's very much that each area has like one or two visually distinctive things about it. But then otherwise, it feels like you're going through some quite similar environments. So if that sounds like your sort of thing, and you know, it's like a 40 quid game, it's like worth a punt.
And Game Pass makes it like a really easy, you know, recommendation. I'm not in love with it, but I think it's like an all right version of what it is, you know?
Yeah. I think if you are 40 to 55, this is going to hit slightly differently, because it's, I think it's tapping into stuff which was probably bigger in your childhood than it was for us.
Yeah.
I work with Matt Elliott, who sometimes writes for PC Gamer and Neuro Gamer, and he's like a huge British folk horror guy, and I just know that he's going to be picking up on ten times more stuff than I am. Whereas I'm walking around going, oh yeah, this seems like a version of England, and then I'll be like, oh, that sign is the same shape as the 40 Towers sign. I get that, and I do the Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme, but I get the feeling there's other stuff going on around me, which I might not get.
I have a question for you about folk horror. Is there anything more to folk horror than some people in some nice dresses dancing around a maypole, a big man made of sticks, twigs, and someone at some point having bees set on them? A woman dancing naked behind a door, and someone at some point being set on fire?
I think these are very specific examples.
Well, they are, but I think that's it, isn't it? Is there any kind of thematic thing behind it?
I don't really get it. It's not my bag, folk horror. The horror of…
I guess what's freaky about it is the community element, right? It's that you stumble into a community and it turns out that their tradition or pastime that brings them all joy is absolutely horrific for you or someone else, and as an outsider or an observer it's really scary, but it's that juxtaposition of, oh god, all my innards are being pulled out, but like a little girl, this is like the best day of summer for her. But I don't find that particularly scary as a thing.
There was that… what was the Ben Wheatley one? Which was…
that was quite fucked up about the hitman.
Oh no wait, so, oh wait, oh of course, Kill List. I was just thinking about that from today.
That was something slight… that felt like it ramped up to 10 in quite a gnarly way.
Yeah, so did Midsummer actually. I think that also got to that point.
Yeah.
Kill List is unusually like grotty and… Bleak. Yeah, it's so good though.
If you want to know what me and Dave Scarborough look like when we're on the town, it's definitely what those two lads look like in that film. So that's very much our vibe. Meet me with a wound that won't heal properly.
Yeah, not good. Yeah, that's a good point actually. I had counted out how…
That is quite scary, the end stretch of that film, isn't it?
Generally it's a genre I tend to think more silly than scary.
Yeah.
But I don't know, people, when they're into it, they're into it. The League of Gentlemen guys, they're all super into it and it's super impactful on their work. And there's probably a bit of Royston Vasey to some of the stuff in Atomfall, when you get to the big town, if you go into the big town area, there's a little bit of that, everyone's a bit creepy and spooky and looks like they're probably played by one of four people, so as all villages do.
Yeah, good accents in this game for sure. You will hear a Welsh person in this game and that's quite rare to hear Welsh people in video games that aren't like The Witcher or other games that we'll discuss in this episode, I'm sure. So yeah, I do rate that about it.
I also, my tip as well, is the game will give you a recommended difficulty setting that I think is a bit too hard for most people. I would say drop that by one and see how you get on with it, because this is some encounters where you will feel a bit overwhelmed and underpowered and a bit like you're just bashing your head against the wall, and you can definitely have an easier time than that. So I would say, yeah, but do that before maybe just feeling like you're at a hard stop with it.
Just drop it a little bit, see how you get on. Anything more you want to say on that before Matthew or should we move on?
No.
Yeah, I think that was a good chunk. I think we've basically got half of what we've been playing. That was sizable enough.
So Matthew, do you think we get enough British settings in games? It feels like we don't have that many, but then I think how many games are set in France, Spain, Germany, outside of fucking World War II games, Hearts of Iron or wherever, we're probably doing all right by comparison. It's just that games are disproportionately set in places like New York, LA or Tokyo.
But what do you think?
I think we do okay. I mean, if you look every five years, it feels like there's a big AAA game, normally made by Ubisoft, which is set in the UK or draws on the UK historical setting, which is a way better hit rate than most countries. And certainly in the last five years or so, I feel like there's been some indie games which have drawn on it.
And people who are working in a space where they can reflect their own life experience a little bit more easily. You know, the money it costs to make a photorealistic version of anything is so astronomical that, you know, you have to be so careful with it, which is probably why everyone goes to, like, you know, sexy Japanese cities and New York, like you say. But I feel like, you know, even outside of the UK thing, you begin to see a lot of indie games are taking us to, like, you know, geographic locations around the world, which is quite exciting, and there seems to be more of that.
So I hope that's going to usher in, like, even more, like, UK-set games, ideally outside of London. There's a lot of London stuff.
Yeah.
And then it gets kind of harder as you get further from it.
Yeah, and that is one of the things that is great about Atomfall, is that it just, yeah, like I said, it's a place that is underindexed by games. You will not feel like you've seen that place in games before, even if maybe you can see in your mind's eye what a version of this, where someone spent 200 million making it looks like. Yeah.
It was probably not going to happen anyway. So, yeah, it's nice at least to see that setting represented. And yeah, hopefully we'll try and push a little bit outside of London with our next exercise, Matthew, which is we're going to create a little canon of defining games set in the UK.
They can be the best, the worst, or just the most iconic. And to do this, me and Matthew each came up with ten games to chuck into the pot. I think we'll have some crossover in there inevitably.
But games that are set in the UK and if they're not set in the UK, there's like an argument to have them in here anyway as part of the mix. That's basically how I saw this, Matthew. Is that how you approached this too?
Yeah, yeah, I kind of went, there's something noticeably British about them for better or worse.
Yeah, absolutely. And I think that I definitely tried to run the gamut of small games, old games, big games, slightly more esoteric things. Games where people maybe have forgot they're even set in the UK.
Is that how you took it?
Well, I feel like I've got a relatively conservative 10 suggestions. So I'm interested if you've managed to find some better kind of corners of this than I have. One thing I struggle with, you know, outside of things that just came to mind or I remembered from a long time ago, trying to find some conversation starters with a Google search, like games set in Britain or British games, it's not helpful at all because they're just like, oh, games made in Britain.
You're like, no, I really don't want this.
Let me just say that there's five or six picks that are really obvious, and then four that are maybe a bit interesting or more left-field. I mean, I don't want to over-egg it either. There aren't so many games set in the UK that it's possible to pick out really distinct entries where they have a lot of environmental detail where it's worth discussing anyway.
So with that in mind, Matthew, let's build this little hall of fame then of games set in the UK. So do you want to chuck in your first entry first?
Yeah, so I'll start with the one which I think is the most Britain, which is Forza Horizon 4.
Yeah, I didn't put this on my list because I assumed you would pick it.
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's open world but made to a very high standard, so it's able to recreate it. In terms of like, here's a game which is trying to recreate chunks of Britain that you're going to recognise. I think this is pretty high up the list.
It also isn't London, so it's sort of the Cotswolds, some sort of Midlands, a little bit of Wales, and gets up to Edinburgh and some Highlands. It's quite a mad map, like it doesn't make any sense. It's not like The Crew or something, which is trying to kind of recreate, you know, the whole world or anything like that.
It's like an impossible map, but, you know, there isn't a big urban centre outside of Edinburgh, which in itself is, you know, quite a historic city, so it's not much like anything else there. Really, it's the kind of Cotswolds, Midlands, English countryside that I absolutely love in this game. Really kind of...
Well, I say it captures the sensations of driving down, like, windy country roads. It doesn't, because you tend to be hooning across the fields and scattering fenceposts and driving through little brick walls. But, you know, it's a kind of dream version of what the English countryside is like, if you could drive as the crow flies.
I think that's pretty fun and exciting. You know, you bang on some, like, British classical music while you're doing that stuff. And, you know, it's such a treat.
Also, it has, like, and it's not Britain as a geographical place, but that there is, like, a line through it of it's sort of celebrating, like, British racing games. And there's, like, a big side story which kind of sort of honours different series which were made here. And that I like as well.
Like, it just feels like a Brits made it. They really love Britain. They really love British games.
It looks fucking brilliant. Like, yeah, it's good stuff.
Yeah, I think this has to go in for the simple reason that I think this is this game, just by the numbers, will have exposed people more to that British countryside setting than maybe any other piece of media from the last, like, 10 years. You know what I mean? Like, where else would, if you live in the US or, you know, all the parts of the world where people play Forza Horizon 4, where else would you encounter this setting in popular culture?
You probably wouldn't, right? Other than maybe, like, a background in a miserable fantasy drama or something.
Yeah, like in The Shire, maybe, in Lord of the Rings.
Yeah, but that's all New Zealand, isn't it? So, you know.
Yeah, but like, The Shire has got a bit of, like, you could imagine these cars are tearing up The Shire.
Yeah, also, I suppose, I think they are filming that Lord of the Rings TV show in the UK, aren't they? I think they moved filming of that for season two. Not that I ever watch it, because I thought the first episode of it was the most boring thing I've ever seen in the world.
About 85 characters in it, not my sort of thing. But yeah, I think that's a dead cert, Matthew. I think that has to go in.
Is this game still on sale? Is this one of the ones you can buy?
I can never remember, because they do vanish. I got a horrible feeling it's one which isn't now. And they're just all in on five, which you can now play on PlayStation, of course.
Well, OK, well, we won't hold it against the game, but...
No, it existed at one point. Look up the Rock Paper Shotgun, Forza Horizon Review. It's my first video that popped when I was on the channel.
And yeah, I'm quite proud of that one.
Yeah, OK. Well, that's... I mean, that makes sense that it's here, Matthew.
I think likewise, we have to put one of the Fable games in as well, which would be my first suggestion. I know it's not technically the UK, but it is the UK, isn't it?
And so I think you're saying... It wasn't in my top 10, because I didn't know where exactly it sat, but...
Yeah, I guess I am bending the rules here, but I think that even if it's not strictly a real-world location, it's got to be included in that, you know, sort of like it evokes a certain type of setting, arguably the kind of setting that Forza Horizon 4 also evokes, but it's kind of the other end of it, where it's more down to the people in the surroundings rather than just the surroundings themselves, you know? So, yeah, I think Fable 2 is the one I would pick here, Matthew. Fable 3, things have gone a bit wrong.
It's all got a bit Victorian children down the chimney vibes under Michael Fassbender in that game, which is, you know, a really interesting twist to that game. But I think Fable 2 is maybe what people still hold as, like, that's what Fable looks like in their minds. What do you think?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I love Fable, and I think it is, yeah, like, while not Britain, I know it's Albion, a fantasy idea of Britain, and its history is sort of the same. I do like how over the series, like, industrialisation arrives, and that's quite a fun kind of hook for it all.
Yeah, Fable 2 is the one. Fable 3 has got Ben Kingsley doing an absolutely terrible, like, Welsh druid character, which should instantly ban it from this list, I think.
Well, obviously, the ending of Fable 3 makes that game very controversial to discuss. I really like Fable 3, but I can see why 2 is still the one that is probably going to be hanging over the series when that new one comes out, you know?
Fable 3 does most accurately or more accurately than any other game, perhaps capture, like, modern Britain in that to win it. You basically have to become, like, mega landlord, and that's, you know, and you basically just, like, rent out the entire kingdom to fund war.
If, yeah, if Prince Charles style, like, your citizens can die and you just take their property for no reason, that's yours now, then that's, like, that's the way to win, basically. So, yeah, just buy all the property and, yeah, make all the money. Okay, good stuff.
Well, that goes in there. So what's your next suggestion, Matthew?
Let's go... Let's go Assassin's Creed Syndicate.
Mm, not on my list either, because I thought, again, you would probably pick this.
I've got two proposals for Assassin's Creed, because we've obviously got Assassin's Creed Valhalla as well, and it's like, which end of, which end of like British history do you want? Do you want it where it's, it doesn't really look like anything. If anything, there's like more Roman stuff left over, then there is, you know, any kind of inkling of like modern Britain, which is Valhalla when the Vikings turn up, or you've got Syndicate, which is sort of Victorian era, you know, very much like, you know, satanic mills and industrialization and people with excellent moustaches and hats, absolutely exploiting the shit out of anyone skinny enough to fit into a piece of industrial machinery, basically.
It's very Snowpiercer. Yeah, I don't know. I just, there is, there is something, I kind of like both of them.
I think the kind of cartoonish version of like Victorian London gives you some like really good villains and people you want to kill because it's like, you know, where, you know, a country really begins to like lose its soul as like money takes over. And so that's kind of interesting. But I also, I do like the big countryside of Valhalla.
Maybe Valhalla is kind of a little too close to what Forza Horizon 4 does in that it's just a hit of like, oh, I want to see some big fields and trees. I'm pretty sure Valhalla is the only game either of us is going to suggest, which lets you go to the Isle of Wight. Which, that's a big plus, which for Americans is if you ever looked at the UK on a map and wondered what that tiny little island right in the middle of the south is, there's like, it's just a weird little island where like people from the mainland basically go over there, get coloured sand and then leave and that's it.
That's what the Isle of Wight is for, I think.
Can I think of anything else I did in the Isle of Wight? I mean, it's like the ultimate day trip place for people, right? Or at most, you stay over one night and you can see everything on that island in that time.
I mean, where I lived, I just looked at it all the time and yeah, coloured sand is definitely what I remember about it. Was there some kind of like theme parkish thing there? Not like the full theme park.
Yeah, Black Gang China, is that it?
Yeah, that's it, that's it. That's where you get the coloured sand. That's where I rode my first roller coaster.
I say roller coaster, I look at pictures of it later and it turned out it was just like a flat loop with like a little bump in it, which a very slow train went around. But, you know, I absolutely screamed my head off and cried and cried and cried. So I was so scared of the roller coaster at this children's theme park.
The other thing about Isle of Wight is you can take a hovercraft there from Portsmouth. That's interesting. Hovercraft.
That's cool.
Isn't it more expensive than just getting on a boat?
I think so. There was a classic Isle of Wight joke when I was in school. This used to absolutely kill.
Really taking some shots here on this episode.
No, this isn't anything. This isn't like negative or anything.
What's big and steaming and comes out of cows? The Isle of Wight ferry. Because cows is the port.
There's a port called Cows.
Right. Okay.
Yeah.
Okay. That is.
That used to absolutely just destroy in the playground in 1993.
Well, that's good. I just completely forgotten. Do they have their own new port out there?
Different from the Wales one. Is that right? Is there a...
I don't remember.
It's a kind of mad shit. But anyway...
We wish it well, the Isle of Wight.
Yeah. I mean, does that make the top British games just because it represents quite a weird bit of Britain?
Well, that's the thing is Valhalla's undeniably got scale. But when you look at any individual part of it, it's not hugely distinctive. It's a bit like the problem with Assassin's Creed 3's New York, where even dialed up even further because it's so much further back than that.
Yeah.
Where there's like, oh yeah, not only is there no Times Square here, it's basically just some thatch huts and that's basically your lot, you know what I mean? And maybe Stonehenge. Can you parkour up Stonehenge in Valhalla?
Is that a thing you can do, Matthew?
Yeah, you can. There's Stonehenge. You can climb around on that.
That's quite good.
Cinder gets a good choice, though, I think, because I think that setting does get your blood pumping. It's by far, I would say it would be like the top five most interesting Assassin's Creed settings, and it does realise it very well. It's from that era where the games are quite simple to play still mechanically, but the budget definitely goes into making the world feel like a proper place off the back of...
You also get your own Steam train, which is, that's quite English feeling.
Jack the Ripper DLC as well, right? I mean, that again is quintessentially English, a man who kills sex workers. So that goes into the list as well.
Okay, well, I think that's probably a firm...
Let's pencil it in.
Yeah, absolutely. We've got three so far. Next up Matthew, I bring to your attention The Getaway on PlayStation 2.
Oh yeah, that is also on my list.
I mean, I think this has to go in because if you ask anyone outside the UK, what's a video game set in the UK, they would say The Getaway. And it is obviously a snapshot of early noughties London, despite being a pretty inept game and having a warped photorealism that's maybe not aged that well. The novelty of driving around it still hasn't dissipated, I think, because you're just curious to see how much of London they've really put in there because it was contemporary London.
Nothing like this had ever been done before. What do you think?
Yeah, I mean, it's a literal snapshot of London as it was, in that they took loads of photos and scanned them in for textures. So, like, the kind of novelty factor of that. Also, I think something that taps into one of our biggest exports, which was sort of Cockney gangster films, is definitely, that feels like quite a key part of the Britain equation.
Yeah, bad game, though. I only played like an hour and a half of it. Couldn't get any further, because it was difficult and a bit, you know, a bit like Driver 3, I thought.
Yeah, it's definitely got some problems. It's a bad shooter. It definitely looked nice at the time.
I think that if you played it in the precise window they released it, and you were the right age, and you were, like, big into GTA and wanted anything like it, I think it really worked, because I played the demo, I played a bit at a mate's house, and I was so into it. And then by the time I could actually buy it for myself in 06, I think, like, 2 or 3 years down the line, 3 or 4 years down the line, I bought it and the magic was completely gone. And I was like, this is crap.
I wonder what this game Saints Row on 360 is like instead, because this is rubbish, even compared to, like, San Andreas, obviously the getaway was left long behind. So, yeah. But nonetheless, as a British artefact, I think the British gangster thing is very true.
I think people still think that's one of our defining pop culture things. I guess it is, because, like, The Gentleman on Netflix, right? And Guy Ritchie is still making films.
And Matthew Vaughan doesn't really make films in that vein anymore, but he made Layer Cake, which is the best one of those films, I think. So, yeah. The getaway goes in despite being a crap video game.
Good stuff, Matthew. What's your next pick?
So, you may take issue with this. I wonder if Return of the Obra Dinn counts as a British game.
I haven't really thought of that, but I can see it.
Because it's about a boat, so it leaves. Like, it's a boat where all the interesting stuff has happened away from the UK, but it left the UK and it comes back to the UK. You are, you know, an insurance investigator looking at the crew of this vanished boat.
I think it comes in at Falmouth in Cornwall. So, it's technically set there and it's full of British voices.
There's a bit of colonial energy to it as well.
It has, yeah, it's like whether we want to honour our colonial past.
Well, it's not honour, it's just like representing.
Represent it.
And acknowledging it's shameful, you know. That's all it is.
So, I mean, my case for its occlusion, it really isn't any more complicated than that. And I like it appearing, you know, on this podcast wherever it can. An interesting range of British voices as well.
Like, you know, you only hear voices in this when you go back to the moments of people's death, but you get like an audio sort of snapshot of the lines leading up to a murder or an accident or whatever. And you get to hear the different like tears of the ship. You know, they're the kind of posh officer class and then you have the, you know, people at the bottom of the ladder who are kind of like rougher sounding.
So it kind of captures, you know, a full cross section of British society. I know, admittedly, most of those voices are going, ah! But that's the nature of dying, isn't it?
Very much so. That kind of thing. Yeah, I think that this will probably go to the maybe pile.
I think, because I think thematically it's a good, like the environment is not hugely evocative in terms of, it doesn't make you think of Britain when you think of the boat, right? Because you are on a boat the whole time. It's very true, there is like a lot of seafaring British colonial stuff flowing through this game's veins, and we don't have that represented elsewhere, so.
I think also maybe having rewatched Master and Commander in the last year for the pod, you should go back and listen to that episode, it's a fun one. Yeah, like I like the idea of like a little bit of Britain, you know, somewhere on the other side of the world, and you kind of take all your weird values on your little boat with you. I think there's something quite novel about that.
I mean, this, this, the crew of the Obra Dinn are like actually far more diverse. They pick up all kinds of people on there. So yeah, maybe it's fine.
I'll accept maybe.
All right. Well, we'll come back to it Matthew. So my next suggestion is Bloodborne, which on the day we're recording this is 10 years old.
I think this, the decay of this Victorian style, not London, but clearly London setting along with all the accents. So this is like a quintessentially British game to me, even if it's not strictly a one-to-one for Britain. I guess like the dark side of fable, right?
But what it evokes is just, I don't know, like the dark underbelly idea of Britain. I think the vibe of being British, certainly in the last 20 years, I think this game maybe sums it up quite well, even if it's accidental because the developers are Japanese. What do you think of Bloodborne being in the mix?
Yeah, I get the fable comparison. I can see how it could sit in this list, if fable can also sit in this list. I do wonder if it's just too fantastical.
Is it drawing only on the UK? Because I've always thought there was a bit of Dracula's Castle and Transylvania vibe to it, but maybe that's me. You've got to remember, I've only seen the opening hour of this for about 10 hours.
I've only seen the opening 5 hours of this for about 50 hours.
So I don't really know what happens beyond that. If beyond that opening hour, there's a Pret a Monge, then yeah, absolutely.
A Betfred. It's the fact that you've got all those NPCs saying, this turn's finished. And there's also just cackling ladies with very exaggerated British accents.
I think it is deliberately, but then obviously it's drawing from an array of influences. What I would say is, because we've got Syndicate in the list already, and Syndicate is the actual time and place that they are riffing on, I think that maybe Syndicate stays in this and this goes, Matthew. I think that's probably a fair compromise.
Let's put it on the maybe list, because we don't know how rotten the rest of the picks are going to be.
I think there's still quite a lot to discuss.
Yeah, but I do get it. And I am curious why, well not actually why, I am curious how much of a role Miyazaki has in picking the voices for the non-Japanese version.
Yeah.
You know, where's that coming from? All the games have that kind of weird, you know, voice actors you can't quite place, but have probably been in TV dramas. Like, it always makes me laugh when you go to the theatre and get a programme and some obscure actor in the play has got like a Bud Blon credit, like in their little bio.
So it's like, I've been in The Bill, The Casualty, EastEnders, Bridgerton, Bloodborne, of course that's my video game credit.
That's so good, I love that. That's great. I love the idea that this, that game was keeping people in work.
I guess most of the From games have British voice actors as well.
Yeah, that's why I'm curious. What is it that, you know, does it mean I can just go like, just get me, get me my guys, you know? That's how, that's how my fictional universe sounds.
So please hire them again or...
I think in Sekiro, they're American, I think. The voice of America.
Yeah, that would be jarring if they were all Cockneys.
All right, Chum, welcome to Tokyo or whatever. And you're like, I don't really, it doesn't quite make sense. I guess at that point, you're getting in some more of the Chernobyl category of, you know, the reactors blimmin fizzed over or whatever.
And it's just, you know, this is not quite, it can be effective, but you have to land the plane with it. So it can be tricky. Yeah, okay, that goes into the maybe pile.
And so we go to your next pick, Matthew.
So I'm gonna pick indie point and click game from the last couple of years, The Excavation of Hobbs Barrow.
Oh, yeah, I was hoping you had played this so you could talk about it.
Yeah, so this is the story of a lady whose name, she's called Thomasina, I think. And she heads to the Moors to excavate a barrow, a kind of buried, it's like a burial site. Yeah, you just got to take my word for it.
I haven't got anything more to say on that matter. She goes there. And you know, it's sort of pixel arts, you know, looks kind of like in the vein of like the old LucasArts games, but is set in a real world location.
Point and click games are actually quite a rich genre for depictions of the UK. Like some of the Broken Sword games have had scenes set in places around Britain. There was a game a few years ago, Grey Matter, which was set in Oxford.
You know, people who want like a kind of calm setting for their strange mystery adventure to play out, like the UK is a good fit for it. Anyway, this continues that tradition, but it's rendering a sort of slightly dour, forgotten Yorkshire town called Bowley, I want to say. And yeah, it's just capturing a sort of early 20th century, quite run down, quite forgotten, small stone houses, the church being quite prominent in the community, lots of local characters speaking with the local accent, lots of region specific slang.
Just I don't know if the team came from there, but it feels super authentic, very gray and misty. There is a bit of sort of, you know, without spoiling what the game is, like it feels like it could go folkcore-y. Whether or not it does, you have to kind of play for yourself.
Has this quite fun artistic twist in that, you know, when you're looking at the screen, it's obviously the whole scene played out in the style of those LucasArts games, but occasionally you get the kind of close up of a character's face, and they render them in the same pixel style, but in a bit more sort of photorealistic detail. So a face that looks slightly unreadable on the main screen suddenly becomes like a sort of gnarled, bearded figure in the pub or whatever, and you get like a close up sort of scare of a potato-faced local person, which is quite a fun mechanic. Actually, as I said that, Monkey Island used to do that too, the kind of close ups of people, so maybe that's what they're riffing on.
But, yeah, just like taking a style of game which traditionally takes us to more fantastical places and putting it in quite a grounded, believable version of a piece of the country that doesn't get represented as much, quite spooky, like you feel quite isolated there. Yeah, I just think it's cool. And like I said, this is what I was thinking of when I was talking about indie developers working at a scale where they can show parts of the world that bigger games might not be able to afford to.
I'm inclined to include this because whether it goes full folk horror or not, the setting, looking at screenshots of it will immediately make most people think of folk horror. And it would be nice to have something in that mold represented on our list, Matthew, just if we're taking it by a setting by setting basis. I think it makes sense.
So I would say that's probably dead cert. I think we say that goes in. Indeed, yeah.
So that goes in. Next to the getaway. That's perfect.
Okay, next up then, I think from me, along similar lines really, but very different only, we have to chuck in Thank Goodness You're Here, a game that neither you nor I laughed at, but features people in the North, in the UK, and was very much enjoyed by a lot of people who are not us. And I think it represents a certain type of British humour that is definitely sort of part of the cultural mix here, even if it's maybe in a quiet taste, to the likes of you and me. And yeah, again, it's just so different from anything else we've discussed so far and celebrates like a part of the UK that, again, you don't really see in games that much.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's a weird one, like you say, it's not really for us. Well, I don't know anyone other than us that doesn't like love this game.
So that's, you know, that was a funny episode when we both discovered that about this game that neither of us got on with it.
That's yeah, but yeah, I like that it represents not just a location, but also a style of British humour, a very League of Gentleman-y, you know, the fact that it's got this quite tight voice cast to a voicing multiple characters, that lends some of that kind of, you know, Monty Python energy as well. Obviously big thumbs up to John Blythe nominated for best voice acting at the BAFTAs this year for this.
Yeah, alongside Matt Berry, I believe.
Matt Berry, I mean, that's a tough competition, but you know, that's cool. Yeah, it's always nice when people you know get nominated for things.
Well, I think we should chuck this in just to keep the northerners off our back, Matthew. I think that's just a good reason to chuck them in there.
I think between that and Hobbs Barrow, we've accounted for sort of the dour northerners and also the ones who were up for a bit more of a laugh.
Yeah, perfect, really.
Which are the two kinds.
Representation. Yeah, perfect, no notes on that one. What's your next pick, Matthew?
My next pick. Oh, they're quite London centric, which is annoying.
Yeah, I think we're going to have a glut of ones that are quite similar to The Getaway, I think.
Yeah, well, I was wondering about, and it's a fucking another Ubisoft game, I was wondering about Zombie U.
Yeah, so I thought about this because there are various London Ubisoft games that all happen in a fairly tight window of time. So I don't know if they got it in their heads that London's a cool setting or something. But yeah, I guess like, yeah, Zombie U, so this is set in contemporary London and Watch Dogs Legion.
Maybe we should put them both up against each other for a potential spot here, because there's no point having both in there, I think, but.
Yeah, I mean, whether or not either of them makes it in, I don't know.
Yeah, because I feel like the getaway kind of ticks off London, London, and is the most London game to a lot of people, even if I would probably rather play Watch Dogs Legion out of the three of those these days.
Yeah.
What do you think? You play Zombie U more than me. I only played a little bit.
Yeah. So Zombie U's whole thing, obviously, it's a zombie game. You know, it's kind of London, but Night of the Living Dead and, you know, get some quite fun stuff out of locations which, you know, become quite spooky when they're isolated and full of zombies, like an underground station.
It begins in Shadwell. Underground is like your base of operations. But you do get to branch out to, you know, more tourist friendly locations like you end up in Buckingham Palace, smacking around, Beefeaters.
No, is that what they're named? No, Beefeaters Tower of London. Those guys with the big hats, the Royal Guard.
Beefeaters? Okay, fair enough.
Yeah. You get to smash them up with a cricket bat. You know, it is quite goofy.
It is quite cartoonish. It has that 28 days later thing of, oh, it's London, but empty and that's spooky. Like, you know, this shouldn't be like this really.
Whether or not that's enough, you know, to put another London game on the list, I don't know. What does Watch Dogs Legion do more interestingly?
Well, it is really the most appealing thing about it, which is, you know, this game is set in post-Brexit UK, which is, you know, the reality we live in. So not really that much of a sort of bold thing to us, but it's all got a bit tech dystopian. Yeah, people striking back against the machine, but I think what is appealing about it is the fact that you have a very nice-looking London with distinct areas.
It's not so precise in detail that you're looking at individual storefronts going, wow, it's definitely got a lot of that The Crew style recycled storefront stuff.
It's got lots of shops that are called like pizza, pizza, pizza.
Yeah, shoes or whatever. I don't know if the shoes is really one, but it definitely has that. I think if you look too closely, you see the seams, but the overall shape of it and the landmarks they do have in there.
The vibes of certain places I think is captured pretty well. Plus it has just tons and tons of NPCs. I don't think anyone quite thought the game was as good as it could have been, but it was certainly an interesting game.
And yeah, it's the nicest looking version of London you can technically see in a game these days.
I think that makes it a bit more worthwhile than Zombie. Just because it isn't like an open world London, you know, it's quite small locations and some of it's like a generic supermarket or, you know, some industrial unit somewhere and that isn't particularly exciting.
Yeah, I'm inclined to keep it off the list though, Watch Dogs, because the getaway is already in there and that is like the defining, not quite contemporary anymore, because it's kind of a period setting now. But, you know, yeah, to most people, it's still what London would look like.
I think when they played Watch Dogs Legion, I wasn't always struck with the, like the wow London of it all. Like, I don't know, because the sort of oppressive police force and all the security checks that are in place, kind of like put a layer of something over it all, that it just all feels a little bit alien, you know. I don't think you can just walk a lap of that city and feel like you're really in London, necessarily.
I agree. And I think that even though it has some of the same shortcomings in terms of, you know, maybe the storefront's not being super accurate or whatever, Watch Dogs 2 feels more like San Francisco, because it's not quite as tech oppressed as the semi futuristic setting of London. And like, definitely when you're walking along that coastline, it feels very, very San Francisco in a way where you're like, I mean, I literally downloaded it during the pandemic, because I thought, what if I never go here again?
I miss this place, you know what I mean? So yeah. OK, I think that maybe then Watch Dogs gets left out also, and the getaway remains, Matthew, despite being a bad game as previously established.
So what is your next suggestion?
Still Wakes the Deep.
So I had Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
Well, I also have that. That's how lazy my list is.
Well, I wonder. So both games from the Chinese room, Still Wakes the Deep, a much more elaborate game in terms of production values. Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, everyone has disappeared, and you're walking around this kind of British village setting trying to figure out what happened.
And there's a lot of environments that really evoke, again, a very specific kind of place that you don't normally see in games, in terms of that feel of campsites and pubs and things like that. Whereas Still Wakes the Deep is obviously on an oil rig offshore, but has loads of Scottish characters in it. Just for the sheer reason, Matthew, that it has Scottish characters in it and is set in Scotland, I feel like it should be Still Wakes the Deep that makes the list.
What do you think?
Yeah, I guess Still Wakes the Deep has some of the same pros and cons as Overdin, in that it's slightly detached, but it captures a load of voices. If anything, I wish there was a version of Still Wakes the Deep where I spent a little bit more time on the oil rig before we went to shit.
Right.
Because once it does go to shit, all these characters, they've still got Scottish accents, but they're basically like meatballs with tentacles. That's quite far removed from what they were before. Quite far removed.
So I don't know. I mean, would there ever be a case for both of them? Is that too much Chinese room?
The thing is, they are so... This is almost their corner, isn't it? They're like...
Yeah, but that's the thing. They're like, oh dear Esther, isn't that Scottish coastline as well?
Something like that, yeah. It's like an aisle or something.
Yeah, so it's got a lot of that. I mean, everybody's gone to the Rapture. I really admire how accurately it captures that.
I think it's like a Schwabshire town, but I do find it quite, quite... I mean, we're not voting on whether or not it's exciting or boring, but I have quite kind of plodding memories of that game. Yeah.
Which kind of colour it for, you know, like still wakes the deep. It has all those voices and it's also quite propulsive and exciting to play. Where everybody's gone to the Rapture, like you have to sort of sort of sit in it a bit and sort of stew it, stew in the vibes.
I will say everybody's gone to the Rapture feels like it draws from a lot of stuff that Atomfall does as well. Weirdly of all the games we've talked about, it's probably the one which has got the closest in terms of countryside location and the kind of buildings you'll be seeing and going into. But like Atomfall is...
Wyndham, like you say, that kind of...
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, but Atomfall is way more explicit in the look. These are all references.
Everybody's Gone to Rapture draws on the same things, just in a much more subtle way, which is cool in its own right.
Yeah. I think that... I'm going to make you choose between Stillwakesadip and Return of the Obra Dink.
So you make a good point about them not quite being set in the UK, but evoking something very strongly. Yeah. So I demand that you pick one, sir.
Yeah.
Obviously, you played Stillwakesadip with the posh English voiceover added, Matthew. I know that you paid 8.99 for that DLC, and it's like, sorry, sir, I didn't mean to get into a brawl there, sir. And, you know, it just adds a lot of accents that you can understand, I know, but...
Yeah. The Benedict Cumberbatch texture pack.
Yeah. It's Jared Harris voices every character in the game. Jared Harris!
Sorry, it comes to mind, because I was watching... He has a very small role in The Last of the Mohicans, which I started watching yesterday. And despite it being like...
Was he? He must be quite young.
It must be, but he looks the same. He's one of those guys who always looks at a certain age, I think. But yeah.
So what do you think? Obra Dinn or Stillwakes the Deep?
I think Stillwakes the Deep is more of a lived in location for you to walk around and like see life, even if it's only for like the first 45 minutes. And then a lot of that life is more around for much longer. I think Stillwakes the Deep ticks the box a little bit more.
Obra Dinn is a little more of an abstract choice.
I think that makes sense because Stillwakes the Deep can now go in as like a dead cert. And we take out one maybe, but we still got basically seven spots already filled. So it kind of makes sense to do that.
What about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture? Because it is very different, the setting. It evokes something very different and is also very successful.
I agree it's not maybe the most like stimulating game by comparison. Stillwakes the Deep has a lot more going on mechanically. And it's a more interesting thing to play now.
Whereas I think that Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, the appeal of it is that kind of diorama that you walk around basically.
Yeah. I mean, there is like no better sort of depiction of a, you know, almost photorealistic depiction of the inside of a country pub than Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, which I'd say is like quite an achievement, just like the kind of cut glass, you know, style of the pint glasses and the ash trays and everything. Like, they should almost be in there for that.
Like, you can smell that pub.
Yeah. It's like, yeah.
If any of these games is going to let you smell Britain, which, you know, should be an aim of the Hall of Fame. I think you can come closest to smelling it in Rapture. Yeah, OK.
All right.
Well, that can go in then. And even though it's not really competing with it, I am going to take out Bloodborne, because that would mean we have nine dead certs. We got eight dead certs.
So we're definitely going to have a few more games to talk about. I want to leave a little bit of space open. So Bloodborne goes and we've got Forza Horizon 4, Fable 2, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, The Getaway, Excavation of Hobbs Barrow.
Thank goodness you're here. Still wakes are deep and everybody's gone to the Rapture. That's a British ass set of games, I should say.
My next suggestion, Matthew, not technically the UK, but I think it's like the most high concept and interesting British prism through which to set a game, which is A Sunless Skies, which is basically Victorian-occupied space, and you traveling around it and encountering basically bits and pieces of things that evoke British life, except you're doing it in the stars. I played this a bunch during the pandemic, and it's a really nice game. It's like a mix of exploration, RPG, and a lot of writing and choices basically.
And the very specific way they do, they evoke a British setting without it being Britain is really smart. And I almost want to reward a game that does something like that. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Yeah, no, I completely get that. I mean, the fact that the screenshot that you always see of this is of like Big Ben, or something that looks like Big Ben floating in a cloud.
Yeah. Like sort of says it all really. Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's.
I'd say that's that's even more Britain adjacent than like a fable in how close it is.
Yeah, it's literally the Victorian Empire in the stars basically. So, yeah, yeah.
So yeah, and it's you know, it's a it's a very British studio and a very British sensibility and like, you know, the literary influences they're drawing on feel very British. Yeah, I think that's I think that's quite a good pick. Also gets us out of like the endless shiny kind of AAA things.
Yeah, it is there is no other it doesn't look like any other game that we picked or discussed so far. So yeah, I think it's just for for its ingenuity more than anything. I think it makes sense to go in here.
This is on Switch as well. If you've ever fancy giving this a try. It's so much so many words in this, but they're very well written.
So yeah, it's definitely worth a go. And I'm not normally a guy who likes pages and pages of text, but I think this is just very, very well done. OK, we have if that's a dead cert, Matthew, we have basically one spot to fill.
So what's your next pick?
Yeah, well, I've somehow chewed through one. I'm down to my last pick.
Well, that's OK. I think I've only got three left. So we're close.
Yeah, I think it's because I bundled some of them together, like the sets of screens.
That's all right.
So I, well, it's my last and probably weakest pick in terms of chances of it going in. But I thought I'd throw in a shout for The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
That was also on my list. So, yeah.
Oh, okay. Yeah, which is obviously the sort of historic Ace Attorney, where they come over to London and team up with Sherlock Holmes. It's a very cartoonish, silly version of London.
But that's almost the case I wanted to make for it, was I thought it was quite interesting to have a Japanese developer, in this case, Ace Attorney creator, Shutokumi, applying his idea of London that he's constructed from reading Sherlock Holmes and other British crime writers, and being a bit of an Anglophile, I guess. And then this is what he comes up with. I like his version.
There's some very period-specific details to it, which feel absolutely pulled out of Sherlock Holmes. There's a policeman always eating chips out of a newspaper cone and all this kind of stuff. I'm not saying that that was a big part of Sherlock Holmes, but that is a correct detail.
Yes, that is something that can happen. There are cases in this game which hinge on a working knowledge of how gas mains used to work in British guest houses and things like that. So it feels like he's done his research.
But then there's also a great exhibition, steampunk, with a mechanical man who may have done a murder, and there's quite a preposterous version of Madden Two Swords, with exhibitions based on recreating grisly murders. Unless that's the thing that happens at Madden Two Swords. I don't think it is.
I've never walked past it on the way to the Bethesda office, and it's got Captain America in the window, nothing about murders.
Yeah. I used to walk past that every day when I went to pick up Catherine after work when I lived in London, because you just have to walk that way, and just seeing all the queues of people who are going to, you know, see a wax grin or whatever.
I don't get it. I truly don't understand it.
It's not really for me. But yeah, I like it that it is one non-English person's take on London, and that it is slightly infused with this anime sensibility. You know, I like the fact that there are Japanese versions of characters from Sherlock Holmes in the mix and Sherlock Holmes himself or her look, Shomes, you know, has got a slightly different look and these sort of steampunky goggles that he sometimes wears.
I think it's a fun twist, if not necessarily truly British.
Yeah, I mean, we've got Ubisoft London, we've got PS2 London, but we haven't got anime London, so I say let's do it. That's a good suggestion. It just, yeah, very visually distinct to anything else in this list.
So I think that goes in as a dead cert with the caveat that I've got two games left to throw into the mix. So yeah, I mean, OK, so I thought we should talk about Grand Theft Auto London 1969, because even though it's an expansion pack, it came on hot on the heels of Austin Powers and went for the whole swinging 60s thing, which is not done by any other games here. It's arguably superficial because it's 2D GTA, not 3D GTA, but I think it evoked London quite well.
The music choices certainly did as well. I think that as a kind of like map pack for GTA, it works. My only thinking is that because we have the getaway there, that kind of is the defining open world London game.
But bonus points to GTA London 1969 having the old cab that's been painted yellow and has a big gun strapped to it as the tank. That's really good. And then, yeah, actually having the Austin Powers car in there as well with the Union Jack on top.
It also a fun touch. Do you ever play this, Matthew?
No, I didn't. But I was well aware of it. It didn't review particularly well.
Like, no, it's very much more of the same. That's the thing.
Yeah. But, you know, you do get to drive a shaggy or so, you know, it's a strong case for it. Yeah, I'm the only thing you could potentially ding it for.
Is that, because I was watching a little bit of this footage this afternoon, so I thought this might come up. And, well, it's quite gritty. It doesn't reflect the true nightmare that is driving in London.
That's a great thing to dig it for. I like that.
It looks more like an American city layout, you know?
Yeah, I suppose that's true, actually, because it's a lot of straight bridges. And, yeah, that's kind of how I remember it as well.
So, well, I think the getaway is quite true to London being like a bit of a nightmare to get your head around.
Interesting, but a curio more than something that needs to go on the list, I think. So that can be left off. That's fine.
But we acknowledge, you know, it has been said.
Yeah, exactly. Last up then, Resistance Fall of Man, which is a game that has levels set in York, Manchester, Nottingham, Somerset, Grimsby, Bristol and The Thames. And if you want a game that evokes the kind of like grim grey skies of the UK, then look no further than this, this PS3 brown ass shooter, which is like, I think actually accidentally reverses into being quite an authentic sort of like colour palette of the UK.
That's what I was going to ask. It's like, is this a brown ass game because of the locations it's recreating? Or is it a brown ass game, sorry, brown ass game because of the era?
I think honestly, it's probably the era than anything, because if you look at Resistance 3, which is set in the US, it has largely the same colour palette despite being set, like in New York or whatever. I kind of more wanted to note it than anything, it's a lot of like going through blown out churches and things like that. It's basically a World War II shooter, but the novel factor is that you are fighting aliens in a World War II timeframe with a similar weaponry and you're an American guy, but you're surrounded by British NPCs and stuff.
So I don't think it needs to go in because I wouldn't muscle out, everybody's gone to the Rapture to give it a spot. But again, Matthew did want to note, the Resistance Fall of Man is a game set in the UK. And it's quite a different spin on that kind of setting than I've seen before.
So yes, okay. We have the 10 then, Matthew. This is as it stands.
Are you sure you don't want to punch out Great Ace Attorney for Resistance?
No, I like having the anime aesthetic in there. It's just, I'm all about the visual variety of how these places are evoked and…
Yeah, and I guess it's very us. Though Resistance, you know, you've got a fondness for it.
It's a fun, it's a, it's pretty, it's pretty good two-person co-op shooter Resistance. Definitely enjoyed playing it back in the day, but wouldn't say it stands to test the time necessarily. Not that that is the exercise, but I also don't think necessarily that people think of the UK when they think of Resistance, which is maybe also a litmus test for that one.
Yeah, I think the newspaper's kicking off because you've got to shoot out the windows of a cathedral.
That is true. That does happen. It's like just any old setting in the game, really.
It doesn't really evoke that when you're in there.
I think the Daily Mail were like, this is an outrage. PlayStation are making a game where you have to destroy cathedrals. You're like, well, that isn't technically true.
That isn't the aim of the game.
Yeah, it's an entire game about that.
It's me, Tony Cathedral Smasher.
I love that guy. I don't know if he made it into PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, but okay. I'll tend then, Matthew.
We've got Forza Horizon 4, Fable 2, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, The Getaway, The Excavation of Hobbs Barrow, Thank Goodness You're Here, Still Wakes Are Deep, Everybody's Gone To The Rapture, Sundus Skies and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. Would you change any of that?
No, I was desperately trying to think back to like, my Amiga days, if any of my Amiga games were set in like, cursed versions of like 80s or 90s Britain. Just to have something a bit older in there. Because I thought with all those UK developers, there must have been something.
But I struggled to think of anything that, well, that I A, remembered or B, truly liked. So, it's quite a modern list.
It is, but I think that's okay. Because I think that, I mean, most of those games you can go out and still play in some form or another, right? Fable 2 is on Xbox backwards compatibility.
It's not on PC, but such as it is. The Getaway, PS2, one of the easier consoles to emulate. And to be honest, you could just watch a bit of The Getaway.
You'll get the vibe of it. You don't need to play it, I would say. And the rest, I think, are all available on Steam or Switch or wherever.
So it's a pretty good mix.
I think if you played that list, you'd completely understand Britain.
Nothing more needs to be said, really. It covers a complete political history. It's all in there, if you look deep enough.
OK, Matthew, let's take a quick break and come back with some cursed British awards to see us out.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, we have some Cursed British Game Awards to see us out. Only second only to the BAFTAs as the most prestigious video games awards ceremony in the United Kingdom, Matthew.
Which British comedian's gonna be hosting this section?
Let's see, we can't afford Dara O'Brien, who's not British anyway, so I take that back and I apologize, which is a very British thing to do, isn't it? Can't afford Rob Beckett, can't afford James Zocaster. Who's more in our range?
Roy Chubby Brown? No, can't, you know, just too cursed.
What about John Kearns? I like him.
Yeah, okay, that's good. Or, I was gonna say, that bloke who's in Dead Ringers, John Colshaw. I think we can get John Colshaw.
John really cursed. John Colshaw, but he'll do all the other comedians' voices.
Yeah, maybe we'll give him like Jan Ravens, the sort of two-hander, you know, it's just...
Oh my god, look at this. Dead Ringers knowledge coming out.
If that doesn't work, then one of the blokes who's in Staff Let's Flats, who's not staff, we'll try and get one of them to...
Oh, that tall one.
Yeah, perfect. That works.
The tall one from Staff Let's Flats.
Okay, good stuff. And yeah, basically you get a very small bottle of wine on the table. You get that.
The starter is a tomato soup that is cold when served. It's not a gazpacho. It's just that it took too long to serve.
It's gone cold. Sorry about that. Got one very hard piece of bread on the side.
The dinner is like a Sunday roast, but it's so tiny. It's like a micro, micro bit of chicken and one bit of broccoli and one roast potato. You'll eat it and go, I swear that was 350 calories.
Then on to the dessert, which is just some angel delights made by me and Matthew en masse out back.
Please tell me that there's quite a drunk marketing manager on a low-level British publishing house here.
Yeah, it is. When it's time for me and Mo to collect his industry legend award, that's when the drunk marketing manager gets up and gives us a 15-minute speech, where he burns every bridge in his career basically. It's everything you want in a British award ceremony in one place.
Is it in a cold tent somewhere?
Yeah, you think it's London when we send you the invite, but it's actually like Greater London, and you have to go to the middle of fucking nowhere in order to get there, and the last train back is at like 9:30 p.m. and the due starts at 6 p.m. So it's just like suboptimal all around basically. Any more details, Matthew, that you want to interrogate there?
No, this is basically everything.
Yeah, okay, good. Okay, so I've got a bunch of categories here. I basically just thought it would be a fun little code to the episode, which has run slightly longer than I expected it to, in all honesty.
If I had known it would run this long, I probably would have included it, but it won't take long to go through anyway. First award, Matthew, is Best Pub in a Game. What have you got for this?
I've got the Pelican Inn from Uncharted 3.
So do I. And even though it's like not made by British people, or at least not primarily made by British people, and I think the price of the pie and chips is all wrong, it's too cheap. It actually looks, colour palette-wise and detail-wise, better than any other pub I've encountered in a video game.
Is that why you picked it?
Yeah, absolutely. Obviously it's full of Mitchell Brothers, as you always say.
Sure is.
My only problem with it, I don't know if the Pelican Inn is the best name for a faux British pub.
No, that's true.
It doesn't ring quite true. I was thinking, if you were an American, and you were making the quintessential pub, you would surely call it the something in something.
Yeah, the Pelican and Goose or something. I don't know, it'd be something like that.
Pelican, I don't know. It's the only word, it doesn't quite sit right with me that.
Or like the old Indonesian Pelican or something like that. It'd be like-
There'd be a colonial undertone to it.
Definitely. Yeah, the Pelican Inn is a bit, yeah, something a bit slightly off about that, but-
Pelican Inn. Doesn't flow either anyway, but let's not think it for that. It's a good pub.
Good pub, and yeah, the endless procedurally generated Mitchell Brothers just really give it that British edge, I think, so that's good. Runner Up, I had The Sand Goose and Fable 2, which was, it's a pretty decent in-game pub, but mostly because they made a game called Pub Games, there was a spin-off of this on XBLA. Such was their adoration for the pub and existing within the pub, so that gets a shout out.
Favourite British location in the game, Matthew, what have you got?
I've got Thornbridge Manor from Hitman 3.
Oh, that's a great one. I hadn't even thought of that.
Yeah, there were lots of games for the Main and Hall of Fame where I kept thinking there's one great bit set in the UK, but I don't think it's enough to be a British game, and the attention to do, you know, Hitman is like a love letter to whatever location the level happens in, and they're so beautifully made, but it is only one sixth of this game, so you can't really get away with it.
No, I think that's a good suggestion, though. I like that. I picked the Getaways version of Piccadilly Circus, which is just like, I think that's because that's the first thing I went and found when I finally had access to the game.
I was like, I've got to go see how they do this bit of it. You look at it and you're like, right, well, that is very unimpressive, but nonetheless, I was like, oh, okay, well, this is the first time. I always wanted to see a video game do this, and that kind of like, yeah, that may be kind of evoked a certain something, but I don't know.
It's sort of, Favourite is a weird one to do in this because I don't, all the places I like in the UK, I feel like most of them just wouldn't be represented too correctly, but I did the same thing in Watch Dogs Legion. I just thought, let's see how they do Piccadilly. It's like how you go to Times Square in a game in New York and you're like, let's see how Spider-Man 2 upgrades Times Square off the back of Spider-Man 1, and let's see how Spider-Man 1 improves on original Spider-Man 2 back on the PS2.
So it's always a good litmus test for how much money they've spent basically.
Definitely.
OK. Most realistic depiction of Britain in the game, Matthew. I've got Bloodborne.
What about you?
Bloodborne. I actually picked a game which hasn't come up previously. The Last Stop, which we could talk about a while back, which is a sort of a almost like a Telltale style interactive story adventure made by Variable State, who made Virginia a few years before this.
Kind of like three intertwining stories, but just set in a very recognisable London, like commuters on the train. I remember looking and they got the textiles right on the underground tube seats, like the pattern was the right pattern for the line they were on. And you were like, whoever made this has had some very boring evenings in London commuting.
I really, really bought it. Like the quality of the light, walking past sad bus stops, the quality of the pavements even, they were just right.
Yeah, I think that's a really good shout actually. I completely forgot about that game. We definitely played it and talked about it on the podcast.
I remember thinking at the time it was a good game to pick up and play precisely because we were still locked down, I think. Or at least it felt unsafe to go to London. And so it was really nice to feel like you could go to London somehow still.
And it reminds you of what certain parts of the in-between bits of London are like. The neighbourhoods in between the big tube stops and city centre bits, basically. It evoked that really well in my memory.
That's a good shout, Matthew. Okay. So yeah, I went with Bloodborne because I think it just...
It's just so... I think what very online people think Britain is now, Bloodborne just tallies so well with that. Yes, it didn't make our list.
But I think it's just the very cursed energy of it. That's how people at their core feel about Britain as it is. So yeah, I know that's pessimistic, but I don't know.
People showing this tanned finish, go away, go away. In that way, the NPC is doing this game. There's just something about it that's so...
Oh yeah, I mean, even if we're not there, you know, sort of like artistically, visually, in like 10 years, I can see a world in which we like this spiritually. So the decay...
Oh, bloody, that's so bleak.
Maybe it's a bit too pessimistic. Okay, that was my suggestion anyway. Most unrealistic depiction of Britain in the game, Matthew.
I've got with Forza Horizon 4, because it makes Britain look a lot nicer than it actually is, despite being very authentic in some ways. I think like the... It may be romanticized as something that has a lot of gray skies and fields.
I mean, I don't know how you feel about that.
We do... It's not always gray skies and fields.
Just 75% of the time, you know?
Yeah, well, that's the thing. It's a game that lives in the 25% of the time. Yeah, that's true.
Also, if you come to the UK expecting to drive that quickly between the Cotswolds and Edinburgh, you can forget it.
Yeah. It's interesting. I just read an interview with George Clooney today where he mentioned that he had a house in Britain, but he chose not to live in it because the weather was so bad, and has gone to live in South France instead.
Obviously, you have to be in a position of immense privilege to be able to do something like that. But it's also just the idea of owning a house here, but still choosing not to live in it because the weather is that bad. That's crazy.
What did you pick for this one, Matthew?
I was struggling for it. I know that Pokemon Sword Shield is based on Britain. Oh, that's true.
I said that because it doesn't resemble. I can't really see the Britain in it. I was looking through the Pokedex to see if there were like Britain sort of inflected Pokemon, I guess.
And there was one which is based on an apple. And I was like, well, we do have apples. I can maybe they thought that.
The one thing that really made me laugh was they redesigned Weezing for this. And he's got like a chimney now, like an industrial Victorian chimney. But it also looks like a stovepipe hat.
And his toxic fumes form like a handlebar moustache.
That's really good. So that's someones in the Pokemon company's version of what Bean British looks like in Weezing form. I love that.
I feel like that's someone who all they know about the UK is what they saw from the Olympics opening ceremony. And they went, oh, Kenneth Branagh, that's what British people saw. So I'll turn Weezing into that.
Weezing does sum up the Industrial Revolution quite nicely, though, doesn't it? It's sort of like emitting a lot of smoke.
Yeah, it's quite a sly comment. Yeah, I like that. It's pretty good.
Yeah, that's good. A great suggestion.
So maybe that is a realistic depiction, but I put unrealistic because it's just like the grass, fucking fluorescent green, and you're like, well, it isn't.
Weezing's not real, is he? That's the other thing.
Also, all the creatures.
All right, this is your category, Matthew. Best game not set in Britain that has undeniable British energy. I like this.
Would you go for this?
Yeah, well, I mean, Fable would have been a good pick. I went in for something completely fictional. I wanted to throw in a reference nod to the Discworld games.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Because they obviously not set in Britain. They have set completely in a fantasy world of its own. But the British humor and specifically playing these games when I was a teenager and they were voiced by then, people I didn't necessarily know who they were.
It was Rob Brydon before he was famous as one of the background voice actors in this.
All right.
So like Rob Brydon, Tony Robinson already famous because of Black Adder, Nigel Planer of The Young Ones fame, Eric Idle obviously also famous. I'm really just talking about Rob Brydon wasn't famous. I didn't set that one up particularly well.
But a British humor voiced by very British voices, that to me felt like a kind of Britain in spirit game.
That's a good suggestion. I've gone with Silent Hill 2, the remake when you turn the fog off.
You have such a bleak idea of what Britain is.
Tell me I'm wrong though. When you go to most towns, it's a Gregg's, a Betfred, a Tesco Express, and then a vast area where people live in affordable property. That's like most towns in the UK.
I just don't leave Bath. That's my problem.
Well, me neither. But Bath is so not a representative version of what the UK is.
It's brilliant.
It's good if you could afford property here. I will give it that. But yeah, I think there was a TikTok video that went viral off the back of this.
So like, oh yeah, someone turned off the fog on Silent Hill 2 on PC, and it just looks like any British high street, and they were right. It really did. So I urge you to go watch that video, because the color palette of the sky, you're like, oh yeah.
It's like this sort of like hell, or all these like weird creatures are. This is actually the UK. I'm living in it right now.
So I think it definitely has that energy. I don't like hate living in Britain or anything. It's got some amazing cities, but it's also got some vast nowhere areas that no one ever invests in or looks after.
You know what I mean? We definitely got some issues with lack of development and where property is built and how property is sold in this country.
Yeah, I don't mean to just live in Bath. That's the way to do it.
I don't mean to get political. It's just a funny meme about Silent Hill, isn't it? Anyway, next up then.
Best game adaptation of a British TV or film institution. This feels like a dead set to me, Matthew. What have you got?
Well, so I wrote this category thinking I'd be able to find some really cursed, hilarious game based on some TV shit. And actually, I really struggled with it. I was hoping I was going to do like a deal or no deal or something.
But yeah, I mean, that Who Wants To Be A Millionaire game probably sold millions of copies.
But yeah, all the weakest link game. Yeah.
Did that have a warped digital Anne Robinson? Or did they not want to be doing that? Oh yeah, PS2 Anne Robinson.
That rules, you know.
Yeah.
I mean, GoldenEye is the best one, isn't it?
Yeah. I ended up writing GoldenEye for this after I created. I should tell our listeners, sounded all the categories.
I added this one and the last one, and this one I couldn't think of a good answer to. That's a good indicator of what I contribute to this podcast.
Yeah. Fair enough. There was a hidden object game based on Coronation Street called The Mystery of the Missing Hot Pot Recipe.
It was released, I think, in either the late 90s or early noughties. It's available on archive.org if you'd like to give it a go. I urge you not to.
That's my advice.
I had a game on the Amiga which was an official comic relief tie-in called Sleepwalker. I think there was like a dog that was voiced by Lenny Henry. It's like the boy who owned the dog Sleepwalks Every Night and the dog is basically like a one creature lemmings.
He used to go and perform all these actions to protect the boy from falling down holes. But it was comic relief branded. I don't know if they created it and sold it to raise money or something.
That's very Britain coded. Well, comic relief is also in America, I guess. So, that's instantly negated.
But I just said something that's good.
Do you know that? It's not on his filmography on Wikipedia, that one Matthew.
Maybe he didn't voice it. Would you have had voices on him? Was that too early for that?
Anyway.
Yeah. I feel like Lenny Henry is immediately who you think of when you think of comic relief. Right.
So yeah, kind of makes sense. OK. Well, in any case, we move on to best British character.
Who have you got for this Matthew?
Diana Burnwood from Hitman.
Oh, Lara Croft. Surely Lara Croft like a whole industry. That's that makes the most sense to me.
But, you know, I was thinking for I don't for some reason I locked in on the voice.
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, original Lara Croft sounds like Victoria Beckham or something.
Oh, yeah. That is the obvious one to go for. I don't know why I said that.
Diana Burnwood is really, really good.
She's posse and English and, you know, a lot of people have had that voice in their ear playing that game.
So, yeah, definitely. OK, so worst British character have you got, Matthew?
Well, I was going to give it to an ensemble, which was again, I think I went more down the voice acting routes. It was all the NPCs in the London level of Tony Hawk Pro Skater form. They are fucking abysmal.
You should watch a video of this. She basically skate up to them. I never will be able to discover this when the when the re-release comes out in a few months.
But, you know, they give you objectives and it would be like one very half arse line. I hope they don't re-voice them, which I imagine they probably will, because they were so, so shit. And it would be, and all the characters were just called like cockney or bloke.
And it would say bloke and it'd be like, listen, I want you to go and jump over that ramp. That would be it. Or like, what I need you to do is go and click the letter skate from those poles over there.
And that is just, I did it too well there. That is too convincing. It's a huge, like, you know, never soft saying, get me a guy in the UK marketing team to do a Cockney voice.
It sounds so embarrassed and unprofessional. It's terrible, terrible voice acting.
A good shout. I mean, aren't they changing that quest structure for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 anyways? Isn't it more of a direct, you just unlock, you just do all the different challenges like you do in one, two and three?
I'm a bit ashamed because there were little stories and narratives in it. Because you'd meet the other skaters and they'd be like, we need to free an elephant in London. And you'd be like, OK.
As you do, as you do on a skateboard in London.
Just like some skaters turn up and decide to free an elephant, which is like, who frees an elephant by the London Eye? That's chaos.
Yeah, that'd be like a terrorist attack in the UK, I think. Yeah, that's I wonder if they've just done that to make it a bit quicker and easier to port. Then maybe that was to do the environment, but not.
I agree, it would have been nice to have those bits around the edges to it.
In terms of one character I personally I really dislike, who has a British accent, is there's the little boy in Disco Elysium, Kuno, who's like, Scouse accent. And like, it's a really abrasive character. It's deliberately written so.
It isn't a failure of a character. They've just effectively written like, just an, like, the ultimate little shit. And you're dealing with your hangover, you're dealing with all the stuff the detective's dealing with in that game, and then you have to deal with him quite, you know, early on in the game.
And it's just, I, I, I just can't, as soon as I can be done with him, the better. I hate, I hate Kuno, as if he was a living person. He feels that well realized.
He feels like someone I've met and absolutely hate. So, him. That's fun.
That's a fun suggestion. Much like Matthew, I wanted to count every single character in the getaway, because those cut scenes are really like, I watched about half of them yesterday. And it's so, it falls so short of what though, I mean, I don't think they are all great.
Those gangster films of the late nineties, early noughties, I think some of them are terrible. What's that very first Guy Ritchie one? Is it...
I thought it was terrible. I watched half an hour of that and I thought it was like a student film, just dog shit. I hated it and I hated all the characters in it.
I just, it's like fundamentally not my sort of genre. Like I said, I think Layer Cake is the best version of that sort of thing because the Dumbledore gangster is a really great character, the...
He's Gambon.
Michael Gambon. He's a great...
Dumbledore gangster. That sounds like something Guy Ritchie would write. Who's this Dumbledore bastard?
But I mean, that's a... There's like a lot of exchanges between him and Daniel Craig in that film that are like, oh, this is such a great, well-written, brilliant film with amazing actors and great characterization. But the low end of that stuff is just, is terrible to me.
But I thought I'd go with Timothy Spool's Barry Micklethwaite in GTA Vice City Stories, who is Phil Collins' manager, I believe, in the game. Phil Collins surprisingly committed Vice City Stories performance. You get the sense he's not a voice actor by trade, but he properly goes for it.
Timothy Spool is dialing up to like 200 percent, and he's doing a brummy accent. And it's a proper sort of like awful, awful caricature. I mean, I bet the Rockstar Leeds folks watching him record that in the studio were like, this is fucking unbearable, but it's Timothy Spool.
I can't tell him to stop doing this. Right. Any comment on this one, Matthew?
Oh, I haven't played the story spinner, so I don't know the character.
I'm sure you're dying to after doing that Vice City episode, though, right?
I can absolutely picture it. I remember a funny thing with Timothy Spool. We went to see his film about Mr. Turner, the artist, and he's got this thing where he keeps spitting in his paints.
He spits on his paintings and then scrubs it into the paint to create new textures and shades or whatever. And Catherine came out and she was absolutely appalled. She really took against him.
She was just like, how can all those beautiful pictures come from this disgusting pig? She was really antsy about it for ages. Very odd reaction.
He's been in some odd kind of like, he's reached that period of his career where he's in loads of British films for old people that sound fake. You know, like the high end version of this is Living with Bill Nighy, right? But the low end version of this is the second best exotic Marigold Hotel.
You're like, who's watching this film? Or there's one that Timothy Sparles in that I got served an ad for for some reason called The Last Bus, where I think he just rides a bus around and talks to the people on the bus. But it's like a sad old man film.
And I agree, there's something about... Anthony Hopkins is in about three of these films a year, where they're on at the Little Theatre in Bath, and I swear no one goes to see them. No one ever talks about them, but somehow they are perpetually being made.
Jim Broadbent, he's in a lot of them as well. He's often having his telly taken off of him or something like that.
The other flavour is like the slightly tall tale version of it, and they're always called like, the 200 year old man who fell out of a window and went to Italy.
Yeah, exactly. I don't really believe these films can be real, yet they are. I definitely watched one of these where Jim Broadbent was either having telly taken off of him or just something, and he had to go to court and make a big deal about it.
But I swear to God he made-
Wasn't it when he stole the painting?
No, I think it's about TV or something, this one. But I think he makes a film like this every year. So there's about eight of them now.
And yeah, they're just so amorphous as a sort of subgenre of British cinema, but they are like the last thing standing.
Wouldn't they all go love bows?
No, I def-
That's a bomb to the older viewer.
Yeah, I mean, but by the time we- No, I'm going to British pessimism again, we don't need to do that. I'll simply move on to best evil British character, and we're not short of them, fortunately, Matthew.
Who did you get for this one?
I picked the villain from Baldur's Gate 2, John Irenicus, voiced by David Warner, who was the evil bad guy in Time Bandits, and he's basically recreating that, just a classic bit of British acting, scenery chewing. But years before, this kind of celeb casting was more commonplace. But you go back to it, still pretty great.
You can watch a compilation of all the bad guys, cutscenes from Baldur's Gate 2, and it's quite fun hearing David Warner putting quite a sincere turn. He doesn't phone it in at all.
Did Baldur's Gate 1 have voice acting? Yeah. Okay, interesting.
There's always been a part of the Bioware mix then having VO in there. I wasn't sure because obviously Baldur's Gate is 98, so quite early for voice acting.
Yeah, because I kept playing it with all the soundbites on and they were driving Catherine up the wall when we were sitting in bed. That's how I remember that as voices.
That's the sub-genre of anecdote with playing Bellattro on the big telly, you know what I mean? That's just sort of like borderline domestic abuse situations that have come up on this podcast between you and Catherine. I've got Albert Wesker from Resident Evil 5, Hall of Famer because they made him British to make him more evil.
I've talked about that on the podcast before, but great stuff. It's not even a British guy playing him. I think he's either American or Canadian, but just goes full on British ham.
Very enjoyable. And I also wanted to shout out Arden in Final Fantasy XV, who I think is the only British character you meet in that game, or one of the only British characters. And he's just a classic smarmy, evil British guy.
But because this game's story is so disjointed, you don't really understand what his deal is, unless you play a DLC that explains what his deal is, which is a classic Final Fantasy XV problem. But the voice performance is good, Matthew.
On a similar note, is Liquid Snake British in Metal Gear Solid 1?
I noted this as like an unanswerable question. Is it Australian?
Yeah, I have no idea where that voice is coming from. I don't know if it's meant to be British, because there's elements of it, have a bit of that to it.
Well, Cam Clarke is American, that's the thing. But yeah, that's definitely... It's talking like this.
Yeah, it's a true... Didn't we have this conversation on the MGS Excel pod? We were like, we just don't know.
Is that a good voice performance? No one knows, I don't think, Liquid Snake. It's like, there's something very confident about a lot of the other voice performances of that game, but Liquid Snake is so heightened, you're like, is this good?
I think it's good. But it's just, yeah, it's a bit out there. Okay, next up then Matthew.
Celebrity performance of notes. Obviously lots of British celebrities have been in games over the years. I wanted to shout out Stephen Merchant as Wheatley in Portal 2.
Oh yeah. Because, not an accent you hear much, they're going to somerset, you know, accent. That's the best I can describe it, but when you hear it, you know it.
But he was very committed to that role. I think he really brought a lot of dimension to that. A lot of the story rests on his shoulders, a little bit on old JK Simmons shoulders as well, but I certainly think Wheatley is the one that you remember from that game.
And I guess shout out to our guy Danny Dyer as Ken Paul of GTAV.
That was my pick, Danny Dyer, yeah.
It's really good. It's genuinely good, that performance. It's like he's having loads of fun with it, and it's not among the more phoned in performances in that game.
Most of them are pretty good anyway, the slow performances and vice versa. Okay Matthew, this British bloke was in how many games award for a surprisingly prolific actor?
I don't have one for this. This is the only one I don't have one for.
Yeah, so I was ironing up Sean Bean, who is obviously in Oblivion and Civ 6, I think he's in, one of the Civs. But I think he had 11 credits, but Patrick Stewart has 28 video game credits, Matthew. Yeah, including your beloved Castlevania Lords of Shadow games.
Of course.
Something like 12 Star Trek games, he's in loads of those, and he's in a load of the X-Men games as well. So he fucking gets around. I bet he has no idea that he's in any of those games, but his agent was like, hey, good news, Patrick, I've made you three grand.
You just got to go to this booth and yell for like two hours, so then the money is yours. And I reckon that's how he ended up doing most of these. But yeah, 28 video games.
It's, yeah, surprisingly prolific. The Don't Yell At Us Scottish Twitter Award for Notable Scottish Performance, Matthew. A lot of British, English actors, however you want to categorise it, have come up so far.
I don't know if the Scottish people like being referred to as British. I suspect not, these days especially. Or maybe it's a divisive issue, I don't know.
But what did you get for this?
So a bit of recency bias. I went for Highland's song The Inkle Game, where you play as a Scottish girl climbing hills and going on an adventure, voiced by MJ Deans, who I think it's their only voice performance in a game.
It looked like a nice game, that one.
Yeah, and nice vibes, but very down-to-earth, just very, you know, it's just like the Inkle thing, their whole thing in general, you know, it's quite subtle, quite authentic, quite grown up. You know, there are definitely bigger, livelier performances, lots in Still Wakes the Deep, for example, but yeah, I wanted to shout out something a bit more unusual.
Oh damn, I wish we'd put this in the list now, because this is an actual Scottish setting and not just an oil rig that's near Scotland. You know what I mean?
Yeah, I'm so okay with it being Still Wakes the Deep.
It still gets an award.
Yeah, it still gets an award.
The devs still get to attend and have a very subpar dinner on the edge of London, so that's good for them, in a tent.
It's just like not making the main list. It's a bit like when you're one of the awards that Geoff Keighley like speed reads out at the game awards that doesn't get to go up on stage, or they just get someone else who's like, hey, these next five awards are sponsored by Doritos. And you're like, oh, cool.
This is my big moment.
Yeah, we couldn't get Doritos. So we're sponsored by those salt and vinegar sort of like chip stick things. That's like our sponsorship in our awards ceremonies.
That's what we've got. And Rustler's Burgers, obviously. Of course.
There's a Rustler's in everyone's goodie bag, by the way.
Yeah. I don't know what state it will be by the time you get home.
If you look under your chairs, you'll all find a Rustler's Burger.
Perfect. And yeah, at a kind of buck fast. Okay.
So I thought Steel Wings of Deep is a really obvious one here. We talked about the game a lot. Alec Newman plays the main character in this.
Great performance. But I wanted to go for a best and worst Scottish performance combined, which is our guy Kevin McKidd, who plays Soap McTavish in Modern Warfare 2 and 3. But also that bloke from Lovefist, which he's terrible in.
No offense. I just played that game recently. The whole Lovefist situation is unbearable these days.
Not just because you're doing that speed mission where you got to fucking turn a big vehicle around in Vice City, which is not ideal. But it's the fact that I think Soap is a really good protagonist in those Modern Warfare games. Quite subtle performance, dramatic performance from a kid.
I remember that character quite well. But then, yeah, Lovefist is just kind of unbearable. And the same guy did that.
And I think for that reason, he gets the award, Matthew. Did Lovefist cross your mind when you were doing this?
Yeah, I did think about Lovefist. But, you know, if you're in GTA, you've got enough exposure that I wanted to highlight someone else.
Yeah. And stick around for the end of the Cursed British Game Awards ceremony because Lovefist will be performing live. So, you can look forward to that.
With apologies to the Welsh Award for notable Welsh performance. I almost called this the Millennium Stadium Award for the most notable Welsh performance. And I couldn't work out what was less offensive, Matthew.
I think this has to go to our guy, Drippy and Nino Cooney, Stefan Rodri, absolutely hitting it out of the park. What have you got for this one?
Well, I went for Nia from Xenoblade Chronicle 2. Obviously, Xenoblade series has loads of regional accents. But in Xenoblade 2, there's this sort of cat race of people.
They're Gormotties, I think that's it, who are voiced by Welsh actors. This is voiced by Catrin Mayhew. And it's a really big, fun Welsh accent.
Great character as well. Very lively.
Yeah. I was hoping you'd bring up one of these games, because the last story came up a lot when I was looking this up. That general kind of operation, rainfall kind of area of Nintendo games.
Just to know that, yeah, yeah.
I also contemplated Edward Kenway from Black Flags.
That's a great show. I actually had Hatham Kenway on my short list of worst evil British characters. Because so good a character, that he's better than the main character of that game, which was tough for old Connor Kenway in that game.
Indeed. Last award then, the Terry Gilliam Award for Funny British Inflected Game That Doesn't Totally Land. I basically just want to shout out We Happy Few here, Matthew.
Oh, that's what I wrote down.
Yeah, exactly. Because this is a very specific strain of British culture that this game takes on and tries to turn into a setting, but bogs it down with very boring survival mechanics. And I think really squanders what is, I guess like a tiny bit Atomfall-ish in the sense that you're like, oh, that's a great idea for a video game setting.
And the game just doesn't quite match your high expectations. Is that how you felt about that game?
Very much so. Kind of cool, swinging 60s again, very Deathloop. But yeah, I never really understood what this game was or what it was going for.
It was quite a bad hang.
Yeah, the next game looks nothing like this. Like Atom.
No, no. So confusing. I'm more interested in that one.
The other game I was thinking of this was Simon the Sorcerer, which was a point-and-click game again in the mold of Monkey Island, which was, I always thought, kind of like a sort of NAF shit version of like Discworld. But the sense of humour was a bit off. The main character was voiced by Chris Barry, who is like such a 90s sort of comedian.
And I just thought there was something quite cursed about it. I don't know if this is, this feels like one of those games, which if you say you think it's bad, you're gonna like lose one, like one true believer who's also a patron. He's like, well, that's actually my favourite game.
And I've been writing articles about it in Retro Gamer for the last 20 years. And you're like, fair enough. But it's a no from me, dog.
I think Chris Barry alone deems that one a little bit. That's, it automatically goes into a certain bracket of like, of production values. I mean, Ashley Day cancelling his Patreon as soon as he hears me say that, the world's number one Red Dwarf fan, but alas.
Okay, Matthew, we come to the end of the awards and the end of the episode. That was a fun little weird themed episode. Yeah.
Yeah, I enjoyed that. I enjoyed going through that. It was a bit more research than I expected, to be honest.
But I think we came up with a good list of games there and certainly explored that history in a fairly deep way with a few gags along the way.
I've got to explain the Isle of Wight to international listeners.
The podcast is over. Thank you for listening. We're at patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us and get two additional podcasts a month.
Most recently we did a GTA Vice City episode. Me and Matthew both finished that again, talked about that for two hours. So that's available if you want it.
And right to the Bong Joon Ho movies, which is likely less exciting to you, but we enjoyed doing it. That was a good little episode we did, Matthew. Where can people get you on social media, Matthew?
I am MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. If you want my film opinions.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts. I'm also on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
And I still have a Twitter account if you do that sort of thing. Been a while, but it's a bit dicey over there. Back Page Pod on Twitter and Blue Sky.
If you'd like to follow the podcast, keep you updated on the new episodes coming up in April, which I'll post pretty shortly after this. And that's very much the episode. So let's get out of here.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
