Hello and welcome to the Backpage XL, a Patreon-exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast.

I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.

Hello.

Hello Matthew, I've got a sandwich update for you straight away.

So I went to Milk Bun Deli in Bath yesterday and ordered the Chapo, which you'd previously

recommended to me.

And I'd been in there, paid for, and they said, oh we're all out, but after I'd already paid

so I had to order a different sandwich and I was livid when that happened.

But yesterday I finally went there and it was, oh, so, so good.

So it's like chicken, lettuce and some kind of green mayonnaise thing.

Is it like chimichurri or something?

Is that right?

What is it?

Yeah, it's not too spicy, but it's quite flavoursome.

Oh, yeah, it was really, really good.

And it's on this lovely soft white bread.

That's these lovely crusts as well.

Yeah, that was exceptional, actually.

It's a really, I don't want to say refreshing, but just a fresh tasting sandwich.

Yeah, I don't feel like I would eat it and then have to have a nap afterwards,

which is true for so many of the lunches that I eat in Bath, you know.

So, yeah, refreshing is a weird word to describe a sandwich,

but I see where you're coming from, pal.

Yeah, I just don't have the vocabulary to do this sandwich justice.

Because some of their sandwiches are so rich and opulent.

There's one of them that basically uses pate instead of butter,

and I'm like, that's not good.

It's definitely like the gout sandwich kind of vibe to it, isn't there?

They'll be at least partially responsible.

I feel like the milk bun burger place they had that was only there for about a year was was really

really good and it was just in a really shit location and it's now that weird gym bar place

I think we discussed in the podcast before um very strange kind of thing but and I think they

always promised to come back to Bath with the burger place but never reopened and now I think

they're just sandwiches I don't know if you have any more insight on that as a kind of man on the

inside I don't I think their website still says they're looking to open a burger place in central

bath which would obviously be great i just went off the old place when i went to pick up those

burgers i saw loads of rats near the kitchen oh yeah that's tough like i just couldn't get that

out of my head that what i was eating was a rat burger it wasn't but it's just hard to to remove

those things like unlike the adorable film ratatouille when you actually see a real rat in a kitchen

it isn't like endearing was it in the kitchen or was it just near the kitchen though no they

But they were by the door.

They were like nudging against the outside of the kitchen door.

I mean, that's just too close.

Yeah, it's a real problem in Batho, Rats, isn't it?

I didn't ever have this problem in Bournemouth.

I think it might just be, or in Gosport where I lived.

I think it might just be a river related thing, right?

It's tough.

We need a Pied Piper figure to come along and sort those lads out.

Get your dad with his oboe.

I don't think he's quite qualified for that job.

You know, I'm really optimistic about Switch 2 after our podcast that we just recorded.

I thought that was, I came off the back of it.

I was like, oh man, maybe I'm getting your bug of like,

I want to plug the switch in again and fire something up, you know?

Oh, good.

All that, yeah.

I mean, if anyone's going to be excited about that thing,

it is going to be me.

But if people kind of want to wallow in despair and be cross instead,

by all means.

But I've just kind of chosen to opt out of that.

Yeah.

Plus Argos has your back with a £10 off voucher for like buying the actual game.

So I feel like that's maybe cranked up the optimism a tiny bit.

So yeah, that's something.

Even if we're all left wondering,

what is Donkey Kong Bonanza?

No one truly knows.

I was really tossing and turning about that last night.

Like, I didn't do it justice.

I've missold it.

I don't know what I'm talking about.

You always let this eat away at you

because you want to have the take

and to have filed that.

But you've got three months to come up with that take.

And you've got to play the full game first.

I think it's okay.

Yeah, well, that should help.

This was just round one, you know.

Round two, I think you'll get this and it'll be good.

Right, this episode then, the lukewarm console exclusives Hall of Fame.

Like shooting fish in a barrel for us, isn't it?

Talking about this kind of thing.

But I thought this would be fun.

I've gone quite into the idea of the Hall of Fame format, Matthew.

I thought it was fun doing it for the British Games episode.

I thought that was pretty enjoyable.

Of all the formats from the Oringa that we ripped off,

this one comes together quite well.

I also have good memories of the Indiana Jones episode we did a couple of years ago

where we put all the Indiana Jones stuff into these different tiers.

And so I thought we kind of like merged the two formats a little bit.

It's a Hall of Fame, but it uses the ranking from S down to D.

Actually, we'll ask you a question off the back of that.

Indiana Jones, where would you put the Great Circle in the Indiana Jones tier rankings?

Oh, it's up high for me.

A, I guess, probably, because I think it's just Raiders and...

Yeah, I...

What's the Last Crusade that was in?

Last Crusade, yeah, I don't think it sits quite alongside those,

but as a spin-off, it's probably my favourite Indiana Jones spin-off thing,

above even Fate of Atlantis and my precious Infernal Machine.

Yeah, I wonder if there'll be a wave of people talking about that game again

as it comes to PS5, I think, in a week or so.

That'd be cool, because it just felt like it all happened in kind of a pocket

at the end of last year, and then it was kind of, you know what I mean,

Like it was a bit of an odd time.

So yeah, it might be nice to see a second round

of people discussing that game.

Okay then, Matthew.

So what we've each done is we've come up with our own candidates

for what should go into the lukewarm console exclusive Hall of Fame.

And what we mean by that is the game,

the notable games that didn't move the needle,

but maybe there was a moment where the console manufacturers

were acting like it would move the needle,

or it seemed like it would be hot.

Those kinds of games.

I think when we talk about the games in question,

the format will make more sense, Matthew.

Well, I'm hoping so, because I'm looking down my list.

I'm like, are all of these games, do they all qualify for this?

I think I've really nailed this.

I think when people hear the kind of material I've got on offer here,

I think they'll be like, ah, I see what they're going for.

Like, I maybe wasn't won over by the pitch of the episode initially,

but when I listened to the beat of it, I really got into it.

So here's how we've broken this down, right?

Instead of me and Matthew all drawing from the same formats,

the same consoles to build this,

I've assigned Matthew all Nintendo platforms,

including handhelds,

Xbox One,

because he worked on Xbox Channel

during the most depressing Xbox years ever.

Tough times for our boy.

And PS4,

because I feel like you were slightly more on top of the PS4 than I was,

and you've maybe been on PS Access,

you did a bit of this as well.

So yeah,

I thought that made sense.

that means that I've got all other PlayStation platforms including handhelds the 360 original

Xbox and Dreamcast and I figured we could both split the the current platforms like basically

we've each got about 20 games to discuss and we'll kind of like put these into various rankings here

so those rankings are starting at the top S rank which is a possible system seller despite being

utterly lukewarm so that's as good as it gets in in the games we're talking about right and there's

A rank, which is possibly a 7

out of 10, but not one of those 7s.

There's B rank, which is

simply middling. May have had hype

behind it once, but who cared ultimately?

C rank, which is pretty

duff. Maybe well-meaning, but

unsuccessful. D rank.

Definitely duff. Implausible

it was ever meant to be a system seller.

E rank. War crime, which

I might actually like rename debacle

to be less offensive.

A net loss

for the platform.

so i mean i wrote that at like 11 30 last night so it's you know this it was perhaps not in the

best taste it's been changed debacle let's change it to debacle debacle's all right isn't it i uh

yeah i think that's fine um okay any more thoughts matthew on this exercise before we jump into it

no the one thing i would flag with nintendo it's a it's a slightly trickier exercise with nintendo

because they tend to pin their hopes on pretty known quantities and games which are likely to be

good it's very rare that they they kind of bet everything on a on a game which is ultimately

duff so i think there are more slam dunks to be found on xbox and playstation you say that i think

there's loads on nintendo i think oh interesting yeah i think i mean the pilot wing series

nintendogs the whole series well uh not not all of them that 3ds one was quite lukewarm wasn't it

yeah i mean i had that on my kind of long list it didn't make my short list in the end but um

it's interesting that that would qualify for it well that's to me that that would that would do but

i mean we've also got at the end of this we can suggest any additional games that might go in there

and um that weren't on our format so we'll see if that comes out in the wash basically but

yeah i found this fairly fairly easy actually i found it much harder to go back to ps1 ps2 because

exclusives become a bit more of a battleground in the 360 era that's when it really kicks off so

it's a bit weirder on ps1 ps2 because loads of games just came out on ps2 and no other formats

because it was the de facto you know big console at the time there's not really any kind of exclusive

angle to it so i've only got a couple from that era and then um yeah onwards it gets a lot um a lot

spicier so yes looking forward to filing some lukewarm to quite bad games into these categories

Matthew so do you want to go with your first one well I was gonna say could you start your first one

and set the tone okay sure so my first one is medieval on ps1 um I think like there's a lot of

ps1 games that were a bit middling but because people played the demo once or they had it and

just like four or five other games they played it over and over again they convinced themselves that

they were good but i think medieval was had quite like a visually distinctive main character that was

an art style that was pretty good for the ps1 for the time but as a third person experience it was

very very jank as fuck and i always thought the nostalgia for it was a little bit unfounded

um i don't think it's a horrible game as such but i think that this is exactly the kind of list it

belongs in and um i can't remember if it was the sony's cambridge studio that made this or not but

there's a bunch of games from sony cambridge that could really just pack out this this exercise

like Ghost Hunter and Primal.

Just lots of real kind of like middle of the road stuff

that I don't think anyone really loved.

Like six out of 10 stuff.

There was not a net gain for the culture.

Their Killzone game on Vita was all right,

but it was very short, but it was all right.

So yeah, Matthew, I think this is kind of like

the kind of thing I see as being a good fit

for this exercise.

Do you see what I mean?

Yeah, I saw this when I was looking at the PS4 games

because they obviously re-released this on PS4

and it did register with me like man i can't believe that got a second bite of the apple you

know yeah i feel like that was um maybe just that sony was just on a high at the time and maybe things

were just getting um green lit without maybe being overthought too much but yeah it was it was

cambridge just as bad so i was right about that sorry to write off that entire studio it's probably

one or two of them who weren't there listening to this so i do i do apologize but yeah i think this

was just um quite mediocre i imagine you played this on ps4 and thought why was this ever a big

deal right uh no i didn't i didn't play it on ps4 um i have played this on ps1 a long time ago at a

friend's house i never never really you know got what it was going for i quite like the look of the

skeleton guy yeah it's his name fortescue is that his name yeah daniel fortescue yeah quite characterful

but you know this just had the bad luck of coming out of time where i remember when i used to have

nintendo blinkers on because i don't anymore um and so i would have described this as

a sort of 3d family fair on and on nintendo platform so probably not for me cut to matthew

saying you should pay for nintendo switch 2 welcome to you motherfucker oh god i'm just i'm waiting i'm

waiting for the angry response to that i was tired i don't not all the takes hold up oh it's all right

I think, yeah, this game does benefit from ripping off like a Tim Burton-y Nightmare Before Christmas style art.

And there's nothing wrong with doing that.

And like I say, a good match to the PS1.

Not a bad game, but I think it does belong in one of these brackets, Matthew.

But which one?

I think this goes under A rank.

Possibly a seven, but not one of those sevens.

I think that's probably fair.

What do you think?

Yeah, I think so.

I don't think it would have come back or had the sort of fan fondness if it was an actual duffer.

Okay, good. Well, we're learning in real time whether this podcast is actually going to work or not, so that's good.

Not unusual for the back page, for anyone who's listened at this point and is used to our commentary on the show as it's going.

So what's your first one, Matthew?

So I was also struggling when you go quite far back,

because there's loads of what are NES exclusives

that I wouldn't want to play,

kind of quite rubbish sports games,

the kind of stuff you rediscover on Virtual Console,

but there's just too many of them to sort of single them out.

The first one that really jumped out

and caught my eye on the Nintendo front

was Cruisin' USA on the N64.

All right.

A notoriously shitport of an arcade game

that I completely forgot was Nintendo published.

And that's really the mystery of this one, is why of all the games in the world, of all the things you'd fight to get on your platform, you know, at a time when you are cooking up Mario 64 and GoldenEye and Ocarina of Time and your first party slate, you decide to anoint this one arcade game and make a port, very, very shitty port.

This was meant to be an N64 launch title, was famously delayed because Nintendo were apparently unhappy with the quality of it.

Goes on to get one of those sort of 40% drubbings in N64 magazine.

But does sell a million copies and becomes one of the sort of player select or the classic collection or whatever the brand label was when games sold enough copies and then they got re-released a bit later.

so yeah cruising usa is just a bit of a weird blot on on nintendo's list i'm not gonna say they

thought it was gonna sell n64s but you know at a time when they weren't making loads of games

kind of odd that this is one of them yeah that is weird i do you know what i i thought that n64 was

actually going to be ripe for this exercise because i thought you would simply aim sights at rare games

so that's all right that's what well the the thing i i even i not like number one rare fan

um that's my twitter handle not number one rare fan um you can't claim that like banjo kazoo is a

lukewarm exclusive like it is one of the better games on the platform i wouldn't say banjo is i

would say jet force gemini definitely also maybe maybe there's an argument for um don't say blast

core wow that's what i mean would blast core come on wouldn't blast core be wouldn't blast

core be the perfect s rank for this for this exercise isn't that surely where that belongs

there's a possible system seller despite being utterly lukewarm i mean maybe it hit different in

the 90s it's interesting because i asked you last night about like scores and we were going on vibes

yeah um and i don't know if it was growing up in the n64 magazine era uh you know as as tim said

when we were interviewing him earlier in the year,

there were so few games that they went kind of big on them.

They sort of force-fed those games to you.

So I remember them all fondly as being key,

like important parts of the landscape

rather than slightly kind of forgotten.

My criteria for a lot of these games is when I saw the name,

I was like, oh yeah, that was going to be a big deal,

which isn't really how I felt about many of the N64 games.

but that might just be my personal circumstances.

That's okay.

I think retroactively it's okay to say

these things are not the best.

I would say we can leave Blast Core

because people do seem to really love that one.

And I'm well aware that my pessimism

is sort of a bit of an outlier

if you're a Nintendo fan.

I just thought that playing all their 64 games

pretty close together,

which I think we played most of them

for one reason or another

making this podcast the last few years.

I thought that Geoforce Gemini

was definitely the worst one,

but Blast Call would be second to bottom for me.

So like Conker, for example,

I think is way too good for this list.

That's a good, it's an interesting, odd curse game,

but it's the single kind of like interaction element

of Conker means it holds up quite well, I think.

Definitely a product of his time,

but you know, it's very charming despite being cursed.

So yeah.

All right, so Cruisin' USA is going in here, Matthew.

It sounds like it's a C or a D to me, but...

It's a D rank.

It's a D, okay.

In it goes.

Excellent.

Okay, next up then.

Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.

So I think this would probably have to go under S rank

because it was a system seller,

despite being utterly lukewarm.

But you and I played this last year

and it was horrible.

The actual Sonic 3D bits were fine.

You kind of know what the deal is with those at this point.

Really fast, inaccurate, platforming.

Occasionally you fall into an abyss for no real reason.

and question if you're truly having a good time.

But, you know, them's the breaks

when you have to translate 2D Sonic into 3D.

It's a very, very fast-moving character.

On Mega Drive, they've very much had the pace just right,

but on Dreamcast, maybe not so much with that 3D space.

But this is a very beloved game,

so I think that we can compromise by giving it the S rank here.

It can be our first S rank, Matthew.

Do you think this is a fair place for Sonic Adventure?

Yeah, I mean, that feels about right.

I'm glad you said it, not me.

I feel like, because you're like four years younger than me, I think, you are of the generation where this, even though it sounds mad, but in games that makes a difference.

I'd say you're of a generation where this begins to become like the Bible for certain like 12 year olds.

Yeah.

Which I avoided.

So as long as it is someone from your generation putting the hurt on Sonic Adventure, I think we're okay.

I'm not sure Jay Bayless will talk to us again.

He understands.

he gets it i think it's one of those things where if yeah i think you're right if i'd have

had this when i was 11 i think i would have been very very close i think to being too old to accept

this is good because by the time this came out i think i had already played metal gear solid for

example so right oh yeah my taste of tough break well that's it my taste in games are really forming

i was really i was playing a lot of like a lot of pc games i'd played a bunch of half-life played

a bunch of Tomb Raider and stuff I think that maybe I would have known the cut scenes were bad

um for example which I and and the exploration was maybe not the best probably a bit more nostalgia

for it but yeah but in the cold light of day Sonic Adventure is a little bit irredeemable to me

apart from the platforming bits which are which are fine um so yes that goes in there Matthew that's

my only Dreamcast entry though because I wasn't greatly offended by the Dreamcast library from our

exercise i you know i would i wouldn't put in something like shenmy for a laugh i think shenmy

is is legitimately good and has things to recommend about it um so yeah sonic adventure takes the

bullet for the dreamcast in this episode what's your next one on n64 hey you pikachu oh right

that's a good one yeah well it was what was interesting you know back then was pokemon was

becoming the biggest thing on the planet quite rapidly on game boy and in the cartoon and all

that stuff and there was always a struggle to make pokemon make sense on the home console rather than

a handheld and you get i mean i would say up until the time they're putting complete pokemon rpgs on

a home console so the switch the home console pokemon offering is like abysmal in my eyes um

and i didn't want to fill this list with like endless pokemon coliseums and all that kind of junk

but hey you Pikachu just feels like a classic sort of failed attempt to seize on your main

iconic mascot has a weird gimmick in that you can say things through a microphone at it

it's like an even more busted version of Seaman

you know or a kind of Tomogachi with ideas above its station just bellowing one word orders

at virtual pikachu um going back and rereading what few reviews are still online for this is

quite funny just seeing people are just so underwhelmed and at shouting words at pikachu

and having this this thing you know react very very slowly in real time to them um

yeah i mean this spiritually represents pokemon on home consoles which is just an incredibly

lukewarm tier of games from nintendo yeah i i mean i think it's much fairer to put this in here than

pokemon snap for example which is i i know people yeah that's that that is that's that is the exception

to the rule yeah exactly but i agree it was um something quite interesting about the end of the

n64 generation some of the games that were coming along were quite quite strange that sort of second

third tier of n64 game and yeah the fact they never released this in europe despite pokemon being so

huge a there was like localization issues with it i'm sure but they i imagine they probably knew it

was shit as well because you'd at least get into the uk market right and just sell it to a bunch of

but apparently it was just very yeah the voice recognition was very bad the story that someone

always told me about this game that stuck with me was um daniella lucas who's a freelancer um said

that she like befriended a boy who owned this game just to play this game which made me maybe laugh the

idea of that um yeah definitely something i coveted but was firmly in that age of like tamagotchis

being huge and you know i bet if they did this now they could have a really good shot at it you know

and if they did a really good version of a digital pikachu that responded very that was very reactive

i think it would probably sell like 20 million copies people would be really into that nintendo

pikachu edition yeah absolutely huge so it's just a pikachu running around a living room and you feed

biscuits every half an hour or whatever.

Yeah, that would be massive. Would it be good?

Absolutely not. But, you know, it would

certainly be successful.

Yeah, it's a good one, Matthew. Definitely lukewarm.

Feels like it belongs somewhere near the bottom to me.

Is this a

debacle? Not a war crime, a debacle.

I don't know if it's that

bad. Okay, so D-rank then.

Definitely Duff. Doomed little yellow

mouse fellow. I'm quite ill

by the way, for people who are listening. I'm

on my third cold of the year. And, do you know

what I blame Matthew media I blame media going back to media yeah um my immune system is already

uh shot to shit so that's good my shoulder hurts because I think I hurt it playing drag and drive

yesterday at the switch to event amazing um okay I was really going for it with those wheelchair

pools well I mean it's a physically taxing game so who among us would not would not feel the same

um there'll probably be a spate of injuries like this when the game actually comes out

assuming anyone plays it which is a big um a big if based on your hands-on experience okay

on to my first ps2 game um i'm gonna bouncer here i think this is exactly the kind of game

that is perfect for this list it's a sort of a all-time kind of stinker sort of like brawler

um with like massive like tetsuya namura blank check energy to it just all the characters in it

look namura as fuck but despite it seeming like it's going to be quite a mature game it really is

Like one of the coming characters looks like Sora.

The cutscenes are a bit bogus.

It's sort of like, it's basically like if Yakuza was done really badly.

I think that's kind of what the bouncer is.

And it's got some really good music though,

but all Square Enix games do have good music.

That's the thing.

So I think this is perfect for this, though, Matthew.

Proper sort of like early false start for the PS2.

Just, yeah.

And by the end of the generation,

I think it's become a bit of a punchline.

What do you think?

Yeah, one of those ones I've not played,

But I remember seeing pictures of in Games Master and thinking, well, that looks pretty good.

And then it getting, you know, a completely middling review.

And, you know, it takes you a while to kind of compute that something can look amazing but be absolutely terrible.

Yeah.

You know, especially as the generations go on.

You know, and there's a few of those contenders for this list in the looks good, plays like total ass category.

Yeah.

As a result, I think this goes in pretty duff,

maybe well-meaning but unsuccessful.

Yeah.

Because I don't think it's implausible

it was ever meant to be a system seller

for the simple reason of, like you say,

it looked so good.

And it was from the Final Fantasy people

and that was part of the way they were selling it.

So, yeah.

But very much, you know,

they've not remastered this and for good reason.

Don't think we'll be seeing the bouncer

come back anytime soon.

Okay, what's the next one, Matthew?

We go to GameCube for Battalion Wars.

Oh, right.

okay deep cut yeah well again like you know nintendo published i think it was made by i

want to say kuju yeah it's made in the uk right yeah british studio uh a sort of spin-off of advanced

wars kind of answering the question of what would advanced wars be on a home console and they decided

the answer is a real-time strategy game where you play as an individual unit so you know a kind of a

a third person action game with vehicles in it but you also command the whole army so you have the

kind of overview of it so you're juggling your performance as an individual unit and your strategic

know-how um i just i always found this incredibly flabby like whether it's battalion wars 1 battalion

wars 2 on the wii um i just i thought this was a real bust nintendo never really knew what to do

with it um you know they made it and obviously put enough enough money behind it but it had none of

the the kind of vision of advanced wars um seeing those little sprites kind of turned into sort of

more fully realized 3d models i just didn't really like the art style of it thought it was quite an

ugly looking world quite an unsatisfying game probably doesn't help that i'm not a big strategy

guy so i sort of found that stressful but i didn't i didn't think the central be the soldier on the

battlefield uh really bought anything to it like it that feels like uh that kind of divide between

the kind of like you know bird's eye control and be you know the thrill of being on the ground

could probably be executed on a on a console with a bit more graphical heft but not here

yeah i always i mean this is true of the advanced wars remastered it too somehow it's like the

biggest gulf between gorgeous 2d art and rancid 3d art you know what i mean like it just right

just do not know how to translate those lovely sprites into like a nice looking 3d game it's

whatever reason they've never quite found the way to do it i think that makes sense matthew i don't

think this is the only i'd say it's well-meaning but unsuccessful yeah okay so that would go under

C-rank. C-rank. Okay, yeah.

Makes sense. Is this your only GameCube

game? No, I've got another one.

Okay, cool. Yeah, because I've got a couple of

suggestions as well for the end for that one.

I mean, I think there's a real, like, obvious

Hall of Fame candidate on GameCube that I wonder

if that's the one you've got, but we'll see.

Okay, the Zone of the Enders on

PS2 is my next one.

Lukewarm, definitely.

Because it was known as the game that came with the

MGS2 demo, but it's still

a game that a lot of people played, and

therefore there was a moment where buying it and playing it was important i think the second one

is fantastic i think the first one is a bit of a rough draft of what the second one would be um

level wise it's just not quite not quite as good doesn't quite have the same rhythm to it doesn't

have quite the same level of like mad anime bullshit i think makes the second one just really

quite delightful even if the cutscenes are hard work sometimes this is a kojima produced game after

all um but yeah a lot of people played it um i think it was there was definitely like a moment

where it was super hyped and then i don't think it ever really like caught on as a series under the

enders it was very much a sort of like the second one was a bit of a cult classic i think and then

the first one people only played for that demo so i think it makes sense this list matthew what do

you think yeah i mean i definitely because of the whole the demo connection and the fact that it's a

game i imagine lots of people own and haven't played more than a level of yeah um which is kind

of yeah absolutely perfect it's a shame i i played more of it than that i don't know if i ever finished

the original zone of enders but i remember playing a definitely playing a demo of zone of enders 2

and thinking it just looked absolutely amazing um it's kind of classy and i like it's i'm not a big

mech guy but i'd say it's take on mechs feel kind of of its own and and you know not really like

anything else it's quite distinctive yeah i quite like this the style of its of its creations i agree

I think there's something about it that's very shinkawa you really see that sort of art style

given given them a slightly different character to you know Evangelion or whatever you know whatever

the kind of like the hot the hottest kind of like mech thing was of the day um yeah I agree I think

that that is good about it I think um it's quite telling though that when they've remastered the

series in recent years they've basically abandoned this one like they did two on ps4 and on pc but

they just didn't even bother with one um one i think they did do with the ps3 collection um they

did the 360 collection which is a a notoriously rough um release by konami maybe a bit of a sign

of where things were going but uh yeah the second one is just head and shoulders above it i thoroughly

recommend it but i would still put this down as possibly a seven um because i think it definitely

kind of was for the time um being next to medieval kind of makes sense to me matthew so a rank it goes

an a for me do you agree with that yeah okay what's your next one uh my next game q pick i don't feel

like this is going to be the one you're thinking of because you're going to say it's like super

mario sunshine or something no no no it's not that okay uh i pick geist oh right no i was gonna

say surely starfox adventures is a hall of fame lukewarm console exclusive like surely that that

that to me is like the epitome of that of what that term means to me do you know what i mean like

lukewarm oh that's yeah i obviously my brain has suppressed that game so much that when i looked

down the list it didn't even jump out of me um my eyes scanned over it it's a bit like how in west

world they've been programmed not to see anything which like fucks with their reality that's what i

do i just saw a gap there you're james marsden on the uh on the ranch in westworld basically um

that's okay we can come back to that one because that's one of my suggestions but um yeah let's

Let's go Geist then first.

Geist was, I feel, quite hyped up by more the American press than anyone else.

There was this hang-up that was developing during the GameCube era,

definitely big in the Wii era, about Nintendo platforms not having,

you know, quote-unquote hardcore games.

And if anyone made anything that looked like it was a bit adult,

and this is famously like either the second or first Nintendo game with an M rating,

it got celebrated just for being a bit edgy.

It was a really tiresome kind of routine we had going.

It's how people ended up bigging up the Conjurer on Wii,

which was that total shiter of a first-person shooter.

Because they had a real chip on their shoulder about it.

So everyone got excited about this thing.

It's a bit like Ghost Hitman.

You are a spirit.

You have to possess people in order to have their offensive capabilities.

So you jump into soldiers' bodies and then it becomes a pretty terrible first-person shooter.

It has some interesting gimmicks in that to possess people, you have to scare them.

And so there's almost like a little adventure game element to it where you possess inanimate objects

and then trigger a little animation in them to try and spook people.

But all that stuff was very prescribed.

It isn't like a big ghost sandbox, which I think is what people have promised.

It's the game where you can famously possess a bowl of dog food

and then make the dog food spill to scare a dog so you can possess a dog.

It's a nice idea on paper, that kind of thing.

It is.

And Nintendo involved...

This should have been the second Eternal Darkness-style project.

I think Miyamoto is a producer on this game.

So you wonder if Nintendo were going to bring a bit of magic to it

or they were trying to do quite a weird spin on a first-person shooter game

in the same way that Eternal Darkness was an interesting and successful spin on survival horror.

But I think this just missed the mark in lots of ways.

Too limited in its ideas, too shoddy in its execution.

I mean, it's a real nothing of a game, Geist.

Pretty ugly looking as well.

Like in some screenshots, it looks like the N64 port of Quake, you know?

Yeah, and it got really dinged for like technical performance and everything.

So yeah, a big old mess.

Was anyone actually really excited about it?

Or like, no one was waiting on guys to decide on whether they were going to buy GameCube.

Yeah.

But again, if you were in the Nintendo ecosystem back then, you just got sick of hearing about

this thing.

It makes you realise that Eternal Darkness was a bit more of a fluke than people realised,

you know what I mean?

Like, they just weren't able to ever really replicate it.

Anything like it, were they really?

It was a real one-off.

Yeah.

The really tough thing with this, a lot of the games I was considering for this, the thing

in common is... Dennis Dyack?

No, what I was

going to say is it's the guy

internally at Nintendo,

the person who works with Western

Studios is Kinsuke Tanabe.

Right. And so he's like the

Nintendo producer on most of these

bad exclusives.

He is the common thread.

He's lucky because he's got Metro Prime to his name,

but he has everything

else too. So

tough break for that guy. He's got

one of the shakier records at nintendo amazing like that sony producer who just left i think a

couple of months ago whose like main job was the spider-man spin-offs like craving the hunter and

morpheus and stuff right similar similar vibes that's funny i i knew about i knew the name of this

game i don't think i ever really knew what it was about or anything else about it yeah i think

yeah just cut the curse gamecube content i mean does look interesting in some ways but oh my god

it also has like the some of the worst box art i've ever seen just so so bad yeah very of its

time i think this this feels like probably c rank in that it's well-meaning but unsuccessful

did um tanabe also do twin snakes is that on um on his cv i don't know the whole konami of that

there were other people involved he did uh he's mainly known for working with retro but yeah this

this too maybe it's like american students he's he was uh i think there was sort of producer on

battalion wars okay well there you go tough break for for that guy um okay very brief one here because

we talked about this game loads somehow on this podcast now but the getaway is the epitome of a

lukewarm exclusive to me ps2 massive massive hype everyone played it was like this is shit even if

the version of like london they did was quite good um i think this definitely belongs on this list

Matthew I think it probably goes in b rank um because middling may have had hype behind it once

but who cared ultimately I think that's probably a fair call for the getaway what do you think

yeah I think a game which has given us this many Andy Kelly tweets um shouldn't be too far down this

list yeah it's a net gain for the for people who are too online basically I'd say the higher games

on this list have have at least stuck in the imagination in some way yeah also those great

car shots in the getaway as well i just see those doing the rounds constantly people just really

enjoy those so um what's your next one matthew uh my next one was a gamecube game became a wee game

and therein lies the problem it's donkey kong jet race oh yeah i completely memory hold this one yeah

so this was originally being designed for gamecube where it was going to be a racing game controlled

with the bongo controllers so you would tap out a rhythm to go faster and then bang either directional

bongo to turn left and right not like an amazing idea but you can sort of see where they were coming

from so they had that peripheral but they i had a troubled development they took so long to bring

it out it eventually comes out on the wii where there is no bongo controller even though bongo

controllers like run through this game 100 like the design of the bongo controllers is in the

vehicles like the jetpacks that they're that they're using uh except now you're just shaking the remote

left and right to turn around corners so no way near as satisfying um i would argue even with the

bonga controllers this would be a huge bust uh it's just it's just not a very fun riff on like

mario kart very very slow controls trying to respond to horrible obstacles it is to donkey

kong what mario kart is to the mario universe so a racing game populated only by donkey kong and his

cursed extended family candy kong absolutely grim uh do not want to pick her own racing game ever

please do not add her as dlc to mario cartwell was she the one who was the subject of that um

she's fit a quote that you found in a magazine oh she's just the one of like oh let's just give a

huge pair of breasts to a monkey and you're like why that's just no everything about this is is

stuff they were really i i don't really know why they ever finished this game on we it was so

compromised it came and went got some of the worst scores on we it's just it's just fucking rubbish

this game i feel like donkey kong has maybe a tiny bit more of a history of being put into sort of

shaky kind of games than other like core nintendo characters you know what i mean just maybe just a

little bit more inconsistency yeah i i contemplated the sort of march the mini stuff for this but

it isn't a big enough concern really to even warrant thinking about and likewise there was a

there was a game boy advance game and then a ds sequel called king of swing right where you kind of

swung on these pegs to climb up levels which was like it was mechanically fine not particularly

exciting but again it's not like nintendo pinned all their hopes on it yeah that's the thing a lot

of that's what i'm saying about nintendo i think they know when something's a bit crap and then

they just sort of sort of brush it under the carpet and don't talk about it yeah okay well

fair enough so where's this going matthew in their rankings i just don't know what a debacle looks like

in the context of this list well worse than hey pikachu i mean that's that's kind of the bar i

think that's been set uh i'd say it's i'd still say this is d rank all right good stuff that's

tough candy kong uh banished to history until uh inevitably in donkey kong bonanza they do a new

modern feminist version matthew and try and reclaim the character and it's very um ends up being cursed

in a different way um okay okay um we move on to the the king of girl boss now yeah yeah voice by

zendaya so that's a reference to um they redesigned that space jam bunny right and people were losing

their minds because they made her less sexy and she was voiced by zendaya like that was uh that

was a thing that happened um bad pandemic memories um okay uh we go up to the the console that's the

king of the lukewarm exclusive and that's the playstation 3 heavenly sword is first up matthew

yeah yeah definitely like this that's the that's i'd say that's the box art for like

lukewarm exclusives in my mind exactly if we made artwork to you know like promote this podcast we'd

have a picture of nariko on there for sure from this game um has all the ingredients for like cursed

early kind of exclusive that didn't hit the mark using six axis motion controls for like for aiming

projectiles didn't did not work even like i think you had to do some of the melee combat was done with

flicking the controller just not not ideal it's about like four hours long it's very very short

so maybe one of those things where they wanted to make more game but making hd graphics was

much harder than anyone anyone realized at the start of that generation so ended up feeling

compromised in that way i'd say about four characters in this look like andy circus even

one of the girls um that's quite cursed in a kind of apex twin style way um i think that

this is definitely a stepping stone to the studio making some better stuff i think enslaved is a

much better game than this for example um but um and obviously the dmc we like a lot um hellblade

I think we're a bit more mixed on Matthew

I didn't play that second one but I think you said

other people seem to like it

they sure do that second one didn't you say that second one was basically

a whole game of just shimmying three spaces

in like in other games

I only played about an hour of it I thought it was

absolutely terrible

so I gave up on it

that's tough did look nice though but hey ho

maybe like a bit of an up and down studio for us

but Heavenly Sword was yeah I think

this is probably a B rank as well

because it was like definitely positioned as a

system setup it was so obvious when it came out

that it wasn't going to be that it was a proper false start for the ps3 it was a proper like everyone

thought this is going to be one of the games i remember that lovely edge cover for example it

just felt like it was going to be shit hot and then it just wasn't so b seems about right for this

matthew do you agree yeah that that feels like in terms of like the buzz around it for sure i remember

alarm bells ringing with this one the way they were talking about it you know when your big thing is

like motion capture and graphics and who's writing it or the voice talent involved but not the game

itself i'm always like there's nothing there there's nothing to this yeah it was this was a

i remember just this being a particularly brutal moment of being on a playstation magazine next to

an xbox magazine because right when crackdown came out as well and so not only were they playing the

halo 3 beta but crackdown was also really good so it was it was tough times for your boy okay in a

similar vein and a similar time frame a layer pierce 3 um again a game that should have been good but

wasn't was absolutely hobbled by six axis controls at launch which they eventually took out but

still only made it a middling uh sort of like a shooter on a dragon kind of game the last factor

five game killed factor five killed the fucking rogue leader studio i mean what a bummer that's

the heartbreaker here it is that's a real bummer so i think i think this might be a good fit for

debacle but the simple reason that the controls didn't actually work and it killed the studio

it killed the studio everyone like this is a net loss for everyone like no one won from layer do

that's fair yeah it's a net loss for gaming because it killed factor 5 yeah and i think like i think

i feel like they were railroaded into doing the six axis controls by sony as well because they were

like oh yeah we've bolted this feature on that no one wants and i've told the story before but

just remember it being demoed to me and uh i could see the pr getting frustrated i couldn't play it

and then because she played the demo so many times she could like perfectly do it but i was like this

is not intuitive this doesn't work and lo and behold a few years later no one's using six axes

for anything um so um it goes away okay good matthew what's your next one we game disaster day

of crisis which was monolith soft what they did before xenoblade and thank god they pivoted into

xenoblade soon after i say that i i have a fondness for this game and i think there's a case that it's

It's almost one of those sevens in that it's a preposterous action game where you're basically in a place where terrorists have set off all these weather natural disasters.

So there's like a huge flood, there's a volcano, there's a tornado, there's a firestorm.

Like all these things are happening at once and you are constantly pulled through this.

Bit of a mishmash of games, like a third-person action game,

occasionally becomes almost like a light-gun shooter.

There's driving sections, there's loads of minigames.

It's just a very odd, you know, everything but the kitchen sink Wii game

where someone was a bit overexcited about all the different control setups.

There is definitely a fondness for this game.

I don't think it's quite a cult classic.

I was chuckling away reading John Walker's Eurogamer review for this,

where I took the quote, he said,

it's as if an alien being attempted to make a game about American life

but based all their knowledge of humans on the films of Roland Emmerich,

which I thought was really, really spot on.

Like, everyone talks in this completely preposterous, macho, action-cliché way.

I think we did a, not a back page, but a comedy one-page in N-Gamer

where we wrote, like, a Michael Bay script, a pastiche of this,

and it was one of those things where the satire didn't work

actual games far far dumber than anything that would ever make it to the cinema uh i remember

playing i reviewed we music while alex dale was playing disaster day of crisis next to me

so he had the extra weird experience of all of this heightened oddness of that game combined with

me parping away through my grandfather's clock um which is probably like the most cursed review

session of all time that's a bad day in that office and bath that is yes no one's having no

won that day they gave us loads of haribo so we were both like super hyper even more cursed i think

that uh this is ashley day as fuck this game this is like ashley day core this game um yeah i always

kind of wanted to play it because it seemed like it was the mad nintendo version of heavy rain or

something where it was you know what i mean where it was a bit of like yeah like using all the

features but it's kind of a narrative game it's this high concept that kind of pulls pulls you

through and it's a cool like setting it's a cool idea in terms of like situation for a game but

yeah it's just like it's just outrun a tidal wave and then you see a volcano explode and it's just

like oh no what next is like the energy of this like he's really just sort of resigned to the fact

that every corner he turns is going to be a new natural disaster and it becomes very funny they're

really funny they become like the jrpg studio after this they're just like and now that's like

that's them isn't it they're not going to make another game like this so yeah um so where does

it go is it possibly a seven but not one of those sevens matthew is it an a yeah i'd quite like to put

it in a rank to not disrespect like it's charming i think if you went out of your way to find a copy

you'd probably have fun with it yeah that makes sense okay next up uh infamous on ps3 um i think

this is probably on the higher end of uh lukewarm exclusives on ps3 but i will i will say that it was

one of those games where i was really in the headspace of i think this is going to be crackdown

for the ps3 it's a superhero game without a licensed superhero obviously um just a very

generic bald man called cole um definitely like sub nathan drake bottom of the barrel ps3 heroes

in that kind of like definitely one of the heads you see in that can you tell all these like bold

video game protagonists apart images um he's like a proper i can still pick him out of the crowd

regrettably that is my curse as i'm i'm doomed to walk the earth with this knowledge um but

infamous i think the second one is better the second one's a bit more of a all singing and

dancing ps3 exclusive it like looked a lot nicer has like a has like a like a big sort of kaiju size

monster thing in it it's set in like new orleans style location which i think gives it a bit more

character even if the main character is still rubbish um but the first infamous is like again

it's got it's got six axis controls it i think it looks horrible in screenshot form now when you look

at it but i don't think it quite had the stuff at the time i think i gave it 72 on play and maybe

they increased the score um it was something to do with like how the editor at the time didn't like

this scoring less than ghostbusters which was out the same month and so you upped it to 78 or something

but um this was a game that was given away for free as well after the um the sony hack so i think a

lot of people actually have played this um but infamous as a series always felt like one of the

the lesser playstation exclusives to me and i think ghost of tsushima is just a much bigger deal than

these games ever were what do you think matthew yeah i i i'm not not into this series so i just

found it very uh just it just felt like a like a very snazzy ps2 sort of ass game in terms of

it's like open world design and thinking really very flat for me but the one thing it did well is

that you could um slide along train rails as the character and they did that that felt that felt

pretty good you had quite a nice little glide off the back of that so you do yeah you'd sort of jump

off the train track and then sort of like glide with a bit of momentum that was quite nicely done

yeah i just i really associated with that era of like every game seemed to be about big moral

crossroads yeah yeah like are you gonna be good are you gonna be bad and and how different games

to reflect that and it was just a really like tedious thing i think we've cooled a little bit

on that now that's dead choice and consequence is still big but the the good path dark path thing is

it's like a very this generation problem i think it's dead as a feature in anything but rpgs now

it's just gone it's just yeah you just don't see it now um yeah i mean it was definitely bioshock

was definitely responsible for this right the you know how you harvest or save the little sisters i

think that's why that happened um but uh yeah it was infamous was probably like one of the worst

uses of it um it was definitely like uh will you be the hero or villain pitch which is not a bad idea

but all the choices were just so preposterous let these civilians die etc we talked about this a bit

a bit before um but yeah lukewarm for sure i will give the second one a pass though i think it was

for the time like a low eight on ps3 so the first one goes in here um i think it's probably

um b rank as well because middling may have had hype behind it once but who cared ultimately i

think that's infamous's legacy the only people you ever see saying they should bring infamous back on

twitter or whatever just sickos so it goes here what's the next one matthew this is a little niche

but it is it's so bad uh it's not actually a nintendo published game but one of the worst things

that we ever played on we that we also covered in some detail uh which is major miners majestic march

oh the one from um the parappa people right yeah this is it so this is why everyone covered it

because it was the parappa creative team back together again and it was like well that that

could be exciting they've decided to make a rhythm game again and they're gonna make it on wii um

unfortunately it was a marching game where your sole input i think was the timing that you raise

and lowered the Wii Remote and either the the game's sense of timing was off or the Wii Remote

just didn't have the accuracy to be able to hit it it just never fucking worked and it had this

really cursed um like audio trick which was when you were out of time with the game the band that

you were playing with would start honking away off key and it would get worse and worse and worse

the worse you performed and every level just felt like a sort of vicious cycle because it would start

going wrong then you'd lose it at how bad it sounded and it would only get worse from there

so it would never be better than it's than it was in your like first five steps all while the

we remote is screaming out of that tinny birthday card quality mic shake me properly shake me properly

me and Kitsue

just sitting in the games cage

in the future bath

just howling with laughter at how shit this thing was

I was crying it was so bad

this game is

it's fucking awful

whatever goodwill you feel towards the

Parapartemia absolutely kills it

and you think never again

they shouldn't be allowed near this genre ever again

this is

an E-rank for me

yeah I think that's fair

i mean we talked about how was parappa ever a good rhythm action game or but did the time even

make sense like um and i think there's a bit of sort of back and forth on this maybe related to

how the timings were maybe based on like input lag lack of input lag and playing on ps1 and stuff but

i can't say the rhythm part of it was ever the part that was good they were just good art pieces i

think where they look and sound amazing which is a good reason for a game to exist back then but

and this didn't even have that there's nothing of a level of like chop chop mustard onion in this

yeah you know it's just like a load of animals holding thrombones absolutely blows this game

yeah um i told you i accidentally typed in major miners domestic march which is not the same thing

um yeah okay good stuff i like there being another debacle in there a bit company for

layer down there so that's that's good um okay uh oh this is a good one this is like a again

another one where i was like this is what the exercise is for matthew god of war ascension on

ps3 i mean has all the bones of like one of our favorite games god of war 3 has nothing to say

nothing more to do with the character it's a prequel you get a couple of bits that are big

sort of like monster-y boss fight bits but i barely remember anything about this game and i only well

i remember i remember exactly when i played it because it's exactly when the queen died i was

playing this game and um it's what she would have wanted me to do with the day off i got off the

back of that um obviously um but uh yeah this is just as somebody who played this via streaming

on playstation 5 not an ideal way to enjoy it matthew i think this is quintessential

naff ps3 what are we doing here with this sony series so they had to reboot the series after this

it was that bad what do you think i i i think i liked it a little bit more than you in that i quite

there's that bit where you ride a giant snake through an ice cave that was all right uh visually

quite spectacular but you are like story-wise i can't even remember where it falls if it's a prequel

a sequel an interquel god knows what's going on with this game felt like a oh we need to do another

one of these yeah which is just no reason to do it no buzz for it no excitement um especially after

the god of war 3 which just has such such like clarity of vision to it yeah it yeah it really

did and many moments that are seared into my brain um partly because they're quite traumatic to watch

but uh um i think this probably goes under middling because the game is not bad as such um yeah but

it's just disappointing so i think that it goes going next to heavenly sword infamous probably

makes sense but uh yeah okay i just yeah real real disappointment if you're ever doing the big

god of war play there's a reason i think this is this hasn't been remastered and probably never will

be even if every um three months now someone with a ridiculous username like mr cheek 69 who says

there's a new collection of these games coming out that it never actually happens so um same person

says wind wake hd and twilight princess hd is coming yeah exactly the exact same guy source my

dad basically um okay um i'm gonna jump to 3ds i struggled with ds yeah i don't i don't know what

you'd really put in there so oh oh wait actually no i do know brain training brain training and

nintendogs they'd go in there do you think so well i think that like s rank is exactly what nintendogs

is for which is to say system seller despite being utterly lukewarm that's exactly what nintendogs is

but it's absolutely fine for what it is yeah but it's barely it's barely any kind of game to it

not it's just i just think that kind of like casual bracket of ds software there's maybe a

case for it but it's okay it's your list so what have you suggested for this so on 3ds uh steel

diver is a really easy one for this which was miyamoto submarine game i think maybe one of the

like last games that you can actually probably attribute to miyamoto specifically right um which

was yeah you're controlling submarine on the top screen but that you control it on the touch screen

little control panel uh an idea that was done in a way more interesting way in affordable space

adventures this just felt like a tech demo that had been kind of pushed through to retail because

it was like miyamoto's tech demo there's a few examples of that not a very substantial game

doesn't really go anywhere interesting doesn't really escalate in interesting ways it all works

absolutely fine like it's not broken or anything um just felt incredibly flimsy and at a time when

the 3ds you know conversation particularly on was dominated by the lack of interesting software

the price of the games the price of the console what does this remind you of

it was a yeah it was it was just a real bummer like they were very bullish like this is what a

30 quid game looks like on 3ds this little kind of throwaway thing actually pilot wings resort is

100 that as well right you know there's about like two hours of mission content in that game and i'd

happily put that in as well you know when you brought it up earlier all-time stinky launch

lineup i think launch window 3ds um just yeah rough you know it was really tough i mean you could get

excited about like you know quite a handsome port of street fighter 4 i think it was yeah uh but

did you know it was quite a hard sell trying to get people excited for like the most expensive

least technically accomplished version of that game again what does this remind you of

well i gotta say though donkey kong and mario kart between them is like yes even a muddled donkey

game is so much more compelling as a proposition so yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't even think it well

I'm not going to

re-litigate Donkey Kong

I just can't

I can't do that to myself

my soul can't take it

you can do it in three months

Matthew

it's fine

yeah but we can agree

that Steel Diver

and Pilotwings Resort

I'd say both

just very flimsy things

that probably shouldn't

be sold as

as full price games

the fact that

Pilotwings Resort

just reused

that crappy island

from

I think it was

Resports Resort

the Woohoo Island

yeah that was it

like they had this

big thing

like all our games

are going to be set

on Woohoo Island

like it's a land

support any kind of game you're like it's a really like miserable place like it isn't it's like one

of the worst worlds you've ever built like no one has any affection for woohoo island though

camarocho that's for sure you know no i mean i associate that place with we fit like there was

a game where you jogged around woohoo island by putting the we remote in your pocket and jogging on

the balance board like that is just that because of that because it made me jog that place is now

forever cursed like i can only resent a place where i've had to do that that's that's big like man who

has to do a lot of walking lately energy to that i would say yeah but i'm beginning to resent bath

bits where i walk around i'm like fuck that corner fuck that corner the crescent the crescent is where

i'm tired so i hate the crescent now oh that's tough i like the crescent but um i just don't like

being photographed by tourists there's so many photos of me photobombing photos from like chinese

tourists doing like panoramics and you just a blur a blur of me in the background there must be about

a million of those photos on the internet i'll afford those being harvested by ai and me being

like a future kind of like ai image generated cryptid whenever you type in a picture of bar

you just see like a blur of my face in the background that's um that'd be good yeah see me

having a heart attack in google street view which is going to be awesome for everyone well still

diver and pilot wings resort holding hands as they jump off the skyscraper into one of these buckets

Matthew, which one?

They feel C-rank.

Yeah, I think that makes sense.

I think they just thought that Nintendogs plus Cats would have the juice,

but it didn't.

The mobile games had already taken off by that point,

and they'd lost the casual market.

Tough break, but yes.

At least they were just nine months away from some good games coming out

in Mario Kart and Mario 3D Land, so all good.

It ended well.

Okay, very similar tack to God of War Ascension, Matthew.

Gears Judgment on Xbox 360,

which is the Gears game until recently that I'd played the most, actually,

because I reviewed it for Cypher now.

Another similar thing of being a kind of prequel at the end of the generation.

Oh, we've done the main trilogy.

We told the story, but shall we make another game?

And then not really having any kind of like juice to it.

And then I feel like Gears kind of needs to go through a bit of a reset period after this

because it just didn't really set the world on fire.

I think very emblematic of the latter half of the 360 generation

where Xbox were focusing on Kinect

and just didn't really have it anymore.

And a problem that becomes, you know,

much larger on Xbox One, obviously.

But yeah, I think this makes sense

as a kind of a Gears game that no one really loved.

No one really talks about remembers.

What do you think?

Yeah, it's the one I've played the least of.

I've definitely not finished it.

I thought it had like more of a weird

sort of score attack vibe to it.

Uh, I might, but kind of vaguely rings a bell.

Maybe an extra, like, a new mode that was a bit, like, bullet stormy.

I remember them making a big deal about Tom Bissell being one of the writers on it,

and then playing it and thinking this could be any Gears game.

Like, it means nothing to me that.

But, yeah, I think this probably goes under B rank as well.

It's middling.

It's the classic Gears combat is here.

It's People Can Fly.

They're obviously a very accomplished developer.

But it wasn't really a place for it.

I don't think it really, people really cared, I'm sure.

If they do a HD collection, I wouldn't be surprised if this gets left out.

It's very much the God of War Ascension of that series.

So, yeah.

Okay, what's the next one, Matthew?

Again, this is niche,

but I felt like we were pushing it reasonably hard

on official Nintendo, certainly in advertising.

There was a 3DS game called Freaky Forms.

Oh, I don't remember this at all.

No, don't remember it at all.

Yeah, so again, a Nintendo first-party game.

Its big gimmick was you made your platforming hero,

and it was like a almost like a sort of paper doll kind of hinged limbs sort of thing but you could

design it if you drew it or cut it out in my head it was it had a kind of papery energy to it but

yeah the idea was nintendo have made a platformer where you make your own hero and you get to play as

them and um you know you make your little freaky form you know i wondered if it was kind of trying

to tap into the a spore thing that had happened of like loads of people are going to make really

characters and we're all going to share our characters and it was the variety of what you

could make that was going to sell it but the truth was that you know however you know solid the

character customization was you made a little avatar which then went through just total drudgery

like there was just nothing interesting in that game really bad platforming coin collecting some

like platform like it just had no had no direction or idea to it um they released a version then they

released freaky forms deluxe which was like an expanded version maybe the original was an e-shop

game um but yeah i can just remember like getting adverts for this to put in the magazine and thinking

oh it's come to this like they're really trying to make freaky forms happen because there was

nothing going on around that so you know maybe it's more of a psychological magazine scar than it is

an actual concern you know going concern for regular people i never thought it was possible

i don't think the 3ds library was large enough for me to have not heard of a game published by

nintendo but somehow this is completely new to me i've never seen these character designs before

and they are like it's like a vague gesture towards little big planet or something you know what i

mean but it was yeah that stuff was shite looks shite it was around here but tear away was happening

and I thought that PlayStation was eating Nintendo's lunch

in the games that look like craft space.

Yeah.

Like, this was the era where Paper Mario looked particularly...

I was going to say he looked particularly thin.

That is his whole deal.

But Paper Mario was looking quite kind of flimsy

and bigger things were being done elsewhere.

Freaky Forms, just a user-generated content game

that just came and went, whoever thought about it.

Weirdly, if you Google search Freaky Forms,

it starts auto-filling with just like

ROM download, ROM hack

straight away as if there's a big audience

for this game.

That is weird actually, yeah.

Unless that's just my search algorithm,

which I don't know why it would be because I have not been looking

for that. No, that's not your deal at all, is it really?

And these, I got the same thing

so I think you're right. I think it might just be

people being completionist about it

and there's literally no other reason to look

it up other than, you know, I just want to

stick this onto my retro handheld

and just see what the deal is.

um shite mate it looks shite um where's it going it is i wouldn't say debacle but i would say d rank

yeah okay freaky forms you learn something new every day about slightly shit nintendo games that

only matthew has played um okay good um perfect dark zero and xbox 360 is next matthew um rare

gonna take a couple of strays here so i do apologize i've left um i've i haven't put banjo

nuts and bolts in here i've spared it that um the horror of that um because i know that people like

that game and it's quite it was quite a shiny thing for the moment but the this definitely was

i mean it there's no reason why perfect dark as a series shouldn't have continued it didn't it didn't

look right it didn't feel right it was kind of tough to have a first person shooter of dubious

quality on a platform that had loads of amazing ones that generation and so very quickly as things

like fear and halo 3 come along and call of duty it just perfect dark seems particularly out of

place it was absolutely years in production as well took ages to come out although by the modern

standards of games not that long really it was like five years but you know these days that's

nothing isn't it really um so yeah but again it just feels like all the all the wrong things it was

a launch game the series died it didn't really have the look or feel that people who played the

first game wanted what do you think matthew i thought this was terrible yeah um and i was really

sad like there wasn't any you know that i think some people are like ha ha you know nintendo sold

rare and rare as shit now i didn't feel that at all i wanted there to i was really excited for there

to be another perfect dark and uh certainly for like the earlier years of the 360 i played the

first level of this and then just noped out and didn't go back to it for a long long time because

it was so obviously bad and wrong it was just uh very unfortunate and at the time people knew it as

well this sort of all of this stuff leads to a bit of a rare pivot ultimately though they did make

viva pinata this generation and that is um that's i think that's pretty cameo also shit at launch

cameo that was my next one so might as well pair these together um yeah cameo so this was a game

that was cameo was also meant to be on game keep at some point right yeah and then basically a game

where slightly zeldery kind of game where you play this little fairy girl who transforms into

of different monsters to progress through the game is that right uh it's been a while yeah that's

yeah yeah so again just i think maybe you can see where the n64 bones are of a game like this you

could you can even see in your mind's eye i think what cameo on n64 would look like you know just a

bit more exaggerated fairy tale designs but the actual visual style of it is just quite muddy and

unappealing tough for these two games to release back to back and for them to both be bad um so yeah

they can they can both go in this list i think maybe perfect dark goes a bit lower than cameo

because that again bad for the series so i think maybe it's c for cameo and d for perfect dark zero

i'm on board with this we're not quite in debacle territory yeah it's not quite that bad they both

felt like games where the studio was working out what like the hd era was gonna look like and how

it was gonna behave yeah like i say i think it's just the sheer amount of competition i mean the

standards for first-person shooters just increased on console really really fast in those years so

yeah not not having the stuff was just going to be super obvious what's your next pick matthew

my next pick metroid prime federation force on 3ds perfect yeah like metroid had been away

like five years maybe when this was this was announced that metroid was coming back

q great excitement but wait this is the game that asks the question what if we could see the

Metroid Universe from the perspective of the

no-name Galactic Federation Marines.

A question no one

ever asked. Apart from...

Oh, actually no, I know who did ask it.

It's our friend, Kinsuke Tanabe again.

Producer of

Metroid Prime. Absolutely sticking out

the joint with this one. Next Level Games

who made the excellent

Luigi's Mansion 2, and we'd go on to make the

excellent Luigi's Mansion 3, got put

on this. When you read developer

quotes, they're like, this was such

a step up for us we were so excited to be working on metroid and they turned it into a just very

generic first person shooter kind of cooperative first person shooter where instead of like a big

interconnected world single player campaign you went and did little little co-op missions with

these generic marines i mean we we mentioned this on the the switch to episode yesterday like the

least exciting bit of the metroid universe is anything that isn't samus so the idea of removing

her and making it about i mean it doesn't even have a clear sci-fi vision for these guys they're

just blue dudes with helmets terrible like just huge disappointment huge bust game is completely

unbalanced like it's designed for car players it doesn't recalibrate the single player at all so

it's just not fun to play as either doesn't yeah there's just nothing there's nothing to it has the

first person controls which were quite good in Metroid Prime Hunters are sort of here too so it

works but what you're actually doing is it's like nothing you want from a Metroid game um things look

pretty bleak for the series around this point um but then things you know yeah talk about a comeback

you know well we've got to wait and see if metro point four actually delivers i think that's another

tonabe joint could go either way um yeah i remember this is a it's a bit weird there's a few

later 3ds games that are a bit a bit odd where you wonder why did that happen like the um animal

crossing happy home designer spin-off or that zip uh chibi robo game uh the 2d platformer ziplash

that's it yeah or the um that intelligent systems game that didn't um quite have the juice the 3d

one. Oh, Codename Steam?

Yeah, yeah. And that was like, I

realise that's a slightly better tier than these

but it was just a bit odd

what they were making at the time. Yeah, they

were but again, these games

like, they were sort of shrugged out

they weren't like, yes, Chibi Robo

but you know, it's very odd that

Chibi Robo kept getting these

outings. You know, to look at it from

afar, you'd sometimes think, is Iwata

doing like favours for these

sort of external studios that

of friends with nintendo right like is he throwing them a chibi robo bone here or you know what's

going on with this you know why are they making these sort of four out of ten platformers the

problem with that chibi robo is it just has none of the qualities of the main series the central

mechanics that make that game work it just becomes like a slightly bad version of that uh unravel

platformer yeah uh it's kind of it's how it sort of felt to me there's also that pikmin hey pikmin

game as well like just yeah just slightly odd kind of like spin-off i just don't really kind of get

the strategy behind them but especially when like other nintendo reliables were beginning to like really

kick ass again you know like fire emblem is always the example given like really came into its own and

they really kind of drilled into what made it work so to see all these other series sort of stumbling

through these weird spin-offs was yeah that was quite odd yeah very strange um okay well where does

do you think this belongs there matthew i'd say d rank i don't think you know again it's not total

debacle but there's just yeah it's just totally duff it was annoying seeing the 3ds and the wii u

which both had like really good hardware for like um doing the sort of metroid style scanning or

whatever for them to not even have yeah those kinds of a first person metroid game on them like it just

feels like that was so obviously the play for those hardware and somehow nintendo just didn't

connect the dots on that proper sort of doldrum years for nintendo um this um so yeah um tough

but it would turn around so that's good um another game where i was like oh yeah this is why this

episode exists two human on xbox uh 360 um a dennis dyak joint um and i think it's a norse mythology

in the form of like um yeah that's right norse mythology with like a sci-fi sort of like bent to

it um in production for years um was apparently originally announced for the playstation in 1999

and went to GameCube and then apparently Microsoft bought the rights in 2005.

Leads to quite a notorious lawsuit over Unreal Engine with Epic and Silicon Knights.

Loses that and has to pay them 4.45 million, kills the studio.

Has all the makings of a debacle this and I did have it.

I don't think it was terrible.

It was playable but it was just a very middling third-person action game

and a lot of good games in this mould had come along at this time

and I don't think the universe was quite as good as they thought.

I think it had like some kind of novel thing with its like right analog stick being used for combat.

And a few games were trying this at the time.

Very few ever really made it work.

I think Fight Night is probably the only time I've ever really seen them mapping actions to the analog stick and then making it work.

So, yeah.

I think there's also like a, it also got a lot of criticism for quite a sustained death sequence.

Because there's a bit of a like afterlife element to it that was very complicated.

It was one of those things where you could see how the strengths of something like Eternal Darkness were working against this game where they were trying to be clever, but it was making the game worse.

Right.

And it just arrived at that era where I think people were expecting a bit more polish.

I'm guessing you never played this, Matthew.

No, I never played it.

I had a couple of champions in the office, weirdly.

I think some people were into it.

It wasn't, like you say, a total bust.

A couple of people locked into it.

I mean, Geraint on Games Master, there was a bit of a running joke about him being a two-human head.

You know, a joke I was never particularly in on because I didn't play it.

So the stakes were pretty low.

I believe that this was re-released for free and you can just go get it

and play it backwards compatible on Xbox.

Whether you would or not, I'm not sure, but anyone can.

But there was definitely a moment where this was like a,

it was positioned as a system seller and it was a major disappointment.

But it just happened to be that Xbox had so much other good stuff

coming along at the time.

It just didn't seem like a big deal that it wasn't very good.

So I feel like debacle because everyone lost ultimately.

But then, I don't know, maybe that's a bit harsh.

It did basically get sixes across the board.

Maybe it belongs in D as well, Matthew.

That might be fairer.

What's your next pick?

The next one is Devil's Third on Wii U.

Oh, perfect.

This was, like, mad looking back on it, there was some hype for this.

for the longest time uh there was talk of itagaki mr ninja gaiden working on a new game with his new

studio valhalla he'd left uh techno to to set up a new lot and i think it was with thq it was going

to be like a you know 360 ps3 style game and somewhere along the line probably the collapse

of thq it was decided that wasn't going to happen and somehow it became a wii u exclusive i mean

Based on what eventually came out, I'm not sure there was any vision for this game or

that it would ever have been a good game.

He's famous for his melee combat systems.

This game's gimmick was you could switch between katana combat up close and then long range shooting

so there were always two tiers of action going but they didn't interact in any particular

interesting way the melee combat was so stripped back to i assume free up your headspace to focus on

um the third person shooting that it didn't really function as a satisfying melee action game which

you'd think he would have like just bought the basics of that to it um and mechanically you know

this game lives and dies by game feel and it kind of had none and that's before you get to the just

sort of baffling story i think you start off the opening cut scene as you're playing drums in

guantanamo bay and you get released from prison to to deal with like a riot there it's all very

try hard and misses the mark looks absolutely rubbish on wii u had a suite of quite creative

interesting multiplayer modes but they all died instantly because no one bought the thing no idea

what happened here again did nintendo just buy it in like a fire sale at the end of thq who knows

I always thought that the end of THQ was a little bit of a racket and they were kind of like trying to make things that didn't really exist yet.

Like they were going to be a big deal.

So I always thought that South Park, that game, never really existed.

It took so many years that game to come out after THQ closed.

Like it was, I think it was like another two years to come out.

I always just got the sense that they were like desperate to survive.

So made themselves seem like they had much cooler stuff in the tank than they actually did.

And yeah, this was kind of like an all-timer as a result of that.

as well like one of the weird big game industry names of the time um very much recommend reading

the work ethics uh part of his wikipedia page um certainly certainly illuminating um yeah devil's

third tough uh where does this belong matthew it's between a d and an e right yeah i think so i think

it's it's because it just sold so badly i wonder if like maybe and being on wii u it's just everything

about it is cursed you know this is debacle territory it just came at the wrong time it's

just another like stick to beat nintendo with they had like no idea what was going on in the

wii generation yeah it was such a such a funny game to read about this uh anytime i read about

i'm like oh that actually happened they actually made that uh that actually came out uh okay good

getting through these now but i've got blue dragon next matthew uh which was an xbox 360 japanese

rpg um had sakaguchi involved had uematsu involved had toriyama involved who um obviously did the

dragon ball z and chrono trigger uh character designs you'd think on paper it all works and

then it's the most mediocre dragon quester like you could possibly imagine somehow looks extra worse

with xbox 360 hd graphics those character designs just they can translate with the right kind of

color palette but don't here so it sort of looks like flat unreal engine just doesn't quite look

right if it looks like it's got the kind of art direction of something like ah it's hard to put

into words they've gone for realistic when it should be cartoony that's basically what's wrong

with it um i did i did buy this and play this at the time and just thought i can't believe that

he got that xbox money and then parlayed it into something just so duff and then you wonder what the

universe where lost odyssey came out first would look like because that game would ultimately be the

miss walker um which was sakaguchi's studio that would be the game that people would actually like

from this kind of initiative of xboxes to push into the japanese market but blue dragon was such

a rough first attempt that i think it just it damaged lost odyssey as well what do you think

yeah i'd agree with all that it's interesting you're talking about like the visual style not

translating i just wonder if people were a bit hung up on oh we have to show how graphically advanced

these machines are where actually you know many years down the line you get to like the latest

dragon quest which is that art style presented in quite a simple cartoony way but it just looks

amazing because you know you can throw so much of that world around because of its like slightly

simpler look and you know we're in slightly more a slightly more sophisticated age that you could

appreciate that you know that they that they couldn't just directly translate those that 2d style to

that 3d style like it can be done you know and it can look beautiful um we just had to like chill

with all the fucking shaders and whatnot.

Yeah, for sure.

Ni No Kuni looks really good, for example,

from this generation.

So it can be done.

But yeah, this is just a misfire.

I think this goes in C-rank, Matthew.

So yeah, in it goes.

What's your next one?

My next one, if we're talking Wii U Lukewarm exclusives,

you have to mention Star Fox Zero.

Yeah, King.

This is like more of a tragedy than anything else

that Star Fox, you know,

which you could just do a straight version of Star Fox,

you know like starfox 64 but with all the graphical advances that you've had since starfox 64 and it

would be absolutely fine there's this sort of obsession with innovating with starfox which

sometimes works sometimes doesn't you know like how they fit it to the ds in command it may not be

trad starfox but it's kind of cool and i i think it sees its ideas through but this became like a

sort of dumping ground for again like you know a weird miyamoto designed control scheme where he

absolutely insisted this was the the best way to play it where you'd kind of cut between kind of

broad strokes on tv and like specificity on the gamepad i guess is the easiest way of describing

it but having to kind of switch between those two felt kind of cumbersome uh it just felt like it got

in the way of the simple pleasure that is just playing starfox there's a version of this where

you say platinum games are making starfox and you envision just a really good starfox with quite

nice graphics yeah and it isn't that like artistically it looks very flat to me like it's

almost sort of resisting or denying being a triple a starfox for some reason yeah uh very odd just a

very odd thing very unsatisfying for sort of long-term fans i don't think the controls are like

horrible or anything in this game uh but i it's playable yeah i i just i just i don't think it

unlocks like a secret in the next level of appreciation for starfox that they perhaps

imagined it would yeah just a bit of a bummer i enjoyed discovering it for that wii u hall of fame

episode we did um you just see little flashes of promise every now and then but it just doesn't

deliver and there's so much kind of so the control scheme just wears you down so much you just can't

really get enthusiastic about it and you just wonder yeah what would this game be like if they

just didn't have this at all um and we'll never find out so um such as it is but uh yeah definitely

not as bad as devil's third but you know another misfire from a similar time where do you think

this goes matthew i'd say i'd say this is c rank yeah you know it's well-meaning but unsuccessful

i think that's true yeah in my head i just pictured like r-wing flying into like the body of a mech or

something then the mech comes to life and starts beating the shit out of another mech um like that

that's the kind of thing i imagined platinum doing with starfox and then what you play is so

conservative in this game you're like oh it's uh just a shame i mean you know the game which

famously ends up fighting a giant head in space this should be platinum's you know absolute bread

and butter no one is better at fighting giant things in space than platinum it's so true okay

um good stuff matthew um uncharted lost legacy on ps vita this was definitely positioned as a system

seller it is not bad by any means it all works as an uncharted game but it's very lukewarm when

you've played the other uncharted games and come to this it's got a bit of uncharted 1 energy um

as was previously pointed out to me sully is in this game you just have to get a bit deeper into

it um has a bit of the old psv2 puzzles to it wiping dust off of like artifacts and things like

that and other bits and pieces that use the functionality in that very kind of launch game

style way um absolutely fine would be among the higher ones here for sure but um i think still

lukewarm ultimately what do you think matthew i'd agree with all that uh you know i played all the

way through it which uh you know is i think it kind of like comes into its own a little bit more

but um a lot of unnecessary guff classic launch game must do all functionality style problems yeah

it's sort of also a game you'd only play once as well it's that kind of experience so yeah and it

It was, you know, they're quite pricey PS Vita games.

I think this goes in S-rank though,

because I think possible system seller is true.

That's what it was designed for.

It was Sony's biggest series of the time.

And it is lukewarm.

But yeah, it's the only S-rank game

alongside Sonic Adventure so far.

I think this is right.

This is ultimately not what the Vita would be good at.

But it was an interesting look at what it could have been.

So I'm willing to be lenient on it.

What's the next one, Matthew?

We skipped a PS4 with Killzone Shadowfall.

Perfect.

I mean, did anyone play this game beyond its second level?

I'm not sure.

I just wasn't feeling it.

I felt like it was throwing around loads of visual splendor,

but was completely soulless.

I'm not a Killzone fan.

This has not been a series that has ever clicked with me.

I do not really see the appeal of it.

And I went into this one.

I tried having an open mind,

but I just don't really know what the hook of it is.

I can't tell you what this game is about,

Because like I say, I played it for an hour and was like, I basically felt the same way

that I did about Perfect Dark Zero.

I was like, just not interested.

And I think, you know, I could only do that because it was like a pack-in when I got my

PS4.

So, you know, that seems indulgent in hindsight, not giving it more of a chance.

But did you play more Shadow Fall?

Do you actually know what this game is beyond its first level?

No, I mean, this was, I think, was this the very first PS4 game they showed?

It was like their big, look what the tech can do kind of game.

But no, I skipped this one because this got actually much worse reviews than the other Killzone games.

Right, okay.

Yeah, I think this basically just kills the series outright, really.

And yeah, the other ones are pretty competent.

Sort of like, if, you know, very off their time looking, industrial kind of like sci-fi games.

This one, yeah, I didn't really know what its deal was, so kind of missed it.

Yeah, I wish I had deeper, more sophisticated thoughts on it.

I just didn't like it and wasn't interested.

There's perhaps something to be said for the PS3 mentality

of what would be a system seller coming through here,

and then that just not working,

and the difference between this and Horizon

is how that generation shifts, you know?

Oh, yeah.

It's definitely a key part of the story of those early years of PS4

not necessarily being stunning on a first-party front,

and then they gradually lock into, like,

this is what all our games are going to be,

and then just across the board, the quality rises.

It's quite amazing how that happens.

but yeah I'd say all my picks do come from those early years yeah that makes sense I think that's

a good choice and not the only PS4 exclusive from that time that can maybe qualify for that I actually

have um this one's um I've gone a bit out of order here but I think I have to put in blinks the time

sweeper on xbox um obviously like uh has some kind of like sonic connections in terms of staff working

on this game but a pretty rough platformer from the time that used a bunch of time manipulating

powers the sort of thing that maybe like 10 years hence could work quite well has the most cursed

looking main character and is obviously an attempt to make the xbox mascot thing happen um i don't

think it's a terrible game i think kids who had xboxes at the time maybe go to bat for this but

it's a bit like any sort of like platforming icon characters from the time where you're never that

convinced that these things are good you just think that the people who like them played them

when they were young um just quite a quite a bumpy ride i have played a bunch of this and i can see

they did it but no it belongs on this list for sure matthew what do you think no affection for

this game at all just i think if you want to do anything kind of platform related that does

interesting stuff with time rewinding just play prince of persia skip this entirely yeah it was

that era wasn't it where people were trying that um yeah very very cursed looking and also quite a

horrible 3d camera as well which is also true for a lot of games from this time um so yes blinks has

been consigned to history though the first one is backwards compatible on um xbox and somehow they

made a second one no one remembers this there was a second blinks game that happened it was a wild

time the noughties uh so i think this probably goes in d rank definitely duff implausible is ever

meant to be a system seller so in it goes my next pick is the order 1886 perfect again this is exactly

what this list is for yeah a game which famously looks beautiful but at the cost of really being a

game at all uh i felt like so kind of meticulous and so detailed that they couldn't really build

the levels out that was the impression i got it basically became a lot of elaborate corridors

quick time events maybe only like two or three moments in the game where it opens up to an actual

fight in a room you know when it actually lets you play it it's it's sort of fine firing kind of

steampunky weapons around um but there was just a sense of this game wants to be a kind of cut

it doesn't want you ever to be in control and to mess up sort of how how glorious it all looks which

i mean it may be impressive on a technical level on an artistic like art design level never did it

for me you know it may be doing things which wow digital foundry but it was used to bring to life

gray boring london streets and sort of dull men some good facial hair but uh yeah just a huge bust

all round i think it's quite telling that like one of the most memorable things about this game for me

was the everyone making fun of the prima strategy guide which had to try and stretch out a very short

game with basically no interaction to a hundred plus pages and it had walkthrough guides for the

quick time events and it was like when it says press x press x and you were like that is a that

is probably one of the toughest like writing gigs copywriting gigs of all time trying to make this

sound like a game that actually needs a strategy guide uh terrible terrible thing yet people like

the show foundry they love this game they're always bringing it up in their coverage you know like maybe

as a technical example but as an actual game surely not surely no one thinks this is good i feel bad

for the studio ready at dawn because they made some very very good impressive psp games and then

try to graduate from that and then i believe that um they had to cut loads of content from this game

in the middle of production i think this came out quite recently in an interview with min max and so

yeah like um a lot of like narrative was apparently chopped away they said they needed another year or

at least one more year and because they didn't get it they had to just cut content from it so i

imagine that prima strategy guy was made on the basis the game might have more to it um yeah it's

I think they said that 2018 is when it would have been a more realistic window for it,

but it was rushed out,

and they obviously just didn't get the support from Sony that other developers got at this time.

So that's unfortunate.

To see the complete version of it, maybe it would have been better,

but yeah, it was very much a Duff early PlayStation exclusive,

which got banished to memory a little bit when some of the better ones rolled along later on.

It had a lightning gun. That was good.

Yeah, that's a cool idea.

And it looked cool.

There is something also to bash it for,

where you have a setting like this,

and the best thing you can do is a third-person shooter.

like that's that's not that inventive or interesting you know maybe a bit of criticism for

that is fair um and then the studio got bought by facebook to make vr games and they had to make a

sequel to one of the most successful games for a platform that no one had by the time it released

and then they closed them down so i mean what a waste what's all that fucking cursed advertising

for on like instagram and shit if not for paying for games from developers my vr headset matthew but

um alas and where do you think this is going uh i mean i think it's i think it's d rank personally

i think it's definitely duff yeah okay fair enough it goes in there it's not a debacle though and i

do tell you a point i felt you know i did feel for them when i read that min max stuff but i think i

paid for what did i pay for what for this i played it pretty early on oof that's rough i think you

deserve to put it in d on that basis really um okay next one playstation all-stars battle royale

on ps3 and playstation vita uh i mean an automatic entry into this straight away matthew um actually

a good game that all the all the actual like beat-em-up parts work they hired the people

at studio center monica to actually make those parts good um i think they got some some fighting

game community adjacent guy to be like a producer on it or something and i think you really feel that

in the in the game i wouldn't even say it's worse to play than a smash bros to me i don't think smash

Bros is like is incredible in terms of feel or anything like that I think it's like it's pretty

good and really the all the kind of like fan service stuff is what makes Smash Bros exceptional

um but the fan service stuff in this is what makes it cursed because obviously they don't really have

the mileage in PlayStation characters to build a beat-em-up out of it was an interesting attempt

we talked about this before but they had another go now they probably have the characters to make

this work quite well um but uh alas it's you can really see them stretching the roster out and there's

some weird third party cameos that don't really make sense like why is the big daddy in this game

bioshock is not a playstation concern really so this this is again definitely what the list is for

i wondered if like do you think this would hit better if they did it now do you think they've got

more of a roster or do you think it's a case of the playstation character style or or tone just

doesn't fit this kind of game you know like is a fighting game with like ellie from the last of us

that's what is that a bad idea that's probably a bad idea right yeah it's just climbs on the back

and starts like knifing him like shivving him basically it's a bit maybe that's it maybe that's

these characters just can't be made to work together you know getting a hell gas to exist in the same

space as sly raccoon or whatever like those two things just don't work where all the nintendo

characters exist in a slightly cartoony realm even the more serious ones like the fire emden people

they kind of work with mara you can see them you can see it can some connective tissue there which

you can't with you know freaking parappa the rapper and jin sakai for example yeah maybe there is

something to be said for that maybe they don't quite i just feel like i feel like they've got

their sort of first party house in order a bit more now and i always wondered if that was simply

the problem at the time that it was a little bit like at the wrong moment that you know there wasn't

a lot of love for what they were doing so it seemed like a weird sort of swing yeah that's possible

i mean also like uh spider-man's one of their main characters so you can't really see a world

which spider-man's in there yeah i think i agree with that also some of this game's best ideas i'd

already seen in smash bros so for example having a level that's set like a wipeout track for example

but the f-zero levels in smash bros are so good why would you ever really need to do that it just

yeah it was it was a real like it summed up where sony was at the time in like um the end of the

generation just it just didn't they just did not have the juice at that point um but yeah and it

just i think this game just died on its ass um quite impressive that you were able to play between

PS Vita and PS3 though I think I played against I think the multiplayer works between handheld and

console I hadn't really seen that done before but not much else to recommend I would certainly never

say people go and play this so um I think it probably belongs in um in B uh I think it did have

the hype behind it I think people who like PlayStation really wanted this to work but

ultimately no one really cared so I think that's where it belongs um okay good what's the next one

Do we think Days Gone qualifies?

Yes, I do.

It's probably up an SRA, but surely.

That's the thing, because it is massive.

It is successful, and it probably made people quite excited for the console.

But I would argue that in the second half of PS4,

the successful half where everyone was firing on all cylinders,

this was the one which didn't quite fit for me.

Didn't really like the characters, didn't really like the world.

you know the the the kind of freaker tidal waves when it all kicks off that is an amazing trick but

felt like they held it back for too long and uh asked you to sort of trudge through some some quite

boring introductory hours before you get there just a very hard world to live and that isn't like a i

don't think you couldn't make a really great game about this kind of biker culture i just thought it

felt quite inauthentic and bland uh i can't even remember their names uh something saint something

yes Deacon St. John I think that's right yeah and that isn't like a controversial take you know I

know there's there's people who sort of soldiered through this but plenty of people gave this like

five out of tens at the time as well I don't think it's actually like a bad game in terms of either

action or stealth I think all those things work quite well I just felt I felt like I'd seen everything

it was doing elsewhere it really felt like cobbled together from like the PlayStation playbook yeah

if it had come out before Horizon I think it would have been a slightly different critical reception

but there are so many open world games with this kind of with with this kind of dna in in it by

the time that 2019 rolls around and this comes out yeah plus it's been i feel like there's been

so much bad faith stuff from like people involved with the game afterwards like the yeah that one

bloke that one bloke but also the voice actor as well was a bit critical about how press received

it i was just like just shut up like your game has to do the talking for you ultimately yeah that

hasn't like affected me massively um it's found a bit of a second life on pc and stuff as well

yeah that is yeah that is true i just i was i always thought it was yeah a little undercooked

um but it is it is massive i mean i'm not you know that's that's the only reason they kind of

gave me pause so s or a i think this probably is matthew but i'd i'd hear i'd hear out of b

argument as well i'd say it's an s rank so i think it is a system seller despite it being utterly

lukewarm yeah it's an unusual game is the order doesn't have this you don't see like people going

to bat for the order in the same way you do for for days gone yeah for out of that that bizarre ps4

collective that pretends anything's good they're just they're doing that ps5 version of it aren't

they and they've added like an extra mode to it and i think you know so they're giving it a second

go yeah yeah uh great stuff what a real highlight of the generation that's going to be i'm sure for

well i mean the fact is it's one of the games which if you just put it into your ps5 it plays

at 60 frames like Ghost of Tsushima.

You don't need an upgraded version

to get the oomph of it.

That's true for so many of Sony's games this generation.

You don't need to pay for the upgrade.

Same with Horizon. You get the frame rate boost for free

so it's totally up to you.

I think S is fair.

I've got three games in S. I've got two games in the same studio.

Sony Bend have two games in S rank, Matthew.

Between this and Lost Legacy.

My penultimate game

is Halo Infinite on Xbox Series X.

This campaign

was so

it's so flat to play and the multiplayer is really really good but i think we could all agree that

halo has just sort of died a bit as a as an appealing part of the xbox mix and yeah that

i think is a major creative failure by microsoft they must have spent so much money on halo's four

five and and this you know however you just can't you can't deny the campaign in this game just fails

to set the world on fire i think some people some critics did like it at the time and and i genuinely

the multiplayer is really really good i played loads of this with jbls really got into it but

i just hate seeing shit halo campaigns over and over again like why like that's what halo started

with that was what was always good they just open world halo and they completely bungled it the pace

of it's all wrong as an open world game it's just it's just very flat and uninteresting there's no

real reason to do this and then everyone thought they were going to expand it post-release of dlc

and stuff and they just didn't bother in the end because people just didn't like the game enough and

they delayed it by a year because people didn't like how that one that one bloke looked in the uh

that one big big alien guy craig looked in the um in the footage um from the xbox announce i mean

oh man like it kind of killed halo for for a bunch of years then they've sort of sounds like they're

redoing it they've switched engine i think all of their creative leads have changed as well it's all

just comes back to the challenge of following bungee you know and one of the toughest gigs of

all time surely stepping into that world and taking over and the idea of building a studio to take over

and replace that well-established studio culture you don't envy it uh no it's hard that is hard

i think actually like the multiplayer side of things has has been pretty good you know infinite

i liked i thought halo 5 multiplayer was excellent from the the bits that i played early on but uh

you do you are right about the campaign like you need that and it just hasn't been right

it's completely vanished up its own lore hole they're completely obsessed with it as this

multi-stranded multi-format ip rather than let's just get the game right at the heart of it

really just terrible stuff that tv show being cancelled and an infinite being like a failure

i hope that is finally like the we've learned our lesson with halo moment because if not that what

because you had a chance to put on tv had all this money and it didn't work and no one cared

like surely you you must understand the game is why people care not the world you know yeah it's

yeah it's brutal and you know i've interviewed a lot of people from like the newer halo team and

it's like they all just drank you know a lot of them are like microsoft lifers who felt like they'd

drinking the halo kool-aid from afar and then thought oh we can do we can do that we can take

over that and control that and grow that and it just seemed so obvious like where it was going

wrong to me but um they all seem like nice nice people just yeah of course it's just a bummer it's

just a bummer you know yeah it is just feels like a one of those things where i don't know someone

decides you know in a creative meeting these are the pillars of what halo is and gets it completely

wrong from the off and then repeats that mistake over and over again yeah but it also shows that

there are like even with the the biggest game series in the world like there are no sure things

they have to be nurtured and looked after it's very very easy for these things to go wrong they can also

come back though that's you know it is important to note that plenty of things have stumbled in the

middle and then sort of found their footing again so i mean i think gears did that to an extent you

know i think i thought gears 5 was was quite a good return to form after like gears 4 didn't quite

do it for me and judgment like you say it couldn't quite work out what they were going what was going

on so yeah i'm telling you man leave the high level design to me give me like a google doc and i'll

write what the 20 levels should be in this next halo game there'll be a snow level with banshees

and there'll be a fire level that has like four scarabs at the same time i'll design that shit for

you like i i will totally do it there'll be a slightly spooky horror level in a forest we'll

do it man like um get me on that shit and we'll go um yeah i just i just want people who really

love the sandbox nature of halo and understand why it was good and the chaos of it and the chucking

it all into a pot and seeing what happens element of the best set pieces in halo 1 and 3 to really

get it for the next one um because they sure didn't with this one it was just i think like um joseph

satan who came back to help launch this said that there was like no side content in it at all but

like a year before launch when he like rejoined the studio so they came up with the thing of like

how you could go around rescuing unsc troops who are dotted around and stuff because there was just

no reason for it to be open world they hadn't even thought of that and there's so many years to make

it i mean very annoying um such as it is hopefully the next one will be good uh what's the next one

matthew oh well jose saturn also appears in this it's the recourse story for xbox one of course

what a duffer recourse they really leaned into the kind of creative head behind this people who've

forgotten this was the action adventure from the director of metroid prime the writer of halo jose

certain and the creator of megaman kenji inafuni was involved and i'd say no one none of them did

their best work with this game um a very confusing proposition kind of pitched somewhere between

the structure of a metroidvania and you know collecting abilities and skills and backtracking

in a world map opening up over time with those abilities but also tied to maybe the more arcadey

media action that you would associate with inifuni and megaman so there was a lot of like darting and

dodging and difficult platforming challenges and and quite unsatisfying combat where you had to sort

of yank cause out of people with a grappling hook almost feels like a too many cooks thing

in that there were different people trying to make different games and cram them together

for me the biggest disappointment was seeing armature is the the company that was set up by some

like senior members of retro who worked on metroid prime and they'd largely done kind of ports and

and sort of work for hire like that so the idea of seeing them kind of make another metroidy game

again was quite exciting and i just thought it had none of the magic of it it was all kind of laid

really bare how all the interactions were going to work there was no mystery or excitement uncovering

and expanding that world.

It was very like, come back here with thing B to do interaction C

and then this will happen.

If you've played Metroid Prime,

it's so organically woven into that world

how all those powers are going to work.

This had none of that.

Didn't like the characters, didn't like the fictional universe,

didn't like the weird dystopian stuff,

had loads of robot animal helpers.

Tell you what I really didn't like.

Rippling technical issues.

As you went between areas,

two to three minute loading screens.

And in a backtracking game

or a game where you accidentally

go through the wrong door sometimes,

that is absolute death.

This game was a fucking disaster.

I remember trying to cover it

on official Xbox magazine

where they were treating it like

this is your big first party game.

You know, good luck promoting that.

Just what a poison chalice

to be learning how to make

that new magazine

and covering games like this.

Yeah.

see also while we're here

Scream Ride

on Xbox One

which was Frontier's

Edgelord Rollercoaster Tycoon

what happens if you were

building roller coasters

but instead of just building

sort of sensible machines

which are going to run

a financially successful

theme park

you're trying to build machines

which are going to

sort of scare the shit

out of people

and push them to the

brink of death

what the fuck was going on

with this game

when your news section

is like hey everyone

Xbox have clothed down

lion head but don't worry we're getting this scary roller coaster game a really tough era of alexen

oh man i've like xbox one from 2013 to whenever game pass launches is like as bad as it ever gets

for maybe any console manufacturer other than like maybe the last two years of the wii u anything

released in that time felt like it just it bombed like no one bought it no one cared quantum break

Sunset Overdrive

you know

a game I really like

if not for Forza Horizon

it's just a

it's a total

right off

you know

yeah

it's uh

yeah

relatively speaking

this year is pretty

this year of Xbox

is amazing

compared to that

like even if

South of Midnight

is not there

something as good

as Avowed

would have been

killed for

back in

the Xbox One days

so

yeah

yeah

also do you remember

Project Spark

oh yeah

their sort of

answer to

to Dreams

like what if

Dreams but it's

dog shit

that happened yeah like a game making thing except the problem is whatever you made in it it always

looked like a project spark game yeah there was just a certain like texture to its art that even

if it had quite impressive um sort of logic programming and you i think you could film

yourself with connect to like animate the characters and things had some nice ideas but

it never looked anything other than a game that's been cobbled together in project spark

and people kept submitting things and being like someone's made pt in project spark and it was like

some fucking mushroomy forest corridor and you're like no that's the forest texture pack from project

spark all right absolutely crap when you compare it to dreams where those games legitimately look

like they're made in different engine you you could not go these are all dreams games oh that's

some really impressive stuff in that that was really good yeah this is just all right and like

no support no interest i think they tried to renew interest by doing like a conquer texture pack

yes that will fix it yeah that's so cynical

this was just this was a tough time like what do you put on your cover when this is the first

party stuff you're being given yeah this is like i think this is even worse than like the ps3 era was

for sony because even like at their very worst like a year could still have an uncharted in it or

you know like a kill zone something shiny to at least like draw people to and xbox just they

couldn't even get the things that they were making previously well right it was like even halo and

gears had a dicey few years they were trying to like figure it out and just their attempts at new

exclusives good god what like a load of misfires they were at least yet halo was too matthew um but

uh yeah it was um it was not not ideal and uh i imagine it's that those are the kind of things that

make you leave media aren't they those kinds of experiences you're like oh that was really bad

well this this is the environment i was in you know when i left to go and do xbox on and the

youtube channel because i was thinking well i can't genuinely get behind these things in a magazine i

have no passion for them i have no interest in them yeah you know you may as well have a slightly

better wage and just go and do it in an official capacity yeah totally fair all right good stuff um

So does this go into debacle, Matthew?

Is this E-rank?

I think ReCore is a debacle.

I mean, this whole...

I'd almost like to group Project Spark's screen ride and ReCore

as just like a...

You know, it was like three consecutive punches to the face

trying to get this stuff into the mag and working.

I like that.

That's great.

Just three Xbox One games consigned down there.

But they represent...

It's more they represent the Xbox philosophy at the time,

which was dire.

I don't think Quantum Break should live in there with those games.

I think that is better than that.

Yeah, I think as Remedy games go, it's probably on the more lukewarm end.

But I would still play that over the vast majority of games we talked about.

Probably all of them except Days Gone,

I would play Quantum Break over everything that we talked about so far.

Apart from the multiplayer panel.

I think Quantum Break is an A rank.

Okay, well, we'll just chuck that in there while we're here.

why not um i also didn't give halo infinite a rank matthew in the last one i because i was

ranting too much about the the decline of halo but i've put that in b ultimately i think that's fair

multiplayer is good so um yeah so it's a bit of a weird one it really is a game of two halves the um

the the most recent halos that applies to all of them really my last one then is for spoken on ps5

um this killed the studio that made final fantasy 15 a game i really liked and thought off the back

of that wow what potential they've got they they now have built like a really amazing open world

even if it hasn't got that much in it it creates a lot of intrigue they're fun worlds it was a fun

world to explore but it was the fictional universe that really did this one in just the the idea of

being plucked out of real life and into this fantasy world i think just felt very thin but also

just wasn't very nice to play um some of the spell stuff in it is is all right but when you've got a

protagonist who's like irritating enough they have to patch it so she quips less that's like when you

know you've got a bit of a problem um does like look amazing in in that same final fantasy 15 way

of just environments and characters are so so sharp and really kind of showed off what the ps5 could do

on that level but the game part was just so wrong it's just i just wish they kind of made a final

fantasy game instead because i think it would have you kind of could have used some of the same combat

stuff the same magic focus combat um with a little bit of that kind of like parkoury stuff of this

game and 15 have in common um to sort of like distinguish it but man what what an absolute

failure like they must have lost so much money on this it looks like it looks so so expensive

and yeah i mean where is it now like i think i bought it for like six or seven quid yeah and it

came with some coasters or something i mean but i think everyone did that i think everyone actually

owns this game and hasn't played it because they bought it because it was so cheap for a ps5 game

like well i've got if any ps5 game is like a fiver you're probably gonna buy it yeah i have played

this i think i just maybe i just played the demo of this that might that might be what i played but

it was enough to be like uh man why even do a demo of this it's just gonna put people off before

they've even played it everything about it tells me not to buy this and that's what happened you know

it was yeah it was rough yeah i think this probably goes in d definitely duff it's like a

borderline debacle though if the studio closes you know what what's not a debacle about it at that

point in fact fuck it it goes in a debacle it is it goes into under screen right okay um have you

got any more Matthew yeah well the only one the other one I had jot down was uh one two switch on

the switch oh great call yeah you know obviously a bit a bit raw because I've seen people comparing

some of the switch to things to this so I don't think it's quite as bad this was the sort of tech

party game which at the preview event i thought was really good fun because a lot of it was based

around like hd rumble there's like a game where you have to guess how many balls are in a box by

by sort of moving around the the joy con um there's a quick draw competition there's one where you're

milking a cow and like individually those ideas are fine but they were only a handful of them and

this was a full price game even if it had been a pack-in i don't know if it would be particularly

remembered as like an all-timer nintendo project i'd say a lot of the games were as sort of flimsy

and short in their execution as like a warioware micro game so you probably need like 200 things

like this uh for it for it to kind of pass muster uh as it is it just felt like uh you know it took

something which was quite cool the joy cons can do all these interesting interactions and just made

it into quite a sour experience it had that bizarro sequel was it everybody one two switch or

something oh yeah which came out and like did they even say i wasn't following the kind of press cycle

around it but i don't know if they even like sent it out for a review or anything like that it just

just came and went like it was announced in a youtube trailer not even at nintendo direct and

then quickly kind of pushed out uh just a very odd thing all around given you know this at that

point certainly the second game you know switch could make any game any first party game into a

success it seemed yeah um so it kind of justified putting a bit of love into things uh but this was

again classic launch game just not really there yet as an idea also a pretty decent heritage on

on nintendo platforms of like mini games that are big enough to good mini game compilations that show

what the hardware can do in the spirit of wii sports and things like that wasn't it so um yeah

Yeah, but it didn't have, and the worst thing is, is when it doesn't have the sauce, it makes you think, the juice, the sauce?

Anyway, maybe I'm confusing my sauces and juices here.

When it doesn't have the juice, it makes you question, like, the whole thing.

Yeah.

Because, you know, Wii Sports is obviously a great advert for Wii U, probably a stronger advert than, you know, what would eventually come out of motion controls.

And this, you sort of think, oh, is this really, you know, gives you a little bit of buyer's remorse.

which would have been foolish because it turns out it goes on to be an amazing platform but

yeah so neither the source nor the juice and my favorite quote from heat by the way is when time

tom size more goes for me the action is the source so that's um so that's good um i'm still

tired from yesterday no so am i i'm ill and i'm like limping through this um but we're about done

so where's this going matthew d yeah it's not debacle i'd say it's definitely duff though all

right one two switch goes in d and that's us done i had a few more like things i'll just mention

quickly i did think starfox adventure should be in here yeah this is a bit a bit of a hall of

famer for this because it should have been good but wasn't um so that would probably be a b rank i

think um because it's just not really a beloved game by anyone as far as i know um starfox assault

similar deal matthew quite cursed a few of gamecube games that fit that red fall which we played

together and was like the last great xbox disaster really um oh that was sad i mean that's that's

debacle territory yeah you know in that there isn't a arcane austin anymore yeah that really

sucks the developer of prey gone just wiped from this universe that sucks um so yeah those are the

other ones that came to mind any any more you wanted to riff off or you about no you you you'd

got most of them um i feel like there probably are some other switch ones but i i didn't go too

deep into that um i'm just i'm too loved up about nintendo switch at the moment yeah i think that's

all right i think i think honestly brain training would be like an s rank in this as that wasn't good

it was so slight and it was 25 quid everyone bought it but it was no one no one who played ds games and

wrote about games for a living thought that that game was good they could see why it was a success

but it wasn't good you know yeah by all means add it to the list i'm not gonna defend brain training i

have no real emotional connection to it um i guess i just didn't think of it because it was just a

monolithic success on ds no i get you that makes sense so that's very much the episode wrapped up

and a tired man and an ill man have limped to the finish line so well done to us and uh yes thank you

to michael banyabats for the edits matthew uh people know where to get us so should we just

get out of here goodbye see you later goodbye

you
