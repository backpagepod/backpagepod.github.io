Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Sammy Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew, I barely got the words out there. That's how fucking Tuesday night as hell this podcast is. So, so that's good.
I have several things to discuss with you. First of all, how's your tooth hole?
It's healing. I think the stitches are beginning to properly disintegrate. So, yeah, like it's barely a hole.
I don't think I could lose food in there now. It's that level of sealed.
Okay, good. New gump has truly cemented it.
I always want to go back to Ghent and tackle that apple sauce a second time just to show it who's boss.
I'm sure one day they'll make a hard-hitting documentary about your return to Ghent for such an adventure.
Hopefully, Baldur's Gate 3 DLC. How hard would it be to just have an NPC in Baldur's Gate who's like, I got sauce in my hole. Like, I'll record the line.
You could use that sound bite just there.
Yeah, that would be perfect. I mean, I feel like every day, I see a new story for Baldur's Gate 3 that's like, you can play as a turtle that's been alive for 9,000 years and fancies a human woman or so. I feel like every new story is like that, like a bear does this and a squid man does that kind of new stories.
I'm sure it's all very exciting if you're into that game though.
Yeah, absolutely. I'm glad. It seems to be filling the game void quite nicely.
People seem pumped for it.
Yeah, it's going to create quite a lot of comparisons with Starfield being where it is in the schedule, right? Like it feels like that's where this is going.
It feels to me like the battle of like authored, very rightly RPGs versus the, you know, the more kind of procedural sort of scale that Starfield is going for. It's kind of like, which side are you going to be on in the RPG? Or on the side of words?
Or on the side of acreage?
That will also have lots of words.
That will also have words, which I'm sure will be very well written. But you know what I mean.
I do, I do indeed. So that's coming up very, very quickly. So, okay, I've got a couple more things to discuss with you.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to these, these, uh, headlines.
Yeah, so I, we should also talk about the results of the PS3 draft, right? Because that, that's happened. Well, no, I'm not, I'm not here to rub it in your face.
First of all, the poll fucking broke because Twitter doesn't work anymore. So it got to like Wednesday, I think, or maybe Tuesday, and it had something like 360 votes. Then it just froze there the entire week, even though people are still commenting and trying to vote.
And it's like, polls just don't fucking work on there anymore. So that's good.
I thought you were going to say so many people voted for you that your bar burst out the end of the poll and like started hitting other bits of the UI of Twitter or something.
It wasn't that bad. Like it was something like, it was bad. It was something like 36 to 64, something like that.
That's got to be one of the bigger droppings.
No, the biggest dropping weirdly was the PC Gaming Draft 2000s one that we did. That was, I think I had something like 75, 25 for that one. And I didn't remember it being that fast at all.
But this one, yeah, so I did win this. The thing is though, I think that I was surprised the gap was as big as it was because I do agree with people who say that your PS3 had like covered more of the PS3's sort of like DNA than mine did. Mine was a bit more narrow focus.
But I didn't sell it. That was the problem. Like everyone, everyone, no one wanted to vote for me because I made it too clear that I wasn't into PS3.
Well, I should have just lied and pretended to have been a big PS3 head. And then I think I might have done much better.
The best part of that podcast for me by far is when you go, people love it about Ratchet and Clank.
They made loads of them.
But it was a proper sort of like Jimmy McGill at the end of his rope kind of sales pitch.
What else can you say about Ratchet and Clank other than people love it?
Yeah, that's true. Also, I suppose that people were probably, people might be voting for me because I suggest a Demon's Souls to you and therefore redeemed myself in the eyes of the listeners after taking all the Naughty Dog things.
But the thing is, I think people just agreed with you. You played well within the rules. You picked games that were available to you and that I wanted.
Well, it got a good response though, right? People seem to think that was one of our strongest drafts, which makes me think I'll be getting slightly better at those as we go, you know? So that was quite a nice surprise.
I don't know if you had any thoughts on that, on our draft craft?
Not really. Like, I feel like I took some big steps backwards with that one. I didn't play it tactically well at all.
I thought I could get by on my kind of charm and I didn't. It proved me charmless.
Well, that's not true. That's just not true at all, is it? I mean, let's face it, like the you choosing stuff that you had no belief in was part of the fun of that podcast, so yeah.
Yeah, there was nothing I believed in. Like I didn't know the console well enough. I hadn't done enough research because I was very busy to fill in the gaps.
I genuinely thought Puppeteer was OK.
Well, I don't think people were voting against you because of Puppeteer, right? I think that was a pretty, that was like, I mean, what was that for wild card?
That was a researched pick. That wasn't just because it was the only thing. I could have picked Tokyo Jungle, say, but I actually thought, you know what, I quite like what I've played of Puppeteer.
I think the vote might have gone differently if you'd have picked either The Last of Us or Uncharted 2 for your second. I already grabbed those, didn't I? I think MGS4 was a very love it or hate it pick.
That's the thing.
I thought it was more precious than it was. I forgot the incredibly popular series of Uncharted. I got too tied up in our own podcast lore with Metal Gear Solid 4 and thought, oh, that will annoy Sam if he doesn't have it, which just wasn't true.
I was all right.
One thing you are very good at is covering up if you are cross or sad that you didn't get something, which then devalues the game in the eyes of other people. A game becomes more impressive if the other person is like, fuck, no, I can't believe I haven't got that game, which didn't really happen for me. But it did happen for you because I obviously wanted Uncharted.
I should have just eaten my vegetables and picked Uncharted 1. And because it's fine, isn't it? It is fine.
And I picked a compilation of PS2 fucking platformers, which is insane.
I respected your late game effort to burn the entire draft down.
I just thought I'd get all the mascots. I thought if I get all the mascots, that's like a secret win condition in my head.
I think my most show your ass moment of the post-pod discourse was when someone in the Discord was going to bat for Jak 2 and insisting it was good and getting at the angle that maybe Matthew did pick this one right and I was just like, absolutely fucking not. That's not a good open world game. I'm not having that.
So there's a bit of that going on.
I like how full on you are with these people, even though you were absolutely tearing ahead and clearly going to win. You will still be cross about every vote you don't get. That's how completely you believe in yourself.
It's really impressive.
What's weird though, right, is that's only true for the first 24 hours and they stop caring because you can only be emotionally invested for so long. So in the drafts, I'm like, the bigger feeling was, oh, that was a good podcast and people seem to really like it. I'll be talking about it.
That's good. There was a really good suggestion from Ash though that one of us should have picked Valkyria Chronicles. That was an obvious misstep not grabbing that because that was a PS3 only thing that did become a big-ish deal off the back of being on PS3.
So yeah, should have picked that for Wildcard or something. That would have been better than The Beads Game, as you called it, or Indeed Puppeteer. So yeah, but otherwise, Matthew, another successful draft.
Let's get on your home turf next time. Let's do a Nintendo console. Let's do that instead.
We've talked about the DS, haven't we?
I think that's an embarrassment of Rich's, and you can express yourself in lots of interesting ways with the DS.
Yeah, okay, cool. Let's do that in September then, shall we? We'll have that in mind.
But for now, Matthew, one last item of news to get to before we start the podcast. So here's what's coming up in August. You are listening to August 4th's episode, what we've been playing.
August 11th, the old CRPGs episode with Jeremy Peel. He returns, one of our favorite guests is coming back to bang on about some PC RPGs and how much he hates the Japanese RPG. That's not true, that's a joke, but I will ask him about that.
Then the first Excel episode for Patreon subscribers at patreon.com/backpagepod, the best video game levels, volume 2. We've already done volume 1 behind there last year. We're going to talk about some more cool levels and games, so looking forward to that.
August 18th, another big, big one on the free feed and the Patreon feed. The best games of 2016, been a while since we did 2015, Matthew, so I imagine this will be our big pod undertaking of the month, getting them done. August 25th, sadly a mailbag because we're both in Germany that week.
We need to fart out a very quick episode for that week, so we've got something up. So if you want to pelt us a bunch of questions, maybe some things we never talked about, maybe some themed questions about, I don't know, a particular console you like, something like that, something that's a bit different to what's a sandwich you like or whatever.
Or like a very boring question about trends. If it sounds like something that Piers Harding Tubby Rolls would say, then that's not for us.
Oh, I hope he never hears that name without the context.
Sorry, that made you sound like we were slagging him off. We are Piers Harding Tubby Rolls.
That's us, yeah. That's a joke about us being forced to be analysts. But the worst ones are when people are like, I believe quite strongly that this is happening, but what do you think about this thing I feel strongly about?
And I'm like, I don't know, maybe tune slightly more into the takes of the podcast with what you ask. But hey, most of the questions we get are very thoughtful, so I do appreciate them. But yes, if you want to fire a bunch of us, we'll talk about them on that episode.
Finally, August 28th, Patreon subscribers, the big Sammy Holdings, Matthew Castle Productions, launch a streaming service draft for the first time in the XXL episodes. We're going to try a draft episode back there. So me and Matthew are going to select TV shows of some kind and build a streaming service with all the usual fun category bullshit.
What will the streaming service be named? That sort of thing. So that will be fun.
So if you want to support us, £4.50 for the XL tier, patreon.com/backpagepod. Enough of that though, Matthew. This podcast, what we've been playing.
So, I don't know how you're feeling, Matthew, but I'm fucking stressed out by the idea of Game of the Year this year. I just don't feel like I've got a handle on it at all. Where are you at with that?
I was feeling pretty good about it for the first three months. I felt like I was really on top of stuff. And then I only played Tears of the Kingdom for a month and a half.
And I played so much Tears of the Kingdom that I then needed a massive video game detox. So these quiet months where I should actually be filling in the gaps of all these interesting things, I'm actually just reading loads and watching 15 hour films about Oppenheimer. But that's how it goes.
So yeah, now I'm kind of like, I'm behind again somehow. I felt like I was ahead and now I'm behind.
Yeah, I don't think I've got anywhere near 10 at the moment. And I'm just sort of like in my head, I'm a bit worried that with the amount of long games there are this year and the amount of time left in the year and my life as an adult with a job, how is all that going to come together in a satisfying list? I'm not sure it will.
I'm not sure I'm going to have a list that accounts for the fact that a Zelda, a New Bethesda RPG, a Baldur's Gate, a Diablo.
Diablo fucking Street Fighter, Exoprimal.
I'm worried I'm not going to be able to account for all that stuff on top of the likes of Dave the Diver and Dredge and Pizza Tower and a bunch of other smaller games I want to check out before the end of the year. Last year was the first year I felt like I didn't actually shit in the bed with making one of these lists, so I'm determined to follow that up. But also last year was mostly just like 8-hour indie games and God of War Ragnarok, and that was basically all that happened, so it was a lot easier to keep on top of.
Yeah, a bit stressful, Matthew, but we'll see how it goes. Hopefully we'll end up with a list of 10 we're ultimately at least half happy with. Okay, good.
So, should we start off with one of my games, Matthew?
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay, yeah, so Exoprimal from Capcom is the game I've been playing. This game is a dinosaur-themed shooter. You play as part of a squad of mechs across all these different classes, and you basically have to clear out dinosaurs faster than the other team.
It's a mix of PvE and PvP. Now, I know those terms are not very exciting, so what I mean by that is you are playing in co-op for a lot of the time, but then, like, in certain instances, it will become a bit PvP. So, what that means is that you will...
Let's say, like, if you've played the Overwatch mode where you're escorting the thing up the track. I don't know anything about Overwatch.
The level of deep analysis before. You know, the think-think-push-the-thing mode.
There's that mode where you escort a thing and it moves.
It's like a big old trolley.
Yeah, that thing. But I don't play Overwatch. What do you want from me?
They could put a hamster in a ball. I'm not playing that. That's not my problem.
But this is basically... One of the game modes that you end up playing in this is that you essentially clear out waves of dinosaurs as fast as you can. Another team is trying to do the same objectives you are.
You can see their ghosts throughout the level while you're clearing out dinosaurs to track their progress versus yours. Then it will move to a final phase where you have a large objective to complete. In the early part of what I played, it was mostly just escorting a big cube thing along a track.
By standing near it, you'd make it move. Then loads of waves of dinosaurs would attack you. Then you get near the end of the track and you can actually see the enemy team and start fighting them.
Along the way, they would give you this power-up that lets one of your team become like a T-Rex or a Triceratops and invade their game and then just go mess them up when they're trying to move their cube along, basically. You can see percentages at the top of the screen that show you, oh yeah, this cube's this far along, this cube's that far along. Basically, it builds up to these quite tense encounters at the end where one team can have the advantage, but if you suddenly play your cards right, then the other team has been completely wiped and you've managed to move your cube along while they're respawning, essentially.
So that's one of the things you do in this. The thing is that there's a whole bunch of different maps that do vary up a little bit. So the types of dinosaur-based objectives you're doing will vary from like, kill all these Velociraptors, kill all these Pteranodons, kill this one fucking giant Triceratops.
It's an absolute pain in the ass to take out. And then the final objective will start to mix up. There'll be ones that are a bit more like this one where you have to collect a load of these sort of energy, sort of like balls across a map.
And that's like a full PVP one where they'll be like, you basically just fight, you're just fighting the other team to collect as many of this thing as possible. Or there'll be like another one that's basically like a control point mode where there's three control points. You got control two and get the most points and that sort of thing.
So it's a really weird game. It might sound like Live Service Hell to you, right? But it's actually a bit more like EDF cross with Anthem.
It's like there's an inherently fun, disposable quality to the combat in this game. So all the different mechs are quite, they're quite varied actually. So, you know, there's one that's like a beefy dude with a shield who can protect everyone else.
There are like healer mechs as well. The one I've been playing is like a martial arts one that kind of looks like Black Panther from the MCU, but it's like it does lots of like really swift punching dudes and this little kind of like force field attack and things like that. And you can do like quick steps to avoid enemy attacks and stuff.
So they each have their own abilities in the tutorial. You get to try all of them straight away. You can change between any of them in game at any time.
A big thing that Anthem was never able to do much to its detriment. You can switch up what works for you all the time until you learn what's actually clicking. And then you can just pick that and hope that you get sorted into squads with players who have classes that compliment you quite well.
Quite a garbled explanation there, Matthew, but do you have any questions for me so far about Dinosaur Game Exoprimal?
When I originally saw this, the thing I was interested in was the tidal waves of dinosaurs pouring out the skies and shooting them, the kind of left-for-dead horde element of this. Do you actually enjoy the fact that it has that kind of PvE into PvP stuff? Could you see a version of this that's stronger as one or the other?
I do like it, and I do think the mix is actually kind of what's great about it. I was a big fan of the Gambit mode in Destiny, right? You basically have to bank motes into this thing, into this pot, basically.
And then you could invade the enemies' game and kill them on an identical version of the map, and then put them behind and come back, essentially. So it was a mix of PvE stuff as you farm enemies, get these motes, bring them back, and then also just trying to disrupt the other player's game, and I think it worked really nicely. I think it's slightly forgotten, actually, as a mode in Destiny.
I don't think they've updated it much in the last few years, so I don't think it's the biggest deal for them, but it was really innovative as an approach to a multiplayer experience. It's not that intensive. It doesn't involve you being shot in the face every five seconds.
I think that this captures a similar essence of, because the two are blended together, you're not tuning out because it's just PvE and you're fighting waves of enemies where you might just switch your brain off because you know that humans are lurking around and they might fuck you up. So that mix is kind of the secret source to it, I think. So where it doesn't entirely work is, I would say that one thing that was good about Anthem, as well as how it looked, which I thought was fantastic, was the fact that if you combined two different abilities from two different mechs in Anthem, they were quite randomised.
It seemed quite strange how it would work, but you could basically pop off a more powerful attack by having two complementing abilities. It was something they did to encourage you to play in co-op, and it was a cool idea. This doesn't seem to have anything like that, and so there's sometimes the sense that even though you're part of a squad, everyone's just getting on with their own thing, basically.
And other than a healer, whose job is ostensibly just to keep you alive, even though most healers in this game don't seem to know what the fuck they're doing and just go off and leave you to die. That happens a lot in this. They don't actually have that complimenting quality as much.
I'd quite like an attack where there would be a cool animation that clears out a load of dudes, because the Samurai Sword guy and my martial arts guy just did some kind of cool anime pose and killed a load of dudes. I don't really have anything like that. Instead, it's like we're all playing single-player games, but we happen to be on the same team.
There's that quality to it. That's where I think it falls down slightly. It doesn't have that synchronicity between members of your team to really amplify the dinosaur-slaying action.
Have you been playing this with strangers? Because I've heard some people say it's quite a different game if you're with friends or not.
Yeah, I've only played it with strangers. I think I've played about eight hours of it now. I think you have to do 55 games to finish the campaign according to a destructoid article I read.
I've played 27 games, so I'm basically halfway through. They are starting to mix it up a bit. You start to get these weird fusion dinosaurs, where there's an exploding dinosaur and all these weird lab-created ones.
It starts to get a bit less like these were real dinosaurs and a bit more like here's some silly sci-fi nonsense.
That is the other thing I heard was that if you just judge this on its first five hours, you don't get to see it. Actually, it does escalate in quite interesting ways, and there are mad match types. I don't know if people say it does anything interesting in a narrative perspective, but it definitely kind of comes together and like holds a lot of the really weird, cool stuff until later in the game.
That is absolutely true. And it means that the early game asks quite a lot of you. So my first experience of Exoprimal was I was on the same map five times in a row for five games doing the same objective.
And I was like, is this all the game is? And you almost kind of need the game. The game should have something in it that forces it to make sure that the second map you see is not the same as the first.
That is one small thing that would completely change the player's early perspective of this game, I think, is if they saw something different. But because I saw that same map five times, I did consider thinking, well, you know, this is a game past game. I've downloaded it to give it a go.
I haven't paid 60 quid for it. I might just delete it and get on with playing Diablo or Street Fighter or one of the other things that I know I need to play this year. So I decided to persevere and I'm glad I did, because like you say, you kind of need to get to, I don't know, maybe the seven hour mark, something like that, six or seven hours.
And then it starts to vary up what you're doing. And it starts to take you into these story levels where there are loads and loads of dinosaurs spilling out of like a portal and stuff. And I've only just killed a T-Rex for the first time, for example.
Was that cool? Yeah, it was decent. Yeah, it was like, it was pretty massive.
It was, you know, yeah, quite intense. My martial arts guy is always getting fucked up, but yeah.
Does it do the monster hunter thing where like when you've like hurt it enough, it begins to look a bit sad and like pant and get out of breath and stuff?
They don't create sympathy in quite the same way. But you can like get a Triceratops that tumbles over and you're like, right, get him! And you start firing like a beam attack at him or whatever.
So I guess it's doing something kind of similar. But it's truly one of those sevens.
Oh.
I think so. Yeah, it's just, it's interesting. I don't want to go as far to say it's got like, you know, some kind of old PS2 Capcom quality to it.
Because I don't necessarily think it does. But it's quite, I think it's quite a nice version of like what a live service-y thing can look like. I saw one particularly popular YouTuber talking about why has Capcom wasted money on this live service thing that will be gone in like a few months or whatever.
And I sort of like, I sort of get that perspective. But also, I don't think it means you should just never try new things because of like, you know, the future of game preservation or what you think a company should be making or whatever. Like I was quite, I went into it quite open-minded and I think it's quite a comfortable and slick experience.
It's quite nicely presented. The way it shuttles you between the different activities you do is pretty decent. I think, yeah.
If a company like Capcom, which has quite a huge commercial hit on its hands in the form of the Resident Evil series and definitely the Monster Hunter series, they can't take some of those profits and invest it into something new or something a bit different. Who can?
That's the thing. So I'm low to be like, live service, blah, blah, blah, because I think when those games are done well, they can work for you. I've had a, I have no real qualms with Apex Legends, for example.
That's a pretty phenomenally generous game that I've enjoyed over the years. And yes, I'm bummed out at the fact that there are versions of the maps I like that are just gone and will probably never come back. But that is a different discussion to is the game experience actually good and is it fun?
Because I think this is fun. It's just that like, no one who likes Destiny should play this and expect the next Destiny because it's not got that level of longevity to it, I don't think.
It doesn't have Lenny James saying in a very serious voice, you must go and kill the Raptors.
That's not a bad impression.
I've decided to become an impressions guy on this podcast after my triumphant Sean Harris.
Yeah, I think that's a good flex for you in 2023. Yeah, so I think you actually kind of sound a bit more like the brains in Futurama, you know, those floating brains.
But Lenny James does have that slight kind of sadness to him in Destiny where he's sort of disappointed, like, oh, you haven't won, you know?
Yeah, they-
I haven't played Destiny for ages. I'm sure he doesn't say, oh, you haven't won.
Someone I used to play with called him Crucible Dad. That was his name in that game, so.
There's quite a good GDC session you can watch in the GDC vault about writing that character and how it kind of unlocked a lot of what Destiny was for the team.
I mean, I still don't know what any of the writing is in that game. I couldn't tell you a single thing about the story, but.
Well, it's him. It's the little lines he says and, like, you know, giving you a sense of inner life.
Yeah, I sort of like, again, I feel like I'm sort of, you know, I don't think I'm the most intelligent person in the world, but I have my brain switched on it.
I'd say you're top 5%.
Thanks, pal. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, thank you. But it's more like, but I just never understood why I couldn't engage with what Destiny's story actually was.
I was watching it and I was, but I just couldn't, my brain just couldn't ingest it, just rejected it. And I've played Halo and I don't think Halo's got, like, a great story, but at least know what's going on. I can at least pass it.
I have no idea in Destiny.
Now I want to see a video where we take someone who's famous for being very intelligent, like Stephen Fry, and see if he can pass Destiny after a day. That's a YouTube video I'd watch. Can Stephen Fry understand Destiny lore?
Yeah, that's it. Or sort of like, I don't know, both Brian Cox's. We could do one after the other, Matthew, and see how it goes.
Which Brian Cox can relay more of Destiny's complex lore after a day of study?
We should be running, like, which channel would do that?
You run a YouTube channel. You could do this tomorrow.
No, you get those channels which are just able to get, like, celebrities to do those career breakdowns. Is that Vanity Fair?
Yeah, or like GQ do them, I think.
Yeah, GQ's lore off.
You know what the funniest one I saw of that? I think it was GQ. They did, like, Pierce Brosnan's, like, career highlights.
And they did GoldenEye, and they did Mrs. Doubtfire. And then it was like, uh, this other thing. I think they did Mamma Mia as well.
And then I think they kind of ran out.
And then probably whatever he was promoting, which I imagine was the terrible Black Adam.
Yeah, I think it was Black Adam, actually. So, yeah, but I was there thinking, oh, damn, such a handsome man should have been in more films, really. But what can you do?
So, yeah, okay, that's... We'll pitch that and see how it goes. That'll be us transitioning to video next year.
Probably, maybe.
Cox versus Cox versus Codex.
Yeah, I just know them as law eggs because that's what Phil always used to call them. We get to like a bit in Destiny and he'd be like, I'm back in a minute. I'd have to hop over this cliff and do like a ridiculously precise jump to secure this law egg.
And that was a thing that he would do. And he seemed to have a good time. So, yeah.
Okay, this game then, Exoprimal. So it does have cutscenes, Matthew. Again, don't know what's going on.
I think some people are trapped in a dimension or something. Like there's an AI who speaks to you. He's a bit like, we're only doing these dinosaur killing experiments to gather data or something like that.
And it'll be like, oh, next time do better. Kind of like wacky corporate robot thing. There's a lot of that corpo humor stuff of late.
And it doesn't really work for me. Where it's like, it's sort of like, you're having a heart attack. Have a nice day.
That kind of stuff. I'm just like, I'm out on that. It's just the outer worlds is full of that stuff, wasn't it?
And it's like, and Cyberpunk's got it as well, obviously.
It's like Bad Portal.
Yeah. It's like, I think the only problem with that is we've lived to see corporations be far worse than this and far more embarrassing and more sincere about it. They're not even jokey about it.
Like Twitter at the moment, all the adverts I get are for posture correcting underpants. And like the images are so cursed. It's like a man in a baby grow basically having his back pulled back by like some material.
And I'm like, this is how low I'm thought of by this social media platform.
What have you written on there to give it the sense that you're this sort of like gremlin that needs correcting?
Well, the thing is, I think they are right. I think I do hunch over too much. I'm not going to fix it with some underpants.
Do you know what I mean? Yeah, very confusing. Right then.
So I think I'm almost done talking about Exoprimal. It does have like live service stuff. Like it has like a dino survival pass or something.
But you really don't have to engage with that. It gives you a pretty steady clip of like different sort of like mech skins basically. So you can change up how you look.
And there are little emotes and things like that. It's fun, but I just wish it had that next level of... Well, maybe I would get this playing with other humans, Matthew.
Of like, you know, just synchronicity. I just don't see how the different moving parts click together. It just seems like a bunch of people doing a bunch of random stuff.
Every now and then when at the end when the squads converge and there's a big fight, you do see some teamwork pop off and when things start going your way and you have like a hard fought victory, it is incredibly satisfying. Like, the bones of this are quite strong, I think. And it's, yeah, so that's why I don't mind calling it one of those sevens.
I think for maybe how pessimistic some people were about this when it was announced, I think this is actually pretty decent for what it is.
Nice. I just wish it, yeah, I wish it was also included on PS Plus. You know, I'm playing a lot on PlayStation these days and maybe I should just bite the bullet and play it on Xbox.
Well, guess what? It's cross-play, so you can, you have to...
I have to buy it on PlayStation.
Yeah, that's true. You could probably, yeah, okay, fine. We'll take that offline.
I'm sure there are ways I can secure a code.
Our friend Ian, our good friend Ian, who's always getting like fucking hounded for code from us.
Would you be pumped if they did Jurassic Park DLC for this game and had like a Richard Attenborough skin?
Well, I work on a Jurassic. I work for a company that makes the Jurassic Park.
Oh, okay. So you're not allowed to comment on the subject of Jurassic Park licensing. Well, that was a colder sack.
I just broke into a cold sweat thinking how do I get out of this one? So you're just getting clean.
I legally can't talk about that. Come on. Let's think of a different bit of balance.
Does it have any of those little ones that eat Peter Storm air in the second one?
Yeah, it does. I was quite delighted to see them. I was like, yeah, there they are.
I remember you from Jurassic Park 2. Like they all just turn up about like, I don't know, four hours in, I started getting those basically. And they are really piddly.
There's no particularly exciting part to fighting those. And they're just there for visual variety more than anything.
Because they're so small, can they have like even more of them?
Yeah.
Does this have like dinosaur numbers where you were ever like, holy shit, that's a lot of dinosaurs?
Yes, it does. But again, it takes a while to get there. And a lot of the time in the first few hours, you'll be asking why isn't the game firing more dinosaurs at me?
Because when there's an absolute sea of them, and I've had a few encounters now where this does happen, it's pretty fucking cool when that happens. And then you just start doing like, you start racking up these medals, the game kind of like charts your score as you go. And my martial arts guy can basically do this attack where he uppercuts enemies into the air and then like does his little blast attack that knocks them flying from the air.
So you really, you get enemies knocking to each other as well. And there's just a really nice physicality to it, even if the dinosaurs are quite disposable. Yes, it's not bad.
I think you could just ambiently play it while switching your brain off. And I feel like every other game this year needs you to just be like, pay attention, we're doing this now. And like, you've got all these like loot things to pay attention to and all this stuff.
This game just doesn't put those barriers in front of you. It's just like, just help your team. And even if you do shit, the game won't make a big deal about it.
And like, you won't get like, you know, teabagged or anything like that. It's just, it's quite comfortable as well. Get T-rexed.
Let's just go. Okay, that's enough about this game. What's your first game, Matthew?
My first game is Pikmin 4.
Nice, I've been playing this too.
Oh, wonderful. Are you enjoying it?
I am, yes. I've got a take for you though, that you might enjoy.
Oh yeah.
This is the first time I've encountered a video game dog I don't like.
So what do you make of that?
What have you got against Ochi?
He's just a bit, does he need to be in this game? Like I'm not totally sold on the notion of Ochi.
Is he technically a dog?
Well, he's got two legs rather than four, right?
Right. So maybe that's it. Maybe that's like something deep in your brain is like.
This is wrong.
This is wrong. I can only love a whole dog.
Well, that'd be a bit harsh, because I've enjoyed dogs that have three legs before.
Can you have a trophy? Can you pet the half dog? Oh, interesting.
Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm not a dog guy. So maybe like, if anything, Ochi resonates with me because of because he is only half a dog or he's quite undog like in many ways.
I do quite like him, though he definitely he definitely messes with the the difficulty of this game, which is my boring take, which probably needs a little bit of preamble to understand in that basically the big the big thing with Pikmin, which is Nintendo's strategy game in which you control an army of small vegetable helpers is that these games have constantly moved along this slider of how much time pressure you're under and as a result, the kind of strategy game they are and how much you rely on efficiencies, changes with each game and Nintendo have by their own admission wrestled with this balance. There's very, very interesting interview on the Nintendo website about Pikmin 4 where the first volume of it is basically about this, this kind of tug of war between is this is this a game about using a huge army to achieve a lot of things at once or should it be a more kind of chilled Zen experience about exploring this kind of garden world and they flip-flopped on it. Basically, Pikmin 1, lots of time pressure.
Pikmin 2, very chilled. Pikmin 3, a kind of interesting middle ground which I think is maybe still like the best balance of it. So the thing with Pikmin 4 and I should say I have not finished the campaign yet and it's been hinted at in a lot of the reviews that there's a lot more beyond the end credits in this game which maybe answers some of these criticisms.
But I would say what I've played so far is a very beautifully made iteration of Pikmin with some amazing quality of life additions but is relaxed to the point of it almost undermines kind of what Pikmin is about at its core. I've had a good time with it but there is no time pressure in what I am currently playing. You are free to go into a level and achieve nothing where in the previous games you were basically under pressure to constantly achieve things to...
you had to achieve like one or two things in every day or it was going to kind of add up and come and screw you and in this one you can just go in and like fuck around and not really do anything and come back and to me that means you have to set the efficiency goal yourself which you can do and I have been enjoying doing that and I like to try and achieve as much as I can in the day but it is slightly unsatisfying that there is nothing kind of directly recognising that what I am doing is smart gameplay which I don't know if you have run into a similar thing or if where you sit on the Pikmin spectrum.
So I think my only experience of Pikmin was playing the second one with the Wii controls back in the day when they did the Wii Classic of the GameCube games and that always seemed like the most obvious example of it. So Pikmin, what is interesting about it is it is kind of like an RTS where you play as the pointer, right? That's sort of what it is.
You are your character who in this is like a player created dude. You order a Pikmin and this dog thing where to go and then do things for you and the Pikmin can die and the dog can get injured and set on fire, which is tough for that dog and frozen among other things. So yeah, you can't swim either.
He's got a lot of defects that dog, I'll be honest with you. I suppose having two legs and swimming is tough, isn't it? That's a lot to ask of a dog's body with two legs.
So yeah, I see what you mean about the sort of pacing of it. I think that there was a purity to the first two Pikmin games that maybe has ebbed away slightly as they've put niceties around the side. So there's loads and loads of people talking in this, Matthew, which really surprised me.
So much fucking dialogue. I was bewildered by that. Whereas my memory of Pikmin 2 and then when I later played Pikmin was just, you just tell the Pikmin where to go and then you just try and get on with shit as quickly as you can.
Yeah.
So this is a bit more like, oh, we're on an adventure. We're looking for Olimar. He's gone missing.
And, you know, he's like, oh, he's six different wacky characters and loads of writing and loads of talking. I was quite surprised by that. I don't know if that makes...
I don't know if Pikmin 3 had anything like that, Matthew, but it's certainly very noticeable.
It had other characters and it kind of introduced them quite quickly, but nothing like this. They've tried to make it as user-friendly and welcoming as possible, and they've maybe gone overboard by making everything a little bit too explicit. There's just too many systems in place.
There's a lot of collectibles. There's a lot of, not currencies, but different things you're collecting to appease different members of your crew. The crew themselves are collectibles, and then there are other crews you can collect.
This is all kind of padding out this hub world. It's all this sort of packaging, which we're so used to in Western games, which is like everything you achieve in the game is represented at this kind of home base that kind of evolves over the course of the game. It feels quite complete and quite polished and shiny as a result.
It feels absolutely stacked with things to do. And it just makes for a different kind of game. It just makes for a much more relaxing game, a game that gives you a lot of smaller rewards.
Like you're constantly getting better in all these little subtle ways, whether you're unlocking upgrades for Ochi the dog, or you're unlocking new bits of equipment for your little astronaut. So increases health or you get a thing which lets you sort of blow a whistle and bring the Pikmin back to you. And all these little things which kind of make make the game kind of efficient or easier in different ways.
And I think they have this this sense that Pikmin has never fully found like the audience it deserves. And so they've kind of made this sort of foolproofed it in a way by giving it this very handholdy story. But I think from what people have said there's basically a whole other campaign Beyond the End credits which actually is a more traditional time-pressured Pikmin campaign.
So that this in the same way that like Super Mario 3D land on the 3DS the campaign is the training for what unlocks at the end. I think they've done a similar thing here which means it's going to be like the biggest Pikmin ever. I mean people have said that there's just clearly more to this game than any other previous Pikmin and I will say like within it there are things where that more pressured play does like raise its head.
It's got these underground sections which are like little puzzle dungeons but some of them are they call them like uh Dandori? Dondori? Dandori challenges?
I think Dandori.
Dandori which is some term I think it's one of these words you can't really like translate they say it a lot in that that Nintendo interview. These are like timed arenas where you have like three minutes to score as many points as possible there's things in all different directions there's obstacles that different Pikmin types are gonna be able to get past some that they won't and so that's where you suddenly kick into right I'm gonna send the red Pikmin to break down this wall I'm gonna send the blue Pikmin through this water to go and pick up that apple on the other side I'm gonna use these ice Pikmin to freeze this bridge while I send these guys across it and all of a sudden like that's the good shit you know that's the oh yes I am standing in the middle of this like Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer's Apprentice guiding all those broomsticks around and you really like when Pikmin is at its best I think you really do feel like this all-powerful ringmaster just directing all this stuff.
It's a game that's very well-made, and it's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made, and it's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made.
It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's.
It's a game that's very well-made. It's a game that's very well-made.
You know what I mean? Like it's, like you say, the ringmaster experience. It's like that is a 10 out of 10 version of that idea.
It's the best possible version of what that idea can look, sound and feel like. And I would just, you know, I think that the Pikmin formula is maybe slightly underrated.
I think so. I mean, I underrate it myself. Pikmin 3 was the one which really clicked for me because I just felt having the pointer controls on the Wii Remote and the map that let you kind of scan the area, it gave you a little bit more controller power, it gave you a little bit more information and those two things were really, really potent.
And this definitely has all that, like your ability to act quite broadly or in a very granular way are like both contained within the control scheme, like once you get your head around it, which I think is quite elegant. There are a few things satisfying as sending 20 Pikmin to a pile of little golden nuggets and then watching that little line of ants each carrying one nugget back to the base. When it all kicks off and everyone is all acting in tandem and the whole level teams with industry, it just looks so fucking rad and it's like low key one of the best looking Switch games.
Yeah. Yeah, very, very nice looking game for sure. So yeah, it's cool.
I think it's easy to let it pass you by, I suppose, if Pikmin doesn't mean much to you. But this is my first time really properly engaging with one, I suppose. And while I'm like not totally sold on the dog, I think that the pure sort of like auto mechanics level Pikmin has always worked and now it's in a form that pretty much anyone can pick up and enjoy.
There's definitely something to be said for that.
Yeah.
So yeah, curious to see what the end game looks like, Matthew, when you reach that.
The other thing about the dog, which is interesting, which I think layers on top of the lack of time pressure, I do think the dog is hugely overpowered because one of the big challenges of any Pikmin game is once you've got this huge horde, you're moving around with all these things following you and you can bunch them up, but they are still a physical presence in the world that you have to quite carefully nurture. And like, if you go too close to enemies, they'll start getting munched on. Or if some of them accidentally fall in the water, they'll drown and things like that, where the dog's got this thing where when you ride the dog as the astronaut, all the Pikmin jump on and all of a sudden that big cluster that you used to have to worry about is actually a very small, very nimble, easy to control thing.
It's almost like safe navigation mode. Likewise, like the ability to charge with the dog and then all the Pikmin that are sitting on its back will kind of leap onto whatever you attack. Just means that you can kind of like bundle on enemies a lot faster.
So I find the combat definitely in this early part of the game, like way easier than any other Pikmin. Like as long as you've got numbers on your side, you can just rush people and just kill them instantly. Where before you'd have to be quite, well, I'm going to send these Pikmin are good against this enemy type and these Pikmin are good against that enemy type.
So yeah, it definitely needs revisiting. But if it can find a bit of bite to go with these quite beautiful systems, you know, I could see this being quite a high game of the year contender.
Yeah, for sure. I'm definitely going to see it through. I just found myself needing like a bit like Kirby last year, I just needed like a nice Nintendo tonic to write things that were like 40 hours long.
I needed something a bit shorter and easier on me. So yeah, that's it. It's weird that I just I didn't think I would rankle so much of the amount of dialogue in this.
But I think it's just it just doesn't add much. I think like so much of what Pikmin's original magic was, was just the notion of you're a little spaceman and these little dudes are helping you out. And that's all you really ever need to know to enjoy these games.
But this game like has to narrate when like you wake up the next day and your dog is bigger. Or like, just to explain every system and every character has got their own little bit of banter.
You know what happens if you've got a real dog at home? You grow up, you wake up and it's a little bigger and your parents say, look, the dog's bigger.
Isn't that what happens? I suppose there's some truth in that. But I guess I don't usually charge on my sort of like dog into battle while, you know, with a little little dudes also accompanies me.
So it's an image of child Samuel riding around in a dog.
It's a good point about combat, actually, I suppose you could argue it's not that engaging because the combat is just like, like you say, a pile on basically. Whereas there was maybe more of a feeling of risk when you'd send them towards an enemy in the one and two.
There's these ice Pikmin, which if you put enough of those on an enemy, they freeze and they're basically powerless. So like you either bundle everyone at once by sitting on Ochi or if Ochi is not available for whatever reason, he's fucked off, he's fucked off, sniffing another Ochi's bum somewhere probably. That's what that's what Ochi's do, isn't it?
Your first move in any combat encounter is separate out the frozen Pikmin, rush them in, hopefully they'll freeze it on the spot and then you basically like shatter its frozen body like Wesley Snipes in Demolition Man.
All of that is true, but it's all about how it develops, Matthew, so I guess we'll talk about this again down the line.
Yes, we will visit. And do read that interview.
This is good.
It's a weird one where they talk about films and things that they watch and Miyamoto talks about media outside of games, which he never ever does. He's like, we all sat down and watched Tim Burton films, and you're like, what the fuck? Miyamoto has watched a Tim Burton film?
This feels like a huge, huge piece of Miyamoto lore we didn't know about previously.
This is more mind blowing than when Miyamoto was at that Star Fox guy's wedding, Matthew. That blew my mind when you told me about that.
Miyamoto has probably watched and cried at Big Fish.
What do you think he makes of latter day Tim Burton joints, Matthew?
What was that one about the woman who paints all the people with big eyes? I like that Miyamoto is like, yeah, Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns, big thumbs up.
Yeah, that's interesting. What Tim Burton film inspired Pikmin then? What was the reference?
I think it was the guy who drew the Pikmin themselves. He was saying, what was the specific film? Or maybe it was just some Tim Burton sketches or something.
But actually, when you see the concept of a Pikmin, it's like those creepy little sprites sitting on a weird curly branch. It was quite Burton-esque.
I can see that, I suppose. They are quite odd little creatures.
Like the pointy noses, there is something cursed about them. They're not just cute. There's something like the red Pikmin, there is something very off about that pointy nose.
Yeah.
I always thought that.
What about the ears on the yellow one? How are you feeling about that?
Yeah, all of them are a little off. I think the rock Pikmin are just straight up cute, and I'm not like a cute character guy. That doesn't normally speak to me, but the rock Pikmin are just adorable.
That's fair enough. I do agree. I found myself having a kind of like, because when you're controlling these little dudes, and you accept that some of them will just die, and that's what's going to happen.
I found myself having no emotional reaction when they died, and I thought, have I become like a Kurt style problematic figure, where I'm just like, I'm commandeering the natives, and I think that I'm God, but I'm not. And I don't respect the people or the land around me. I was like, is that...
I think it's funny. They talk about it in the interview about it being a funny thing when they die.
Right.
Rather than, they're not trying to pull the heartstrings. That's why the stupid little ghosts pop out, and they're like... That's obviously some lads having a laugh.
Some lads. Okay, good. That was a good little meaty discussion about Pikmin 4, Matthew.
Yeah, it was very enjoyable. Should I talk about... Actually, no, should we talk about your next game?
Because I've only got one more game.
Oh, okay. I played a big chunk of Viewfinder, which is the puzzle game where you take pictures and then by holding the photos up, you can reinstate them as 3D spaces back into the world. Does that make any sense?
Is that a terrible description of that mechanic?
No, I get it. It's just that it helps that I saw it at Summer Games Fest.
Yeah.
So I kind of understand what it is from that.
Yeah, you can hold up a photo, freeze that photo and then like step into the photo. So it's a kind of game where you compress the world into 2D and then you decompress it into 3D to serve your purposes, I guess is the best way of pitching it. Obviously an amazing visual trick, like the actual, the moment you first step into a picture and the game layers up quite gradually.
You don't get to take photos for the first hour or so, you're just picking up pictures. But the idea of you picking something up, holding it and then like imprinting it and it becoming a 3D thing in the world, probably up there with sticking your head through a portal and seeing like your backside going into another portal for the first time. You know, it's one of those, oh, this is instantly cool.
I instantly get why this is impressive. Like you keep thinking about the tech behind it, like how they kind of control and manage this space. You know, I don't know how most games are made, but this one I really can't even imagine when you begin with it.
As an actual puzzle game, I think it is merely OK. You obviously have this awesome power, but what it's largely used for, or definitely in what I've played of it so far, is kind of taking chunks of the level and using them to make paths in other bits of a level. So you can take a picture of a wall, spin it on its side, print it on the world, and then it's a bridge across a gap.
But while it definitely gets more creative than that in terms of the spaces you're navigating, a lot of this game is about taking just shapes and putting them in a different place, which isn't as interesting as I thought it would be. Often they look quite ugly. Often it feels like you're fudging it or brute forcing it a bit.
When you print a photo onto the world, it just cleaves through whatever was there, and sometimes it will be a bit wonky, and because of that, you often put things slightly misaligned so you have to do some clumsy jumping to get over it. So even though you've solved it, there's this slight hint of, have I really solved this or have I just found quite a clumsy solution to it? I imagine they'd say, well, any solution is a solution, congrats.
But it doesn't have the snap of an amazing portal solution, say.
A eureka moment, basically.
Some of them do, but a lot of the times I'm like, yep, that certainly is a bit of a level I took from there and put here. Well done me, I guess. So there's something not very exciting about that.
Weirdly, the bits I like more than any others are where it is a bit more limited and a bit more gimmicky. Like early on when you can't take pictures and you're just given photos, I actually found that a little more engaging. Well, where do I use this photo to solve this problem rather than I can take a picture of anything to solve any problem.
Sometimes there are gimmick objects in the world, like a birthday card with balloons on it. But if you pick it up, hold it and print it on the world, those balloons then like float around the world. They become physical objects.
And I quite like the gimmickry of that. I quite like when this game gives you devices or little things which feel like Easter egg jokes on the side rather than core building blocks of the puzzles and you just get to play with. There's one where you pick up a Tanagotchi, but obviously based on perspective when you print it into the world, it becomes this like ten foot Tanagotchi, which you can then like play with and like interact with and I quite like the moments of magic where a small thing in your hand becomes big in the game and maybe that's a bit like basic of me and I'm not appreciating this clever puzzle game that exists around the outside of that, but it's more the magic of the interaction than what they do with it that I think kind of speaks to me.
Yeah, I think like I think a certain amount of the having to fudge the solutions was inevitable with this kind of game. Like it's almost like it's one thing to actually like do the perspective shift and another thing to like completely nail the puzzle design that layers on top of that effect, you know? So I have some sympathy for the idea they might not have completely got that, you know?
The tool is so powerful. It's like how do you possibly build a puzzle that can outsmart this tool?
Right, exactly.
Yeah, like you can't really. The fact that the camera can clone devices that you might use in other puzzles, you know, the fact that the exit point you're trying to get to, why go to it if you could take a picture of it and then print that picture close to you and just go into the exit that way? You know, like there are odd moments where the whole game seems to flip on its head and you're like, well, actually, none of this means anything.
If a clone of a thing equals the thing itself, that kind of does rewire your brain in quite a fun way. Is it churlish? You mean to be like, but I wanted more, but I did want more.
I wanted more than this extraordinary kind of reality tearing visual bit of genius, but yeah, it seems to capture people's imaginations a bit like it's have, you know, there's been like a rush of people talking about how cool this is.
So yeah, it's definitely not been ignored this year, which is cool.
Yeah, yeah. I imagine it will be on quite a few people's end of end of list things. I'll tell you what, this shows where I'm at, like, playing this game, I kept thinking this would be such a cool mechanic in like an action game, where you could like rewrite the DNA of the levels or even like the idea of like taking an object, holding it up and then like printing it to kind of like cut a man in half because you basically cleave through any matter with the photo.
So there's bits in this game where you pick up like a pack of playing cards and you can print these giant playing cards. As a visual thing, I could really see a game where you're like a first person shooter, you've got a gun in one hand, but like whatever object you hold in your other hand, you can like print it into the levels as like an offensive thing or as like an escape route or something. Like that's, that's what I'd like them to do with this very delicate puzzle mechanic rather than you explore a load of Zen gardens while these like gramophones tell you about, you know, the backstory of all these people with like deep traumas.
Like, I'm just an asshole who wants to like kill people with a giant pencil.
I'm sure many people are wired the same way, Matthew, but I'll have to make sure I pick this up then at some point and give it a look. It's too curious and I did not to have a look.
So yeah, for sure. Yeah, I'll definitely finish it. I think I've got like another hour or so to go.
That's all right. Quite interesting publisher, Thunderfall. They're like the SteamWorld people and they did, that game Somerville last year was a bit like Inside and Planet of Lana this year, which is also a bit like Inside.
So yeah, some quite unusual sort of like Indie world.
This is not like Inside.
No, very much not. And yeah, but like kind of like Indie Plus sort of games, I guess, that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah. Interesting, Matthew. So, okay.
So my last game is quite weird this week. So I've been playing 1998's Parasite Eve, a game published by Square before it became Square Enix. Developed by Squaresoft, I think like a collaboration between Squaresoft Japan and their Hawaiian studio at the time, their USA studio.
So quite a weird one in that it's based on a novel that was apparently like partly responsible for the rise of the resurgence of interest in Japanese horror in the late 90s, Matthew. And this game is, I think, like a relatively loose adaptation to it. I think it's like a sequel to the novel.
I think that's the kind of approach they've taken. And then I think that, because you've read the novel, right?
I actually I haven't read it yet, no.
Right. Yet.
I own it. I bought it for a huge amount of money. I just haven't got to reading it yet.
No, I think actually, like I think what happens in actually is that they, because you meet a Japanese character in the story, I think that it maybe alludes to the idea of what was happening in this game, which is set in New York, has happened before in Japan. I think I think that's what how they've approached it. So how best to describe this?
So basically, you play as Aya Brie, I think that's how you say her name. She is a 25-year-old NYPD cop. She is goes to an opera on Christmas Eve with this lame ass kind of like butthole date basically, this dude who's a bit of a bit of a wash and this woman comes on stage and everyone in the audience dies apart from Aya and her date runs away, leaving her there and then you go and investigate what's going on with this figure called who's calling herself Eve but also is maybe related to the to this actress who is part of the the opera that you went to.
It's like some kind of like dual identity element to it I believe and the whole thing with it is some weird idea of how mitochondria is okay how best how do I best explain this so that would be a complete nightmare basically they can speed up the rate that human cells move in order to like make people spontaneously combust that's kind of like a okay a big part of the the plot here and that's kind of what happens to the in the opening scene like everyone in the audience burns alive it's quite gnarly as a it's shown with the old classic sort of square soft like great CGI sequences as well there's a bunch of those in this game so that helps bring bring it to life yeah so you got that backdrop and you're trying to investigate what happened to those people or why they're when this like Eve figure goes around or why people are dying in this fashion why she's able to like she melts a load of people later on as well she just seems to like fuck with people's cellular structure and Aya is trying to stop her Aya and like the rest of the NYPD and of the 17th precinct in Manhattan are trying to stop this from happening so what it amounts to is this vogue It's a whole horror game where you have all these really beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds in the old PS1 Resident Evil style, right? Like gorgeous looking interpretations of like famous New York areas, like Carnegie Hall, for example, or like Central Park, or like the Chrysler building. Something like a pop culture vision of New York, I would say, like quite stylized, doesn't necessarily, it feels like it's made by people who have been to New York, but not lived there, I would say.
Like it feels like a, I get that kind of vibe from it. But what's interesting is the combat is a bit more in the Japanese RPG realm. So it's a sense of being real time.
You encounter these enemies, like really strange enemies from like these weird snakes and like birds, and like this really fucked up looking polar bear thing with like part of its flesh missing, all of these weird mangled animals. And you can put, when it's ready, it's your turn basically, like a bar's charged up. You pause the action, select a target, and then AO will like shoot the enemies.
And what it actually, the combat is, it's kind of like Japanese RPG asteroids or something, because there's a lot of like dodging area of effect attacks in this. There's a lot of like an enemy's gonna like fire an electricity attack at you, and you need to just be out of the way when it happens essentially. So the reason I started playing this is it's always been a curiosity of mine.
Like it's kind of one of those games that when Square made a load of money off the back of FF7, they just seemed to green light loads of like random shit that some of it was good, some of it was bad, and you know, some real cult classics in there. And this is definitely like one of the more interesting ones in there. So I had this on PS3 and I thought I'd give it a proper go.
It's not that long, but it's like a relative to Resident Evil and Final Fantasy at the same time, which I think is what makes it interesting. It's like a Tetsuya Nomura character designs, but it kind of like superficially looks a bit like you're playing Rezi. It's not that scary, but it is quite weird.
Like some of the enemies do get a bit fucked up and gnarly, and it's got some good bosses in there as well. And I'm quite enjoying it. I think maybe the vibes, Matthew, lots of great music in this.
It just feels like late nineties as fuck in a really good way. And it's a kind of survival horror flavor you don't necessarily get anymore. Do you have a take on me playing Parasite Eve?
Is that strange that I've done that?
No, no, this makes perfect sense. It makes me feel bad that I spent, I did spend a huge amount of money on a copy of the book and I, yeah, I just haven't got around to reading it yet. I bought it in a auction because I was worried that I wouldn't have a shot at buying it.
This was at like the height of my Japanese mystery fiction mainly. It's not even really mystery fiction, like you say, it's sci-fi. So yeah, it's kind of absurd that I did that given that I have absolutely no connection to the game itself.
It's a game that I've only ever seen in screenshots.
Right.
Like this is very much a, oh, that looks cool on, in Games Master. Like games like this and Fear Effect, I kind of grouped together as sort of like things I can't have that look adult on other platforms and exciting. There's sequels to this, right?
Yeah, that's right. There's another sequel on, there's a sequel on PS1, Parasite Eve 2, that did actually come out in Europe. The first one didn't.
And that I believe is more of a trad, Rezzy style survival horror game. And then there's a quite unusual third game on the PSP called The Third Birthday, which is-
Right, that's what I was gonna ask. Was it that game?
Yeah, that was just a shooter, I think. It wasn't like there wasn't that much to it. But yeah, so it's kind of had an extended life as a series, but it's not like widely available now.
And it's hard to tell if Square would make this available again. I think they should. I think it's got quite a lot of novelty as a series you could resurrect.
But it's also one of those games series that I think has probably had its reputation outsized by YouTube videos, mythologizing how cool it is. Because I think most people would find the combat quite antiquated. It's like a Japanese RPG where you are a one-person party member.
So you kind of need to be doing more than one thing at once, but the game doesn't let you. So you basically got like a version of spells you can use. They got like a PE meter, and you can basically use that to heal or cast like other kinds of spells, offensive attacks, barriers, that sort of stuff for use in combat.
It's got like a gun upgrade system. If one gun's got like a certain upgrade, like it's more powerful firepower, you can get another gun to absorb it. So it gets the extra firepower bonus and things like that.
It's quite deep for what it is. It's only apparently only about nine hours long. That was also part of the appeal to me.
But yeah, an enjoyable late 90s artifact, Matthew, I'm glad I gave it a go.
Why did you jump into this one again?
Just I was in a bit of an odd mood on a Friday.
You suddenly had the words Parasite Eve pop into your head.
Well, there's a few other things to it. It does actually aesthetically look like Final Fantasy VIII quite a lot. So it's got a world map where you select bits of Manhattan to go to basically, and that looks like the Final Fantasy VIII world map basically.
It's like New York via that prism. I think a game that has that very particular aesthetic was quite appealing to me. So that was part of the reason.
It's one of those things I've always thought about playing, and I never just sat and gave it a go. I just thought, you know what? I just want to play something that's not 20 hours long.
I'm just going to play this. So yeah, very bizarre.
Just looking up on Wikipedia and laughing in the development section of this, where it says, the game was produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi. Development lasted roughly two years, including the pre-planning phase. Sakaguchi created the story outline, not watching any movies, so he would not be influenced by them.
Which makes him sound like he's just so easily guided. Like, I must not see a single movie, lest I be influenced by it, and it comes into Parasite Eve.
Yeah, and so I think Aya is actually named after his daughter as well, Sakaguchi's daughter.
That's the thing, he's so easily influenced, he just looked at his child and took her name into the game. He's probably right that he didn't watch any films. There are some cool films coming out in the mid-90s that can be folded in.
Yeah, it doesn't really feel like anything else, to be honest. It's sort of like, yeah, there's just this opera thing, you think there might be some kind of weird, I don't know, maybe semi-erotic connection between these characters who seem to be intertwined in some way. Certainly, if you're watching horror fiction now, I think you would lean into that sort of thing, but there's no subjects at all like that.
It's just a bunch of stuff happens. Eve does something terrible, and then alludes to Aya being special in some way, and then they have a fight, and then the same thing seems to happen again the next day. That's what the story's been so far.
It feels quite random and strange, I suppose.
Does it have more or less story than Pikmin 4?
I think it's got less, you know. I think it's got less dialogue than Pikmin 4. There's a bit of, almost like bookends, the gameplay sections with all the dialogue you need, and then you're dropped into these levels for a bunch of these battles in the search for your objective, and that's it.
But now I think Pikmin's got a lot more. Pikmin's got lots of wisecracks to confront you with.
Is Ochi fucked up enough to cut it as an enemy in Parasite Eve?
I actually think he could, yeah. I don't want to rag too much on Ochi for just having two legs. That's not his fault, you know what I mean?
And that's okay. I have two legs. I'm fine.
Yeah, so that's Parasite Eve, Matthew. I will complete it and talk about it again at some point maybe.
I'd love if one of your Games of the Year was this strange horror game from 20 years ago.
If that happens, I've truly failed the assignment on Game of the Year. So, fingers crossed it doesn't get that bad and I can get around to some Dave the Diver before the end of the year. So we have one final game to discuss, Matthew, right?
Yes, I've played the first episode, the only currently available episode of The Expanse video game, which is the glorious, question mark, comeback of Telltale Games, or rather the strange, reanimated corpse of Telltale Games. They obviously went, like, Mega Bust about five years ago. And this other kind of fund, some fund, whatever that is, kind of bought all their IP and, like, the rights to their name and now trades as Telltale, so it isn't the company from who made all those games, it's kind of the rights to all those games owned by this other company.
This game's actually made by Deck Nine rather than Telltale. I only say this because for some reason I've had a lot of Telltale stuff in my Twitter feed the last few days with a lot of, like, we're back and Telltale are back and it's the glorious return of Telltale and you're like, not really, like, they didn't make it and it's also that company doesn't exist anymore, so let's just set that straight. Do you have much love for The Expanse?
I've actually never seen it. I watched the first episode and it was quite intense. There's a lot of plot.
And I know it's one of those shows that everyone says the second season is the one where it's properly, it properly takes off.
Yeah.
And so, and then it, then it, like, moved to Amazon, didn't it? And I think it's Jeff Bezos was, like, a big fan of it. But it does seem to have a big reputation.
It's maybe, like, a Battlestar Galactica style reputation, right? As being, like, quite complex political, kind of, like, sci-fi thing.
But you have to, kind of, get over this initial hump, which we never did. Like, we've tried several times to watch this. I think I've watched the first two episodes about three times now, and...
I'd bounce off Thomas Jane wearing a little hat, and speaking in his, like, made-up Mars speak, or whatever it is. If you're not into, like, space slang, there's lots of this in this. So, buckle up.
On paper, though, you know, a good match for what Telltale do in that, you know, it's a universe in which the kind of personal and the political are often at odds. There are lots of different hierarchies. You have the galactic scale of what's going on.
You have military hierarchies on board ships of, like, who you answer to. Then you have personal relationships with people, and very rarely are all those things going to be aligned, which is the kind of perfect storm, I guess, in which to explore a big kind of moral conundrum maze of the kind Telltale are known for. I found this first episode very underpowered, though.
You're the exile on a ship. The first act of this game kind of introduces you to the crew, where you basically do a lap of the ship, and you meet everyone, and you instantly have to kind of make a call on all these people you meet. You don't know the context for any of them.
Each of them are basically doing something weird to give you, like, a moral decision of, like, oh, shall I punch this stranger in the face or not? So you're having to make these decisions, because you can't possibly judge her right or not. Maybe if you've watched the show, some of this will resonate more, and that will mean more.
But as a relative outsider, I found that quite baffling. The second act of this is you go and scavenge this ship, and it becomes this huge, like, third-person spacewalk set piece, where you float around this, like, devastated carcass of this warship, going into, like, little rooms and cracks in the hull to collect bits of salvage. It is odd that the meat of this game is this, like, third-person action set piece, where you don't really interact with anyone.
You communicate with people over your radio. And it's, like, probably a step up in production values from what you'd expect from a telltale game, which were always very, sort of, linear. But at the same time, I don't really know what they were going for with it.
It's, like, a big, bland bit of Dead Space. Like, the outdoorsy bits of Dead Space. Really odd choice.
Like, I don't really know what it's meant to say, other than maybe scratching, like, an expanse itch that you want to see this scene play out. Or maybe it's, like, a big bit of fan service and, like, people really like spacewalking scenes in this show. I don't know.
But for a studio that sort of sells itself on its storytelling strengths, I think it's quite odd that the story basically fucks off for the meat of this.
It sounds like it maybe hasn't done it favors being episodic and maybe it could have just used being, like, a six-hour game that is, like, is tight and cool and, you know, a nice addition to the Expanse fiction but doesn't feel like it needs to prolong the experience for the sake of it. Yeah.
I just don't know if I was gonna bring back... If I was gonna try and sort of be the new Telltale, I don't know that I would invest so much in, you know, for want of a better word, open world bit of level design. You know when you get those, like, wide open bits in, like, the Uncharted games where it lets you drive around in a Jeep?
Yeah. And it kind of gives you the impression that it's a much bigger thing than it actually is. It's like one of those set pieces stuck it in the middle of a very, very short Walking Dead-style episode.
That is weird.
It looks good in the trailers, I guess, because you're like, oh, wow, like you're actually floating around space and you get to explore. You don't get to do that in the other games, but that is just not what I want from these.
I guess it'll be interesting to see if they try anything like that with the subsequent episodes.
Yeah.
Yeah. I guess now you've got the whole lot, right? So it's going to roll out and you'll get the next episode.
Yeah.
It had classic episode four of a Telltale Series energy. They kind of get you in with a three hour opener, but by then the budget's inevitably running out. So they're kind of like, fucking book it.
Right, right, right. Interesting. Yeah, it's a weird thing for me because I don't know if they could have made any game that would make me, that would seem appealing to me.
I think just because the Telltale thing firmly feels like a thing that came and went to me, like it happened.
Right.
And then I just, it was really sad how it ended, you know, for the staff there. They had a terrible experience and I felt, you know, enormous sympathy for how terrible that experience was because it seemed quite a lot like mismanagement from the way it was reported.
Yeah, that's it, you know, it's difficult. I think one of the Splinter Studios is the one behind that Star Trek Resurgence.
Yeah, which I do want to play.
Yeah, I downloaded that actually. My original plan was to play this and that to do like a sci-fi show versus sci-fi show head to head, but I only played The Expanse, which is why I haven't got very deep thoughts on it.
Well, what is Pikmin 4 if not a very intense political space opera, Matthew? It's got a spaceship in it.
Yeah, it does have similarities. Things are slightly tenser on the crew of the Artemis in The Expanse, but not by much.
It's got that going for it. Okay, good. In which case, those are the games we are going to discuss this episode, Matthew.
Shall we take a quick break and come back with some list of questions?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So we have a bunch of list of questions to go through here. You know, me and Matthew fucking love doing that.
So got a few here from-
Very old style start to this.
No, it wasn't meant to sound that way. We do appreciate the engagement. If you'd like to send us questions, by the way, backpagegames.gmail.com, you can email us.
You can also drop them into the pod questions bit of our Discord. I don't really promote the Discord enough, I suppose. Like, if you want to join the Discord, you just have to go to twitter.com such backpagepod and there's a permanent invite to the Discord there.
I know it's like, it's one of the suggested searches for on Google, which suggests that people are struggling to find a little bit. So there you go, a little bit of promotion there for the Discord.
On Google, it's like, how do you join the backpage Discord?
Well, it's like, if you type in backpage podcast, like the Discord comes up. So it suggests that people are seeking out.
Oh, so if they were doing the wired, auto-complete interview, it would be backpage pod. And then they pull off the bit of paper and it just says Discord. And then we're like, well, what do you want us to say?
We've got Discord. And they're like, we knew we shouldn't have interviewed these two podcast nobodies. We had Christopher Nolan and Robert Downey Jr. on last week.
What the fuck were we thinking?
That's so specific, but very enjoyable. So yeah, so that's how you can find the Discord. People are very friendly in there.
I was sort of like, yeah, I think it's going quite well, the Discord these days. It was like a few hairy moments along the way, Matthew, but I think we have endured.
There's a few hairy moments every day.
Pretty much, yeah. It's up and down in there. I think like their new version of the Mission Impossible 2 is good thing, by the way, is Alien 3 is good, which is like, we haven't even announced an Alien episode yet, but I alluded to the possibility and now that's a thing.
They're like the Velociraptors trying at the fence to find the weak spots. They're constantly just trying to see what annoys us by throwing out these little opinions and when they find it, they absolutely ride it.
Yeah, absolutely. Now I just think of Velociraptors as enemies in Exoprimal, to be honest.
Yeah, you're not scared of them anymore.
No, they're a piece of piss bait. You could just, I can kill like 40 of them in about a minute. Okay.
First question.
It's like that scene where she turns on the power, except a hundred Velociraptors come through the wall.
Yeah, I've not, you know what? I've not seen the original Jurassic Park in Seoul. I don't think I've seen that.
I thought you were about to say, I've not seen Jurassic Park and I was, I was going to be truly shocked.
No, no, I don't think I've seen it since 1990 something. Like, I don't think I've seen it this century. So that might be a fun thing for me to do at some point.
Okay. So the first question from the list, as we finally get to it. I once turned my Xbox off because my friend was killing the Marines in Halo Combat Evolved.
What's your most pathetic gaming moment? That's from Zach. Now, I couldn't work out if we had answered this one before Matthew.
All our listeners, apart from Angry Kurt, seemed to think that we hadn't. So I kept it in the podcast, but Kurt seemed to think we had. So I don't know if he's right, but I do have an answer to this I might have talked about before.
What's your answer to this?
I mean, there's a few games that I never played again with certain people, which I guess is about as petulant as I got.
Right.
The last game of Smash Brothers, I think I played with my friend Mark at secondary school. We bet each other we could beat each other, and he only ever used the downwards Pikachu lightning, which is so inferior. If you're going to lose to anything, that is so infuriating to lose to.
Losing and then swearing off the game, but it's not quite as exciting as just being very upset about the killing of fucking NPC Marines.
I just like the idea of you're not obeying the rules of war and then just turning it off at the wall or something. Just like, we're not going to do that anymore. I've got so many pathetic gaming moments.
Oh, well, this is good.
I just worry I've talked about most of these before. So the one I do remember is like, leaving a Call of Duty 4 game. And back in the day, I think like when that, when a player did that halfway through a match, it would break the game.
It would like pause for a moment and not realizing that. I imagine a colleague was in there and he messaged me going, you fucking loser. Which was quite pathetic.
So, you know, it's good to cop to that and acknowledge that I can be very petty. Thing is, in general, I like, I get less petty and less pathetic about these things with age, but when I was younger, I was definitely more invested. That's just like a boy thing, I think.
Just like, you just get more hotheaded about stuff and irrational about things. I definitely had like one friend who I fell out with like every week and him losing in a multiplayer game was one thing that could happen to arise from that. Us maybe arguing about our favorite characters from a game, we could like fall out over that as well.
And I felt like he had, he banked pathetic moments for sure, that guy. Very similar to your Pikachu story, Matthew, but that was fair enough. Smash Bros as well, I think I had the same thing my friend Andrew in that down fucking B Kirby move in N64 one, like what a piece of shit that is.
It's even worse in Melee, isn't it? It's just that the Kirby is just so powerful in that game.
I guess a sort of a sort of petulant moment is when one Christmas my brother got Ocarina of Time and I got Pilotwings 64. And just because Pilotwings was mine and Ocarina was his, I definitely went through this initial, I don't like Ocarina or Zelda face because it was Alex's. So there was a bit of that, which is obviously ludicrous, like this thing that everyone was excited for, that I was excited for, but because it didn't belong to me, I was like, no, I'm not a Zelda guy.
That was quite petty.
Right, yeah, but kind of fair enough. I sort of get it.
Is it?
No, not really.
Imagine being like, oh, who wants to play that babyish bullshit playing Pilotwings instead, which is good, but I mean, come on, it's not Ocarina. That is properly cutting off your nose despite the vase.
It is a little bit, yeah, but sort of like, you know, I don't know if it's any worse than the current sort of we don't talk about it situation between us on Tears of the Kingdom, Matthew, where it's like we have landed so far on the other end of the scale. Does it seem like I'm being petty about Zelda? You know, with that in mind, but yeah.
No, that's fine. Like it's, you know, that is what it is. I get much more cross about occasionally I make the huge error of going into the Tears of the Kingdom bit of our Discord and it's...
I've never been in there.
Oh, there's some fucking like lunatic takes going on in there. And it's like people who spent so much time with something, they've got so granular about it. They're picking up on this little thing going like, oh, I really don't like this little thing.
And they've just lost all sense of perspective of like what the grand scope of that game is. I just can't even type anything in there. I get so cross about the number of bad takes.
Bad takes, I mean, simply people who don't agree with me.
Okay, like the big, my big pathetic moment was breaking my friend Andrew's PS1 with my fist while it had discreia front of MC8 in it because I'd lost a card in Triple Triad, the fucking random rule. That's like, I can't remember if I've coped that on the podcast before or not.
No, I've heard you talk about the random rule. Well, I always sensed there was something more there.
I had to build up to it, you know what I mean? I had to wait 138 episodes, Matthew, to get to the point where I felt like I could discuss this and many more XL and XXL episodes. So yeah, I did break that and I had to replace it.
It wasn't too expensive. It was like 20 pounds. I know it was more than that because I had to get it from the MC8 as well.
It was certainly not costing me about 40 quid, that. And it was a good lesson in not losing your temper. But I'd be lying if I said I never lost my temper with the game again after that.
But the random rule was so unreasonable and they should have changed it for the re-release they did a few years ago. That they didn't is on their conscience at Square Enix, I think.
But you're still friends with this Andrew, so that's...
Oh yeah.
He obviously forgave you.
Well, the way I presented it was he didn't... I was like, okay, I think actually, no, I think it was my copy of Final Fantasy 8 anyway, not his. So that was, it was something I had to replace for myself.
I think I just said to him, I broke your childhood PS1, but it's okay. Here's another one just like it. And I presented it to him.
And he was like, okay then. And then we never talked about it again, really. So he was fine.
He still had a PS1 that functioned. So yeah, that was quite pathetic, really.
I think the reason we can do this podcast is because we don't play a lot of games together. Because I think we would have probably got under each other's skin if we had.
I don't know. I wish we played more games together. Because I really enjoyed when we, even when we played, what was that vampire game that came out this year?
Redfall. Redfall.
Even when we played Redfall, I had a good time. You were just very enjoyable to ambiently spend time with on voice comms, I think. And Halo Infinite was like that, too.
You were just so much fun on that. If we were competing, maybe. But when we're in co-op, you're good fun in co-op, I think.
Oh, well, that's good.
Yeah. Okay. What's the next question, Matthew?
Hello, both. A mystery benefactor has granted you unlimited funds to buy the names slash rights to one of the many defunct UK games mags to run his UC fit. However, you must actually try and run it at a profit.
Which mag do you choose and why? And what is your strategy to breathe life into the specific defunct title and to run it profitably in the challenging market of mags today? That's from Koig.
Tough one. I think the future of print is probably in high-end product rather than low-end product. So I think launching a mag that maybe feels like a mag from 20 years ago probably isn't the way to go.
I think a profound waste of time and Lost in Cult's lock-on stuff alongside Tune and Fairs from Software Books that there's all like, what's the one that's kind of based on Bath, Matthew? That's quite a bitmap bro, right? Is that what it's called?
Bitmap books? That's it, bitmap books, sorry. And so I think that is kind of the angle you have to take.
You have to go high-end, get nice paper stock, that sort of thing. And so I probably, with that in mind, bring Games TM back. What would I do with it?
I'd probably make it mirror the output of this podcast a bit, be like 50-50 new stuff and retro stuff. Games TM did have quite a big retro section compared to other mags. It could take up about a third of the mags sometimes, or maybe more like a quarter.
Would you bring in Ash Day onto staff?
Definitely. I mean, he probably wouldn't leave his lucrative job at Team 17 to do it, honestly. So yeah, I think I would find it just too stressful to work in print media again, though.
It's actually the living inside the timeframe thing again. I couldn't do as much, rather than the actual making of it. It's like you're living your life every four weeks and being like, I can only take a week off in these other three weeks that are not Deadline Week, basically.
I just don't think I can do that anymore. I need to live on a different cycle. But I'd do that.
I'd have Games TM. I'd have no news section. Probably no previews either, just like features, reviews and some fun bullshit sections and making ofs and that kind of stuff.
But that's kind of what came to mind is like what is, I guess, what is like a non-edge premium-ish brand and Games TM is kind of that, I suppose. So what about you, Matthew?
I imagine people would expect me to say NGamer or Nintendo Gamer as I do love it. But I don't know, probably like Games Master, probably something multi-format just because I want to be able to get free games from all the publishers.
I'd consider that angle.
That is the main reason I would bring a magazine back is just to kind of get me back on those free game lists from all the PRs. So, I'd run it like super cheap, proper toilet paper. It basically needs to function as enough of a magazine to get me on the list for the free games.
But what it actually is, I'm not as bothered about it. I just would like some free games.
I've definitely mentioned this before, but I remember Simon Miller when he still did NREV stuff. I'll keep getting them mixed up, sorry, it's been that kind of day. When Simon Miller did NREV stuff, I think it was some kind of Nintendo mailing list where they just sent you promo copies of every single Nintendo game.
So he'd just be like, running X360, getting all the good 360 games and then getting the DS games and Wii games as well. I was so fucking jealous of that. So yeah, I think now you've convinced me, Matthew, the reason to go back into print media is not to make a high quality product, it's to rake in some free copies of computer games.
So yeah, I mean, like, I don't know, I like actually running a thing at a profit, I mean, that's very difficult. Like if I wanted to sell loads of Games Master, I would bring it back. And for the first issue, I'd give away a switch on the cover of every magazine.
Seems reasonable. High, high outlay. But you know, you've got them, haven't you?
It's very much from the school of thought of the Game Pass service that gives you eternal life and pick and mix.
A Back Page, roughly.
If you just give in. If you give people a good enough gift, everyone will buy it.
Right. Yeah. I can't prove you wrong on that.
So yeah, fair enough.
And then everyone, like 20 years from now, there'll be a podcast, so like, God, do you remember that issue of Games Master, they gave away a switch and it sold five million copies?
Yeah, that's, okay, bold, a bold return to print media for Matthew Castle.
Designing a cover, though, which can have a switch stuck to it. The amount of cover space you'd lose to that. That's tough.
Yeah, that's it. I suppose, like, as well, wouldn't most of your most engaged readers already have switches, Matthew? Or I guess they can have a spare switch.
And they'll be like, oh, no, I've already got one of those.
No, that's fair enough.
They're like, oh, five pound switch. Oh, no, thanks. I've got a switch already.
That's good. What do you think about the part of the question that says run it at a profit? So what's your sort of plan there to break even on that?
Because this is so like, it's such an insane plan that I think people would be like, I'm going to buy this for 100 issues after this just because what they did was so audacious. I will always love this magazine. Well, the thing is you get them in with the switch and then you keep them subscribed with like my amazing editor's intro, not the rest of the bag, just the intro.
I hit you up front with that and you're like, wow, if this keeps up, I'm definitely subscribing.
It's one of those classic sort of like collectible magazine things that come with like a little toy car or something where it's like first issue 299 comes to the Nintendo Switch. Next issue 1499 doesn't come with the Nintendo Switch.
Yeah, but that doesn't work. You need to give away bits of the Switch. First issue 99p comes with the Switch stand.
Next issue comes with the rest of the Switch is 500 pounds. And people are like, oh, well, I did get the stand for 99p, so I should probably buy issue 2. Also, that editor's intro column was hilarious.
Issue 12, free copy of Just Dance 2019. That's like, yeah, just that fell off of a lorry that Matthew's bundled up into the mag. Okay, next question.
Gents, you repeatedly said that the pod would likely stay ad slash sponsor free and rely solely on the patron for support. That said, if you had to pick one sponsor slash ad spot, who slash what would you pick? What would the spot go like?
And perhaps most importantly, how would you segue from the episode into the sponsor spot? Keep Up The Steal of Work from Madbrew. That's quite a big ask for a question, Matthew.
That's basically asking for help.
Yeah, that's a big ask for a question I hadn't prepared.
That's like about four hours of work, basically, to do that properly. So yeah, don't ask so much these listeners, Matthew. So I gave it some thought.
I'm on a big milk bun thing at the moment in Bath. Basically, this burger restaurant opened, right? And then it closed in about a month.
It was gone very quickly, but they still do takeout and the kitchen's open. You have to go to this weird door around the back and it'll give you a burger. It's fine.
You go in there, but it feels very insecure. There's no security. It's just like one dude and he's like, yeah, there's your burger and you walk off.
He's very friendly.
Could be anyone.
Yeah, exactly.
So you say if I just approach the door and be like, burger, please, just give me one.
You just go, yeah, that's mine to the bag or the thing. Hopefully, you won't ask your name and you walk off, probably with my order, to be honest. So I suppose in a broader sense, like the ad-free thing, I suppose, is like having no ads, but depending on Patreon means that everyone wins from the support we get.
I don't know. Like it's more as well, I didn't want to like, I didn't want to sort of like make the audio any less pure. I don't know.
Just, I think it's also because, I don't think, do you get that fucking Louis Theroux podcast advert where it's Craig David talking about being celibate and Shania Twain talking about swearing? Do you get that advert, Matthew?
On what?
On Spotify, Spotify does that ad.
No.
And it's so annoying. Like he's like, the Louis Theroux podcast brought to you by Hewl or whatever, because everything's brought to you by Hewl. And honestly, it just drives me up the wall.
And I think I just like the idea of you just hit play on our podcast, you just hear us straight away. So yeah, I don't know. I just sort of like, I'm not like adverse to doing ads, but I would rather they just weren't like the same podcast ads you get everywhere sort of thing.
Like, I don't know. I don't really know what a good version of it would be.
But the only one that I'd maybe be open to, and mainly because I think before you do these ads, you sometimes get free samples, is I have been interested in watching some of those Master Class documentary things.
Right, right.
Which get advertised a lot. And so I'd say, well, in order to advertise this, I need to watch all the Master Class. So I'd use it to get free access to Master Class and then very quickly be like, you know, all you have to say is like, I watched the, probably a video game related one.
I think Will Wright tells you how to make a video game. We'd actually, like, that would actually be a good episode. Us talking about what we learned from Will Wright and whether we could make a video game after taking his Master Class.
And I'd be like, no, I can't because I'm too busy making, like, six podcasts a month. That'd be like the conclusion. I'm too busy making the podcast.
You're hearing me talk about this on. I've sort of thought about more agnostic things. Like if someone said, oh, yeah, we need to sell this mouse and here's, like, I don't know, 200 quid or something.
You'd be like, okay, do the advert. And then probably the marketing guy would be like, no one bought the mouse. And I'd be like, yeah, I don't know what to tell you, really.
Like, it's not a podcast.
You don't have that impact on things.
I think we do on, like, certain games. But I think it's just, you know what I mean? Like, it's, I'm not sure if people would...
Yeah, like, if I was CEX, I would definitely buy ad spots on this podcast.
That's a good shout, actually. We could, like...
Because we'd be like, hey, everyone, buy Hotel Dusk and then everyone does it.
That's a good, I actually think CEX would be quite a good fit. But we'd have to be reading out prices. And I just worry it'd sound a bit crass.
I don't know, like...
But we do that anyway.
Yeah, it's true.
I tell you what, CEX would not want to be on Gamescourt where we make fun of people's pre-owned purchases.
I might feel differently if I had a podcast that had, like, a massive audience but quite a small list, you know, like, supporter list. But we do actually have, you know, I'm very grateful for the support we do have. So I don't want to mess with the alchemy too much, really.
So I've just left it because I'm terrified. That's basically the truth. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think it's right. I like that it's pure. I believe in the purity, too.
I did have a very bad attempt to, like, my milk bun advert though, Matthew.
Yeah, come on then. It's just going to have big episode 100 energy.
I think it's, like, not... Wouldn't have been... You know when, like, we had that first cut of episode 100 that wasn't very good?
And you were like, I think I can make this better by slicing out 30 minutes of it. And then you did. And then it was actually decent in the end.
I think it's maybe got, like, the offcuts kind of energy to it.
I've never worked so hard to make something merely decent.
It was a big edit job. Really, like, the hitman bit at the start bailed it out a bit. So, yeah.
So listening to that original cut of that podcast is like watching the clips of Back to the Future with Eric Stoltz. It's just so fucking raw. But there is, like, a kind of novelty factor to it.
I remember when we were recording it, I got this, because I had, like, come up with pretty much all of the skits, and Matthew just sort of attended and joined in. And I felt like Matthew was not convinced by it while it was happening. And it really did just come together at the end.
So, God, I almost don't want to have a go at an advert now, because this has been a much more interesting thing to discuss, like the making of episode 100. But I did have a go, though, Matthew. Basically, when Matthew makes a draft pick that he isn't convinced by, I'd go, hey, sometimes in life we all make decisions we regret.
Take my good friend Matthew here. Picking a PlayStation mascot he's not convinced by, but you can never go wrong with a cheeseburger. And while Milk Bun and Brits on Bath might narrowly miss out on the cheeseburger crown to local competitor's Magu Burger, you can't go wrong with their cheese and bacon Bronx fries.
Leave a lifetime of mistakes behind with Milk Bun. That's what I came up with, Matthew.
Oh, and it's fantastic, because it associates them with failure, and also says they're not as good as Magu.
Which I think is true, but that, I must admit that... No, we won't go into that again, it's fine. But yeah, I know you're big on their slur.
They're like, they've been very good to you with the sides. Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
Right. All right, SNM. Oh god, this is broad.
All right, SNM, please rate all the main consoles of the last few generations out of ten.
How are you feeling about doing no prep for this episode now, Matthew?
That's an episode concept, that isn't a question. Please rate. Just ask.
There's like no preamble. It's like, hi guys, do you mind doing loads of fucking work for me? Please rate all the main consoles of the last few generations.
That's from Tintendo64.
There's a lot to enjoy here. You reacting in real time to look at these questions for your own podcast for the first time and being like, what the fuck is this? That's amazing.
And then also, the hostility of saying to the listeners, getting us to do a load of fucking work when we ask them for questions.
But like the questions are like, you know, what would you be if you were a sandwich? Not like, I want you to evaluate all the consoles from ISIS. That's a lot of work.
All right, have you got an answer for this?
I do, yeah, because I had like, you were like, you were running behind slightly for the podcast, normally it's me running behind, and I did do a bit of prep for it, but, oh, that's killed me there.
I will happily just react to what you've scored all the consoles from the last few generations.
Well, first of all, what would you be if you were a sandwich? Because you mentioned that as a hypothetical question. What kind of sandwich would you be, Matthew?
I want to know that more than the answers to this.
Oh, I'm quite route. I'd probably be a BAP of some kind.
You could be.
I'd probably be like a loaded breakfast BAP.
Oh yeah, I quite like the idea of that. I mean, I don't think of you as like, you know, bacon and eggs. That's not, I'm not sat there thinking that's what Matthew Castle is, but.
No, but you don't, I'm not all set. I'm not like salad, you know?
I think I'm definitely like some kind of red meat and mustard and sort of like red onions, kind of like bagel.
Very much an acquired taste.
Yeah, but like, you know, if you do like it, yeah, we're gonna have a good time. I think that's kind of like the vibe there. So.
The thing is, I'm quite, like in person, I'm quite sort of vanilla and eager to please. So I'd probably be a very broad popular sandwich. Like a.
Cheese and onion.
Or chicken, just chicken salad or something.
Right, yeah, okay, yeah, I can sort of see that. But you know, behind the scenes you're quite.
Just tuna and cucumber. Oh yeah, behind the scenes, like, you know, I'm like a baguette full of fucking, I don't know where I'm going with this, there's Kentucky Fried Chicken and mayonnaise and slaw. I don't know, I haven't planned for the questions we do have, let alone the ones that come up.
Okay, I'll just give you my answers to this. So, yeah, I thought that PS4 was like an eight, I went with that, I think that's pretty solid. Xbox One is six, you've got to, like, knock it down for the connect, mandatory connect.
At the moment I think.
I'm surprised that PS4 is not like a nine.
I think it's just because, like, the games it's most famous for weren't all games I massively clicked with, so. Yeah, I don't know. I think it's, I think it also, like, the list of reasons that make it exciting individually as a console is smaller than it would be for, you know, like, PS2 kind of generation, or even a 360 PS3 generation.
So, yeah, like, I've got, like, the Wii U as a four out of 10, but I was kind of, like, tough but fair. Yeah. At the moment, I think both the Series X and the PS5 are probably both a seven.
They might also, they might be an eight tied. Like, I am enjoying the games coming out, but, like, it's a bit of a different exclusives generation, isn't it? Yeah, so, PS3 was a six, definitely.
360 was probably a 10, maybe a nine, probably a 10. Yeah, and then the Switches, I think the Switches are nine. I think that's probably where the Switches are.
I think the Switches are 10 for me.
Yeah, that's fair enough. I think it's like, it's lack of power is probably the only thing marking down slightly, and that being noticeable in some more recent games.
You want to ray-traced Ochi, do you?
That's actually the last thing I want. I don't ever want to hear about ray-tracing again, thank you.
Imagine that the number of legs he could have with a bit more oomph.
I've spent most of this generation pausing games by a puddle of water and changing between performance mode and what is the other one, trying to see what difference the reflection is in the water and whether it's worth it. That is not a good evolution of the video game experience in my book. I will take the frame rate every time, thank you.
So anyway, so yes, that was basically it, Matthew. Those are the last few generations.
I hope you enjoyed that.
Do you have any takes on that? Like anything you agree with or disagree with?
Oh, yeah, they mostly sound about right.
Yeah, blew through an episode idea there in 45 seconds. I hope you're proud of yourself, Tim Tendo, 64.
I just, I don't know, like, I feel like we have, I feel like if you stitch together all the episodes we've ever done, I would hope we paint quite a comprehensive picture of how we feel about all the consoles from the last few generations. Yeah, I think the thing- Like this feels like an abridged version of the whole podcast, which is why the question makes me laugh, because it's like, take your entire project and boil it down to just numbers.
Yeah, it's too reductive, you know what I mean? It's sort of like, yeah, like you say, there's 138 episodes of kind of discussing these eras of games in quite, I think, reasonably eloquent fashion. So, yeah.
Okay, let's do it.
But listen, thanks for listening.
Okay, and we'll do a couple more here, then we'll wrap up. So, hi Samuel and Matthew. Over my years listening to various podcasts, I've discovered many new things.
I would never have tried before. Perfect examples being my newfound love of Japanese crime fiction, which is down to this podcast and trying and loving the Ninja Theory DMC game after Chet and John gave it their game of the year on their Reassuringly Finite Gaming Playlist podcast. For those of people who don't know, that's a UK podcast that existed for, I don't know, like maybe six or seven years.
It was really good. Former games journalist John Denton and Chet Royvus made that. It was very enjoyable.
It was one of the inspirations for this podcast. So my question is whether podcasts have ever led you to try anything out of your comfort zone, whether it be in games or something else, and what were some of the best examples? That's from Angry Kurt.
Matthew, what have you got for this one?
So have games ever made me try something out of my comfort zone?
No, have podcasts ever made you try something out of your comfort zone?
Oh, whether a podcast, listening to The Big Picture Podcast, which is one of the few podcasts I do listen to and we rip it off endlessly, their affection for horror and talking about trashy horror and where it's readily available has led me to trying out a few more horror bits and bobs here and there. I got a little Shudder subscription in the run-up to our Horror XL episode that we did, which was probably partly due to them.
That's funny actually, because when I was trying to measure the effect of The Big Picture on me, horror was what I came back to as well, Matthew. So weirdly, I think it's because I've already seen a lot of their key texts that they talk about a lot, like Michael Mann stuff or Aaron Sorkin stuff or 90s films. I feel like I'm fairly up on those.
So yeah, it does come down to the slightly odd stuff. So when they basically did like a bunch of different horror episodes, where they pull out different films. And that's how I ended up watching Speak No Evil on Shudder, for example.
They did like quite a lot of podcasting about that. And I heard buzz about that anyway. And it's a pretty depraved horror film that really takes its time to get to the point, but it's worth it.
And they're going to remake it. And I don't know what the fucking point of that is. Like you're a Philistine if you watch a remake of that and not the actual thing, because it's so easy to get hold of with James McAvoy, apparently.
And so, yeah, I think that's one example. I ended up watching the original Miami Vice TV show for the first time because it was on the rewatchables. And I wanted to know what the hell they were talking about.
Also because I was kind of curious about that as a sort of, I guess, like a Michael Mann sort of sub project. With Chet and John specifically, I did try a lot of games they mentioned. The most obvious one is like the Velocity Games, who I think were the developers of Power Wash Simulator made those, Matthew, and now gone on to enormous success.
So yeah, those kind of come to mind. Horror films are like probably the big one.
I sometimes listen to episodes of the rewatchables about films that I've seen years ago that I thought were shit. And they talk about them with such affection that I'm like, you know what, I will give that a second go. And it is inevitably as shit as I remember it.
Yeah, see like Oceans 12, et cetera.
Primal Fear.
Oh, I thought Primal Fear was okay. But like the Twitter, yeah.
Okay, maybe shit's a bit much, but like they've got quite a bad habit of elevating like two or three star films. They talk about them all with the same level of enthusiasm. They do their favorite films ever on that show.
Yeah.
So you come out going like, that sounds so good and iconic. And then you watch it and you're like, ah, no, this is a little bit like three stars.
Yeah, but it's a great, what I think I really like about that podcast and the true thing that we've lifted from a lot of their podcasts is like the language of how they discuss those things in this very sort of accessible way where you're kind of like drawing a larger cultural picture of where things fit into other things. And I think the style of doing that is what I enjoy most about those podcasts. So the way they will frame Primal Fear as like an intersection of what is going on in Richard Gere's career or like the rise of Ed Norton and things like that.
They love an imagined narrative, as do we.
Exactly. So that is the part I really enjoy about those podcasts. So we definitely lifted that if you've ever listened to like the preamble to a draft episode of this podcast.
But the funny thing is with games, right, is that games are much more monocultural than people realize. It's actually like the few indie games that kind of break out really are the indie games that break out. And it's hard to find avenues that cover that stuff that actually falls outside of that, you know, that doesn't quite make it or doesn't quite get the attention that it either wants or deserves.
Like it's games are more monocultural than you think. Like Dave the Diver is a good example of that, right? Like everyone was suddenly covering that.
And then the game was everywhere. And now it's sold like a million copies. And the same is true of Dredge.
The same is true of Pizza Tower. But for all those games, there are hundreds of other games that get no attention at all. So I don't even really rely on coverage as like a recommendation vehicle.
I kind of rely on it as like for like good writing about things I already know I'm gonna play or things I'm interested in. So weirdly, it's quite rare for me to like discover games because of, I don't know, websites or podcasts these days. It's just not, that's just not how the framework of how things seem to work in the games industry.
So there you go, a bit of a bleak note there Matthew, but probably true. Okay, any more thoughts Matthew as we move on?
Yes, we do.
Okay, do you wanna read this last one?
Short one, what's the best pizza restaurant you've eaten at and what's the best pizza chain following Samuel's brutal takedown of Bella Italia in the RPG channel on the Discord? Hey, it beats a Dreamcast talk in the episode chat and that is from Balladeer.
Yeah, so I think like Oven in Bath probably is the best pizza place I've been to. Experiments with the form Matthew, you know like the thick jam and spicy Induja.
Creamed walnuts.
Creamed walnuts pizza, that's a fucking great pizza. Yeah, yeah, but.
I do love the Oven, I will say the last couple of pizzas I've had at the Oven, I felt like the toppings were a little stingy.
Right, interesting.
I actually felt like there was a little bit too much crust on the go and it's like twice, it's almost becoming a trend.
Yeah, cost a living crisis.
And I wouldn't want to have to write a scathing review on Google reviews, which I've started. I've started reviewing a lot of stuff on Google reviews because once you've done it a couple of times, you keep getting pinged on your phone and it's like, you're an amazing reviewer of places in Bath. You should write more reviews.
Why don't you review this dry cleaners you went to? Why don't you review Pret a Manger? Why don't you review the Abbey?
It basically asks you to review anything you've been near or recorded on Google Maps. And I'm like, sure, I'll review those. So I've just started reviewing lots of stuff and I've become like quite a key reviewer in Bath.
I can't believe you are like producing free content for Google, Matthew.
I mean, they're very short. And if you read the reviews, I think you'd see that I'm not putting a lot of time into them.
It's funny. I got like, when some dudes came and cleaned my flat right, they begged me for a Google review. And they asked me to name them by name.
And when you read, I got like a notification today saying 50 people have read your review. And well, because I list the names of them in the first line, it sounds quite a lot like they got a gun to my head and they're like, tell them how fucking clean your flat was afterwards. And like, I just want to make it clear, by the way, that's like the first time I've ever hired people to clean my flat.
But I was going to say like, I paid my taxes on the Patreon. And then like, I paid for like one deep clean, because I thought I was going to move out a few months ago, then didn't. That's basically what happened.
But now, what was it? Because it just, things had gotten bad because I worked from home. And I was like, you know what?
I just need like, I just need someone to get the grime out of my bathtub. That's not me. Basically, there's no good way of framing this.
But like I said, it's not that bad. I'm just saying like, you know, you get a lot of limescale in bath, don't you? So anyway, so yeah, that's it.
Blame it on the dirtier water.
That review reads quite a lot like, I don't know, Gav and Sean and this other bloke have a gun to my head. And they're like, fucking say how nice that bathtub is. You never had a shinier bathtub than this.
I've had thousands of people read my review of The Big Sainsbury's.
What do you say about it?
Well, that's exactly what I wrote. I was like, listen, it's a big Sainsbury's. I think you know what this is.
I think some people have liked that review. It's obviously given people a little bit of a chuckle. I like the idea that you're just scanning through these things and you might find I've written a few gags in there.
Some of your best journalism is now in Google reviews around Bath.
Random sandwich places, pubs, I'll tell you where I went for the first time the other day. That good fish and chips restaurant you recommended.
Oh yeah, what's it? Oyster Shield? No, the other one is Scallop Shell.
Yeah, that was good.
Oh yeah, I told you, fish and chips.
After our whole fish and chips thing on the podcast, where I didn't think you could do really great elevated fish and chips, and that's exactly what I had there, it was delicious.
Yeah, it's fucking amazing, like just top batter. It just really has changed fish and chips for me forever for that place.
So I gave them a five-star review.
Okay, good. Well, there you go. So that's what Matthew's doing these days in his evenings, playing The Expanse episode one and going, this isn't very good, then reviewing Big Sainsbury's.
I have detailed thoughts on the Big Sainsbury's. I think the sushi counter is not exactly working out for them. You know what I mean?
Like, if you test that sushi, take that sushi for a ride versus Waitrose. Waitrose knocks out the park every time. Over-refrigerated, you've got to hose it down with the sweet soy sauce to make it even vaguely edible, in my opinion.
That's my take, Matthew. I don't know if you have any thoughts on that sushi counter.
Yeah, I mean, I don't buy sushi, so...
Okay, that's it then. The podcast is done. On that note, it ends, basically.
So Matthew, that was a very strange episode of this podcast. Very odd late Tuesday energy to it. But I think I'm optimistic about the month ahead.
I'm excited for Best Games of 2016. Excited for our first XXL draft. So you can follow the podcast at twitter.com/backpagepod.
I may migrate to another platform at some point. It feels like Threads is already over, maybe. So...
Oh, Threads is rubbish.
So not sure it'll be that one unless they vastly improve it. I quite like Blue Sky, but there's not enough people posting on there. That feels a lot like Twitter in 2009.
As soon as I get an invite code, man, I'll send it your way so you can get on there. I'll pull you off of the raft. There's also a lot of people talking about how bad Twitter is on Blue Sky, and that just feels like a complete waste of time and energy, but...
I'm still having an okay time on Twitter.
Yeah, it's not as bad. Like, it's just... Every week there is something that makes you like, existentially like, question what is going on on the whole platform, you know?
So, yeah. Where can people find you on social media, then, Matthew?
I'm at MrBazzill UnderscorePesto on X.
Oh, grim. I'm Samuel Dobby Roberts, and we'll be back next week with a new podcast.
Goodbye. Bye-bye.
