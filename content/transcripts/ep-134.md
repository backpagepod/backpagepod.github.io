Hello and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, what have you been playing lately of the 19 different games that released in June and May? What have you been rotating back to of late?
I've actually been playing a Master Detective Archives Rain Code, the Danganronpa follow-up for review. But I'm now desperately thinking, when is the embargo for that? It may be today, so I probably, just to be safe, won't say what I think of it.
We'll circle back round to that. But I have been playing that. Obviously, I was very interested to see how that worked out, being a big Danganronpa head in the parlance of this podcast.
But basically juggling that and still chipping away at Final Fantasy XVI.
Nice chunky game, that with old Clive. I'm finally starting to chip away at that a little bit. But what we're going to do next month for listeners benefit, because we know there's been so much out lately and so much coming out, is that we're going to do two what we've been playing pods next month.
So I think we're going to try and tick off the likes of the Ghost Trick Remaster that's come along and Trapang 2 and Street Fighter and Diablo 4, FF16. There's so much, it feels like this is the month to do that. So yeah, plus it's a hot July and I'm trying to avoid three hour pods in hot July basically.
My exciting Final Fantasy 16 adjacent news is that I'm now best friends with voice actor Ben Starr, AKA Clive.
Yep, I saw a picture of him at the oven in Bath, the best pizza restaurant in Bath, if you ask me.
I wonder if he was having the creamed walnuts and fig jam.
I bet no one at that table recommended it to him because you're all Philistines at PlayStation Access. That's what I think.
We're not really best friends, but you know, he's following me now on Twitter. So kind of a big deal.
So it's only a matter of time before he comes on this podcast, you think?
Basically. The thing is, he's amazing at podcasts. Like he's a really good podcast guest.
No, he already did the Lucy James podcast.
He's the real deal. He's really into games. There's some people here, they're into games and they've got quite a casual relationship, but he's like a nerdily into games.
You know, he was talking, I heard him over talking to Rob about who was in his Blitzball team. And I was like, the only other person I've ever heard talk about this was you. And the fact that he was like, oh, you know, got a classic bit of brother in my team.
And I was like, I know what that reference is, because that's what Sam said.
Oh, wow. I'm so impressed by that. We have to get him on and do the Blitzball part.
That's a must, frankly. Wait till he finds out that I'm the one other person who likes Blitzball. Like it's like we were meant to be pals.
Yeah. So that was exciting. That was nice.
Yeah, it's very funny that this person has sort of entered into my orbit a little bit. And playing the game and you're like, well, it's kind of odd that you semi know this person or you can put the face to the voice anyway. It is a great, he is great in it.
Clive is good. And I'm not just saying that because we're best friends on Twitter now. I legitimately think like the voice acting in that game is one of its major strengths.
Yeah. That's good. I mean, I know you're kissing his ass, despite what you say, but I'm only joking.
It is good. I can be straight with my best friends.
Yeah, no. Yeah, exactly. No, I'm only kidding.
The voice acting is very, very good in that game. The Square Enix's localization is always good. They are just absolute masters at doing that.
And you think about what an operation it is to release a game simultaneously worldwide like that and have all the lip syncing done and stuff like that. That's a fucking gigantic bit of work that they do. Sorry, this stuff is now slightly more interesting to me than it used to be because I work in games publishing.
And I just realize how much work things take. So I'm like, wow, the amount of spreadsheets they must have needed to do this. That's the kind of nonsense that my brain tunes into now is sad.
Sad decline of Samuel Roberts, basically.
Well, you need to find the person who does those spreadsheets and befriend them on Twitter. So we've all got best friends on the Final Fantasy team.
Well, I did tell you that once I interviewed James Arnold Taylor, voice of Tidus in Final Fantasy X, I told him I played 400 hours of the game and he went, God bless you, like that, he said.
He should have done the laugh. He should have laughed in your face, a la that laugh.
Yeah.
And then we were like, oh shit, that is how he laughs, genuinely in real life. That was completely sincere.
Yeah. And I was interviewing him for the Clone Wars cartoon, which to me was just like so not a big deal. And then I sort of realized about a couple of years later that, oh no, people absolutely love this thing that I just don't really understand.
And he's just, you know, but then I'm not really interested in him going, Urbe one, Kenobi, which is what he does in every episode. But I was, for him doing the fucking Tina's voice, I'm all over it, man. It just, you know, that's my kind of shit.
So, yeah. I also, I wouldn't mind being pals with Ray Chase, who voiced Noctis in FF15. He's got a good voice.
He did the audio book for Jason Schreier's novels, novels, sorry, books about game development. So that was good. It was like, yeah, it was like finding audio tapes in Final Fantasy 15 where the king of insomnia or whatever is telling you about the time that Kingdoms of Amalur went south.
Okay, bit of a ramble there.
Yeah, I have to ask you very quickly, just because we put out the Indiana Jones Patreon pod. I know that you've seen Indiana Jones. I don't want to push this down a huge Indiana Jones detour, but just give us the bottom line here.
Yeah, so you know how on that podcast I said that it was a bit ageist to be saying Harrison Ford's not up to it or whatever. I will say that is an old ass man in that film. He's very, very, I mean, he is frail, but I think what helps is that they use Phoebe Waller-Bridge for a lot of the set pieces.
So he's tagging along, but he's not necessarily the guy who's beating the shit out of 10 dudes or whatever. To be honest, it was not disappointing, just it wasn't quite as good as I hoped it would be. It's better than Crystal Skull.
I think it's a bit more the beats of it and the characterization of Indy are a bit more in line with the first three. The opening, despite being too long, is pretty close, I think, to being a great Indiana Jones opening. Oh, okay.
Yeah, it gets in the ballpark, but it's way too long. It's got probably one too many excursions to a place where they go with some torches in a tomb or whatever and find out a thing about a MacGuffin. A bit too slow on that front.
Didn't mind if he'd be Waller-Bridge. Mads Mikkelsen doing his Mads Mikkelsen thing where it's continually playing bad guys despite the fact he obviously rules.
There could be many different things. Another Mads Mikkelsen thing is doing that cool dance where he's drunk a load of lager at the end of that film.
There's none of that in this one. It's not like he's to the Fuhrer because he's playing a Nazi and then he's just drinking that down. I need to stay away from Nazi joke content Matthew after Smozzy's Gate in the last podcast.
So yeah, sorry, you wanted to ask where does it go in the rankings, right? In the power rankings?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll put it in C. It's like a solid C. It's like a three star film.
It's like better than most of the blockbusters I've seen lately. I was sadly not really in Across the Spider-Verse guy. It didn't do much for me that one.
Did you like that one?
No, I'm going to see. We're going to mop up some films over the next few days basically. That's the plan.
Yeah, that makes sense. But I thought it was better than Guardians 3:, for example.
Oh, okay.
I mean, even Guardians 3:, I thought was the best MCU film in a while. That is to say a three star film.
Let's give me some hope. I was going to do this great segue. I was going to say from a solid C to solid snake.
Oh, fuck. That would have been great. And I just stepped on it.
Sorry about that.
But then we started talking about something else. I just want people to know that I did have that thought.
Yeah, absolutely.
That I'm capable of that kind of pod construction.
Yeah, absolutely. So from a solid C to a solid snake, Matthew, this episode we're talking about. I don't really know what the first nine minutes of this podcast are.
I can't believe we're nine minutes in. We've just been talking absolute shit.
This is just the way we've podsed now.
I think so. And also we don't do it that obnoxiously. It's just one little bit at the start.
It's not like two hours of baseball, then one hour on, I don't know, Cain and Lynch 2.
Yeah, this could have been nine minutes of us moaning about that person who didn't like our logo. And we didn't do that. And we're not going to do that.
Oh no, I don't mind that. I didn't mind that too much because I'm not as married to the logo as you, I don't think. I'm like, the logo is fine.
But it does its job. But that's all it needs to do really. For the listeners context, one guy very politely suggested that our logo maybe could be replaced with a better one.
And it became, you know what it's like when we receive a tiny bit of criticism, we blurt out proportion, just that basically. You've heard it over and over again on this podcast. So that happened.
But I think we ultimately came to the conclusion that there is some affection for the logo, but ultimately the content of the podcast is what matters. Nice little resolution there, nice little three act structure to that story. So all good.
So yes, Matthew, a bit of nonsense goes a long way. So this podcast then, Metal Gear Solid 3:, Snake Eater, we've been replaying it for this episode. Why?
Because they're remaking it. Konami announced at the PlayStation conference slash whatever you call it now, back in May showcase that this existed. It was quite a brief, odd CG teaser of lots of animals that seemed slightly out of proportion with their size in real life to me having a big old thrashing fight in a pond and then you saw Snake at the end.
And it was the first Metal Gear anything that's happened outside of licensing sort of gubbins, like board games and stuff, since Metal Gear Survive, which is obviously a controversial spinoff that nonetheless earned some affection from Rich Stanton, sometime guest of this show. So Matthew, with that in mind, it feels like the right time to replay Metal Gear Solid 3:, what do you think?
Yeah, absolutely. And it's one of our on-running kind of game obsessions on this pod. This seems like a good time to do it.
I mean, we could have done it when the new version comes out, but let's get ahead of it. Why not talk about it now? Yeah, why not?
Yeah, I wanted a little bit of distance with it when it actually rolls along as well, because I wanted to sort of like not burn myself out at MGS3, then play MGS3 again, basically. So I think that's why now I thought was a good time.
But it's unusual that they're putting out another version of MGS3 before that version of MGS3 in the Master Collection.
Right. Yeah, that was the other thing they announced, of course, the MGS Master Collection, which has 1, 2 and 3: is coming to modern platforms, including Switch and Metal Gear Solid 3: is coming to PC for the first time, apparently without mouse and keyboard supports. I read that as a rumor.
I'm not sure if that's true, but because it was a lot of this was discussed during the Nintendo Showcase. It was hard to gauge how high end the port job is on these. And I think that's kind of the big question with that is, it's yes, it's nice to have it on modern formats and something is better than nothing, definitely.
But what shape they'll be in is interesting because Metal Gear Solid 3:, Matthew, we both own the version that's on 360 that's backwards compatible. And that version is fucking mint on Series X. I don't know if you agree with that.
I think it's that version, isn't it? Like, I think it's the HD edition versions of 2 and 3:.
It is, yeah. But I guess I just want to see it in action before I'm like, oh, yeah, here we go. Just because I've got it on my Xbox right here.
The definitive versions of these games already exist and I have them, you know, so it's whether they're comparable on other platforms, I suppose. But yeah, it's cool that people will have another chance to talk about it and also that it sort of punts Metal Gear back into the public consciousness generally, which feels like there's some larger push going on with Konami there. Who knows if it just ends at a Metal Gear Solid 3: remake and probably a second volume of the Master Collection, which brings Shudder, Metal Gear Solid 4 to modern platforms.
The listeners know how I feel about that, Matthew. I feel like the day that happens, I'm going to get fucking 19 different mentions on Twitter straight away. Yeah.
What do you think of that as an idea?
Yeah, I mean, it's nice to be associated with something, you know, like when your personal brand is so clear cut that people can make those links. That's always cool. Yeah, but it mustn't leave.
It just, yeah, it's where it belongs forever. It's proper, like, don't open Ark of the Covenant stuff. All our faces will melt.
The idea of that game being in a collection with, like, maybe all the, like, PSP or handheld ones is kind of sounds kind of like a rough deal to me. That's quite jarring to go from, like, you know, one of the more high end ones. I guess it would have five and Grand Zeros too, right?
Yeah, I guess. I guess so. That is a weird collection though, isn't it?
With Peace Walker plonked in the middle there. But there's also the question of whether they'll do any other extras with it because they've got the original Metal Gears coming with that master collection, including Snake's Revenge, which I think is the one that was off-brand, not made by Kojima. So, pretty comprehensive.
It begs the question, Matthew, actually, first of all, how big? How many discs are they going to need for Metal Gear Solid 4, which needed a Blu-ray at the time because it was gigantic, and Metal Gear Solid 5 and Grand Zeros as well as a bunch of extra stuff?
You ain't put the idea of, heaven forbid, Metal Gear Solid 4 on a Switch cartridge?
Oh, that's so wrong. So incorrect. So fundamentally immoral.
You know what I mean? Like, it's not right, man. There's a joke about Blu-ray discs in there.
There's a joke about the six axis controller and the DualShock 3:. Like, it's... I just...
Yeah, it was... Those two things are symbiotic.
They just dub it over. So he's like, tell me about these Joy-Cons.
Yeah, really badly sort of dubbed over by clearly a different voice actor.
All David... How David Hater stands now, which is probably a bit different.
Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah, yeah. I'm actually interested to talk about him in this podcast.
So yeah, Matthew, so we've got all that to come. I'm also hoping they won't do this, right? But it'd be cool if they excavated Portable Ops, which is kind of considered a non-canon Metal Gear now, but mechanically is a precursor to both Peace Walker and Five.
And also the Acid Games, which again have not been ported to any other platform. But those on a Nintendo Switch, that's really appealing because the second one in particular, really nice looking game, card based, turn based game. Absolutely a modern game type that would feel fresh in the hand.
So I think it'd be good to see all of that in one collection. How likely do you think that is?
I mean, that sounds unlikely. But I don't know, this is quite a generous collection. You know, one, two and three and the retro one.
So it's not too shabby. Yeah, I'd be up for it. I don't have any experience with those games myself.
So I'm definitely up for trying them. I'm just surprised that they haven't put a bit more effort into maybe grouping things like narratively, maybe.
Right.
It feels like you might put together the big boss games and the modern trilogy might be a cleaner split.
But you know, yeah, I genuinely think that they just thought people won't understand if this is like three and two other games then one, two and four. That would just be too confusing to people. I wonder if that's why they did it that way.
Just because it would break the brains of the general public. Yeah, this sometimes happens with comic book collections where they'll be like, it'll be four and issues one to five and seven. And then you look up where six went and it's like some fucking underground artist drew a really weird crossover issue and it's no longer in print or something like that.
That happens a lot in comic books. It's really annoying. So maybe they just thought completionist sake, one, two, three, four, five, you know, assorted ephemera.
But yeah, interesting times to see this stuff recirculated for sure. And Metal Gear Solid 4 on a Switch. That's like we've crossed the Rubicon there.
There's no coming back for mankind after that. I've got to say, that's like an unholy act. Good for game preservation, though, just as an NB at the end there.
So Matthew, Metal Gear Solid 3:, then, just for clarity as well, the remake is called Delta. Is that right, Metal Gear Solid Delta? Yeah, so that's coming along.
But Matthew, what is your memory of your first memory of playing Metal Gear Solid 3:?
I was at university. I didn't own a PlayStation, but someone in my student house had a PlayStation 2. And I rented it from Blockbuster and absolutely cained it over the 48 hours that I had it.
And it's not really a game designed to be taken like that. So I remember taking it kind of quite a clip. And as a result, it's a game that I didn't necessarily appreciate or understand first time around.
And I've kind of grown into it more over the years, or my appreciation of it, of its grown and bringing a lot of the wider knowledge of the weird Easter eggs and the amount of weirdness in this game. It's like a very dense game. It's full of Kojima bullshit, which often takes a few years to kind of like fully emerge.
So like that, you know, a race racing through the story that first weekend is like not really what this game is about. So a bit of a bit of a messy experience. Also remember the original version has that absolutely god awful camera where it's based on it's like the traditional cameras.
It's kind of like top down. And this is like quite an organic environment. It's not really built around neat right angles that that top down or that traditional camera view supports.
So that's, that's quite rough. That's quite a lot of like trying to shoot stuff off screen and think about stuff that's off screen. And like, when you play it with the newer camera, the full 3D camera, you're like, how was this ever perceived as anything other than this?
Yeah, it's funny because when subsistence came along, which I think was 06 maybe 07 around that time, they bundled in obviously a Metal Gear Online, which by the way, I looked up a screenshot of that. It was the most bonkers fucking screenshot. The player character was that Ivan Rykov guy with the Raiden hair and then Ocelot just shooting him in the background and then four other dudes on screen.
It looked like absolute carnage. I really wish I'd experienced this so I could have some stories to tell from the front lines of PS2 Metal Gear Online. Yeah, so I immensely enjoyed that.
But yeah, it meant actually for me because I didn't come. I think this was almost straight away, subsistence became quite pricey to get hold off. It wasn't an easy thing to find in Europe, so you'd end up spending upwards of like 40 quid to get hold of it was my recollection.
So I didn't see this new camera until those HD editions came along. I think 2011 or that was like a really, you know, I always knew it existed this fabled new camera, but I had to wait for it like you and I agree with you. The other thing is that Metal Gear Solid 2, I believe was one of the only PS2 games that ran at 60 frames per second.
And you can tell that from how slick, slickly everyone's moving in that game. And then three was 30 FPS because I think like the jungle and like the increased level of simulation and that sort of thing meant they just needed to drop the frame rate a little bit to prioritize detail is my understanding. So and so it means that there's like a slight like just moving through sludge aspect to selecting that first person camera from that third person view and just being like why is there nothing in between with that original camera, which I think you can access that original camera by clicking one of the sticks in the HD collection so it's still there but yeah but weirdly though Matthew I don't know about you but it didn't bother me that much at the time because I think I'd whacked the difficulty down too easy and just made and just kind of treated it as more of a narrative experience.
Yeah I mean it was what it was as you know like you didn't question it but you weren't like oh I wish it had this other thing like because it was just more in line with the other Metal Gear games you're like well of course it's going to control like this it's only in hindsight that it seems really egregious.
Yeah that is true exactly so I think that while Kojima Productions are obviously aware of it enough to bother re-releasing it with that new camera as well as a bunch of extras it was yeah it wasn't that big a factor for me. Yeah it's interesting because my first experience with Metal Gear Solid 3: was that I had a couple of years where I wasn't paying as much attention to games and there was this dude in one of my in one of my sixth form classes a very dark time for Samuel Roberts where he he sort of like gleamed onto the fact that I was a big Metal Gear and Final Fantasy guy and he would talk to me about those constantly and then he borrowed Final Fantasy 8 from me for a whole year. I lent it to him in September and got it back from him in July just before I left that sixth form and that was like that was one of my last proper lending out experiences with someone.
So he killed generosity in you.
Famously, I am the least generous man ever. I'm fine.
I'm joking.
No, but letting people hold your stuff captive for like years at a time. There's just something that's never good, is it, when that happens and then you become the guy who has to chase them and they're like, yeah, bring it back and then they think, oh, why are you getting so arsey about me bringing this thing back? And that's like, oh, I just wish none of this had ever happened.
Yeah. So such as it is. But this guy, this guy actually like is quite an interesting dude.
He I didn't really have time for him at the time because I was at an age where I just couldn't be doing with any of the people I was going to school with. But he was trying to engage with me on Metal Gear. He later joined the military and went to Afghanistan and stuff.
It was like quite intense.
But he was saying to me, he became like a sort of a Cobra unit style Bizarro soldier. Like he joined the unit and had like a load of fucking snakes up his trousers.
Yeah, I think the reality of war is much more harrowing than that. Sadly, it doesn't leave you with many kind of like novelty factors to distinguish you as a kind of character. It's more just like the PTSD.
I wonder if anyone does rock up at, you know, when you sign up to the army and you're like, I think the career I'd like to pursue is to become one of those like crazy Cobra unit soldiers governed by like one pure emotion of the battlefield. What would your emotion be?
Avarice and then I'd just steal their trousers each time I kill them. That's like, that's pretty eccentric, but actually it's maybe a bit too homoerotic.
Do you have to put on each pair of trousers over your last pair?
Yes, exactly. When I run out of room, I have to start putting them on my arms as well. And it's just like absolute chaos.
And actually the key to beating you is to deliberately lose so that you have put on so many pairs of trousers that it just becomes unworkable. You can't walk around. And then we just walk up and shoot you in the head.
Or the Kojima style twist version of doing that is you wear a pair of shorts and I don't know what the fuck to do. And then I just explode and that's what. Much like, you know, aging the end to death in Metal Gear Solid 3:.
Just like that's the trick way to do it. So yeah, what about you? What would yours be?
Uh, it'd probably be something to do with eating.
Right. Would you just eat like the arm of your victims or something like what's?
Yeah, I'd be the greed.
Right.
But that's a bit like Fat Man from Metal Gear Solid 2 keeps on exists anyway.
I imagine the Fat Man being quite irritated with you, like infringing on his brand. It's like, hey buddy, like I'm the guy who drinks wine. Like don't start munching on people's arms and trying to steal my personal brand.
The thing is though, food and feeding and dropping food is like a very key baked in mechanic for Metal Gear Solid 3:. So a boss that was more elaborately about feeding them, you know, like a particular combination of things to give me heartburn, you have to give me like very fatty meats to give me terrible heartburn. That's how you get me.
I mean, it's a little bit too much like the fear in that regard. But the fear is jumping around on trees and like, I ain't doing that. You've seen me.
Like I'm sitting in a deck chair, like just in the middle of a forest.
You're not that bad. You always make yourself sound like it's like Brendan Fraser in The Whale or something. It's like that is not your life.
You know, you're just like, you're just a large gentleman like I'm a large gentleman. It's fine. You know what I mean?
People aren't like looking at you when you walk down the street.
I'm not getting up any tree.
Well, no, I accept that. Yeah. The other thing is that if you killed me, the avarice in Metal Gear Solid 3:, Snake would like get 50 new sort of camo options, but it's just the same pair of trousers 50 times.
You have to scroll through them constantly. You're like, oh, why did I fucking kill that optional member of the Kofi unit that gives me 50 pairs of the same trousers? This is such a nightmare.
What would definitely be true is my stamina bar would be so short. Like my natural stamina bar would be like the shortest one in the game. That would be like a mini-joke for them.
Yeah, he could just kill you by making you jog. Like he just sort of shoots at you twice and then you go for a jog and then it's like drained down to one bar and you're like sweating it.
See, we are back in Brendan Fraser, the whale territory here.
Yeah, sorry. That's not the case. Nor is the condition in that film meant to be laughed at.
Just making that very clear for our list. Right then, what the fuck were we talking about? Let me just find my guide.
Our early memory is playing it.
Oh, yeah. So basically, after that 10-minute aside, this guy encouraged me to play it and I was like, I'm kind of out on it. The reason was because I was a huge fan of Metal Gear Solid and 2 and they had a continuous story and the end of 2 had a twist that I knew that they would eventually have to pay off in a new game.
I knew it wasn't going to be this game because they were like, it's the origin story of a guy you've literally never fucking met because you live in the West and you're playing Metal Gear Solid and didn't get Metal Gear, so why would I care about this? That was actually how I felt about it. I was like, an origin story for a dude you never meet in either of the two Metal Gear Solid games I've played.
So it didn't seem that enticing to me, honestly, just on that story-based level. I do remember very vividly what the early conceptual trailers they put out for it though, where there must have been E3 2002 or 2003, but there's a sequence where there's a dude on a motorcycle and it seems like Snake is going to hijack the bike. But then the dude on the bike goes, this is no Vice City and then drives off.
It's a weird little exchange. One of those kajimari jokey trailers. But also there is something oddly welcome to the rules of the jungle.
Nothing quite applies here. Element to their promotional trailers for this. They did a good job of making it seem like it was going to be an open world jungle game.
And then when you play it, it's these more diorama type little chunks of levels in the jungle, which I personally prefer. We can talk about that in a minute. So it meant I didn't have loads of anticipation for it because I just wanted to know how the fuck did the Patriots die 100 years ago?
Spoiler alert, there's some bullshit about AI. Who even fucking knows? Metal Gear Solid 4 is a mess, man.
But that's fine because I did eventually take a plunge on it because when they started promoing Metal Gear Solid 4 and you were seeing all of these videos of old Snake on the battlefield, I thought, that is the coolest shit I have ever seen. Snake fighting the fucking cow robots. That is so cool.
I have to just plunge my head back into Metal Gear. So I went and picked this up and then absolutely loved it because the thing that this game is like an answer to Metal Gear Solid 2. I can't remember how much of this we covered on our Excel pod with Rich on the best Metal Gear moments.
But 2 is the unwieldy game with endless cut scenes and thematically interesting but quite baffling finale to that game. It's very obnoxious in all of the ways the sort of Kojima touches are in there. Whereas 3: has a bit of that, particularly at the start.
It has a lot of like fucking Khrushchev talking to LBJ and you're like, this is going on for a long time and LBJ is voiced by Sully from Uncharted, so it's slightly distracting. But then it enters this mode where you start getting to the Cobra units where it's so like lean for what this era of Metal Gear and that being. And that I think just allows its story to land in a way that the story simply doesn't in Metal Gear Solid 1, 2 and 4.
Maybe it does a little bit more in 1 actually, but certainly in 2 and 4, where the cutscenes are so long, there's just so much fluff in there. This is like a coherent story told well. And that was the thing that really captured my imagination, Matthew.
Yeah, no, I completely get that. I mean, the amazing thing about this is actually if you... It's how much of the nonsense that there is, you can opt out of it by just not using the codec.
There's like tens of hours of Kojima silliness here if you want it. But if you don't have it, the actual core cutscenes, outside of the very long one at the start and the very long one at the end, yeah, it's pretty fast moving and it keeps a lot of the cast in play as well, which I really like about it. There's a lot more faces appearing from start to finish and you build more of a relationship with them.
It has more of the shape of a traditional film than any of his other games. Yeah, I think lean, like you say, is the perfect word.
It made me wonder if maybe Kojima felt boxed in by his own lore a little bit with 1 and 2 and what they'd built up and maybe he wanted to snap out of that a little bit and 3: allowed him to redraw the canvas. Again, there's way too much lionizing of Kojima that goes on and not his collaborators when discussing his games. I completely acknowledge that, but certainly you can least attribute the storytelling aspects of Metal Gear to him.
That is obviously his sensibilities coming through. On that level it's accurate, but obviously we know many other people make these games. It's interesting.
I've got lots more to say about how I felt about Metal Gear Solid 3: this time. But I was curious Matthew, when did you last revisit this game before this?
I can't remember the last time I played all the way through it. I have been playing it, like I had to play it for some work this year, which coincided with us deciding to do this episode. So actually, I don't know if that really counts.
Maybe I'm hijacking the last time I played it for that. But yeah, definitely in a backwards compatible form. So it's got to be in the last five years or something.
Got you. Yeah, that makes sense. I think for me, it's a regular play.
I've probably played this every five years. So I remember playing through the PS Vita version of it at one point. That's a really lovely little port that is on PS Vita for two and three.
Played that at some point. What else? I think that, yeah, I definitely, when I was at Imagine, played through it at least two or three times.
It might actually have been more than five years since I last played through it in full though. So definitely some of it felt fresh, which was nice. Does the idea of a remake for this game make you excited, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, all of this is couched in a slight kind of mystery of we don't really know what Delta is, like how substantial a remake it is. All evidence points to it being a very loyal remake with just like a big visual layer over the top of it based on the fact they've put out some screens which are, you know, exactly the, you know, very recognisable locations. They are exactly the same as they were in the original game, but just visually like a much, much denser.
So I don't know if that puts it more in line with like maybe like The Last of Us Part 1, kind of like a complete visual do-over rather than say a Resident Evil 4, which is like the same shape but reimagined more dramatically. I don't think it's going to be that. So that aside, you know, what excites me on a very basic level, even about just a visual makeover is that this game has so much iconic stuff in it, so many iconic set pieces that just seeing them in any kind of new light is exciting.
Like the anticipation of ticking off those things, which is kind of how I felt about Resident Evil 4 as well. Going into it is like I want to see this, this, this and this. Here, that's a similar vibe, and just seeing those things look slightly nicer, or just seeing some of these cutscenes and the whole thing really, this game is like crazy for memorable moments.
Like how many there are and how packed together it is, and I've kind of forgotten that about it in a way. So even with it like fresh in the mind, yeah, just the opportunity to see all those slightly different, like I'm not even asking for a big mechanical do-over. Obviously, the more ambitious the remake is, like great, I'm all in on that.
But even on that basic level, I'm kind of feeling a bit more excited about it now having replayed it.
Yeah, the funny thing is, I think that replaying it really underlines how doable a remake is. It's not so much level real estate that it feels overwhelming for a modern developer team to up-res it in shiny 2023 visuals. It feels very doable in terms of its scale, even more so than Resi 4, what was I saying?
I guess it's proven out by the fact that Resi 4 remake did not do every single bit of that game, right? So even they cut some tiny corners to make that still excellent experience.
Imagine this, they're like, we're doing the whole thing you said at the end.
Yeah, we're just going to double up on the fear boss fight, so you'll just fight him twice in that other forest, and that's all you're doing. Oh man, worst remake ever. This also made me think, actually replaying it, there are some obvious opportunities where they can significantly improve it.
The third-person camera, as much of an upgrade as it was on what was in the original version of Snake Eater, the one they added with subsistence, there's definitely room for an over-the-shoulder camera, I would say, and some kind of over-the-shoulder aiming that could go on to improve that experience that might arguably make it too easy, and you can argue that some of the ways in which the quirks of MGS3's controls are built around the, you know, the limitations of, I guess, shaped what you were doing in the game in terms of enemy numbers, that sort of thing. But, yeah, it sort of definitely feels like something they can sort of knock it out of the park, you know, when it comes to the visual side of things and bringing that kind of like jungle environment to life. I didn't really want them to do, try and do Metal Gear Solid 5 with a jungle.
I just think it's fundamentally, it becomes a different game at a certain point.
Yeah, I agree with that. I would take a game that handles as well as Metal Gear Solid 5 in this setting.
Definitely.
Like, that's really the two things I want, is it for it to look really pretty and for them to sort out the controls, because, not to step on the toes in our later discussion, but that's, they're a tough hang at times. Like, even after, you know, 10, 12, 15 hours with it, I was still tripping over certain things and being like, this is just so unnatural that it handles like this. The hierarchy of, like, standing on the ground to middle, to standing up, and the fact that there isn't, like, an instant drop or an instant stand-up, like, there's something fucked there that I could never get my head around.
Yeah, yeah. There's also, the thing that really got me this replay, right, was that first person aiming and how unreliable it was. It's like, I'm pretty sure I shot them in the head with a dark gun, but then they keep moving and I'm like, oh, I guess I must have missed it by, like, a pixel or something.
It's just that kind of thing. I just, that unreliable nature of the information you're given, it's a really interesting one with this, actually, because Two arguably does a better job of this by having the laser pointer on the dark gun, but I bet that Kojima thought, well, first of all, it's the technology factor, the fact that it's set in the 60s so they wouldn't have that. But also, I think he, there was, he was pretty commonly perceived that MGS2 could be gamed with the dark gun, right?
The M9, just go around, dart, dart, dart, dart, headshot, headshot, headshot. Now, the headshot is a lovely interaction, but it made me think that here, it's kind of like deliberately slightly unreliable and maybe playing into the fact that visibility in the forest is not all it could be, you know?
Yeah, some of that's tied to stamina, right? Isn't it, doesn't you get, like, slightly shakier the lower your stamina is?
Yeah, that's right, it gets hungry. I actually, like, never knew what that noise was, whereas stomach crumbles. I never, I always thought that meant a fucking crocodile was nearby or something.
And, like, but even, like, later in Grossny Ground, I was like, why am I still hearing the crocodile noise? Only twigged this time that that is a stomach grumble and not a crocodile. That's on me for being an idiot, to be honest.
But there is lots of that shit in this game. And you're right in that there's a lot of the stuff where you're like, is this, like, bad and poorly explained? Or is this, like, a deep mechanic that you're meant to learn to appreciate over time and that's part of its subtle genius?
I'd say it's probably like a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B for me. I think there's just some stuff in this game that I've never truly understood. And I feel like if I have to watch a YouTube video telling me how to, like, understand CQC...
Like, that's the floor of the game. I think it has... I think it's...
I don't want everything revealed to me. I don't want, like, all of its mad simulations, like, fully exposed. But I wouldn't mind, like, a better, basic training in some of its, like, core mechanics.
Yeah. Is there anything more to CQC except grab them and slit their throat or choke them out? Is there anything else that CQC does?
If you watch, like... Like, there are deeper dives into this. There's, like...
I watched, like, a half an hour video about, like, every bit of it. And it was just explaining, like, how, like, different... You know, when he does the little kind of punch-punch-kick combo, what it means if, like, different bits of that connect, different times, and what it means for, like, guard behaviour and how you can manipulate guards and how you can throw guards around.
There's the one where you can, like... You can throw them and go straight into, like, pointing a gun at them on the floor and things like that. And I've never been able to do any of that.
Like, once I've figured out this button presses grab and then this button presses, like, cut their throats, I'll basically just do that. It's pretty horrible. But I do that a lot.
Yeah, I sort of, like, I tried to choke out more people this time than slit their throats because I was there thinking about how long is the Sorrow boss fight going to take if I kill fucking 900 people in this, like, first half of the game. So there's a bit of a time-saving aspect to my decision making there. It's not the morality.
I just want the time back, you know?
Yeah, I still feel like there's something there I'm missing out on, you know?
Yeah, I don't think...
Because narratively, they make such a big thing of it. It's like this fighting style for people who haven't played it. This episode is going to be, like, quite a rough ride.
See if you can play it if you haven't played it already.
Yeah, but like, there's this fighting style that Snake and the boss have, like, sort of designed between them, which they talk a lot about being, like, the core of their skills. And, you know, there's a very big signature fight where it feels like, you know, or it's suggested that there's, like, a CQC level to it. I'm like, am I missing something here?
Like, at the end of the game, I'm like, is there a really cool way to be doing this that I don't really get? And I guess that's, I could apply that to quite a bit of this game. There's stuff where I'm like, I'm aware of something being slightly beyond me constantly.
Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. I think it's personally a system that sort of, like, seems flashier than it is and makes more sense when you get to the final fight with the boss and you can do sort of counter moves to some of her attacks and then you see him flipping her or whatever or, like, failing to counter her.
Yeah, that's already beyond me.
Well, that's it. Well, that I kind of, like, did make sense of. And I was like, OK, well, if I press the Y button at this point, then he throws her to the ground and then that's fine.
But if I press circle, she catches the punch and then throws him to the ground and takes his gun off of him or whatever. So it feels like it's almost built for a sort of, like, hand-to-hand combat system that doesn't really come into play because all you ever really do is taking guards hostage, you know?
But that there's loads of that in this game, though, in terms of like there are loads of systems which you just you don't really need on a on a kind of basic playthrough of the game to the point that you wouldn't know they exist. You know, the classic one in this is there are food huts and if you blow them up with TNT, it weakens all the enemies in the surrounding area have lower health because you've cut off their food supplies.
But like I had no idea that was in the game.
Like that is that that is like that is a deep simulation, which I think is also in all variations of that are in Phantom Pain where it makes perfect sense because it's this big open world and the idea of like if you take down this radar here, these guys here will have less Intel or if you do this, they won't be able to call for reinforcements here. But like that's the thing. This game has simulated elements that are just you wouldn't know unless you really went looking for them.
And as a result, you just don't need them. It's weird. It's a weird game.
It is. Matthew, just to help the listener through this, in case they haven't played it, how about I give 44 minutes into the podcast? I give a tiny bit of context.
Yeah, sorry. Yeah, that was...
No, it's fine. So there were two Metal Gear Solid games before this one, one in 1998 and then one in 2001. They were set in near present day, slightly near future, in the 20th century, 21st century.
This one is set in 1964, which is 31 years before the events of the original Metal Gear on MSX. The story centers on the Fox operative codenamed Naked Snake, who would later become the villain of the series known as Big Boss, as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist called Sokolov from this group of bastards called the Cobra Unit. And Snake is betrayed by his boss and almost left for dead during this mission, but he returns to the scene a week later to again try and retrieve Sokolov and destroy this big robot called the Shagohod that is capable of firing nuclear missiles and to take out the Cobra Unit.
Has that cleared things up, folks?
So, as a game, it's tactical espionage action. That's the tagline of Metal Gear. You are venturing through these forest environments and later these more kind of like military base type environments.
You take out soldiers however you wish to. You can choke them out. You can use sleep darts.
You can shoot them in the head with actual firearms. You can knife them. All kinds of combat options.
While doing this, you have to camouflage yourself by going through the different environments. You also have to find food on site for yourself. So, there are animals in these different environments.
Rabbits, snakes, a tree frog! Famously. Lots of different creatures to find.
Sometimes you can just pop a grenade into the middle of a forest and blow up like the animals of Farthing Wood and then like 19 different things fall out of a tree. And you're like, yep.
They just like rain down as rational facts.
Yeah, good eating tonight. And that's it really. It's kind of, in some ways, like a proto-survival game or like a little, you know, a sort of taste of what the survival genre would be, which is now obviously a massive, massive genre, particularly on PC.
So, not sure how much of that stuff is debuted with Metal Gear Solid 3:, but certainly a lot of its best mechanic, a lot of its mechanics are done very well here. And so, yeah, that's the game, Matthew. So, I suppose that's a good place to talk a little bit about the story here, Matthew, because, like I say, I think this is the most successful of the Metal Gear stories by miles and miles, and it's widely celebrated for its story and themes, which are very much about duty and what soldiers do on behalf of their country and what they're willing to sacrifice and their place as pawns in a political, kind of like a political battle, geopolitical battle.
And it's sort of a pushback to criticism of Kojima's storytelling style, which, like I say, quite an obnoxious amount of cutscenes and feels like narrative gets in the way rather than supports the game. And that has been a common complaint of his games over the years, but this was like a pushback to that criticism in a lot of ways. So where do you stand on the story these days, having gone through the game again?
Yeah, I thought it was great. I think it works really well in that at its heart, you have this very basic revenge thriller in that you are working towards this base. There is a big robot you're trying to stop.
The stakes are laid out very clearly for you. We have to do this to avert a world war. You meet all these villains in the opening stretch who foreshadows you're going to run into all these motherfuckers again.
And even if you just switched off your brain to all the wider themes of it, you can enjoy it on that level. And you can enjoy the central kind of power plays between Snake, the boss, Volgin, who's this sort of Russian general who is the kind of sort of the leader of the enemy forces and this double agent called Eva. And you like just seeing how the things play out between them.
And there's this kind of big sort of mystery hanging over the character of the boss, who's like your mentor, who you keep sort of encountering and she's sort of like hostile towards you, but doesn't ever kill you. And, you know, what's kind of going on with that? And that stuff, I think, is enough to kind of carry you through.
But then, like, if you do want to go deeper, like you said, you've got the codec conversations you can like ring in and basically talk to the specialists about every sort of inch of that game has a conversation to be had. And there's like deeper lore stuff to go into about all these characters. And I just feel like in his other games, those things are so intertwined that you're forced to endure the stodge whether you like it or not.
And this is just, I don't know, it's really good fun. Like, I think that's like the major unsophisticated takeaway. It's just everything like big and silly.
And, you know, people say it's like a James Bond prestige. It's not really, like, the whole survival jungle element of it is so un-Bond-like. Like, the music, perhaps, in places.
But, you know, it's its own thing, completely its own thing. But, you know, maybe this is just, like, because we talked about it recently. But it kind of reminded me a bit of, a little bit of Last Crusade in terms of kind of, it was all the stuff I love from Metal Gear, but just, like, done in this really big, fun way and incredibly enjoyable.
And maybe that's because it, like, also ends in, like, the most, it's got, like, one of the most spectacular endings to, like, any game, probably. Like, the final three hours of this game are kind of unreal.
Yeah, absolutely.
And it's kind of hard to untwine from that. So, yeah, like, you know, maybe because it is set in the past, it's, like, dealing with slightly simpler ideas as well. Like, there isn't, like, an insane tech angle to it.
You know, it's kind of Menon and War Machines, fundamentally, which helps, so that kind of keeps some of that stuff in check. But, I don't know, do you have deeper, deeper story thoughts?
No, I think you've summed up well there. I think it, you know, I think the only way in which Kojima is really, like, a plagiarist is in the character of Snake, obviously being lifted from John Carpenter. But, famously, John Carpenter didn't sue because he said Kojima was a nice guy, which is genuinely how we should resolve more things in the real world.
It's just be like, that's fine because he's a cool dude, and then we just move on, that's okay. But, I agree with you that this, yeah, you can look at Bond, you can look at Rambo for, like, bits of inspiration, but I don't think he's big into lifting a story. And I think he's got his own themes that he's interested in and interested in exploring.
And when does Bond ever explore that idea of, like, you know, duty in any meaningful way or any deeper way? It doesn't really. It's just, Daniel Craig got blown up by some missiles.
Who gives a fuck? Now let's play a song from a better film that was released 40 years ago.
That makes me cry.
I don't know why I keep going on about that. But I suppose what I mean is, like, yeah, I think I agree with you that he just, he has his own things he's interested in. And you see the way that this, that other media informs what he makes, but it's not exactly, but he's not ripping things off.
And so it's a very particular kind of story. The boss character is, like, maybe his best creation, because what I love about the boss is that she is Snake's mentor in the game. So their relationship as mentor and student is quite interesting to unpack, because there's maybe a little bit of a mother figure element to it, but also maybe not quite a lover, something in between, something very intense and sort of, like, under the surface, you know, just some very particular kind of relationship.
At the same time, one thing I, one touch I really love in this game is that Volgin, who is your, sort of like, he's sort of the stand-in for the bog, for the bog-standard, like, Metal Gear Solid, shit-eating villain guy, who's, like, ultimate bastard and must be killed, but he is scared of the boss. And you see in several cuts in, she moves towards him and he cowers. And I love that as a touch.
Like, he just had such a clear vision of who the boss is in this game and, like, what she means in relation to the story. And I've just, I don't feel like I've seen that exact character anywhere else before, you know?
Yeah. But I think it helps, though, definitely, that Volgin is more of a presence throughout. Because a lot of the other games, like, the big baddie is almost a bit of a mystery.
You know, it's kind of, you're working towards something. Who's pulling the strings? And when they turn up, like, they get, like, a fucking three-hour monologue to kind of explain themselves, inevitably.
But they are very, like, densely packed there, where Volgin, you know, on all the characters in this, I do love that you see them. You basically meet everyone you're going to meet in the whole game in the prologue. And then you just keep encountering them, and every time you learn a little bit more about them, or you see, you know, it foreshadows the powers that they're going to use against you in the boss fights.
Volgin is kind of dumb compared to some of the other big villains. He's a very, like, he's just a big evil electric man who likes torturing people.
A bisexual sadist electric man.
Yeah, basically. He's actually kind of got a little bit more in common with the Senator Armstrong from Metal Gear Rising.
Right, right.
In terms of just a big muscly dude that you have to fight at the end, rather than, like, the quite charismatic, like, liquid snake, say, or whatever. But, yeah, I love that they're constantly there. It just feels like more people are in play.
Like, it feels like a more traditional story structure, and I definitely respond well to that. The one thing I think that kind of sits slightly to the side of it and is maybe more of a Kojima touch and more relevant if you're into, like, the wider story, because I think a lot of that vulgar boss stuff can just be enjoyed by itself. Like, if you've not played any other Metal Gear Solid, that would make sense.
But I do love the... This is also sort of the origins of, like, Revolver Ocelot, who is a great villain in Metal Gear Solid, like, in the modern-day setting. He's absolutely fantastic.
And here you get to see him as a young man, basically how, through his sort of repeated encounters with Naked Snake, he's, like, forged into the sort of villain or set on the path that he's going to become. And a lot of it's, like, iconography stuff, like he's given the guns that he's going to use and all this kind of... And I do love that as, like, a more Kojima deep cut.
I mean, it's the lightest of deep cuts, really, but it's cool. Like, that through line is fantastic, I think.
It's the ultimate example of fan service done well.
Yeah.
It's like the trump card of the game, I think. It's like, if you played Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2, it's something you bring into this game, you know, with you. It's, like, something you can enjoy.
You can latch on to even if you don't know anything about Big Boss, you know, going into it.
He's really fully featured and the motion capture on him is amazing with all his gun spinning. Like, it looks great. The cutscenes in this game still look amazing, and he's, like, such a big part of that.
Every time he's, like, juggling his guns away, you're like, this is just so cool. Like, even now, there's very few cutscenes that can match this.
I'm just, I'm always laughing when he's doing it. I'm always like, here is this absolute cocky bastard. And it goes on for way too long each time.
But that is, like, absolutely part of the joke of the characters is how long he's fucking juggling these guns. It's just, I enjoy his presence immensely. Great creation.
Not to, like, you know, there's obviously going to be a lot of spoilers talking about this game, but, like, I'd completely forgotten about the very final beat with him in the story.
Yeah.
And the fact that he does have that final beat, and it's sort of playable in its own little way. It's, yeah, it's just cool. I love that he's, like, the last thing you really, like, face off with this in this game.
I like that he gets to go from being bratty villain to bratty anti-hero, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah. That's, like, a really nice arc. And then there is also a final reveal with him.
The fact that he sort of, like, turns on Volgin in the story at a key moment and sides with Snake is a really interesting look at, like, how his morality as a character, what he deems as, what he values in Snake that he doesn't value in Volgin, you know, what kind of integrity, and how, just how mercurial he is. It's all embedded there. So, you know, when you get down the line and he's secretly working for the president of Metal Gear Solid, or he betrays Galukovich in Metal Gear Solid 2 and steals Rey at the start and stuff like that, the fact that he's always playing for himself makes sense.
You know, the tendrils of it sort of connect really well, I think. So, yeah, immensely enjoyable presence in this game. Yeah, so in terms of the themes as well, I think it does land.
It's one of those things where this time when I played it, I thought more about this as a stealth experience more than as a narrative experience, just because I'm so familiar with that story. I feel like I've spent so much time thinking about it and looking at it. I agree with you.
For a PS2 era game, these cutscenes look fantastic. What do you think of David Hayter in this? I think he's really fucking good.
And I almost like... And I still really do not get the decision to replace him with Kiefer Sutherland that took place with MGS5, because Kiefer brought nothing to that character, really, in terms of emotion, that David Hayter couldn't already do. And also, Kiefer didn't sound like he had any idea who he was really playing, whereas obviously Hayter has always been Snake.
So it's just wired into him. I just love that voice, that voice when I hear it. I'm like, that is fucking video games right there.
Do you get that feeling from him?
Yeah, absolutely. And it helps. He's such a good hang in this game.
Because he is a different character, and it's like his path becoming a villain. It's not like by the end of it, he's Darth Vader or anything. It's like the first step of many.
He's a military guy, but he isn't like... He cracks jokes, and actually the stuff with Eva is quite flirty and fun. There's lots of humanising moments.
I think my big takeaway from it across the board is it feels like the most recognisably human Metal Gear Solid game, where there's stuff in it you're like, oh, I recognise these emotions. These are much easier to see yourself in, whether it's romance or respect for a mentor. These are things I think more people can sympathise with than trying to get your head around with whatever the fuck was going on in Metal Gear Solid 2.
He's such a huge part of that. He sounds like he's a bit more relaxed and having a bit more fun with it. I love him in this game.
I think he's great. You're right. Big misstep getting rid of him.
Also, having a celebrity voice in changes like the character of the writing because they obviously can't do a billion lines of codec bullshit with Keith of Sutherland. So there's a lot less of that stuff. And that is part of it.
Part of the fun is if you want to spend more time in these characters, you can. And I don't think you can with Keith as Snake.
Yeah. I think another thing that... Yeah, that's absolutely true, actually.
Yeah. And so also it also just means that you can't connect the boss you have here, the big boss you have here, with the big boss you have in Five. They just feel like they're not of the same piece.
And it's a bit messy because, yes, you have the same voice actor for Huey, who is the Hal Emmerich Otacon voice actor. But because it's not Snake's voice, it's like it just doesn't quite work. I've heard people make the argument that the big twist in Phantom Pain doesn't make sense though, because it's also Keith from Ground Zero.
Yeah, that's bullshit. Kojima just wanted to hang out with the celebrity.
Exactly, that is exactly it. If you follow me on Twitter, it's obvious that that is the answer. He's hanging out with Elle Fanning now, he's having a great time.
I'm surprised he doesn't have more loyalty to David Hayter in that role.
Yeah, if you think of it as just business, then it's a very cold way of doing it. I think it does rob the games of something, I agree. I really value him and every time I hear him, I get a buzz.
I love that the snake in this is a bit of a gun nut as well. When he picks up a custom firearm, he starts talking about all the ways that the handle's been sanded down and stuff. I absolutely love that stuff.
I love the fact that he knows nothing about movies. So when he ever has to call with Paramedic to save the game, she talks about James Bond and things like that. He's seen none of them.
He's got no idea. Normally, he's nonplussed by the stories in these films. He's like, that sounds like a dumb idea or whatever.
She's just like, no, it's amazing. I particularly like the James Bond one, Matthew, where Major Zero jumps in and goes, what's wrong with James Bond and that sort of thing. That was really fun.
I agree with you. There's loads of personality in there for this character. The reason I think that the Snake and Eva relationship works better than the Meryl and Snake relationship in Metal Gear Solid 1 is that there are all these regular moments of these regular touchstones between the two characters throughout the story.
They meet several times. They meet behind a waterfall. They meet at the top of a mountain when they get to the Grosnygrad base.
They meet early on when you fight Ocelot's men. There is this feeling of a relationship building, whereas if Meryl dies, she's out of the story in Metal Gear Solid. If you fail to survive the torture test.
But also, it doesn't feel like the connection is built as successfully. So I think that you are more invested in that dynamic at the center of the story. And it means that the sting in the tail with Eva is all the more harsh when you get to the end of the game.
So, yeah, it really works.
It also helps that every time she turns up on that motorbike, she does like a mad motion captured stunt. She like jumps through the waterfall. It's got lots of weird special effects, whatever engine they were using for this.
It just looks so good. The texture and the tone of it is really coherent. It's very rare that there are 3D looks that are timeless like this.
Maybe it helps that the ports were so nice for the HD edition.
I was constantly bowled over. Maybe the argument is you don't need to remake it because it still looks pretty great.
Yeah, exactly. Especially the Bluepoint 60fps version on Series X, I assume blown up to 4K. It just looks terrific.
I wouldn't change much about that look, as curious as I am to see what they do with it.
Apart from, of course, the floating ration boxes, which we all know from Edge are terrible.
Shattering immersion there. Just the break in the realism. What a curious choice, Matthew.
Yeah, interesting stuff. So yeah, so the story really lands to me. The supporting cast as well, the voice actors are all great.
I think the other thing is that obviously like Hater is boxed in somewhat by how Snake sounds. So he has like loads of subtlety within that performance, but the other performers get to be have a lot more range to the way they talk. Yeah, I love the Eva voice actress and the actress who plays the boss who is, if you've ever seen Family Guy, the voice of Diane, the newsreader in that, which is, I can't help but remember that every time I hear her talking.
I think she's fantastic, but I think it's Josh Keaton who plays Yungos a lot.
Yeah, Volgin I like because he's so fucking nasty in this as well. He gets pleasure out of like electrocuting a barrel while a dude's inside. Terrible, terrible things happen to Granin, the dude you meet early in the game, who's like the sort of like swept aside Russian military guy.
And Sokolov, poor Sokolov has a terrible fate as well. And obviously Snake is basically tortured and blinded for fun.
That torture scene is so gnarly that the effect that really got me was he's got this black plastic bag over his head. And the animation on that thing, you've seen it in films where someone is breathing in a panicked way inside one of those bags and it's kind of like sucking against their head. Like they really captured that.
It is a really gnarly game in places.
So Matthew, is there anything else you would change about the game in a remake? Because I've got, actually, this is probably a good chance to talk about the gameplay side more, right? So the different aspects of work here, you have the survival aspects, like I say, of collecting the dead bodies of animals to eat them that you can, keep them in a cage to keep them fresh because the animal carcasses will rot while they're in your possession of a classic Kojima touch.
So leave it a day and that crocodile will not taste as nice as it did yesterday. So that's interesting. And then there's the camouflage system as well, which is a key part of how you use stealth in this game.
So how do you think it holds up as a stealth game?
Yeah, I like fundamentally like that, you know, that enemy AI I quite like and the kind of the routine that they go through in the kind of the risk reward of, you know, do you kill people or do you put them to sleep? If you put them to sleep, you know, you could fundamentally work your way around the area and clear everyone out, which is really satisfying. But all it takes is for someone to find those bodies and start waking everyone up to undo your work.
Like, I think there are sort of systems that you interact with a lot in this game, which are really good, like, you know, that core, shoot, sleep, trank the guards, you know, I really, really like that. You know, the physical act of like crawling around and navigating a more organic environment that doesn't have those very clean right angles of the interiors until you get some big interiors. So the game kind of does both, which is cool.
I think the thing that bugs me is that there is a lot of more to it, that like, it's just there to be cool rather than you ever really need it. But I can't see how you would ever force people to connect with that stuff, like that food hut thing, that you just don't need to do that. Like, that's just a little bit of goofy nonsense, because they're almost like open world systems in a game which is fundamentally linear.
And the only way you could make them more relevant is to add a few sections where it maybe opens up a bit more and you've got more of a sort of playpen. But that you can't or that you don't need to engage with those systems isn't necessarily a mark against it, because what you do do is fundamentally solid. So it feels like...
I can't really see them making it like this today. You know, like, you wouldn't ever waste so much thought and intelligent design on stuff which doesn't go anywhere. Or, like, no one ever encounters.
That seems very counterintuitive. And, you know, Phantom Pain kind of is what that game would be. Like, that is the open world game with bigger ideas and bigger systems, and it teaches you them, and it has the kind of length that requires you to engage with a lot more things.
And I think you're right. I'm not saying... I couldn't...
I can't really visualize a dramatic remake of this game where it is, like, set in Phantom Pain World but has these set pieces and story beats. I don't think that's quite right.
No. I think that the little pottered level way that the jungle was broken up is... It feels very deliberate because the interesting thing that...
You know, the thing about Metal Gear Solid 3:, and I've always sort of believed this, because... I was thinking coming into this, how much do you compare it to something like Dishonored? You know, games where people ghost them and, you know, there's these very intricate stealth systems where...
how you're caught, how you're perceived by guards, how you can escape, how much information you have as a player. With Metal Gear Solid, I've always pretty much believed that being caught is part of the experience. And in this game, where you are absolutely stacked with different kinds of machine guns and other kinds of firearms, that makes sense too.
The thing that also backs it up is the alert system has these different phases that go away quite quickly and you can escape without... with relatively few consequences. And while there is continuity between areas, if you get...
if you get it down to the... the caution status, I believe that disappears when you go into the next area. I think that's right, in...
on normal mode. Yeah, so... so it does feel like they are designed to be treated as little levels in some ways, you know?
It's only if you're on high alert you move between places that you will keep that high alert. So... Yeah, I think being caught is...
is sort of part of it. And how obtuse it is sometimes to interact with feels like part of that to me. Like, there is meant to be some kind of trial and error to, you know, to landing a shot.
The fact that you get very limited suppress... suppresses in the game to use with your dark gun means that he doesn't want you to play it the same as Metal Gear Solid 2, right? It wants...
there's an intent to have you treat it differently than that, to... to maybe make more of what you've got in your inventory. At the same time, it's a short game, right?
It's not that long, Metal Gear Solid 3:. You can probably finish it in about 12 hours. It's not...
not epically long. But maybe the intent of this game is to have you... If you want to ghost it, you can do it, but it's going to be a matter of trial and error, and you're going to have to very patiently engage with those camouflage and survival systems.
You're going to have to wait it out. You're going to have to deal with the fact that guards wake up relatively quickly if you dart them. That sort of stuff.
Like, I just... there was... there's a military base nearish the start of the game in this, where there's these trenches around the outside.
That's one of the few bits in the game that I bothered to actually get everyone taken out without getting caught. I tried it like four or five times until they got it. And on some level, I think, that they want you to treat the game like that, where you go from level to level, and if you want to perfect it, you put in the time to do it.
And if you don't, you just... you kind of treat it like an action game where you're trying not to get caught, basically, which I think is how most people play it. So I think the ethos behind it as a stealth game is quite different to the sort of immersive sims you see people compare this to, Matthew, sometimes.
And I think it's quite the same thing. It's not trying to achieve the same things. Do you think that's fair?
The fact that the story itself can't be changed and has action beats based... you know, baked into it, you know, I would think that runs counter to some of the immersive sim thinking. Like, OK, you can tranquilise the bosses rather than kill them, but you still have to fight the bosses, you know.
It's not a game where you can kind of, like, outwit or outthink the game design on that level. That runs counter to, like, some of the immersive sim values, I think, like, narratively. Yeah, I agree with that.
I mean, maybe one thing, you know, you could do in the remake is draw out some of that, you know, maybe more superficially, is give people, like, you know, an easier way to restart an area or, like, an indicator if they're still ghosting it or, like, you add extra trophies or whatever to draw that level out. You know, there are layers of interface and, like, wider modes or whatever that could, like, connect people with, like, the deeper level stuff in this game. I just think...
And maybe that's what I'm looking for. It's just, like, idiot mode that shows me... I want, like, an idiot mode to show me how clever it really is.
Yeah, I completely agree with you on load screens, because there is no load game command in the menu. You have to quit to main menu and then load again. And if you do want to try and go something, it's like...
It's not... I've realised how much I've become ingrained in PC gaming over the last ten years that I just... I couldn't compute that there wasn't a quick load, quick save function, you know?
So, yeah, that's one aspect where there's, like, it feels like there's an easy upgrade, and I agree that kind of, like, tracking your progress in some way would also be useful, so, yeah. Is there anything else you would change, Metal?
I mean, maybe we can talk about this in the second section. I don't think it's too controversial. I don't think all the bosses are that great.
No, I agree with that.
There are some things in this game which are, like, untouchable and you shouldn't tinker with them at all, but I wouldn't preciously defend, like, all of the Cobra fights. I think some of them you could revisit, maybe, but I wouldn't know how, or I no doubt that they're going to, based on, like, the way they're talking about this game. I don't think that's the vibe at all.
Yeah, something else I thought was interesting about this, playing it now, is that I think the pace of the game really picks up when you get to the end. I think that the end is the point you get to where...
By the end you mean the fight.
Yeah, not the end of the game. So, the end before you go into the mountains. That is where I think the game has just so much momentum.
After that, from that boss fight to the famous ladder, which the ladder comes straight after the end, that is perhaps the best one-two punch of video games ever in the history of video games. So, that's what I noted about it, was that just the pace of it sort of picks up in a way where it's just basically a 10 out of 10 game from that point to the end. But at the same time, there's an interesting push and pull with the fact that once you get to the Grosnygrad base, you no longer have the jungle environment part of it.
And there is actually a bit of a contrast, a bit of a contradiction, I guess, in terms of the momentum that they want you to have in a traditional Metal Gear experience. And then also the USP of this game being set in a jungle, basically. It's like those two things don't necessarily live side by side.
They're kind of like oil and water that just happen to be in the same game. When you're in that Grosnygrad base, it really doesn't resemble the opening hours of the game whatsoever. It's completely different.
It's a traditional Metal Gear game. It's suddenly Metal Gear Solid 1 again, but not quite as interesting an environment. It feels like the thinking, though, is one of the selling points of this game is that you are going to enjoy lots of different flavors of stealth and lots of different pacing of stealth.
Even before the end, actually. In my head, I always remember the second half of this game really goes hard and the end feels like the hinging point. But I do quite like the weird little Hitman beat just before the end where you're sneaking around in that scientist costume in that smaller army base.
That's fun. That feels like there's a little opportunity for social stealth a bit more before... Wait, is that the same base?
No, it's slightly before. It's that mansion with the basement. That's where you find Gran in that building.
Yeah, that's right. There is a little bit of to and fro with Grosny Grad later where you go in and have to find the Raiden costume and all that jazz. But yeah, I kind of like that.
You know, just as I was like, OK, I've kind of had my little fill of jungle now. And then it's like, well, here's a little urban environment. I was like, great.
Now here's a boss fight. Now here's a mountain. There's no coverage here.
It's going to be very, very stark. And I kind of liked that sort of flow. I thought that was quite elegantly done.
I remember the first... What I'm basically saying is I remember the first half being a bit more of a hard hang. But actually, I was enjoying it loads this time around.
It's funny as well because it's the first time I... I think this might be the first time I actually completed it on normal. Can that be right?
I might have always only played this game on easy. So playing this on normal does force you to engage in survival systems more because you are watching his health go down all the time. The other thing is actually I thought we'd have less patience for those systems this time, but I didn't really.
I actually really loved the cure screen and I loved the camouflage and I loved the food and stuff.
If it was designed now, those things would be integrated into the game 100% and probably streamlined in some way. But I actually think that forcing you to engage is a good thing in this game.
Yeah, they can definitely give those things a bit of a UI makeover and still keep the character of them. But yeah, if you asked me when I played this originally, I can remember voicing the opinion for many years of like, I loved it, but you spend so much time like fucking around in menus that it was like a real kind of joy kill having to do that. And like, not really like, you know, associating camouflage and the healing with just being a pain in the ass basically.
But now, like, I don't know, maybe because I know how like I'm more efficient at it, or I just know how what I'm kind of meant to be doing. Like it didn't bother me at all this time around.
No, and like you, I enjoyed the opening hours a lot more as a result because I was willing to engage with that stuff, you know, and I was I was probably getting into the finding the animals and enjoying the different snake reactions to food because I just forgot how much fun character there is in those. And then later on when you can feed Eva and you're finding out what she likes as well and she has different taste in food to snake, just those kind of granular details. So, yeah, I like the opening bits too.
I think there's just there's a bit where it snaps out of being exactly what Metal Gear Solid 3's original ethos was. It's like the jungle stealth game and then becomes that more trad Metal Gear experience, like you say. And so, yeah, it's interesting to see that transition now because it feels a bit more bisected in my head than it used to, you know, but that's not a criticism.
They even cram in that very late game bit of jungle, like just before the boss fight. Yeah, where it's as if to go like, oh shit, yeah, we have to engage with this again. Remember, this is the jungle game.
Here's like quite a hard bit with you and Eva. Yeah, that bit is quite rough going.
Yeah, definitely. That was a bit of a like, oh, come on, let's fucking get through this so we can get to the end. Sorry, the actual end of the game this time.
The boss. So one thing I would change actually, if we were going to do like a proper overhaul of the game and we could actually change bits, it sounds like they're going to be very like faithful and just give it a visual overhaul, probably some kind of interface overhaul too, is that I would dial up the social stealth bits because it seems to me that having Snake be a scientist and having Snake dress up as Volgin's lover, Ivan Rykov, it seems to be a joke about Raiden that is slightly homophobic, probably, but he's a ranking military professional. I don't think he's like, he's maybe like emasculated, but he's not enormously treated as a figure of fun.
But I would dial up the social stealth bits because you get that costume, you walk through a door, and then that's basically it, unless you decide to go out into the Grosly Grad base, and then every soldier there goes, sir, sir. And it seems like maybe it's just the Hitman part of my brain, Matthew, because Hitman in some ways has become the defining modern stealth game experience to me. It's the nicest form of it, in terms of the form I enjoy the most, the most pick up and play, but also has a high skill ceiling feeling to it.
I think because of the Hitman part of my brain, I want to see, well, what if Snake has to be this guy and he has to go to a meeting or something, or he has to go into this, has to make a decision about how to discipline a soldier or something like that. What if that role play aspect was dialed up more and it was played for laughs? Because they put those systems in the game, but they are very simple and they're very momentary.
So that's one thing I'd change, is I'd increase that, and I'd increase the possibility for comedy by having Snake be undercover as fake scientists with a bandana and then Ivan Rykov. So those are the things I'd change, Matthew, otherwise. Okay, Matthew, I've just got a couple more questions.
If we take a break and come back with our next section where we're going to rank the bosses of Metal Gear Solid 3:, which seems like a fun way to cap off. Do you find this big boss era of Metal Gear more interesting in terms of story and theme, or is Solid Snake in the more modern techno thriller vein more your sort of thing? And what do you think Kojima preferred based on your experience with the games?
Oh, that's a really tricky one. Narratively, I do like the simplicity of the earlier timeline and the stakes that I can understand. Some of the modern day threats and challenges that you face in Metal Gear Solid 1, 2 and 4 are just a little kind of like going a little over my head.
But at the same time, I do love what that technology unlocks mechanically or with some of the goofier stuff. I love the Metal Gears themselves. I think they're really cool.
I like the more kind of like urban settings of them or the more like modern settings. It's tough. There's not a lot in it for me, I'd say between old and new.
It is interesting that Kojima kept returning to the past. I swear, originally, Metal Gear Solid 3: felt more of like a, oh, here's a novelty. We're going to do the 60s one.
This will be fun. Rather than, this is the beginning of an arc which is as substantial, if not more substantial than the modern Metal Gear Solid arc. I don't know how it counts, games to games.
You are watching a villain origin story, aren't you? You know, in Metal Gear Solid 3:.
Yeah, but just between them, you know, three ground zeroes, Phantom Pain, Peace Walker. You spend more time as Big Boss than you do 3D Solid Snake, which is kind of mad. I mean, the amount of him that's in all of these games.
I find it quite hard to sort of untangle them in his affections, really.
The modern setting has the more potential for, let's say another studio wanted to make a Metal Gear Solid game, right? I wouldn't recommend they make a Big Boss game, but I would recommend they made a Solid Snake game, you know?
Right.
Just maybe it's because Snake is this kind of interloper in these different stories like in Ghost Babel and the Game Boy Color game, and then, yeah, the Metal Gear Acid games as well, which are kind of non-canon. But he's sort of a more one-size-fits-all action hero. He can stick into all these different, you know, sort of like sci-fi stories that happen to have a big robot in them, and then that's kind of fine.
Whereas I think the arc being so defined for Big Boss is the major strength of that character, and therefore those games, you know? You just, you know, it's on a track to one end point. So that works really well even if you're not that familiar with Metal Gear or Metal Gear 2, the original games.
So yeah, yeah. So I think personally, I think Kojima probably preferred the Big Boss era because all of the more, all of the modern games were like about that era basically, right? And the ones where these kind of like new systems like the Fulton system and then the more, you know, the heightened simulation in MGS5, Kojima chose to tell a story in that time period rather than with Solid Snake.
Solid Snake, it felt like a story that he consciously wanted to end, you know? Hence why MGS4 is so all-encompassing as a game. So, yeah, that's kind of what I think.
But, you know, I'd be interested to ask him, but I will never get the opportunity, so I can only guess. So, yes. Last question there, Matthew.
This is more about us than Metal Gear, I suppose.
I like those questions.
Because they don't talk enough about us and our podcast on our podcast. Do you think we should do MGS1, MGS4 and Peace Walker pods to complete the set? We've done two and three now, and we've done the Best Moments one.
Like, I feel like I've always got more to say about this series. Is there anything in that, do you think?
One and four. Peace Walker's a weird one for me. Like, I just, it's not that I don't like it, but I just, I don't have as deeper thoughts about it.
It's not quite the same as the others. It doesn't have quite the same character.
Right.
You know, I don't know if that's because of, like, I don't know, I feel like I never really played that game at its peak when you could do it, like, co-op with people or whatever. You know, I feel like it's like talking about, like, an old Monster Hunter game or something. It doesn't feel, like, it doesn't feel like you can fully experience what it is now.
Right, yeah. I think that if we ever do Peace Walker, we should probably do it in some kind of MGS5 pod, and it's combined into that sort of thing. It's like the other stuff that has Big Boss in it, a pod, which might be further down the line.
1 and 4, I could see being more in our future, more in our immediate future than Peace Walker, you know?
Yeah, I mean, the problem with 4 is I don't even have a PS3 anymore, you know? Like, I just can't play that game.
Yeah, yeah. But that is on you, isn't it? Because you should own a PS3 if you want to play that game, so that's on you, right?
Yeah.
In this, I've got one upstairs in the attic or something. It's gone. I sent that console to the video game graveyard.
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, it's a...
One for sure. And we're about to have it in a very playable... on every platform, basically.
Yeah.
And the other reason I kind of want to do one is there's still no other game that feels like one in terms of how it looks and sounds. It's really its own very specific kind of late 90s thing. So yeah, that's something that maybe the listeners can look forward to down the line.
Any other all-encompassing MGS3 thoughts, Matthew, to see us out before we take a break?
Just how good it is, you know. Like, if you'd asked me before doing this episode, which was the best one, you know, I love Phantom Pain. I think mechanically it's the most sophisticated, but mechanically the most sophisticated.
But I thought this one, I was really struck with how well balanced it is in terms of, like, the Kojima bullshit I like, the action that I like, the mechanics and the stealth that I like. This is a very, very well-judged game. It's a real delight to play.
Yeah, it really is. It's like, Five doesn't really have any heart, and this game is all heart, you know? That's the thing.
It's like, it's cold. It's a cold, modern game that's excellent at what it does. And that's, it's nice because it means that MGS has all of its stealth bona fides, you know, unquestionably.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's good. But yeah, if you, you could, if you were like playing through the series for the first time and you went from three to five telling the story of this guy, you would be like, I think you'd be slightly heartbroken to realize the story is not quite the same kind of angle.
Yeah. Peace Walker has a bit more of three in it. But even then, like, it's three is its own very specific special thing, I think.
So, yeah, absolutely magic. Loved it. And, yeah, just enjoyed kind of trying to engage with it more as a stealth game and try and understand it as I always think of like the tactical tactical espionage action.
They're telling you there that action is part of the mix, that the hide and seek element does matter here. Like, being caught is not, it should not be the end. I mean, I think one of the more difficult, one of the difficulty settings, you can treat it so you get caught and it's like a game over.
But for most players, it's meant to be a game where you're caught, you run away and there's the drama of the chase and some awesome music kicks in. And it's really exciting. And I think that really is like at the core of the intent behind MGS3 and 1, 2, 3: and 4.
So, yes, those are my closing thoughts, I guess, Matthew. And the Star Trailer, Star Sailor track at the end is also banging, of course, way to fall. What if those guys will make a bit of money now that MGS3 is being remade?
That better be in that remake. If they don't put Star Sailor in there, I'll go, I'll just like, I'll flip a table over, you know? They better not go and get like fucking Keen or Turing Breaks or someone else from the time.
Like some kind of other like British dudes with a guitar band. So yeah, those are my closing thoughts, Matthew. Should we take a quick break, Matthew, and come back with our boss rankings?
Yeah, let's do it.
So, in this second shorter section, we're going to rank the bosses in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Having played through the game again, of course, we've got some fresh takes on this.
That's the bosses you fight, not the bosses, aka Big Boss and The Boss. That would be a shorter section.
Yeah, it would be. Thank you for clearing that up, Matthew. And yes, that will lead us to the end of the podcast.
The end of this podcast, not the boss fight called The End, or indeed the end of Metal Gear Solid 3:, just to clear that up. So I hope we're 100% clear on that. I will say actually one line that keeps repeating in my head, Matthew, since I played this game is, Jim Spong's the biggest thing to come out of the UK since The Mayflower.
I wouldn't be surprised if they made 20 more of those movies. That is like embedded in my brain. The guy who plays Major Zero is excellent actually.
Jim Piddock, he's like one of the dudes you see in Christopher Guest movies, but he's otherwise one of those movie that guys, you know.
He's not English, is he?
Yeah, he is English.
Is he?
Yes.
Oh, I thought he was a guy doing like a parody of it.
No, he's like, he is often seen as like the English guy in different TV shows. So I saw him in, he's in one episode of Angel playing a butler, he's British and that. He's in, he plays a Simon Cowell type.
I just looked him up on Wikipedia. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he's one of the judges in Best in Show.
Oh, well, my apologies. I thought it was like someone doing a spoof British accent.
Did you think it was Troy Baker, Matthew?
No, I didn't think it was Troy Baker, but it's kind of ripe in places that we are.
Well, I think it's just deliberately meant to be a bit hammy, but I think he really suits it. And he's like, the vibe is just so different from Campbell, you know, it's just what the combination of like David Hater and the, I can't remember who plays with Campbell now actually, but those like two voices are just like perfect. Like they are, you know, proper sort of like chocolate, peanut butter, but these two go really well together, I think.
The major being this like slightly over the top, Bowie referencing sort of like figure.
Well, hopefully he's on Cameo, so we can get him to do the intro for our 200th episode.
And I'll say, by the way, don't listen to the Metal Gear Solid 3: episode where my friend slags you off for sounding...
I'm not slagging you off, I just, I love the performance, I just thought it was someone putting on a funny voice.
Yeah, Christopher Guest movie is Matthew, where you at now? Yeah, I think Best in Show is my favorite of his.
Yeah, yeah, the dog thing is a bit of a block for me. Because I just don't get dog people at all, you know. Do we count Spinal Tap as a Christopher Guest film?
I guess, Rob Reiner, but I guess, you know, he is in it.
Waiting for Gufman, I like that. I actually quite like the folk music one.
Oh yeah, Mighty Wind. Yeah, that's, yeah, they're all pretty solid, but Best in Show has that couple who are on the brink of divorce. The dog show, they always just struck me as so real.
One of them is played by Parker Posey. I quite like that as every set of like characters in that feels quite real in terms of dog people. But if you don't like dogs, that's tough.
Anyway, this podcast, so let's rank the bosses. Right, we've got, I'm going to fly through the list of them here in chronological order. I hope I got this right.
But that will basically just remind people of who they are. So you have young Ocelot first up. You encounter him in the story a bit earlier, but there's a bit where he's basically across a cliff from you and you are shooting at each other.
That's the first boss. There's the Pain, who is a dude who throws bees at you, and you fight him in a little watery cave, a preposterous boss fight, that one. There's the Fear, which is a man who has some kind of lizard tongue and jumps between trees invisibly, shouting, Fear.
There's the End, a legendary ancient sniper, who is literally dying as you are fighting him, very slowly his stamina bar is going down. There is the Fury, who is a Russian cosmonaut, who has a flame thrower. That's his whole deal.
Oh, that video will get to that.
Yeah, we might disagree on that one, then. There's the Sorrow, which is a conceptual boss fight, where every single person you've killed in the game, you face in a kind of like River of the Damned sort of scenario, while this dead member of the Cobra Unit taunts you about all the people you've killed. Then there's Volgin, who is like a one-on-one battle, but then turns into like a mech fight.
So I've kind of combined those into the same thing. So Volgin and the Shagohod have got here as one fight. Do you think that's right, Matthew, or should those be broken up?
I think we can justify that. It's like a big set piece, isn't it?
Yeah, basically. So one kind of flows into the other. And then finally, there's the boss, the fight between Snake and his mentor.
So those are the bosses, Matthew. Which is the worst one?
I say the fear.
I think I probably agree.
But it's close.
I think there's like three obvious ones at the bottom.
Okay, what are your three obvious bottoms?
Right, I think that, I think all the first three are all kind of like much of a muchness to me. I think that the pain, the pain's got the good factor of you have to jump into the water to avoid his bees, right? But otherwise, he just has to forget where you are.
You pop out of the water and then you just shoot him while he's distracted. Like that's kind of all that fight really is. But the bee effect is quite cool so you can catch your grenades and catch your bullets and stuff.
I guess I wouldn't put that at the bottom because that alone is conceptually interesting.
I think the problem, yeah, one problem I have with the pain is that his arena requires a few more fiddly button presses to like climb up on the rock and dive underwater and swim underwater. Like that stuff, it asks a bit more of you, which is a pain in the arse, but I don't know. I just think the fear is of all their enemies, like the least interesting design as well.
Just a man in a long tongue who sort of jumps around trees and he just put on the thermal goggles and he's fucked and that's it. That is the fight.
Yeah, or you use the, one of the things I did do in this game actually is because you don't have the traditional soliton radar for Metal Gear Solid in this one. So I put the motion sensor on for the first time and they do some interesting things with that in the boss fights actually, one of which we'll talk about momentarily. But I think I agree with you because the fear, the personality of that character is not really established either.
You don't get a sense of what he's all about really. He's just sort of there.
He's the most Saturday morning cartoon villain where he's like, I'm evil. That's his whole vibe and you're like, I mean, I'm not saying the pain is that sophisticated. He's just a man covered in bees.
He shouts, pain, pain or what? But something about that resonates a bit more.
Yeah, I think to go back to my tenuous Excel episode, boss episode criteria, Matthew, I think with Metal Gear bosses, there's a few things to consider. The build up to the boss, like the things leading up to the boss. And MGS3 is an all-timer for it because obviously you do have that cut scene where all the Cobras kind of converge at the start.
So the build up is arguably great across the board because you know they're all coming. There's a setting and context which are sometimes excellent in this game, frequently excellent. And I think that that is, the worst point, one good thing about the fear is that that jungle area you fight him in is full of traps.
So there's a little bit of that tension to it. He goes in to retrieve food to restore his stamina bar. I think that's quite interesting as well.
I do agree with you that there's not much to it in terms of actually finding him and killing him though. So he can go to the bottom. I agree with that.
But the pain's close. I mean, I'm not saying that, like, neither of them kind of cover themselves in glory, you know?
Yeah. The thing is though, does Metal Gear Solid have a dirty secret, Matthew, in that none of the Ocelot boss fights are ever good in the entire series? Are they all just okay?
Because this one where you're just shooting at him while he hides behind the rocks to reload, is kind of like not as satisfying as any of the cutscenes where you see Snake fighting Ocelot. Those are great fun.
Yeah, I think I had conflated that fight with the enjoyment of the cutscenes. I think we can say that his boss fight isn't good and that doesn't dent him as a character. I would have probably defended that boss fight as a general revolver Ocelot defense, but I think he lives outside of it.
Yeah, that fight's quite annoying because you're kind of stuck behind this little platform. He's stuck on this other platform. It's a little bit of sort of shooting gallery.
I think you can do some stuff where you shoot down like bee nests to kind of like draw him out of cover and things. Yeah.
And his men will join in sometimes and start shooting at you, which is cool.
I'm not saying it's great though. I mean, it's definitely like towards the bottom. Yeah.
So if we agree that the fear is at the very bottom, Ocelot or The Pain, which is better out of these two, do you think?
I just, I'd still take Ocelot just because like, if I'm going to hear repeated sand lines, I'd rather hear Ocelot rather than The Pain. He just says things like, I'm going to cause you pain. And he shouts out the name of his moves, which is dumb.
Tommy Gun. That's rubbish.
No, I like that. And then he fires Tommy Gun bees at you.
And then he goes, that's what I hate about The Pain. He goes, grenade. And then a load of bees slowly carry a grenade towards you.
Like the idea that you've got like, oh, here are 200 bees who are going to collectively work to carry a grenade. That's so stupid. And he does that annoying thing where he creates like, the bee clone of himself and you have to work out which one to shoot.
Surely though, that is conceptually more interesting than the Ocelot fight, which is just a man hiding behind a rock, reloading. Surely it's more interesting than that.
But the Ocelot fight also has bees.
Yeah, I just, the pain of all these boss fights, The Pain just took me ages because I just kept falling off that little fucking rock. And like, maybe it's because earlier in the game, I was still getting my head around the slightly fucked controls.
Yeah, it's quite hard to angle a grenade at him as well, which is what you need to do too.
Yeah, I just, I had a bad time with him, but you're probably right. He is probably more interesting than Ocelot, he said begrudgingly.
Well, also the little water cave is a more interesting setting, I think. Like, I like it when you do miss the grenade and then you just blow up a load of fish and then you can just go pick them up and eat them. And that's, because famously fish are very nice to eat when they've been blown up by an explosive.
That's like, what happens to fish? So, that's my argument, Matthew, for the pain being slightly above Ocelot. But it is no diss against the Ocelot character, agreed.
So, yeah, weirdly, it's just a low point with that character. You do get the great cutscene afterwards where he starts, like, hitting bees with his twirling guns. That's ridiculous.
Oh, that's mad. He gets attacked by so many bees and he fights them off by twirling his guns. And you just see loads of bees falling down from it as well.
That's a great, great scene.
Yeah, that's great stuff. All right. So, so far we've got the fear at the bottom.
Second bottom is Ocelot. Third bottom is The Pain. So, that's...
Are you good with that, buddy?
Yeah.
The end. Right near the top, right? So, one or two, surely.
Oh, one.
Yeah.
Sorry, I thought you were saying the end was next. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
No, no, no, no. I'm just meaning chronologically in the game.
Oh, right. I thought you were like, oh, he's going to be the fourth worst boss.
No, no, of course not. No. He's like, yeah.
I think it's like one or two, but interested to kind of like go through this when we get there. So, yeah. So, I think my sort of previous point about how you were meant to play this on PS2 with a lower resolution so you couldn't see him as easily holds true because he is quite easy to spot, I would say.
You use a directional microphone to find him. But the staging for this, like the cut scene where Snake's looking around the jungle and you know he's out there. And like his whole monologue about how he's like, it's like one last battle, grant me the power to achieve this victory and stuff like that.
He immediately has a cooler and better reason to be than the other, the preceding Cobra fights, you know? So, there's personality to that character as well as the conceptually amazing idea of a hidden sniper fight. What do you make of this one playing through again?
Definitely a boss fight. I've warmed to over the years. I've always understood the kind of brilliance of it, but I found it very, very hard when I was playing this for the first time when I rented it from Blockbuster.
I remember thinking, like, this game's got to go back soon. I don't have the time to be fucking around with this. But actually, like, now taking your time with it, using a directional mic to sniff him out.
I really love that. I don't know if it happens every time you play it. It happened the time I play it.
he can catch you and send you back. I don't know if that... does that always happen?
Did he catch you and put you in prison?
Yeah.
No, it doesn't always happen. He can basically hold you... Did he hold you hostage or did you, like, turn the game on?
Yeah, he basically says, like, oh, I've got you or whatever. And then the camera turns around and he's standing behind you and you're like, oh, shit.
Yeah, I think it's like that punishes overreliance on the directional mic, I think. So when I play it now, I'm always putting the mic on for like 10 seconds and clicking off again just to make sure he doesn't sneak up on me.
It's like trying to work out how PT works. We're trying to work out the arcane rules of the end.
Yeah, the arcane rules of Jareth, that's certainly a thing I was doing in 2014. But yeah, that's what's great about it, though, is I still don't really understand exactly how he works because there's a bit... I went to save because I was going to have dinner or something and then you don't actually really need to save in this anymore with Xbox Quick Resume, you just turn it back on and it's there.
Although you do miss out on the great MGS3 opening menu screen with the cool music. But there's a bit that Paramedic says to you, are you sure you want to save here, Snake? So something happens there.
I don't know if he can also take you hostage if you save at that point. So yeah, she was warning me against that and then there's other stuff he can do, like he can walk into his trap and then you have to cut yourself free and he starts shooting at you while you're hanging out of a tree. That rules.
Yeah, that happened to me in this fight. I don't think that's happened to me before. Or at least I don't remember it doing that.
So that's obviously really cool. Naturally he can fall asleep in the battle, but that restores his stamina a little bit too. So just really fucking good this fight, isn't it?
Just one of the best things ever in a video game.
It's the confidence to go, hey, here's this thing that might legitimately take you an hour to do if you don't know what you're doing. And the idea of someone allowing the game to potentially go that pear-shaped. In the age of focus testing and whatnot, you just think no one would let that occur.
There might be a cute version, a fast-forward version of this, but never on this scale.
Yeah, it's also the fact that I think it also does some of the best world-building secretly because you spend time in these three quite vast jungle environments trying to find him, switching between them, trying to find his sound, basically. It sells the jungle setting so much because you are listening to the ear. It's eerie just hearing the sounds of water running down a stream or wildlife because you're like, I know he's out there somewhere, but I can't find him.
And by planting you in that area and you spending so much time trying to find him, I think it just heightens your connection with that jungle environment and that jungle theme in the game. So that's another reason I think it ties better to that core ethos of the game than almost anything else does in the game. You know, it truly makes the most of that jungle setting.
So, yeah.
He's also got a beautifully shootable head. When you do find him, he's got a big bald head. It's so satisfying just to put the sniper scope on it and just blam in.
Yeah. Where are you at on the teeth shooting out of him when he dies? Don't always forget that.
It's so drawn out and poetically done that it ends with this really dumb denture skag. I don't know if that's brilliant or not.
One thing I do love actually is the fact that all of the cobras explode when they die. In one case, it's like a fucking Evangelion cross, like fire cross kind of thing. But they all explode.
It feels like some kind of biblical punishment for all the bad shit they've done. You know what I mean? It doesn't happen to the boss, notably.
Do you think the avarice will explode?
Yeah, and trousers will go everywhere, Matthew.
Jeans into the sky everywhere.
What about you? Will calorie mates explode out of you if you die?
I'd be like a piñata, yeah. They'd just be like cans of Rio everywhere.
In all the guides, it would be like, don't worry if you haven't got any health for this boss fight. You just have to feed him a load of food until he pops and then gives you all the food you'd need for the rest of the game.
Yeah, like my shorts kind of like a hack, yeah. I do, as you must say, I do slightly regret sort of like picturing myself as a Metal Gear boss who steals men's trousers. I do actually regret that partially.
Just want to have that on the record for the listeners there.
I mean, you can have a do-over if you want.
No, no, it's fine. What, I just edit it back into the podcast?
No, no, no, you can just say you're something new now.
No, I think the trouser thing is actually quite funny. So I think that kind of works. So yeah, is that what avarice means actually?
Does avarice mean greed? I think it does. So we're both actually called the greed there.
So we've done the same thing twice.
Two giant men. Two giant greedy boys.
We just get sent home by the boss basically.
Maybe we fight us at the same time. Maybe it's like an Ornstein and Smoutite do.
We've definitely made that joke about us before.
Yeah, I know, but we've done so many of these episodes. That's allowed.
Did we also make the joke that we'd both be the big one twice? There wouldn't be one smaller one.
Okay, good stuff. Bit of lore there for the listeners. Also, we'd go to board the Cobra Unit helicopter and the boss would be like, now we're sending you home because you're too shit.
You're not good enough to be in this game, so go home.
I am so bad around bees and wasps. I would not get in a helicopter with a man made of fucking bees. I'd make such a fuss about that.
They'd kick me out the Cobra Squad just for being a fuss bot.
Yeah, I'd be like, I have to sit in the front seat of this helicopter or I'm not going. I'm out. I'm not getting involved in this Cold War nightmare.
Yeah, okay. So the end is number one in the list. And then we've got a gap in between.
Next up, The Fury. Where do you stand on The Fury, Matthew?
I think he's the next worst one on our worst list. So coming up from the bottom.
I think, go on, sorry.
I like that he's just like an astronaut who went mad. I like the idea that he just went into space, saw Earth, and just like lost it and decided to come down and kill everyone with fire. And I like the fact that he turns into like a fire snake when he dies.
That's really funny and weird. But the actual fight itself is like a big pain in the ass, I think.
I think it's a good fight.
Oh, okay.
Here's why, right? So I don't even play, like I said, I've been playing this game on Easy for years. So playing on normal, it really is like a proper hide and seek boss fight.
Like you have to basically get, there's like all these different sort of like columns in a row. And he can appear at any one of them. He can jet pack around.
So you don't know exactly where he's going to be. He's quite quiet. But you can spot him in the distance and then sort of like snipe him or hit him with your machine guns, that sort of thing.
But as soon as you've hit him, he will almost immediately do a fire attack afterwards. And when you're playing on normal, it's the difficulty I think is perfectly calibrated. So you can only fuck up the dodge of the fire attack so many times.
And that just really worked for me as a kind of like risk reward boss fight. It was like if I missed a shot and he knows I'm here, then I've missed my opportunity here. And so I ended up failing it three or four times.
But that, combined with the fact that there are like loads of bats flying around, right? So if you have the motion sensor on and you're trying to find him, you have these like little like dots in the map everywhere because the bats are there. So it's not actually that useful.
I love that as a bit of design too. So I've come around, I used to think this is just like, yeah, just fucking shoot him. And if I get set on fire, who cares?
I'll just like, you know, heal or whatever, use some life medicine. But not this time. I actually, I was, I was conceptually, I was quite into it this time.
So yeah, I, while I think it does belong, it is probably the next worst on the list.
Right.
I do think it's, it's a lot better than I thought it was.
Okay. Yeah, I just, I don't, I just, it's the, like, maybe it's the stress of playing it and like there's fire everywhere. And fire is always a bit annoying in games when you keep setting on fire and you're like, oh, Jesus, I'm on fire again.
Um, like he says, check out Mr. Edge over here with his deep analysis. Imagine, imagine submitting that copy to Tony.
Um, the other thing is that the Fury has the unfortunate, uh, sort of like job of following the end as well.
So that's, that's, that's also part of it. Um, I think also like the Fury, like is the one who gets the least foreshadowing. He just sort of turns up and he's like, I don't know.
He's like something out of No More Heroes. He's very, he's very odd, his deal.
Yeah. Who's calling him on his fucking walkie talkie where you can hear spaceman sounds? Who's calling him?
No idea. I just, the thing is like, it misunderstood. Maybe this is deliberately part of it.
Maybe this is the joke. It's that astronauts, they're so fucking boring. Like all astronauts, whenever they hear them, because the people who get to be astronauts have to be so like level headed, that whenever they come back to Earth, and they get back to Earth and then they just, they're famous for the rest of their lives for going to the moon or whatever, they're always boring to listen to, I find.
I'm really sorry if anyone listens to this podcast, loves astronauts or is related to an astronaut, but like, this is something my sister pointed out to me years ago. She was just like, I really, she really hates that one that plays the guitar.
Tim something, is it?
Oh yeah, that. And now I watch some clips and you're like, yeah, you know what? This person is really boring.
You have to be boring to go to space. And I like that this has one mad astronaut. This guy is doing a lot to make astronauts cool again.
Not in For All Mankind and Apple TV Plus, Matthew. Those astronauts.
That's got some cool and sexy astronauts. Those people come back and they are fucked up by something. That is right.
They make astronauts cool again. If the Armstrong film, the very boring Armstrong film... What was that called?
First Man?
I like First Man, but it is slow going.
It's a film that very delicately captures how boring you have to be to go to the moon. And you're like, yes, congratulations, mission success. But if at the end of that film he just looked back on Earth and it just went fucking mad and turned into this, that would be a much better film.
I'd watch that film.
That was his villain origin. So I'm going to go back with a flamethrower and just live in some fucking Soviet mountain range or whatever. Wait for guys to walk past in my little corridor.
But that is literally what he says. There's no deeper thought to it than that. I just went up there and went, I just have to burn everyone who's down there.
And you're like, great.
Do you think that would be different if it was an American character? The fact that it's a Russian guy feels like they can sort of, maybe they feel like they can get away with it more, I don't know.
There's that quite weird bit where the boss tells you her story. And basically what changes, the boss is also going to space.
Right, right.
Because she was like the first, she says secretly she was the first astronaut in space. And they sent her up and she, there's this weird thing. Then they send her because she gets like massively like irradiated in a bomb going off or something.
So it's like she's basically doomed anyway. And she goes up and gets like huge doses of radiation in space and sort of looks back down on Earth and sees that we're all actually, you know, all armies and all wars are kind of bullshit because fundamentally we're all on this planet together. And I like that she comes back and is the boss and the Fury comes back and is the Fury.
Just a very different vibe. This film is like, this game is not good for like what happens to you in space. It's a very bad advert for space.
Yeah, especially because like space was so, I guess it was the key. It's a key theme in the 60s, right? So it makes sense that it's such a core part of this game and it's represented in some way.
But yeah, it is represented like with the madder sports shit possible, it must be said. Okay, the Fury goes fourth bottom. So next up we come to the Sorrow.
This is a side note actually, but one thing I was actually, my jaw dropped to how pretty this game was, was you know that bit where you're going down a straight river and there's like those floating dudes, like they've got those floating platforms.
Those things are dumb, side note.
They are dumb, and it's the 60s, so why do they have them? Anyway, the way that area looks, Matthew, is like a fucking Apocalypse Now poster or something. Just beautiful orange sky and those silhouettes of the trees.
And the water effects are good as well, like rippling and...
Loads of fish swimming beneath you. So good, man. I was like, that's gorgeous.
So side note there, as we talk about another long river you walk down with the sorrow. The dead Cobra, a dead member of the Cobra units and the boss's lover, it turns out. So this is a conceptual fight, like I say.
It goes on for as long as you've killed enemies in the game, basically. I think it tallies almost exactly, Matthew. I haven't researched that, but it feels like that's pretty much the intent.
And therefore, if you play it nonlethally, then there are fewer consequences to who you're dealing with. The enemy types you encounter reflect the enemy types you kill in the game. If you shot down a helicopter, you will see a helicopter pilot.
Love that touch. And there's not much more to it, really. You just have to avoid this sort of ghost attack he does at you sometimes.
But I think that even though it's sort of a tough hang on a replay, because you know the deal, and therefore you can't be impressed by it in the way that you were the first time you played it, where you were like, what the hell is going on? Especially following the amazing cutscene in this, where Snake jumps off of the waterfall, basically. The fugitive scene.
Yeah, okay, there is some plagiarism in this game, but yes. It's like, I think just in the Annals of Gaming History type angle, you have to respect this boss fight, right?
Oh yeah, yeah, as a sort of cinematic storytelling exercise, absolutely brilliant, it's got, yeah, a great gimmick to it. Like, the Sorrow is quite a weird presence in this game throughout. Like, I never really understood the...
He sometimes gives you, like, hints and cutscenes. Like, he's sort of floating around in the background and things. He's a very strange, strange dude.
But for that, yeah, as a big striking kind of like, that kind of first hit of it is super impressive. I think he's got to be above the Fury.
Yeah, I think so, even though I'm sympathetic to the Fury. I think the Sorrow is just... The Sorrow is one of those Psycho Mantis type ideas.
You know what I mean? Yeah, it's like, it's that part of that strand of Metal Gear's DNA. So, yep, that goes above.
And we come to Volgin and the Shaggo Hod. I think this is a great fight, actually, because you're just really ready to take on Volgin when it comes down to it. You're like, fuck this guy, this guy fucking sucks.
And there is an element of it where he has this electric attack, and if you have a gun out, the electric attack zooms in on your gun, because obviously it's drawn to the metal. But if you don't have your gun out, then the attack is quite easy to evade. So there's a lot of taking your guns out, putting them away kind of thing.
Quite unpredictable when you can actually hit him, I would say. It's like one floor of that hand-to-hand fight. But once I got the flair of it, I really liked it.
You have Ocelot chucking you armor, which is cool. There's this platform that lowers down in the hanger that's got the Shaggo Hod in it, so that's excellent. And then it turns into a set piece of a chase, basically, out of the military base, Grosny Grad, and then down a runway.
And then eventually across a bridge, where you try and destroy the Shaggo Hod by blowing up the C3 that's strapped to the bridge. Then one final fight with him in this large field, I guess. We just got to shoot him as he's plunged his electric hands into the Shaggo Hod.
It's like multi-stage, Matthew. I guess it's almost unfair to compare this to the other bosses in some ways. But I think the whole package is really good.
It's like the, here's your trad Metal Gear villain outro sort of element.
Yeah, that's the thing. Because the fight against him is a bit like the sort of mano-a-mano fights that you expect at the end of a Metal Gear Solid, and that they tend to do. But then, yeah, it scales up into...
Like, what was... I don't really remember this from back then, but it must have been amazing to see this happening on a PS2. It's still impressive now, as an actual action set piece.
The Shagahod is tearing this base up and knocking tanks out the way. It's a huge thing, and it's amazingly choreographed, that chase. Really exciting.
You cover loads and loads of ground in it as well. It goes all over the shot. And the music.
The music is fucking amazing. Yeah.
Oh, it's great. It's one of the most satisfying action conclusions to a thing. Oh, it's brilliant.
This is really, really up there. For just pure spectacle. It's great that it has this big action beat, which is unlike anything else in it, really.
Yeah, it really is.
Just the level of drama, it just feels like a big finale. I think it's underrated the fact that really rad turret sequences are quite a key part of Metal Gear Solid's DNA. There's one in one.
There's loads of them in four. There's a really good one in four where I think you're in the bike with Eva in four, and then you just shoot this military dudes after you. But there's also those Metal Gear women have those flying things, flying robots over the city.
It's in Prague, I think. That's just some really, really good chase stuff in there. And I think that maybe it's one of the reasons MGS2 is not as well regarded because it doesn't have a sequence like that.
But this is the best one of those sequences, the way the Shagohod moves. It's cinematic, but it's interactive as well. You can shoot loads of dudes and then Eva congratulates you when you take a guy out or whatever.
And yeah, it's fucking great. So in terms of the actual mechanics of the fight, I probably would put this number two. But there's a reason that the last one has to go in that top two, right?
So the last one, which is you fighting the boss, is narratively and framing wise, one of the all time greats. I'd say the actual fight itself is good. I don't think the actual fight itself is amazing.
I don't think it's very good.
Okay, well that's good. That was me being polite.
No, it's quite messy. Because when you can actually hit her, it's mostly a case of you counter a physical attack, she's on the ground, and then while she's lying on the ground, you just have to shoot her while she's lying there, which feels not very sportsmanlike, I guess. And the challenge almost becomes, can you find her white outfit in this field of white flowers?
And then sometimes you can just sort of hit her while she's moving around, if you can catch her before she catches up with you. It's not that interesting. But that is not me saying this is a bad boss fight, because I agree, the framing, it's like it almost gives it, it powers it up by 150% as a composition, right?
It's just like, it's part of the canon of video games, this boss fight.
But then that's almost it, right? It doesn't have to be... It doesn't exist to be like a big challenging boss fight.
It exists to be this moment of catharsis, and as it turns out, the outcome to it is kind of preordained for various reasons. You know, it's not meant to be a challenge. It's meant to be this sad moment.
It's just a little odd that throughout the game, you keep meeting the boss and you never fight. You know, you fight her in cutscenes, and there is this idea of like, oh, I would really love to see the, like, the master and student properly go at it. And that is the pitch of the fight a little bit, and it kind of doesn't really deliver on that in terms of like, holy shit, I've never seen anything like this before, you know.
Yeah, yeah, it's true.
But that's the only downer. That's like the downer to it. But then, you know, it ends so sort of poetically, and like the kind of interactive cutscene element of it is really, really well done.
Like the final action you have to do is so poignant. Yeah, you can't really knock it. It's a weird one.
Yeah, you just press that one button. That's kind of what the whole fight is about, that one button press, basically. It's like it wouldn't make sense to just have a cutscene and get you to that point.
You do have to fight the boss to earn that moment. So yeah, but I think that's what puts it above the Vulgar and the Shaggo Hardest. I do prefer the spectacle and the actual interactions in that fight, for sure.
I do think it's cool, though, that she can disarm you and chuck your weapon away. That's like the coolest thing that she does in the battle, for sure. And you do get a real sense of her physical strength as well, like the prowess you see in the cutscenes.
You experience it firsthand when she's just absolutely kicking your ass. So, yeah, there are things to like about it, but I just don't think mechanically it's all that, really. All of these bosses actually have a strange thing where they have these invincibility windows, and it's about sussing out when those are as a player.
Like, when will Volgin be immune to these bullets, and when will the boss be immune to these bullets, or the fury, or whatever? That's part of it. It's like when they're running away, can they actually damage them?
That's an unanswered question you have to figure out as a player when you're playing these. But the bosses may be the area where you ask it the most, because you're never quite sure exactly what's heading on, what the criteria is. So, yeah, interesting, an interesting one.
But it gets to number two anyway, Matthew, because of that, I think. So, cool, so we're agreed then. In which case, we have our order, Matthew.
So, should I count them down? The fear is at the bottom there. Then below that, we've got the Ocelot fight.
Below that, we've got the pain. Below that, we've got the fury. Below that, we've got the sorrow.
Below that, we've got Volgin slash the Shagohod. They get to number two, and it's the boss. Number one is the end.
What a fucking video game, Matthew. What a fucking great video game that is.
And I'm genuinely looking forward to replaying this when they remake it.
Yeah, same. It's been fun. We should do more of these Two Giant Men replay pods.
Yeah, they require a lot of work. This is why we've often said, because we really like the Rewatchables podcast, where they talk about a film, and we're like, we should do that for games. But then you're like, the thing is, it takes two hours to rewatch a film, and it's like a huge commitment to replay an old game when there's so many new games to be played as well.
If we were full-time podcasters, it's something we could do.
Oh yeah, but alas no. It's fun. I've really enjoyed doing this one.
Yeah, absolutely. The good thing about this era of games as well is that they used to make games that were under 20 hours long, and that was good. So yeah.
Okay, thank you so much for listening to this podcast. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
At MrBassel underscore pesto.
If you'd like to support the podcast financially, you can support us at patreon.com/backpagepod and unlock two additional podcasts a month, one about video games, one about pop culture. I can't remember what the video games one is next month, Matthew, but we've got the Mission Impossible movies ranked coming up from the XXL. It's going to be a fun one.
And we just did the Indiana Jones episode, as mentioned. People seemed to really enjoy that one. That was cool, seeing the response to that.
So, yes, otherwise you can find the podcast on Facebook and Twitter at BackPagePod. And then I'm Samuel W. Roberts.
