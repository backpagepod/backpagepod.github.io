Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew. I saw The Lord of the Rings in the cinema this weekend. Not all three of them, though they were showing them. I wondered if you might want a humorous observation or two from that experience.

Matthew
00:37
Um Oh yeah, please do, yeah, of course.

Samuel
00:39
Hit me up. Lovely stuff. So um I would say that the audience was sort of over egging it on a on a couple of the funnier lines in it. And I'm not out here trying to police anyone's fun, but I did think you could take it down a notch a couple of places. Like I would say an unusual amount of sniggering at one does not simply walk into Mordor. The whole Council of Elrond scene actually was fraught with a bit of this. There was one bloke behind me who was laughing, I would say, uh like two hundred and fifty percent more than every joke warranted. So there's a bit at the end of the Council of Elrond scene where Pippin goes, um, great, where are we going? And that guy went, ah! And again, I'm not h out here trying to police anyone's fun, but I think just take it down a notch. I think everyone's been a bit too sort of meme-pilled and it's poisoned their brains from the uh the Lord of the Rings experience. What's your take on that, Matthew Castle?

Matthew
01:31
I can understand that. I remember one of my very good friends at university going to a Star Wars marathon and describing a similar thing where everyone would lose their minds when they say we're taking the power converters to Toshi station and you're like, what the fuck? I didn't even know that was a thing. Yeah. I mean maybe it's just a subculture and over the years certain things have just been enshrined as brilliant or hilarious or and you know we are just too casual in our love of Lord of the Rings to appreciate these things. But I I can understand wading into that situation without those references and understandings under your belt that may be It would seem a little strained.

Samuel
02:15
Yeah, that was uh that was kind of the gist. I mean I saw Revenge of the Sith last year. You know, that has been similarly memed, that film. But it's not like when um Obi-Wan says it's over Anakin, I have the high ground. People were like, or anything like that. Like there was even when Power Petin was like, I love democracy, um, I laughed the most when he fell over his chair, obviously, because that's the funniest bit. when Yoda sends him flying into his chair. Oh yeah when Palpatine falls over his his weird office furniture. That's the best bit of that film, isn't it? By far. Because the the the shot goes on for about four times longer than it should. uh while he just like slowly full clambers and falls over the chair. It's g it's great shit. But yeah, Lord of the Rings, I I think they're a little bit too hyper aware to be honest, but um Nonetheless, the scene that got me that I just forgot was funny was when they were in Moria and like Pippin knocked slap some bucket down a well. And then Gandalf goes full of a tuck and then basically tells him to kill himself afterwards. And like that bit just completely took me aback. So I was like, I forgot that Gandalf basically suggests Throw yourself down next time and rid us of your stupidity. A aka kill yourself, Pippin. And that bit did I'll be honest, that bit did get me on a rewatch. We should get Gandalf on a draft. Definitely uh yeah, take on Dave Scarborough. That would be um that'd be some great shit. Um anyway, those are my observations, Matthew. Oh, I love them.

Matthew
03:34
Thank you for your observations and thank you for enduring all four hours or whatever it was to bring us those observations.

Samuel
03:40
Well you know, I I do what I can, um in service of the listeners. But uh how have you been? Is your Your weekend good? We've um you were sort of uh doing some busy work stuff over the weekend, weren't you? You probably can't talk about that.

Matthew
03:50
Yeah, yeah, I've been prepping some s some top secret stuff for work, uh and desperately trying to get through Uh GTE DLC packs.

Samuel
03:59
You got a bit of time on those DLC packs, so that's not till next month.

Matthew
04:02
So I am lost in the damn down. I'm halfway through Gate Oney.

Samuel
04:06
U Fucking hell, you're really knocking through it. I mean I've only just started Lost and Damned. I'm I've just gotta get it out of the way. I love it when I pitch a podcast project and Matthew Grease to goes, alright then. Then 18 months down the line he's just like, fuck this. Fuck ever agreeing to this. What was I thinking? Uh okay, well, I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the game and the DLC um in the coming weeks, Matthew. That should be good. This podcast then is all about what we've been playing. Rounding up some games from last year, the the really hot games of 26 haven't started dropping yet, so it's a bit of a chance to sort of Audit things that were in our library, um things we asked for keys for, then ran out of time to play at the end of last year, which I always feel bad about, um, trying to like write the universe in that way. Um so we don't see like a bunch of key thieving bastards to the PRs that we deal with.

Matthew
04:53
Um you know, just something I want to avoid. I do not want to end up on the key thief list as part of the PR Whisper network. Exactly.

Samuel
05:01
So we do try and only ask for things that we actually want to play. Um so you know, which is obviously sensible. Um but uh yeah, it does mean that a few things get sort of like bumped out as you run out of time. Or yes, I force Matthew to play through um an 18-year-old Grand Theft Auto game with no checkpoints. These things do happen. Um so yeah, like it's uh an array of things, although Matthew does have one game that was released, um that has been released this year, and it was released this week. So Matthew, I wonder if we should kick off with that.

Matthew
05:27
Yeah, let's kick off with TR forty-nine, which is the new game from Incore. Are you at all aware of this?

Samuel
05:35
Yes, I'm familiar with the games of Inkle. I've not played all of them, but um a very esteemed outfit. I've produced a really like interesting array of stuff. I played a bunch of sorcery. Um what was the one with the alien language? Heaven something. Played that. Heaven's Low, yeah. So cool UK outfit. And this has been teased a little bit with some Sort of like what it looks like fake literature. Um and it seemed to it was exactly the kind of thing that got my blue sky feed buzzing, basically.

Matthew
06:02
So please go on. It's a little bit of a tricky one to talk about because they've been quite cryptic in the run-up to it and A lot of the game is about discovering both how it works and what it is. You know, if you really want to go in blind to it. then by all means skip this chat. I'm I'm gonna be very, very careful, don't worry, I'm not I'm not gonna spoil anything anything serious. To give you an idea of the direction it goes in, I'd say it's quite adjacent to the deductive detective games that I like, you know, Root Tree, Oberdin. type help from last year and people who like those games tend to understand that going in without any information and diving in and seeing what awaits them is part of the magic. Qu So if you just want to skip this whole bit of the chat that's absolutely fine. If you want to hang around, I will try and um talk you around to picking up this game because it is quite excellent. It's a deduction game about discovering archived materials in a computer. uh that behaves a bit like a automated microfiche machine you know I think it's pronounced microfiche it's not a word I've ever said out loud um i y those machines where you have lots of documents sort of miniaturized and then you sort of magnify them by moving around. It's how they sort of archive a lot of newspapers and films and whatnot. This is kind of a an automated computer version of it. It feels a bit like a cross between the root trees are dead and also type help from last year The root trees element I'd say comes through in the way that your fundamental task in this game is to organise this archive and make sense of it. Uh in the root trees you are trying to work out. a family tree and who everyone is. Here you're trying to work out the name of every single document in this archive. And so as you go through it, you're finding unnamed documents. You're also learning the names of documents from other documents, and you basically have to piece them together. But it also has that type help thing going on, which I hope more people have tried after our Game of the Year episode, in that you kind of have to work out how to use the machine and sort of the rules that govern it and then through that using the documents to deduce how you're meant to sort of navigate it and find other documents. So it's all very mysterious. The task is mysterious, the means of performing that task are quite mysterious. Is any of this sounding appealing to you so far?

Samuel
08:41
Uh well, uh the funny thing is I I did I pulled up the Steam page while you're explaining it, because I actually think these are ga these games are quite hard to explain and I think that if you see the interface for this as being like this 60s spy LeCarey kind of thing, then I think you start to like understand the tone that all of this material you're sifting for is sifting through is really going for, if that makes sense. So I do kind of I I kind of understand it mechanically on a basic level from what you said, but I do think that seeing it really cement it cements what it is in my head, you know?

Matthew
09:14
Yes, it's it's this quite sort of um sort of analogue feeling machine with like dials and levers, but it also has this slightly strange sort of sci-fi edge to it where you know when you start playing the game and I would say probably quite late into the game, you might not even know when the game is set or exactly what it is that you're dealing with or the nature of your protagonist using the machine. Um and all that is is sort of lying there waiting for you to uncover it. What I'll say about TL49, uh for me I think it is Inkel's best game in some time. It's just much more mechanically engaging to me. Much more of a sort of traditional game, I guess. than Expelled or Highland Song, or maybe Overboard. They do a lot of work with reactive narratives and branching storylines and and very complicated narrative structures driven by their Ink game engine which allows them to do this and you know th that's definitely where they did, you know, a lot of their most famous work, you know, earlier on in the sorcery games. you know, and then Eighty Days and then Heaven's Vault, you know, they are all quite narratively complex, very reactive games. What I think this does is trims a lot of that down in that it is this deductive game you're dealing with like a huge amount of information that you're kind of wading through. But it keeps their other strength, which is, you know, they are very good world builders and very good writers, and specifically uh John Ingold, who's the main writer on this, you know, is a very intelligent guy. And you know that that intelligence comes through in all their games and all their storytelling. But for me, I just thought this married that intelligence with a game system or maybe just a genre that is of more interest to me. You know, I I am I find it much more rewarding kind of working towards this kind of objective and this kind of point. than maybe marveling at the ingenuity of the of their branching narrative stuff that they've done in some of their other games. I often think of Incoi in the same way as of that I think of like in in literature like Philip Pullman or Christopher Priest, like they're quite you know, they they wear their intelligence on on their sleeve. You know, they ask you to kind of keep up to to a degree as well. That sort of tone, that slight kind of bookishness and natural nerdiness, which I think exists in a lot of their work I just think that's a really good marriage to like a deductive game and that slower pace of thinking. I won't actually say too much about what you're investigating, 'cause I could say the journey is is very much the appeal of the thing is like working out exactly what's going on. But what I will say is the game has this quite nice structure to it in that you're sort of dealing with Three levels of history simultaneously. You've got the history of what's been archived that you're wading through. You then have the history of like the archivists themselves who exist in the machine in like footnotes and the way that certain documents have been documented. working out what their deal is is like another layer to this. And then you have the voice of the person using the computer who's communicating with other people through a walkie-talkie who aren't in the location with them. And those three things, uh like all of them have their rewards for sort of following those paths through. There's the the magic of like working out just what the hell was happening all these years ago that needed to be archived. What the hell was going on with the people who actually did that archiving. and like why people are using this machine now. And those three mystery strands, they worked really really well for me. I was also quite surprised by No, given the fact that it has this quite cold mechanical interface and you're dealing with a community of very intelligent people, though it's some quite big ideas and some sort of highfalutin stuff in this game, that it does maintain like quite a sort of human heart. That sort of emerges over like the four or five hours it takes you to get through the personalities of the past and they the way they emerge is really nice. There's like a strand to this about parent-child relationships and the way we come to maybe understand our parents through the things they like, or not necessarily like the pop culture they ingest, but the way they sort of express themselves and the things that they take an interest in. which actually I found quite on the money as I was playing it and reminded me of a lot of things of like how I understand not just my parents, but it captures that moment where you can like learn something about someone. or someone suddenly comes into perspective a bit more, you know, not through dealing with them, but like dealing through their like work or their interests and That I think is d like a super interesting thing that this game interrogates. So it's rich, Samuel. That's what I'm telling you. You know, it has the detective smarts, but it also has a lot of stuff going on with it.

Samuel
14:36
Yeah, I mean this makes me wonder what I could learn through uh watching my dad's Avita's Aim Pet DVDs. Who knows what kind of secrets I might unlock about the man? You say it's four to five hours long? But I look at this, I look at the interface of this, and I think I'm gonna spend four to five hours just looking at like two screens and not making any progress. Like You know, you've you've played a lot of detective games in the last like 18 months. How does this rank in terms of difficulty versus Root Trees are dead or type help or like the any of the games you've played in recent past?

Matthew
15:06
Once you understand how the machine works and and what it's communicating to you about the other documents, I think the things you begin to look for are relatively easy to find and quite forgiving. The game has like a list of all the documents that as you're naming them, it's kind of filling them in on this document and some of them are marked. If there's like more information in that document to be found or like this document is still relevant to you, like it can still lead you to a place you haven't found yet. In the later stages of the game where I began getting quite stuck I had some guidance, you know, because there could be a nightmare version of this where there's just like a hundred pages, you've forgotten about half of them, and you're like Oh, I swear something somewhere said something about this, but it sort of says, well, why don't you take a second look at that document? And and that helps. The only thing I would say is, all that aside, the actual sort of detective complexity of it. It is set, like I say, in this quite intelligent, sort of rarefied world. It's not like a murder mystery, not really. And it's you know, I I don't want to say like the kind of people it's about. Well well I'll tell you what I'll say. Th there's a lot of academics in this story. And I can see some people looking at the details of that and thinking, I just don't understand this. It's like picking up a slightly tricky bit of science fiction. and being like, um, I'm just bouncing off this, you know, it isn't i that's i i i it isn't there's nothing dumb or lowest common denominator about this and I'd you know, I'd sp but I'd say that's true of a lot of Inkles stuff. You know, if you've got on okay with their other games you know, you're probably on the same wavelength as them and and you'll be able to get into this. But you know, that's why I I think when I likened them to to Philip Pullman in a way, it's the it's this you know, it's the difference between the accessibility of a Harry Potter and then an author who's pulling on much bigger ideas and much more intellectual things and, you know, is asking you to kind of like meet them halfway. You know, I think they can't suppress their their intelligence. I don't think I think John Ingold is you know, I've you know I've talked to him, I've met him, he's a very smart person and he sort of almost like drips with that intelligence. And I feel that in in his work. Yeah. So that's that's the only thing. Like it I don't think it will scare m you as a detective game, but there's a chance people might be like I uh I just don't really know what half of this is sort of talking about.

Samuel
17:37
I really like your comparison to Philip Pullman or Christopher Priest. That's sort of like smart but you know a sort of like undeniably British in flavour, but without but without being a British flavour that's like fable British flavour, for example. You know, it's sort of like It's it's sort of almost imperceptible, but you know what it is when you see it, you know.

Matthew
17:56
It's a bit old fashioned. I always it it's like it's like nineteen seventies BBC It's a bit more serious minded.

Samuel
18:05
Yeah, I know you I know what you mean. Like um yeah, it's and it's cool that they it doesn't feel like they've ever sort of made a project. just to sort of appease an audience that doesn't already engage with the games they make. It almost feels like one of those developers who is always trying to excite the same audience they had last time again and again in different ways. Like that's there's just like there is like a they say that what they do with their games does vary, but there is Like an intellectual through line to the games they make. So yeah, I mean it's it's definitely intriguing. Four to five hours does make it kind of appealing. Um I always feel like I'm three detective games behind um with you, but I'm also always waiting to find out what are the ones that are compatible with my brain. And like don't ask too much of me in terms of like busy work.

Matthew
18:49
So Yeah.

Samuel
18:50
Yeah, I uh I'm sort of like and so I'm a bit I'm like sixty forty pro after hearing you describe this, Matthew, which I think is a good place to land on. Um yeah, I'll uh I'm I'm intrigued to Give this a go. I know that people in our Discord will go nuts for this. After as soon as they hear you talk about it, they'll buy it and they'll all be talking about it. That's what 100% gonna happen this week. So uh Well, hopefully, like I say, I

Matthew
19:11
you know, I don't think we've really talked about an Inkle game on the podcast ever, not in any real detail. And and some of that has just been like I sort of admire a lot of their games rather than like really love 'em. But yeah, this one it's it's it's the thing I'm interested in the most, you know, genre-wise. And uh, you know, I think they've definitely like nailed enough of that and Um it makes me see if they do other things like this and you know, they've I mean they really if you look at their track record, I mean A, they are my beloved studio that really makes games. They make stuff, you know? That you know Productive. Expelled came out less than a year ago, I think. Uh now you've got this, you know, they're very good at judging what's doable and you know what's doable with their resources and their team size. Like this this seemed to have been made by about I think there are about five people in the credits. So, you know, Phil was maybe like a slightly sort of s maybe a smaller project for them. And because of that, they seem to have a uh flexibility which lets them dip into all kinds of different genres and art styles and that's I mean I struggled to think of another studio that puts out this many games which are this different on top of that.

Samuel
20:24
Yeah, it's very true. I completely forgot that they're the 80 Day studio. Yeah. I think the only time we ever discussed them was Maybe we discussed one of their more recent games. Like maybe we discussed discussed overboard a little bit on a past episode. But 80 Days had I put in my best games of 2015 list. So we did talk about that. Um And that I l I love that game. I thought that was like probably the best mobile game I've ever played, to be honest. So it's Yeah, I feel like I've I've got unfinished business with their games for sure. So um Yeah. But you're right, they but they've made so many of them, it's pretty amazing.

Matthew
20:56
And they made that stroll King Arthur Stratchy game, do you remember that? Pendragon?

Samuel
21:01
Oh that rings a bell actually. Um like maybe eight or nine years ago, something like that. I can't remember, but In any case, um, yes, uh okay, cool recommendation, TR49, um, for those listeners who ask us to always repeat the names of the games um because They were like eating a cheeseburger or something and just needed the reminder. So that's me doing my public service there, Matthew. Good stuff. Um my first game then is Skate Story. A game I did discuss a little bit last year when we did the um Steam Nextfest demos episode. Um this came out just before Christmas. Um and I do wonder if it maybe missed out on a little bit of Game of the Year traction. People have already done their list and they want to log off for the year. Um but it is a cool game. Um it is Uh pretty much what I assumed it was from when I first played it. So you are this skater made of glass in the underworld. And you have to eat a load of moons to get out of the underworld. I believe that's the story. Like this glass demon, basically. And How the structure of the game pans out is it's broken into seven levels and each level has a different moon for you to to get. And as you go into each level You basically have like this mini hub, not quite an open world. There's a few NPCs to to talk to, a few things to find, but not hugely consequential. And there's like a shop where you can buy things to customize your skateboard Um and then you have an objective to get out of this little kind of like hub area and then you're into a kind of like into like the main level bit of each of each stage basically. So what this encompasses is normally Um some kind of um chase or um navigating through uh some like tight corridors or dealing with certain obstacles um as not necessarily as quickly as possible, but It might require you you to use different skills in different ways, like maybe there'll be a barrier in front of you where you have to go extra fast to smash through it. And then there'll be a battle at the end, and what the battle basically entails is Um some kind of uh themed boss where you have to um string together uh skating tricks and and then like pull push like a finisher button in order to cause damage to the enemy. and um and complete and beat the boss and then and eat the moon and then the next stage begins. So that's basically the structure of it. I'm on the fourth uh level out of seven so I'm about halfway through Um I am very much enjoying it. It's like a a firm 8 out of 10 for me. I do think a lot of people probably played this because did this end up on PS Plus or something, Matthew? Like one of the services got this. Yeah, so you can go play this. If you have a PlayStation and you have that service and that's something you can go you can go give this a go. Um really good Steam Deck game, um couple of levels that are quite um sort of intensive. It is a visually spectacular game, I would say that the The kind of like demonic sort of like 2001 every now and then sort of ass uh visuals. It's a very hard style to like boil down, to be honest, but Sort of like cosmic and demonic at the same time, I guess you might say. Um a lot of like weird red shit and it's always night And there's always something there are always shiny surfaces or shiny things surrounding you, and you are made of glass as mentioned, so it's a little bit pseudo-51-y. Yeah, I think that's a a good yeah, Grasshopper a good like. Yeah, what was Killer is Dead, like a tiny bit of that? Like it's Yeah, I think you can definitely see some of that in there. But um very singular looking. And yeah, what I also like about the structure is it it does start start out as these very basic uh sort of like skateboarding moves you can do. You basically just have different versions of Ollies that you can do. um using the the the B button um or the circle button and um and then the shoulder buttons to to pull those moves together. But as you go into each stage it layers in different things you can do, the traditional, you know, skater sort of moveset you'll be familiar with from Tony Hawkeye. Um your uh your manuals, your nollies, they call nollies, right? The when you push down on the front of the board. That sounds like a thing. Um You grinding is automated, you actually just have to land the jump appropriately onto the surface in order to grind, you're not pressing triangle or anything like that. So yeah, and then like um I think that it it keeps things interesting by Giving you different conditions to deal with. So there are there's like one enemy uh the boss I just did. Um you basically have to chase these two moons around the environment, and you can only damage them by finishing a move. in like the shadow of the moon, so it's this big blue shadow following these moons. So you're kind of basically skating after them as quickly as possible, pulling tricks together. So when you reach the sh the blue shadow, you just hit that Finalize your your uh trick um button and then you doubt do damage to the moon and then continue till the battle is over. There's a time limit on those battles as well, so there is a little bit um of peril to it, but it's not a hugely difficult game. Um I'm enjoying it though. I think it's a great like a great d January distraction. It's uh one of the easiest to pick up and play games I've I've found and that's even with like the tone being a little bit like sort of like I don't know, like confrontationally sort of like I don't say obnoxious. I it's just sort of like You know, I think there's just something in the visual style and the storytelling that is a little bit pretentious and you either will respond to that well or you won't. I personally don't really mind because I don't pay that much attention to it. And I'm like And back into the cosmic exciting skating.

Matthew
26:19
In the same way that you can ignore the chuckling guy at Lord of the Rings. Exactly.

Samuel
26:23
I'm not here to police your fun if you like pretentious content. Um That's gonna be the motto of the podcast for this year. the bottom of the Discord. So yes, that's um that's Skate Story Matthew. I'm I'm enjoying it. Have you given this a try or thought about it much?

Matthew
26:38
I've eaten one moon so far. One thing I was curious about was how much more it evolves as a skating game. 'Cause it's not like a Tony Hawk. where you have all your abilities unlocked from the start. You know, you you start off at you can basically just go forwards and then there are these sort of monoliths that teach you to do specific tricks. And I was curious it felt quite minimalistic as a skateboarding system from the the bit I've played so far. Like you had three moves you could do by doing very specific button combos. And I was curious if it ever blossomed into you know, a complete skating system or how complex it gets on that front, basically.

Samuel
27:22
So i it's interesting 'cause I thought that at first as well, but I think it's just laid in enough stuff that at the point I'm at now. that it's starting to feel like a more well-rounded skating game. So you can do your sort of like reverts we spin um on the spot and like keep a trick going or Like I say, you can do the sort of like um like a manual and just sort of like tip your skateboard back and you start to understand how to grind. Like it's I actually haven't played skate, so cannot make that comparison. It's a it's definitely like you are definitely m a sort of weightier sort of skater than you are in Tony Hawk, where you're basically this arcadey hopping around kinda like you're just waiting to do the tricks. Here it's a bit more like Um i you know, you can fall off your skateboard and shatter into glass. Like there is a s a certain amount of like risk involved with pulling off tricks. But I think the way it's done it is good because You're so taken with the visuals, I think, in the first couple of chapters that it doesn't matter the skating's pretty simple, especially because like m a lot of what you're asked to do is More chasing than putting together tricks. So it is just about the s speed and momentum. Um and so where I'm at now, it is j I would say it's just reached a point where it's like I've got enough I can do to pull together some interesting moves and it's still not overwhelming and you know I assume it's got more to layer in as the the final chapters un uh unravel. So Yeah, I think it just about um, you know, passes the test on that one, Matthew. Uh it's definitely something that crossed my mind too.

Matthew
28:46
Yeah, 'cause I w I was surprised by The Tony Hawk vibes I was getting from that first hub area where there were like secret challenges to unlock and if you jump over Five of these drain pipes something will happen and here's like an NPC who asks you to do something in thirty seconds and i it felt like more of a game than I thought it was gonna be. I thought it was gonna be much sort of artsier and abstract, but underneath it is it i there is quite a traditional game.

Samuel
29:13
That's definitely the case I think. I mean I would say that the hub areas like maybe see more packed than they actually are. Like they are you can buy you but you I found that when I get into them now I look for what the objective is. Sort of like fulfill it and then just sort of bypass it and move on. I'd I'll always go in the shop to see what stickers they're selling or boards they're selling, but Yeah it I think it's almost like an illusion that those areas are real functioning spaces. You can skate around them as much as you want, like so there are optional things to do, but there's only really like one substantial thing to do in each of them, at least from what I've played so far. So Oh so you're not you're not hitting like a juicy Tony Hawk hub every hour or so. No, not really. It's not it's not that laced with optional objectives. So um but that's okay. I think what it's What it's got is perfectly fine. It has the devolver thing of being like an ultra polished indie game, like it feels like super super well put together. So It is like a soft recommend from your boy, basically. That skate story. Uh available now, Matthew, on presumably all platforms, but definitely PC and PlayStation. Um so what is your next game, Matthew? Oh so here's an odd one. PopuCom. Uh not familiar with this game.

Matthew
30:30
Yeah, this was uh this was actually sent to us by PR who reached out after our end of ear chat where we were talking about split fiction and our hopes for the the rise of the Hayes Light like you know, other forced two-player co-op games uh which borrowed from split fiction and It Takes Two and one of our listeners, Matt, reached out to me and said Well I I happen to be PR ing a game which I think is a haze light like uh you should give it a go. So here we are. Popukom from hypergru hypergruffy. Hypergruffy. I don't know how we pronounce that, but I think it's that. Uh we've been playing this on Switch. You can only play the story mode in two-player, which is the tick in the old It Takes Two split fiction box. It's a two-player co-op story mode. that feels like a mix of sort of Splatoon, Pio Pio, and uh maybe a little bit of the puzzling from Portal. Um rather than being like uh you know, a big story-rich adventure like It Takes Two or Split Fiction, you know, it's a series of contained levels which are very much driven by cooperative puzzling and gadgets, but at the heart of it you each have a gun which shoots coloured orbs. Uh each player has uh different coloured orbs to the other player which activate certain machines. So that's where a certain level of cooperation comes from. I shoot the blue buttons, you shoot the red buttons, and so forth. But when you get to combat and This is where it maybe feels like a bit sort of splatoony slash this piopio comparison I mentioned. is that all the enemies are also made from coloured orbs and to eliminate their bodies you have to match the coloured orbs by sort of firing orbs into them so that you get chains of three and they delete themselves. And you get more outlandish creatures, which are like little like men with big legs and long arms, and you know, you literally delete their legs by shooting like coloured orbs at them. And then their body just starts crawling around because they haven't got legs and you just keep deleting bits of them until there's like not enough of their body to function. But As it goes on, these orbs are used in ever more strange body types. You get like great long snakes that you have to sort of shrink their bodies. you have these like big uh cubes where you're kind of like almost like chipping away holes in outer layers by matching colours and then having to change colours when once you get to their insides because they're a different color. you have e enemies that fire off waves of attacks which are that almost look like bullet hell moves, like these huge walls of projectiles, which you can delete by matching the right colour to it and then firing into them. So It's it's quite unusual. It looks very video gamey because of the whole coloured orb thing, and it feels very video gamey c compared to something like split fiction in that you know, the levels are self-contained, you kind of tick them off, you know, there are, you know, three or four puzzles per level and there are three hidden collectibles in each level. When you come out of the level you can use all the the credits you've collected. to buy customizable things for your for your character, which is where that Splatoon thing comes from. It feels very Splatoon coded in its sort of art and obsession with customization and fashion. So it's a a real like hodgepodge of of things going on here. So not exactly like a split fiction, but it certainly ticks the box of There has to be two of you and you are both fully engaged all the time, which is the experience at the heart of these things that I want to recreate over and over again. You know, I like I like playing these games with Catherine. I like having something where we both sit there and it's not a case of well one person can just do all the heavy lifting while the other person's a passenger. You know, you're fo both fully engaged. Where where it's maybe like a little r rougher around the edges, it's got these like supporting gadgets which I use to sort of increase the puzzle potential. So For example, you have like a coloured shield uh which can defend you against the same coloured objects, whether they're projectiles or lasers or whatever. and you have to use those to sort of bounce light beams around a level and to create safe passage through laser fields for your partner and and that stuff's fine. But one of the gadgets is like a drone thing that you pick up objects in the level and move them around for physics puzzles where you're kind of constructing paths and things. And controlling your character and controlling this little drone. you know, which has a lot of physics attached to it, which kind of hammers the frame rate a little bit on Switch. That is it's just too fiddly. Any puzzle where we have to very carefully like Pick up a plank at each end with our drones and then move it over a gap and you know visually it's quite hard to read distances and where things are gonna land. Like we sort of groan a bit whenever that comes into play. And it's just and as it's part of your inventory, like i it's kind of a threat. It can come into play at any time that you may have to get this drone out and Anything that requires real finesse isn't necessarily this game's strong point, but on the whole it's it's been pretty fun. Uh you know the the the puzzles are quite smart the weird orb thing, it like gives the game a certain sort of beauty of its own. Like people should just you know, look up PopuCom bosses on Google Image Search and you'll get a sense of how strange these things look. Yeah, and we and it feels substantial as well. I think we've played like two hefty evenings of it and it feel like we're about halfway through it. So it's got that same sort of meat to it as as split fiction and I I feel like I think you predicted actually in our predictions for the year that there would be more haze like sort of clones um coming out. And this one came out just the end of twenty twenty five, but I i I think it shows, you know, there is an appetite for these things and if you are into that, y I think you can stomach a a slightly bumpier version of it just because the the core appeal of it is so strong.

Samuel
37:08
Yeah, yeah. I think um I I I agree like you can see that it's not as sort of mega budget as split fiction is, but It definitely I think it still in most instances looks pretty appealing visually. Um despite the gaminess that you point out. And I do think that I made that prediction because I just think that people are Jonesing for anything in that mold. And I think anything that even gets like 75% of the way there, which is what it sounds like this does. Um will probably be appealing to people. So it's good you put on their radar. I think you sent me a key for this as well, and I don't remember what I did with that key. Um I'm not very good at archiving the keys you send me, Matthew, but um you should get it. But but play some popcom together. Yeah, right, 'cause it's uh do you say it's up to four players, is that what you say?

Matthew
37:51
Yeah, well there are so th the core story is just for two, but there are other modes which, you know, take its cues from the mechanics of the story mode. for four players. I think they're more like party games. We actually haven't dug into that side of it. But yeah, we can definitely do that or you can come round and be a two player co-op partner. I think you can play it online too, so Yeah, be good. I enjoy playing I enjoy playing Goldeneye and your house if a couple of weeks ago. I mean I don't know. We've never played a a proper co-op game together. I don't know how we'd do rage-wise because like you know, things get pretty heated between me and Catherine and I You know, no offense to you, there's like way more affection between us. Oh I'm shocked to hear that. Yeah, so I don't know if uh Yeah, I like I don't know who'd take the lead and just if if it would actually be a bad idea. It might be the end of the podcast.

Samuel
38:46
No, I don't I don't think so. Like um I will ask actually based on that, because Catherine's very well behaved when we play Golden Eye. If I'm not there, is she a lot more like it's sort of a fire brand when she's playing these games?

Matthew
39:00
No okay, it's just you then, it's just you. No, it's my sme, it's bad behaviour for me really. Like I I can get quite No passive aggressive playing these co-op games or bossy, you know, if I think if we're like messing up a puzzle and I'm like, let's let's do it this way and giving instructions, but You know, Catherine is a very smart person, doesn't need instructions from me of all people, so that's where the tension lies. But um yeah, we've had some I would say like the darkest moments in our general relationship of of you know many years have all been video game related.

Samuel
39:41
That is so funny. Um yeah, it's sort of I don't really know why we haven't done this. We've lived ten minutes from each other for six years. I mean there was a pandemic at the beginning of that, but it's like Yeah, we've I think we've played games together about three times in that whole time and now it's I think I think we've both had the same thing where now it's looking quite likely that I'm gonna move to Reading. in a few months. It's like, oh shit, why did we do more of this? Like, and so now it's a bit of a it feels like more of a ticking clock to do it than it did, maybe. So

Matthew
40:11
Yeah, but certainly certainly this like local the more local co-op stuff. I think maybe you moving out of Bath may trigger like more online gaming between us that which hasn't existed before, but we might do that. for some reason. Well that'd be good.

Samuel
40:24
I wouldn't make you do Arc Raiders or anything like that because I just don't think I just don't think you'd enjoy it, frankly. But um yeah I mean it's I do I like the idea of something else in this space. I'd definitely be up for giving it a go. And um I will dig through my WhatsApp messages till I find the key that you sent me and make sure I redeemed it on Switch. I may have already done that and just forgotten, but um Very cool v of the PR to reach out though and listen and be I d I identify it as something that might be interesting to be.

Matthew
40:54
Pretty close to it. I I'd say the only thing I would s say about this is if you played split fiction or It takes two with a younger game or a kid. I would say the puzzle element of this is much harder than anything in those games. Uh I don't know if that would be off-putting. I d I I we're always on thin ice, because the last time we talked about what what what are and what isn't isn't good for kids, everyone was like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. So Uh Areas this podcast should stay away from it.

Samuel
41:24
Areas we should stay away how thick or not our listeners' children are. Kids and Ireland are things that we shouldn't pass comment on, I think, just to be safe. Um but yes, um Okay, that's PopuCom for those who would like the green names repeated again. Popucoms. Um but yes, P-O-P-U-C-O-M Um okay, um good stuff, Matthew. Um I'm glad you played that. It's a bit of uh really interesting thing to pull out and discuss. Wheel World is my next game. This is a game that came out last summer. Um I just completely passed me by. I was doing that thing over Christmas where I treated Game Pass like it was the the cover disc of a games magazine from about twenty-five years ago and just treated every indie game there like a demo. And um in doing so, play end up playing two hours of this game, which is an open world biking game from the makers of Nidhogg, um, which is a little bit unusual. Um has this very vibrant 3D art style. It's not hugely difficult. It's an open world game in the sense that you can go anywhere and do pretty much anything from the start. You can customize your bike as you go, and the cycling um feels really good, and the world is not not hugely sort of like filled with stuff, but it's a it's a nice space to explore. It's got different biomes with their own sort of like flavor t flavour to them. And each area is filled with um collectibles to find and challenges to do which uh take the form of um a bike race, basically, through different areas of the map. And I uh it's interesting because this got a bit of a mixed reception from press. And I do wonder if a lot of And you know, actually talking about this in Skate Story back to back is interesting. So both games that deal with, you know, a kind of extreme sport of some kind, but uh but are sort of like have more of a have an intent beyond just simulating what that sport is. Right. And I think we I think Wheel World puts vibes before um before the actual like biking experience feeling like hugely simulated or whatever. I think it's a really fun biking game, um, but it's not massively challenging. There's like I would say maybe half of the races I have to do again, like once or twice, but it's never um I'm never like stuck there for ages. And um it doesn't really matter what upgrades you make to your bike, you can change different stats on it, but largely you sort of like win races the same way. Um you sort of like there's that old Mario Kart slipstream thing where you get behind other the other bikers and then you get a little speed boosts, there's little ramps you can go over. Um there's like a boost you accumulate while you're doing tricks along the along the race. And yeah I honestly just thought if you treat this game as a You know, it came out last summer like a sort of relaxing poodle around an open world map with a kind of a theme I don't feel like I've seen that much in bikes before. And it's like that lonely mountains downhill game that came out a couple of years ago. But Just I haven't played h I haven't played a huge amount of games where you're you're on a bike doing things on a bike and I just found it um very satisfying for the two hours I played and I'll probably go back and finish it 'cause only four hours long.

Matthew
44:30
Have you ever been a bike guy in real life?

Samuel
44:32
I was like I used to cycle everywhere around my town, a hometown as a kid, and then I had like a absolute horror show. of punctures back to back. I did have like a horrendous crash when I was in year six. My little mate David Rodwell, we were going down this road He was cycling really fast and for no reason without telling me I should have saved this for best games in nineteen ninety eight Matthew because it's a nineteen ninety-eight anecdote. Um but he just skidded in front of me and then like I like When uh just like so he was just like I just went into the side of his bike and I went over my handlebars and he and we both like crumpled into a pile in the ground. One of those injuries that If you're an adult would kill you instantly. But when you're a kid, you just sort of like shake off and sort of get on with things. Like I can't explain it but Or or you're Bruce Willis from Unbreakable Yeah, I don't think so, given recent history to be honest. But um I feel creaky as fuck these days. But yeah, so um I did that and then yeah, the the punctures thing. Like I was always re I always thought that Inner tubes just seem like such a racket. Like they were just they would pop so easily and then the repair kits for them were so shit that I just found that like it would work again for like a day. And then my dad would just sort of gaslight me to be like, you're not doing it properly when I'm fixing the inner tubes. And I was just like, this is just shit. This is like shit technology. And um gave up on biking. I mean So that's that's kind of my experience with cycling. I've not done it since I was about sixteen basically, Matthew. How about you?

Matthew
46:05
Yeah, I'd I just scared that it would be the death of me, you know? I'd just go under the wheels and then that's me. That's me done. Uh and that puts me off. I've I was I'm not a very coordinated person. I actually failed my cycling proficiency the first time I took it in school. Uh because I fell off my bike. Oh no! Which is an indicator. Like a very like bikes driving test, very similar through line, chaotic both times. Um just absolutely sh I just I d I just couldn't do it. Whenever I see bikes, even in Bath which hasn't got like particularly uh spicy traffic you know, I see people cycling around think, oh God, you know, I just get a little bit nervous for them.

Samuel
46:45
So Why why would you want to cycle in a town that's got that big fucking hill?

Matthew
46:49
Like if you live up that hill, surely you're never cycling.

Samuel
46:52
Surely that is like pointless. I guess if you're going to and from other towns along the river and you never have to go up a hill, that's fine. It's pretty flat doing it that way. But yeah. There were like Phil Oanyuk and Ben Maxwell where we used to work with at Future Matthew were just like I think they cycled from Bresto every day. And they were like you and I were just hitting up like the foot-long subway sandwiches. And I felt like such a fat bastard whenever I spoke to either of those guys. I was such a such a mess of a man in comparison. Um yeah cycling proficiency. Wow that really unlocks some memories. Um because obviously you have to wear the helmets during it. And I remember like Two kids like during our test just pulling up and these little teenager boys uh and saying fucking losers wearing helmets at us while we were trying to like indicate and stuff.

Matthew
47:39
How do you know that wasn't part of the test? You can take the helmet off and throw it away, and that's when the teenagers get out of the car and you realise it's actually your geography teachers. And they're like, You have failed cycling proficiency.

Samuel
47:51
That's like the extreme that's the European extreme difficulty version of um the cycling. Proficiency tests. They had more and more NPCs to put you off. Oh, good stuff, Matthew. Um anyway, yes, so quite a nice game, but I've heard people be pretty cool on it because I think they just think it's too simple. Or ask too little from you. But I say if you go into it with the right mindset, it's about I think it's on sale right now for about ten quid. Right. A really nice like in-between other games kind of game to play. Is this

Matthew
48:20
I mean um I I know I know it exists, but uh I I can't say I was yeah, particularly Jonesing to play it. I didn't want any sort of traumatic flashbacks to that that cycling proficiency. Uh how would you say it compares to the the only other virtual bike I can currently think of, which is the bike from GTA San Andreas. Uh or the bike from Bully, um as well. Or the bike from Yeah, which is they're kind of the same bike.

Samuel
48:42
Yeah, basically. It's I I would say it's not like hugely different. Um you sadly can't um punch people um to the side like you can in bully um when you're going around. It's sort of like uh I would say similar level of Not hugely simulation based kind of arcadey. Um yeah, I'd say pretty close to that, Matthew. I bet it's got a really nice bike sound, like the wheel. Mm-hmm. Um yeah, I s yeah, I think so. It's just got Yes, it's not a good thing.

Matthew
49:08
I wasn't paying that much attention to the bike to make it really come alive in a game.

Samuel
49:12
I wasn't paying that much attention, to be honest. I mean I felt pretty engaged with it, but I I can't say I ever stopped to listen to the the wheel.

Matthew
49:19
Can you customize it with like wheel clackers or whatever those things are called?

Samuel
49:23
It didn't seem huge on like the aesthetic customization. It's more like but it's more like you swap individual parts, basically. So you know, like wheels that might have better sort of like um uh traction on sort of like a certain type of ground or whatever. But again, it doesn't hugely matter if you don't really engage with that. I added a couple of upgrades I thought looked nice and then Didn't really think that much about it. And um what is interesting is when like if you're in like the sprawling hills, the type of race that you'll get into, in like a very Mediterranean-feeling countryside. It's quite different to the type of races that you do when you're in like one of the city or town environments where it's a lot more like tight streets and tight turns and things like that. So there is like enough variety to it. Um yeah, a good game between other games. This is sort of like uh Yeah, sort of like a a soft recommend, but not quite as uh much of a recommendation as Skate Story, which I think is I think it's like a seven, and Skate Story is an eight, Matthew. So that's sort of where I landed with it. Yeah, Wheel World available now. And uh I'll ask Matthew more about cycling on a future episode when we go back to ninety-eight, ninety-nine times, see what kind of other gold I can get out of him. Um what's your next game, Matthew? The case of the worst day ever. It's just another is this another detective game? It is.

Matthew
50:36
Wow. It's a golden idol clone, basically. You know, you're stepping into these scenarios, you're moving through sort of diorama 2D sort of s snapshots of things that are going on and filling in the gaps of a a sort of you know, a passage which describes what what has happened in this scenario, so you know, so and so took this from so-and-so and you're kinda collecting words from the scene and then finishing the story uh based on logical deductions. What's interesting about this one is it's not about murders or violent crimes. It's kind of like a comedy version of that set up. It follows a family who is having the worst day ever, as the name suggests, and each episode, each case, is how a different member of that family how the day went wrong for them. You know, it's very lighthearted, but it's just interesting to see someone take this this format, which is normally about how did this person end up setting on fire? Or, you know, why is this person impaled on a flagpole or something, which is sort of golden idol style, to well, how did this guy get covered in mud? Or Why is this girl having a meltdown in the toilets? It goes to show that actually the the subject matter it doesn't really m doesn't really matter. Like the the the core principles of it. can be exactly the same. If anything, what is really surprising about this one is that it has a comic subject matter, it has a really cartoony look. So you might think going in that it's going to be quite throwaway. Where it's actually probably one of the hardest examples of the Shamra that I've played. And it's that that took me by surprise, the kind of combination of like silliness, but actually it's incredibly legit as a deduction game. Probably too hard for the more casual tabla. But if you have played Golden Idol and, you know, maybe played some of the harder cases in like I'd say the DLC of the first Golden Idol game. were the hardest things that team's ever made. I'd say it's like more akin to that level of difficulty. Not from the off, but like a couple of cases in and you're probably already there. I thought that was very unusual. I this game does not seem to have had like much reach. It's got 22 reviews on Steam. Um which is crazy to me because if you are into Golden Idol, and loads of people are, it's kind of as good as that. Wow. It's just got a different subject matter. And so I feel like lots of people are maybe missing out on something they're gonna really, really enjoy. So maybe it's more of a, you know, public service announcement that this thing exists and you should play it. I mean I only heard about it because there was uh there was a great uh blue sky uh thread of someone listing like all the the weird detective games that had gone under the radar last year. And so I just put I added loads of my list and I was like, how the hell did I miss these? It's cause all the tagging on Steam is shit, see earlier episode. And uh I like why Steam hadn't served me this game? Like this is my dream game, you know? It just goes to show it doesn't really work, but anyway, that's for another time. We literally already did it, Matthew. The the only thing I I would say it's you know, maybe like a a word of caution is that The difficulty of it comes from the amount of information you have to pass in each case. It just throws so much stuff at you that it can It can be quite overwhelming. There are certain cases which are very text-driven. You know, you'll be moving between several locations in the scenario, and then in those locations, you know, there'll be books and computer screens and documents and each of those are individually laden with so much information that it's just quite hard to like hold it all and and get it in your head. Like some of its difficulty just comes from the amount of stuff there is for you to actually manage rather than the particular kind of complexity of that stuff. It's it's uh i yeah, sort of overwhelms more than it it outsmarts. That's kind of fine. Like I'd say there are definitely puzzles in Golden Idol where you know, you get like an instruction manual from a machine and you just have to flick through loads of pages and and to get your head around something and there's a lot of that kind of thinking in this game. It loves a Yeah, it loves like a book or a here are twenty inboxes for you to go through to work out what's going on in this office or whatever. And some people might just think that's a nightmare and by all means don't play this game. But if that speaks to you, there's a there's a really good case in this, um, to give you an example of how that comic tone comes into play where there's been a huge bust-up in a social group of teenagers in a school and a lot of it hinges on working out who all these characters are and who has like dumped who or who's broken up with who or who's now going out with who and you have to work all that out from sort of secret handwritten notes that have been swapped in and sort of posted into lockers. It's a fun sort of information set to work with. It's a slightly different skin. on working with like secret notes and secret codes, you know, which I've definitely done in in other detective games, but I just think finding that slightly more silly, accessible sort of framing for it. It's quite refreshing and yeah, I I really really enjoyed this. I'm amazed it's only got 22 reviews. What is going on with that?

Samuel
56:11
That's crazy. Yeah, it's uh it is very under the radar. Um it's up to thirty three if that brings you any comfort mode. But um I do wonder if like 'cause they say in their description on Steam, a deceptively difficult detective game. And I wonder if like Pitching yourself as like if you if you want more of the hardcore shit from Golden Idol, we've got your back, is maybe like too much of a niche within a niche. Um But at the same time, I do also know that um again the same uh thirty Discord secos are gonna buy TR forty-nine um from earlier the early discussion of the episode are all gonna go by this as well Um and it is like it's like ten quid on Steam, it's like nothing, basically.

Matthew
56:52
So um this is like the flip of TR forty nine in that it's Super easy to understand on a surface level, but is a really difficult detective game. Where that is quite an easy detective game. wrapped in the language of intellectualism, you know?

Samuel
57:07
Yeah. Again, like if this came out in like early December, I wonder if it just missed like the window when everyone had time to review games or whatever it might be. But Interesting. Um, yes, I saw someone um recommend Little Problems of uh in a sim which is apparently in a similar vein to this, Matthew. That was uh I saw That's what I saw one person uh m recommend uh another detective game, maybe that's something else for you to check out.

Matthew
57:32
Yeah, it's uh it's an ever growing list. That's the case of the worst day ever. I'm just gonna say it again. The case of the worst day ever.

Samuel
57:39
It's a good it's a good service, Matthew. So I've got a bunch of different games left to talk about here. I've played all these games for about an hour each, so I don't feel Like I need to give them a huge amount of discussion um in the short term. Um the one I played least actually is Routine, the horror game, um which really leaves you to sort of like make your own way. It doesn't really give you sort of markers to fit find where you're going. Very alien isolation in tone. I know this is in development for a long time. Um but I honestly found it just too fiddly. Like it's you you're given this like cutter tool that also um can sort of like uh shoot things with electricity and you scan things with it and you plug it into all um to these devices to use it to like save the game and uh to sort of as a as a database and just interacting with that, pressing the buttons on this tool that you have, was so much work that I was like, do you know what, Dog? This is just uh I'm not feeling this and I just turned it off.

Matthew
58:36
Is this the one where it's you said it took you ten minutes to get out of the first room?

Samuel
58:39
Yes, yes it did. Um because there was like a certain screen s you had to push like three times and I was like, uh basically one of the first things the game teaches you is you can crouch down on the floor and look underneath like the bottom of cupboards and stuff to see what might be down there. And so I immediately spent about five minutes just doing that and looking on the ground for things. Um and it turned out that wasn't what you had to do at all. I mean that that was fully my stupidity. And I definitely think there's a I don't think there's the type of player who will who will appreciate that kind of like analogue fiddliness that Alien Isolation gestured at, but I think this is like more actual actually fiddly than that game was Yeah, and it's I I definitely think that the lack of hand holding will will appeal to people and the I think the atmosphere that it does nail. It does it's a nice looking game as well, but I honestly just thought this feels like work. And so I just stopped playing it, unfortunately. But that is also on Game Pass again, treating Game Pass like a demo disc as I'm want to do. A game I was a bit more keen on, Matthew, to discuss was Earthheon, which is a shmup that is has been released on the Mega Drive as well as modern platforms. So it's a a game designed with that in mind, those kind of like limitations in mind. But it is, yeah, it it can you can buy this on a on a Mega Drive cartridge. It came out Uh like last summer I think. And um yeah, and I was sort of like slowly thinking of rebranding myself as a schmuck guy, even though I don't have the real like the skill to pull it off. Um but I think the 16-bit kind of visual limitations they they give themselves it just means that it it's like visually impressive on its own terms. Like it has this really nice little flourish when your ship side scrolling game your ship just um zooms into a level and it just sort of spins in 3D and it's just like ooh look what look what they did with this very limited kind of canvas they gave themselves And um it's definitely feels like it's got a bit of gradient to it, a bit definitely like a a lot of like Sega uh flavor to it. And um Yeah, it's not not very much money. It's like say fifteen quid and I think you can get it on pretty much everything. Um but It's sort of like I think that a a big part of what they hinged the appeal on was the Mega Drive thing. Right. And so I think that made it maybe made it a bit under the radar, I guess, as well. It is still a bit of a cult genre Like you and I talked about Birdcage um when we did um did an episode at the end of last year. Um but the other thing they've been trying to using they've been they've been sort of using to promote this game is that Um Yuzo Kushiro is the composer behind the music in the game. The music is very very good. And this is where you get the Sega influence most um Most profoundly I would say. So um the Streets of Rage series and Revenge of Shinobi, he's responsible for the music in those games and so many other games, um, Shenmue, Shenby2, and uh Uh s I mean, just contributed to like so many like classic games from the 16-bit era onwards. And I think that it does really add something to it. But In general, I uh what I like about some of these modern schmups is it's got, um, even though it's designed to run on 16-bit hardware, it has got sort of like it's got an easy difficulty basically so you can still play it even if you're shit at these games like we are and this is again how I how I felt about um birdcage where it's calibrated nicely to your skill level Um this is still really hard to play on easy mode. Like I got to there's eight stages and I got to the end of stage four. Um and uh I was pretty impressed with myself for doing that, but um I think to complete it will require a lot more of sort of memorizing the the layouts of the different levels and being prepared for them and that sort of thing Um and I also think that it's it's it's got like a couple of other touches that make it feel a little bit more contemporary. So You have like both this like shot level um bar and like a shield level bar. So if you're hit, it's not necessarily over. And if you kill a bunch of enemies, you can collect power-ups to like get your health back up. Right. And that again feels like quite forgiving for games of this era. Like I feel like a lot of like treasure games you're like you get like touched once or twice and you're just completely fucked basically. Um this this just feels like you're always clawing back health after you go through like a fight. Um also has the thing I really like from uh this is where I I get into a bit of the territory of like um that kind of like boss baby um movie tweets about Where I'm like, basically it's got Einhanders thing of like you um you have like a loadout of weapons and you you can pick up You can change the loadout as you go. So you can swap out one weapon for another and then you can cycle through the different weapons you've got on the fly as you go. So you might have you know like be pummeling enemies with missiles. You might have this like um for like fire, sort of like a flamethrower effect that pops out of your screen. You might have an a uh sort of like ammo that fires in all the different directions around you so you can hit all the enemies in sight. And then um it has one where you're basically like dropping bombs onto the level below and the level design is clearly built for you to like respond to the changing layout of the level with the different power-ups that you've got. In general, I just think this is a really cool game. Um and it's just uh yeah, like the Mega Drive thing is like a novel touch, but it's uh a great schmup in its own right if you're f if you're kind of like curious about this genre, Matthew. So uh Yeah, another soft recommend from the boy.

Matthew
01:04:05
It's a it's a a genre I'd love to know more about and be better at. Like the the the f the very few that I've played, you know, I always enjoy them, you know, I enjoy the aesthetics and the sound and the general spirit of the thing, but uh I always feel very nervous talking about them. Like I don't have the experience or vocabulary to do them justice. Yeah, same.

Samuel
01:04:28
Um the yeah I dabble with them anyway because They are like bastions of some of the best like art and music in any game. And so that's why I feel like I can't turn a blind eye to them. There's too much of Too much of gaming's history and greatness is tied up in them. Um, so the idea of like there being this newer generation of them that Sort of riff on the the old generation, but they have like lowered the bar of entry a little bit for for players. I I like that and I think it's I kind of want to meet them halfway where they m they make those kind of design decisions, you know, to appeal to losers like me who simply are not talented enough to finish them on normal difficulties, Murphy. So um That's Earthian, um, as mentioned, available on I think it's pretty much on everything, but definitely on Steam. I played on Steam Deck. Good Steam Deck game as you might expect for a Mega Drive game. And um yeah, and the other thing I've been playing, I've finally checked out a bit of Matthew Castle's beloved The Seance of Blake Banner. No, this is a really good game. And it's This, I would say more than any other detective game you've just you've discussed on this podcast is for dummies, I think. And because I don't think you can really Like I don't think you really struggle to make progress, because it's sort of like everything you need is there to go and find in this manner. And it's really just about the order in which you you kind of unlock the next bit of progress or the next bit of information. Like it's it's like you said, it's sort of it's not really a detective game once you have the full shape of it, and I I definitely don't at this point, but I can already see that it's sort of like it's a game that wants you to feel smart. Even though I don't think it's like asking you to be that smart a lot of the time, if that makes sense. It's it it's getting you to make really simple A to B connections in most cases. And The atmosphere and the voice acting and the writing it sort of really adds to it to be honest. I'm I'm enjoying it.

Matthew
01:06:23
I think you get to roleplay as a detective in a story more than you actually have to be a detective in that story. That's a good way of putting it for sure.

Samuel
01:06:31
Yeah, and it's it just looks really nice as well. And I I think it's just it's just the format of it and the way it gives you information. Is very Moorish. And so I think it really is really good at sinking its hooks into you right away. So yeah, I I really like this. I will finish this, Matthew. Nice. Um I'm very yeah, it's really good. It's the out of all the different games you talked about At the end of last year, I thought this is the one that would probably appeal to me the most because it's it's a it's the it's the it asks the least of you, basically. Um, which is maybe just where I'm at mentally. And then the the last game I was going to mention this little roundup was um was Demon School, um which I've uh played a about a couple of hours of. And this is best described as like a sort of a mix of into the breach and maybe a bit of Marvel's Midnight Sun's sort of turn-based combat, like a lot of making dudes like bounce into other dudes type of um type of grid-based combat. With a little bit of Shin Magami Tensei visual flavoring to it. Um maybe you'd say persona out of reach, but I don't massively see that. And then I think that It's it's it's just it's the tone of game in terms of story and characters where I think it might really appeal to a a certain type of really online person and then it might put off a lot of other people, but I do think that if the if the combat is your sort of thing, it's a really good version of that kind of combat. I don't mind the kind of narrative flavouring. This game has some beautiful props in it. Like really nice 3D props. It sort of looks like a deluxe ass PS1 game. Yeah, even though it this had a little bit of hype for a while, it did feel like it ultimately went under the radar a little bit at the end of last year. So yeah, Demon's School, it's um it's pretty cool. I don't know if I'll get through the whole thing, but it's um It's it's definitely got some I definitely think there are some of our listeners who will enjoy it, Matthew.

Matthew
01:08:23
Yeah, I I I haven't given it a go yet, but I definitely sensed in the reviews there was a split between people who found it like tonally and aesthetically it was like so much their jam and they projected a lot of their you know personal likes onto you know their I've sort of You know, there were a lot of reviews which the the more positive reviews read like very personal outpourings of love, you know, like I love X, Y, and Z and this remind me of those things. where I think the cooler reviews were the tone of it and the snark of it and the humour of it kind of held me a bit at arm's length and I I just couldn't really get into it. And The things that people were liking it too weren't necessarily things that I had a huge emotional connection to, so I just assumed it wouldn't be for me. But I've since heard a lot more. There was a great interview actually with um is it Brandon Sheffield who directed this and he did a great he came onto an episode of the US gaming podcast into the ether and they it was quite funny. They'd just done like a quite glowing review episode of talking about this and and doing a fair amount of that sort of projecting like, oh it's really like this and it's really like this and it was quite funny to hear him come on and not in a critical way but say actually this this and this didn't really factor into my thinking at all and he you know, he seemed qu quietly bemused that so many people had projected so much onto it. I would say that's probably a big success from him, that he's obviously uh place this game in such a way that it can mean all these different things to all these different people. Like that sounds like quite a skill, but I listening to that interview almost made me want to play the game finally, because I was like, oh I quite like this guy. And, you know, I quite like his outlook on it and it that it it made me laugh to hear him sort of say, you know, great, I'm glad I'm glad you think it was based on this, but I think he referenced like someone said Oh it's really like Buffy the Vampire Slayer And he's like a show I've never seen And I just I I like that 'cause we do that all the time. We're like oh it must You know, we love our little narratives about, oh this must have been so, or this must have happened, or I can't believe this person hasn't also played this and you're wrong so much of the time with that stuff. Uh which is a a long-winded way of saying, yes, I shall play this.

Samuel
01:10:46
Well it's sort I think you hate the tone of this sort of to be honest. Uh the characters. I I don't think you'll get on with it at all, but I do think you'll appreciate how it looks and sort of feels. Um, I think the combat is good. I think that that's really interesting to hear about the influencers. What what it reminded me of is a little bit is Paradise Killer where The art style captures a set of influences and like a time frame of like game development, but you can't exactly put your finger. on what the one thing is that really informed it. And so I think that because of the the overall slightly demonic feel of it and all the sort of teenage type characters, like maybe Shin Bagami Tensei It does make sense that people would kind of use that as a as a reference point, but it's a school as well, right? Yeah, it's as it is a it is a school. But what I also wondered if like Maybe that um Brann and Sheffield had just played like fucking tons of Sega Saturn games and tons of PS1 games, and that collective sort of like memory of those games, like out of that conjures this quite original feeling thing that does have, you know, loads of connections back to games you might have played before. So that might have been without hearing that interview, that might have been what happened. But it certainly the game feels like it's taking from a particular era, even if he says that the the influences are not necessarily what people might assume they are. Yeah, an interesting game. This is on everything as well. Um I don't know how much it is, but uh it does feel like they've gone up they've gone quite all out with it in terms of how it looks and feels. I know they're working it for quite a few years. Uh I met Brandon very briefly at GDC twenty twenty three actually, like Wes um from PC Gamer introduced me to him, seemed like a very nice man. Uh so yeah, I don't know. I I I might go listen to that interview actually, 'cause it might um might actually galvanize me to get through uh more of it. But But yeah, so far so good. I think it's a pretty, pretty solid seeming game if you can if the yak doesn't put you off. Um and it may. So finally Matthew, um I thought we should talk about Berlin Apartment, which is a game we've both played. Do you want to lead on this one?

Matthew
01:12:49
Yeah. I so I'll say up front, I haven't quite finished this, even though it's only like meant to be about four hours long, but This is a I'd say like a f a first person narrative experience, a walking simulator maybe. probably closest in the vein to uh Edith Finch, in that it interrogates the different lives of people who lived in this Berlin apartment. The setup is at the start you have uh a decorator is preparing this apartment for sale and you are uh their kid who's kind of tagged along for the day. And as you walk around this apartment and sort of tear off the wallpaper and demolish the bathroom tiles you find objects sort of hidden in the walls, or maybe like painted onto the walls, which act as a sort of doorway to a previous resident who lived there, and then you sort of flash back to a story which shows you sort of how that came to be. And that's that's really the defense of it in that you have a central location which you're exploring in modern day and as you explore it it's triggering these other episodes. From what I've played of it, the episode, it it's n not as like fast on its feet as Zedith Finch, like where that took you into the lives of ten, fifteen people or something. Um I get the feeling here it's maybe four or five and they're longer so each episode's maybe half an hour long, say. You know, the first one, uh, you go back is sort of uh set in a uh Cold War? Yeah, kinda Cold War. You're in East East Berlin, next to the Berlin Wall, and it's about a a relationship that sparks up with a a person who lives on the other side of the wall who you communicate to through paper aeroplanes. And again it has that Edith Finchy thing where different sections of this game have different mini games that sort of come to define them or just like a little moment of interaction that only exists there. So, you know, in this episode the the act of sort of making the the paper aeroplane and then throwing it, you get this very short sort of twenty-second game where you have to sort of pilot a paper aeroplane. through various wind gusts to reach this other person's windows and you know, it only exists for that portion of the tale. Really, I feel like what really matters is the storytelling going on around those games. It has this like slightly like magical realism thing going on, like in in that Cold War episode, for example, like you've got this talking goldfish, I think it is. I wondered at first if it might be sort of pulling its punches in that it's dealing with some quite heavy historical stuff, but it also doesn't want to be like a major buzzkill. So it has like this slight sort of oddness to it or fantasy elements. But I don't think that's entirely true. You know, I think it's it never like r from what I've played anyway, or maybe the end takes quite a severe twist. I wouldn't say it ever, like, really rubs your face in like abject horror or anything, but it's it's constantly aware of the historical significance of the periods you are in and maybe one of its better tricks actually is you come to it with hindsight and you know what's gonna happen to some of these people or you know what their lives sort of denote based on like who they are and when they are like what it is to be a family in the the run up to Hitler, you know, what's coming, for example. And you can apply that and you can understand the seriousness of the situation. And I did wonder if the game was you know, broadly trying to say in the moment these are just quite regular people who don't know that they're part of history, or they don't know that they're making history, or they don't know how important their lives uh you know what their lives are gonna signify and mean down the line and having not finished it I don't know if they sort of tie a bow on that idea at the end. But it I I don't know, I like I like it. Yeah, me too. I I I th I think it's it's it it treads quite a delicate line between mawkishness. and the historical importance of this and and being a bit lighter and a bit more like lived in, maybe.

Samuel
01:17:17
Yeah, I think that the slice of life kind of um sort of perspective of the game amid amid like uh like a hist periods of historical significance, like you say, just means it offsets the kind of like any potential overwrought storytelling. So it just helps it to feel grounded when even though you you're in moments where either something's about to happen or something has happened. Um and I do think that that's like a a smart kind of storytelling sort of like tone for a game like this because it does mean that You know, the the obvious like narrative is kind of pulling you through it, but I just don't I think it just it's way better than trying to dial it up to a hundred and ten percent and just have you be in tears at the end of every single section. Right. Um it's just not it's not that kind of game. It's just a bit it feels a bit more mature for having not done that. And I don't I don't really respond to games that do that kind of thing anymore. It feels more like what indie games did about ten, fifteen years ago. Um by the way, that paper airplane bit, if this was like a PSN download game, that absolutely would have been a six axis bit um back in the PS3 days. Um I I did think that when I was playing it. Um The other thing is that that fish really reminded me of Klaus from American Dad, the talk the German talking goldfish. That also came to mind. I also did this game also remind you of the Zemeckas film here, Matthew? Because that too is all set in like one place across different time periods. And it's a bit unusual to have like two things in like a couple of years that that do a similar thing where it's like one space and how it transforms over time and the people who live in it. But that is a film that really dials it up emotionally. Um whereas this game has a bit more restraint than that, you know?

Matthew
01:19:07
Yeah, I think so. I liked how The sections that I've played, the the people are so sort of unimportant and regular in the grand scheme of things. You know, that's quite winning. Like the guy in the first section is you know, you he he doesn't see hims you know, he doesn't see himself at like a major point in history. He doesn't see the import you know that he's living next to the wall and you know what it really means to be communicating with this this person on the other side of the wall. Like he's just like a slightly lonely guy, moans about the shitty food he has. You know, he's just a b quite a believable sort of schlub. I um I I assume he's a schlub. In my head he's a schlub. Um we don't actually get to see him, but he has that energy. It's like one it's like if one of us was there. That's what that we'd be like.

Samuel
01:19:55
For sure. The the other thing I thought I've only got through a couple of the chapters of this. The other thing I thought was that the game is showing you kind of like circumstances that games otherwise don't normally put you in. So it's quite weird to see the wall For example, it's quite weird to see like uh what would be like a Security outpost because you're like, oh, I've never really I've never played a game that made me experience anything like this. I've played loads of like World War II games and spy games set amid the Cold War, but the idea of being like this close to a to a wall, but of course everyday life would be getting on with things. And I do like the idea of using a an adventure game as a as a prism to present that kind of um that kind of historical moment. Um it does feel original in that respect. Like it's How you interact with the game is not it's not it feels like a blend of things you would have played before, but it's still like a if you if you think the I think Eda Finch is a good touch point if you like a game if you like the game in that Fane, you'll like this too, as long as you're not expecting it to be as sort of lavishly cinematic or stylistic as that is, you know?

Matthew
01:20:57
Yeah, I think that game takes like bigger swings in a way.

Samuel
01:21:00
Yeah But um a cool little game for sure. And another game that's just gone under the radar from last year, because it released in, you know, mid-November when people were probably playing, I don't know. Ghost of Yote or whatever. But uh yeah. Good stuff Matthew. It is quite different. So that game is the Berlin Apartment public service um completed there, Matthew. And uh yeah, quite quite a lot of games we wrapped up into one episode there. And um yeah, enjoyable. I mean it's I don't know if any of those would like go I don't think any of those would invade my top ten from last year so far, but I've I've still got more to play from last year.

Matthew
01:21:34
I think I don't know if I could have put just yet more detective games in my top ten. Um the k yeah, the case the the worst day ever. I mean it's you know, it's it's it's as good as things that I have put in my top ten before. But it also doesn't break any like new ground particularly. It's just more of it. You know, like last year I didn't put the Golden Idol DLC in my top ten. s something else going on under the hood to move the needle really.

Samuel
01:22:05
Yeah, but these are these are all things I played in between, you know, after finishing GTA four basically, or before playing GTA four. Yeah and It's nice to have these games that you play for like five to six hours and kind of get on with your life. And I think most of what I discussed there apart from Blake Manor and Demon School. I I would say it kind of fits that bill. Um so yeah, a nice a nice start to the year, really. And uh yeah, I'll probably play a few more things before The big games really kick off. Um there are plenty of them to come this year as we've discussed before. So Matthew, where can people get you on social media? I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. I'm Samuel W.
