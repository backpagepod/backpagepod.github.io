Hello and welcome to the back page of video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew, how was your working week of hell? As I don't know if you put it that way, but um certainly it sounded like you took on too much work. And then we're gonna collapse under the weight of your own hubris trying to finish the damn stuff.

Matthew
00:42
Yeah, I I agreed to do lots of stuff and then loads of things collided at the same time and yeah, it ended up being A real slug. Um so you've caught me at my most weak where I'm most likely to botch. This N64 mini draft.

Samuel
01:00
Every time we do a draft episode, Matthew, you come in with some kind of excuse or like position yourself as the underdog, or it's like, oh, it's just humble old Matthew Castle productions like uh you know just like Mom and Pop used to make.

Matthew
01:15
Well, uh you know, for those that have been following this podcast they'll know that I don't have a a particularly strong success rate with winning these polls. Um I don't think I've ever been like resoundly trounced.

Samuel
01:27
No, I think it in both cases it was about 55 to 45% in the voting.

Matthew
01:33
But I think some of those were sympathetic votes for me.

Samuel
01:36
Uh I don't know. I don't I don't wouldn't like to comment because it would look embarrassing for me. What I will say is You'll probably do a win. And I I would expect that you'll win this one based on your knowledge, but we'll see how it goes. So for those listening at home who have been following the podcast, you'll know that we've done a PS2 mini draft. That was a great episode that was really well received. had more than three hundred votes and uh I ultimately my PS2 Mini was elected the winner. And we also did the Game Developer Draft episode, which was our first draft, and that was um that was a fun one. It was a key part of Backpage law because it established the fake video games companies that me and Matthew are now synonymous with. So that was fun. But this time we're gonna do a hypothetical N64 mini draft. So Again, this console doesn't actually exist, but there was a big spate of retro sort of like miniature versions of consoles that popped up over the last few years. But now the next gens here, it feels like they're not a priority in the same way that they were. But I would say that some of the more interesting consoles never got a shout, and the N64 is definitely one of those. So in this episode, we're each gonna pick 10 games. We're gonna compete to pick the best 10 games on the N64. And we'll put it up on Twitter as a a vote. You can go vote for who picked the best games, and then in a future episode we'll address who the winner was. So It's a fun competition, people get engaged with this stuff. Matthew, how are you feeling about this draft?

Matthew
02:59
I am feeling quite nervous because I feel like it's my home turf. So I should in theory win or feel kind of confident at least comfortable. But at the same time, because I've got a bit of a mad broken brain, it's trying to push me in the direction of of some quite sort of um sort of esoteric stuff and I'm just desperate to not bodge this by trying to be too clever or weird.

Samuel
03:28
Yeah. What's interesting about this is that Matthew picked the categories this time. I obviously approved the categories. And they are more what I would describe as shifting sands categories, where One pick in one may shift what you pick for another. Like they it they interlock a lot more than the PS2 ones did. The PS2 ones I treated like little islands really. They're all quite different. Yeah.

Matthew
04:02
I you know, I have a vague idea of what I want, but I also know that if you pick certain games I've got to take the list in a different direction.

Samuel
04:11
Yeah. I'm largely in the same boat. I think it might end up being a bit more tactical than the PSG one was. And that was already pretty tactical. So Yeah. I think it I I actually think as well, whoever goes first might just win it outright because you're in such a powerful position at that point. Because Uh the the interesting thing is we'll we'll talk about the N64, uh kind of like an overview of it in a minute, but there is an elite tier of games that you kind of need to get off the board as quickly as possible. And then What you put around that ends up being kind of interesting colour to shape your list, but you sense that those big games are probably the ones that will win it for you. Is that how you felt about the library?

Matthew
04:49
Yes, though, like I was saying, there's a bit of my brain that's like, well, we know some of these games so well. Isn't this an opportunity to surface some interesting stuff? And, you know, I keep thinking about You know, what's the what makes the most commercial sense for an N64 mini and the N sixty four mini that I personally would like to play? Yeah. Um because as I'm sure when we talk about the N sixty four itself, it's uh it was a very expensive console and I think people's experience of it isn't as wide as their experience of other consoles they may have owned So I I almost want to kind of play up to that. But at the same time there's some things you're like, I have to have that. There's like good boring choices. And there are like weird, exciting choices.

Samuel
05:35
Yeah, I think so. Uh let's go straight into it, Matthew, because you know, I think we pick this because A, I think it's the twentieth anniversary of the N6.

Matthew
05:45
The 25th anniversary.

Samuel
05:47
Yeah, sorry, 25th, yeah. Good god, good god, we're old. Um yeah, so That was the reason why we kind of had this in the in the books for a little while we thought, okay, something specifically on the N64 would be fun. We were gonna do a best of list, but then we thought uh the drafts are just so fun. They're so competitive, they make for great podcasts. We thought that this would be um a better way of doing it. So let's talk about why we we like the N64 then Matthew. I think you've tap you've tapped into it there. They're the people's relationship with this console. It wasn't only like 40 games. It was only like 10. 10 to 20 games. And those were the canonical, like good games. And as we've discussed in previous episodes. There would also be like a couple of total dog shit games in there as well. Like um a tie-in or like something like um Clay Fighter uh or you know something like that. Um, you know, or a Turok, which I'm not saying is shit, but Turok is um, you know, uh I know it's got like um a a something of a hardcore reputation, but they're they're s they're quite ropey FPS games even by the um standards of the time. So how do you feel about the N64 looking back, Matthew?

Matthew
06:53
It's it's very, very difficult to like untangle from like my formative gaming years. So some things are kind of enshrined as almost like sacred texts because of this. It's a weird console in that it has a lot of like genre defining games or a couple of of really vital genre defining games so it's like a super important console. But like you say, at the same time, I feel like I didn't get to enjoy the full extent of the machine. Um, just due to like how old I was and that I was d basically dependent on Christmas and birthday presents to get new games. The fact that they were really expensive, like ruled it out. This wasn't like a pocket money. games console at all. Though weirdly on the flip side of that, I feel like I kinda lived a lot of the N64 sort of sort of vicariously through N64 magazine. That's something very key to this time. I think even though a lot of people didn't own a lot of N sixty four games, we've all got opinions on N sixty four games we didn't own. A lot of those are absorbed just from that magazine, or your respective magazine at the time. That Like literally certain games' reputations were basically made, in the UK at least, by the opinion of one bloke in N64. And then and then like everyone parroted those views and we just assumed that they were right because you weren't gonna buy it. So that's kind of interesting, you know, doing some like research and 'cause I must admit I haven't like looked massively into N6. You know, I don't on a day-to-day basis like read much about it. And actually just seeing what the state of like the appreciation was or is at the moment was quite kind of interesting on YouTube. Like what games people do and don't rate. You know, there was some sort s slightly surprising picks in there I thought. Is it what's the th what's the thing that surprised you most from digging into that? I I mean there's just some like there's just some like wild I s I saw a couple of people who are like uh the world is not enough is better than goldeneye takes Okay that's which obviously which is I mean that is powerfully wrong. Uh 'cause I had both those games, so I feel like that isn't like a ha had you actually bought the world it's not enough you would have discovered it was this hidden gem. It's not terrible, but it is also not golden eye. That was a wild one. Um I saw I saw a very um a very valiant attempt to reappraise Mission Impossible, which which really made me chuckle. Because I didn't own it, but I did play it and it was like this really rotten like proto hitman, but like super prescribed, very wonky. But it let you do the bit where you went down on the rope in the in the vault. So I think people went a bit loopy for it. Yeah. The thing I found about N64 is that my relationship with a lot of these games I feel like they had the kind of longevity and legs that games just don't have anymore, and I can't work out if that's like an inherent quality in the game. Or if it's just the fact that we had so few games we had to replay what we had. That's that's the thing I can I can never quite work out with N64. It's like were they better or did we just have more time? and more multiplayer time and fewer games, so they became these life consuming things. I don't know.

Samuel
10:03
I think that the multiplayer thing is obviously important to tap into there because you're it's a console that's got uh four controller ports on the front, which you know is like a a statement of intent about how you're meant to enjoy that console, right? And so You know, in in my life, the N64 was a thing that existed around every single kid's house. And then you'd go there, you would play Goldeneye, some kids would have Mario Kart, every kid would have Goldeneye. And you know, you would play that relentlessly. And even if you weren't playing the multiplayer and you redid the single player, obviously Goldeneye was structured to be replayed in terms of how you unlocked cheats and also the um the obviously the difficulty settings. And um trying to beat those times in order to unlock the cheat. So, you know, that was like a a multi-layered game. Likewise, Perfect Dark is a game where, you know, to unlock the more interesting like bot uh multiplayer stuff and and additional cool cool things to use in multiplayer requires a time commitment basically. So I think that that combined with the fact that you've got loads of platformers which are heavy on You know, collecting. I think like um Donkey Kong sixty four is the most famous infamous I should say for like making you collect stuff. And you I think yeah, these games were built to last in a lot of cases. And the games you're talking about probably only represent a small bit of the catalogue, but they were they were sort of key. Even something like Star Fox sixty four, structured to be replayed over and over again. You could do the different combinations of those levels. And um, you know, you have to because that game's only about two hours long, so what can you do? But yeah, I think that I think you're I think you're right there, Matthew. But um I don't necessarily think it means that subsequent generations are any less or any less kind of replayable. It's more maybe more that like like you say, it's a time thing. You know, you just had the time to endlessly throw at this console.

Matthew
11:45
I I guess there are fourteen year olds now who are putting the same kind of time that we put into this They're now putting into Switch or probably some endless thousand hours of dota or something.

Samuel
11:58
Yeah, I was gonna say Switch is uh optimistic. I would say, you know, definitely Fortnite or Another games a service game, you know. Um but yeah, or GTA Online. So yeah. Um I uh I wanted to ask then Matthew. So we talked about this a little bit before, but How did the N64 lose so badly in this generation when it was such a persistent part of like every millennial's young life, it seemed like, especially in the UK? If you didn't have one, like you someone someone you knew had one. That's like a like I say, someone had GoldenEye and you were playing it. Just every kid I knew had played Goldeneye and it was such a massive part of like you know, uh our childhood basically in terms of how how we um how we played games. So what why is it that this this console's like reputation seems outsized when it obviously wasn't the big seller of this generation.

Matthew
12:46
I think some of it's a matter of perspective. I think the rumors of its failure are slightly exaggerated. Because when you put it next to PlayStation, yes, you know, PlayStation absolutely stomps it. But I think the headline there is more PlayStation ushers in a new age of like phenomenon home consoles rather than the N sixty four is like some massive massive bus. Like N sixty four sells more than Mega Drive, fundamentally, you know, across the world, you know, a and you wouldn't think you know, you think of that as just a very prolific a relevant console too. But it's just when you put those numbers next to 100 million PlayStations, I think it sells what, 33 million the N64? So like, you know, there's that. And also like you say I think the multiplayer asper means this spreads into a lot of lives. It's like a weirdly viral console because of that. Like you don't have to have one. to have experienced N sixty four. In fact most a lot of people didn't. I also think it's just such core territory. You know, the games it was making were so important that like Taste makers, like your real core gamers. I don't want to say like just journalists, because this is beyond journalists, it's like journalist forums, online vocal voices. played N64. So it's got a lot of people who kind of who can sort of spread that message and maybe not exaggerate how popular it is, but definitely amplify that. Like I feel like it's a really well chronicled console. because the kind of people it appealed to are the kind of people who went on to talk a lot about games. So it's kind of exaggerated. It's a bit like now you get these games where you you think like everyone knows that like Akami is a masterpiece and then it has actually sold like eight copies, you know? There's a I think there are a lot of examples of this. Where something niche, but it's just such a loud niche, you know, it it feels much bigger than it actually was. Caine Lynch 2. Well not yeah, not not quite. I just think if everyone who gets to talk about video games, particularly like journalists are into it, you know mm-hm you know, you wouldn't you just wouldn't you have to have experienced some of these games. I mean at the time, I hadn't like I you know, as a person who owned one I wasn't like, oh man, I own this losing console. My feeling was, I own this rad console with the best games in the world. Like, man, I pity people with a PlayStation. Uh I just don't think it crossed into your minds that you know, maybe the culture back then, like we didn't care about business, like that's something that's kind of infected the discourse as it's become like a twenty-four hour news cycle. You know, you need something to fill that time. So we've become more obsessed with numbers. Back then I don't think anyone really gave a shit. You gave a shit when like your favourite company closed down and then you were like, oh, I guess Sega had bust, you know, on in the console space after all. But I don't think that like played on your mind at all.

Samuel
15:38
Yeah, I think you're right there. And um numbers arguably the least interesting part of games. Co get up games coverage, but it gets a lot of attention. And yeah, perhaps I'm infecting this podcast by even mentioning it there. But I just find it interesting because when you look at the N sixty four sales of thirty-three million, I mean first of all, it's a lot better than the GameCube would sell, which was you know GameCube just had an anniversary this week. It's um released in Japan. And there's quite a lot of um I think uh I think it was uh Kat Bailey pointed out how much revisionism there was with the um you know the reputation of that console. And at the time it was like largely mocked. Even though it was super cheap and had some cool games. But hey. And um yeah, this is uh yeah, I think you're right there. I think the numbers thing is um is overblown and you know the PS1 was just pervasive in a way that was kind of beyond um any console that preceded it. I mean the snares only sold forty eight million copies, but sorry, uh units.

Matthew
16:29
But you know that's you know, it is de you know, it's gotta be a disappointment when you're like In this decade Nintendo sell like a hundred million Game Boys. Yeah. Um but the truth of it was that was you know Yeah, it was downhill after the netz, and yeah they'd always dominated the handheld, and they just kept those handhelds going for such a long time, like That's gotta play play into it.

Samuel
16:52
Yeah, for sure. So I was wondering, Matthew, I actually um bought a copy of um N64 magazine ahead of this podcast. Just uh out of curiosity, I just on eBay, I bought one. It's really interesting to look at the review section of that month, which I think is is just three games. And And like um obviously some Game Boy games too, but I think um I think maybe Banjo two was the the lead review. Something like that. But I was What I thought was really interesting about this console was when I hear people talk about it who were there at the time and were actively buying games, is that you would wait months and months for a new release to roll around. And I was curious if you think maybe the reputation of the console First of all, at the time you didn't think about that stuff because you're a kid and you're getting maybe one or two games a year, and they were easy enough games to fulfil that. And maybe that's When you kind of boil down this console's library, it doesn't matter how spread out the releases were in retrospect, because looking back, there are definitely more than 20 good games for this console. So I was curious about How y you think its reputation has changed in retrospect?

Matthew
17:53
It fit the rhythm of most of our lives, so that that stuff didn't stand out. I don't think it's necessarily been reappraised. I think everyone knew what the really good games were at the time. I'm you know, I said I went onto YouTube and saw some interesting takes, but that's more like you know, uh a bit of like weird sort of super hardcore fan revisionism going on there. And because so many of these games did have a tail as well, I think that papered over the cracks. And like, I really think Definitely in the UK, N64 magazine played a really really important part. They made it seem like a busier place. They Did really great stuff getting you like excited and talking about the future so you could sort of think about that and just that excitement helped fill the bit of a gap. They were really, really good at celebrating what they had. you know, this was before the time where like a game comes out and it's basically dead to a magazine and it's something magazines it's something good magazines have always sort of fought against where they try and you know, find ways of kind of keeping the library alive and whether that's like retrospective or kind of retro sections or whatever, but like I think N N sixty four had that in his blood. I mean I think that's why I find it hard to kind of th see this time as this great barren wasteland, just because I had these weird group of mates who I'd never met. who'd kind of convinced me otherwise.

Samuel
19:15
I think what's interesting about the point you made earlier about how um, you know, opinions would pass down from that magazine and then become sort of like, you know, Law or a con the canonical opinion of everyone. I think that me making that clay fighter joke earlier is an example of that. That was a game that I just remember being mocked in magazines at the time. And I wonder if I I think I I did play it and I remember I mean it it was a shocking uh beat-em-up. I think that I sort of like must have inherited that from somewhere. Like I must have heard about how shit this was. From someone. I think someone told me, Oh, it's like the lowest rated game in this magazine and then you play it and it's like, oh holy shit, this is terrible. But Yeah, it's it's a time where a magazine could establish a take on something and then it'll become everyone's take. That's just uh a really uh Very much a phenomenon of the of the time, you know.

Matthew
20:02
Yeah, I mean like the famous one with N sixty four was was Superman sixty four, which is a game like no one has played. Look anyone who's ever used that as shorthand has not played that game. I've not played it. I don't know anyone who has played it outside of the reviewer who played it in that magazine. You know, it is j but it is just a universal shorthand for like absolute shiter, you know? Yeah. And that's just r I mean it's rough, but that's also part of it. Actually w one funny thing with the N sixty four, um you're talking about like how sort of ubiquitous everyone's libraries, like everyone basically had the same like 15-90% rated games. But because of those long gaps, there were de that's where like weird stuff could sneak in. Maybe you got a bit hungry. Or maybe you had an an inconvenient birthday placement and you had to ask for something. Like you couldn't not ask for a game for your birthday. And so like every collection does have a couple of like quite weirdo stuff in it. We had an absolutely gold standard N64 collection and Xena Warrior Princess the fighting game.

Samuel
21:10
That's funny. I I I will say this, Matthew, our buddy Jay, but Jay Bailez, who came on the Sonic episode, told me told me this week that uh in the Brighton CX, behind the glass, is a copy of Superman 64. And A, I found it funny that the you know, the people running that shop would think this is an artifact to put behind the glass to get people excited about coming into the store. So that I found funny. But B yeah, the idea like I I th think about it, I I know this is a game where Superman flies through rings, but do I only know this because I read it in like a magazine or that that got passed down as this is what the game is, you know, it's interesting.

Matthew
21:44
Lex Luther says solve my ma solve my maze. He challenges that. That becomes like a running box out in in um NGC and you're like, well, what is Well I don't even really know what solved my ma I don't really know the context of the mazes that Superman's being asked to solve, but I will forever associate it with that game.

Samuel
22:06
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, so uh you know, uh interesting thing as well about that magazine is that it comes along at an era where I remember no offense to the staff making it, but I remember the official mag at the time. I don't remember which publisher had it, maybe it was EMAP or someone like that. But It was just like a pamphlet. It wasn't critical. It didn't have personality. And that would change later on. It became it got uh sort of like redone and became a lot more sort of vibrant as a magazine with the same voice. But I think that N64 was a bit uncontested when it came to other mags having like you know, uh being authorities on the subject matter. Do you think that's fair?

Matthew
22:42
You know, this was the era where a magazine would say like twenty page review and eighteen pages of that would be like basically mega box outs showing you every bit of the game and then like fifty words of review at the end. Um but uh you know N sixty four and N sixty four definitely did those kind of reviews as well, but they were always you know, the review itself was always much chunkier than you got in the other mags. Just much better like just much better standard. I I must admit I didn't read the other N sixty four mags at the time, so you know, I can remember flicking through some of the official ones and being like, nah. Um So it's kinda hard to say, you know, like it's it's it's it's that particular group of people and their personalities and how tied they were to certain games and how obsessed they were with certain games. I mean they really did uh There's some things we kept on playing just to try and like get best scores to impress them in the magazine and things like that. So it's yeah, it's a it's a defining part. I mean For people who listen to this podcast outside the UK, that maybe sounds baffling because they probably haven't even heard of this magazine. Um but here it was like a you know Definitely an essential text.

Samuel
23:50
Yeah, I think most of it has been archived by um a couple of different sources online. So if you want to go um check it out if you live outside the UK, then it's worth a look for sure. I imagine People feel about about this the way I felt when I listened to Retro Naught's Nintendo Power episode, where I was like, well, I've got no idea what this is, but it sounds like Nintendo just sent you a leaflet every month that you had a great time, which is fine, you know, like that's uh That's good. And um yeah, I imagine it's just uh yeah, it's just quite a different uh experience of Nintendo as a result, which is interesting because it's much more monocultural these days. Everyone buys the same games at the same time and Your source might be, you know, a US site or a UK site and it doesn't really matter, but that delineation was quite interesting around this time. So Matthew Before we get into the draft then, do you think the N64 is actually that badly served these days in terms of availability? Because Looking at it, I mean the games should be in the Switch Online Library. We're you know approaching the five mark five-year mark for the Switch, and Nintendo hasn't found a way to get N64 games to play. on this console, which is really embarrassing, I think, but classically Nintendo. The thing is though, you've got on 3DS some of the classics were re-released in um in 3D form. And at the same time, we know that Super Mario 64 was part of the All-Stars collection that they did. And then there's also the Rare Replay collection, which has a lot of their key games. If you own a Wii U, you can weirdly piece together most of the major games. Um, if you're willing to spend uh $8. 99 per game, which I think is way too much for what they are. But there is a way to essentially have this library on tap, maybe not convenient way. But I was wondering how you felt about the availability of it

Matthew
25:27
I th I think you're right, like there are those routes to it, but it's it's the absolute highlights. It feels like it is all the games everyone owned and like none none of the interesting ones. Like there are lots of le lost N64 games outside of that. like virtual console ecosystem. Maybe just partly because half of the publishers don't exist anymore and things like that. That played into some of my thinking in terms of wanting to maybe build an N64 mini that does open a door on some of that stuff. Cause I feel like if if they are gonna bring them to the Switch online virtual console thing. It will just be the same, you know, 15 first party games you've already played and probably play to death. Also, and I must admit, I I I don't do much like emulating stuff so I'm I'm definitely not an expert on this. But I still get the impression that like N64 is kind of pretty rough. You know, like it's it's a bit of a pain in the arse and I mean you can definitely emulate it and play those games on PC, but they you know, whenever you see YouTube videos, they always look absolutely diabolical. Like there's just some stuff which is like inherently wrong. So they just never have the same c character to them. I mean maybe the scenes come on a bit and that's that's just, you know, not true anymore. But, you know, the few times I've had to dabble for like screenshots in mags and stuff, it's always like Oh yeah yikes, this just isn't right.

Samuel
26:46
Yeah, I think you're you're right there. I mean uh the thing is if you want some of these games to run closer to how they originally were or you know, to run well by today's standards Be prepared to mess with a bunch of plugins, you know. And um, you know, somebody in sixty-four emulators even tell you this game uh has problems with this bit. And there are some good wikis for this stuff. But it's true that, you know, when they that bootleg version of Goldeneye Remastered just emerged in the wild. And um if you play that on the Xenia emulator. It runs really nicely and it's kind of a relief because if you play Golden Iron an emulator, basically it just chugs. Like the music chugs and then it's got like frame rate drops and it's just you know suboptimal basically and it just makes you want to play it uh on the console itself so Yeah, I think that's a good point. What's interesting is some of the third party games that are are good or interesting have weirdly been like excavated by developers like Night Dive Studios and put on PC in recent years, for example. So you can enjoy those. We talked about Shadow Man in the previous episode. Like um and obviously the Turok games as well. I don't think they've done Turok 3 though. Some of it it becomes widely available. I was quite interested to see that uh Doom Sixty Four re-emerged in recent years too. That's um that's cool to see. You can play something like Rogue Squadron on PC as well on uh GOG. But yeah, it's true that I don't know, there's not like one place you can go to for all this stuff, and that is that is definitely a a f a factor. I don't know if I factored it that much into my pick, so that might be where we delineate a little bit

Matthew
28:16
But I honestly I sort of don't know what I'm gonna do for a lot of this until we get to it.

Samuel
28:20
Yeah, I'm kind of in the same boat. I think so much of it will change depending on who goes first, who picks what. So Matthew, I feel like we're giving a good overview of the N sixty four there. Is anything else you want to add or should we go straight to the draft?

Matthew
28:32
No, just thank you, N64. I loved you a lot. You were very good.

Samuel
28:35
Yeah, wonderful console. So great stuff. We'll take a short break and we'll be back with the draft. Welcome back to the podcast. So the N sixty four mini draft, let's do it. Let's build a hypothetical So, for those listening at home that haven't heard the uh one of these draft episodes before, or if you need a refresher, basically there are ten categories here. Me and Matthew will each pick a game one by one. We are competing to build the best. ten games out of the uh out of the N64's library. And the key thing here of course is that once a game has been picked, the other person can't pick it, so it becomes fiercely competitive and you have to think carefully about which games you're picking first because In the next turn, maybe the other person will take a game off the board that you really wanted. So um there's gonna be a lot of back and forth here. As mentioned. Matthew selected the categories here, and I signed off on them, but there is a lot of shifting sands between them because the particularly the back half of categories that Matthew has done. It it has the potential to turn into sheer chaos and it will just it will keep it competitive to the end, I think. Like it's quite interesting. I had to think carefully about my preferred order of picks this time. With the PS2 mini, I just knew I needed to get Silent Hill 2, and that was that was it. And I got it and then that was fine. But with this I think like some of the key picks that shape who will win will come like fourth or fifth in this, Matthew. Is that how you felt about it?

Matthew
30:19
Yeah, absolutely. I actually think there's a couple of I think there's a couple of categories where there are only really a couple of really serious contenders. But that that might be my personal opinion rather than popular consensus.

Samuel
30:33
I did quite I did a bit of research for this episode, actually. And um it involved playing about five to ten games that I didn't know much about and I just wanted to have some kind of background of knowledge on. And a special shout out to Jet Force Gemini, which people always said was good at the time, and I thought was like diabolically bad. Just a truly dreadful shooter. I don't know how people even played it at the time, having like doing the shooting and aiming. But am I at alone there, Matthew?

Matthew
31:00
Uh I I don't like it. Uh it's it's it's not for me and I I thought I you know I thought I'll give this a r a proper go again on uh rare replay And I was just like, nope.

Samuel
31:13
Yeah. And um there's another game I played on that collection that I may it may have come up come in this uh come up in the draft, so I'll um I'll save that. But that was my main opponent That was my main observation. Also a couple of picking for a couple of these categories took a lot of lateral thinking and watching YouTube videos and and realizing that some games are just total dog shit and you've got no reason to pick them now. That was um that was tough too. So I'll read out the categories, Matthew. Number one, shooter. Number two, fighting or sports? Number 3, Racing. Number 4, Platformer. Number 5. Action or RPG. Number 6. License game. Number 7. Wildcard. So that's something weird or esoteric from the N64's library. Number eight, Japan only. So a game that can only have released in in Japan. Number nine, a game made in the UK. And number ten, free pick. So Matthew, as the architect of this, tell me what your thinking was of the CARE Group.

Matthew
32:11
Some of these some of these are very just heavily influenced by that magazine reading past. So like Japan only, I thought there was an interesting import scene with N64. Mm, maybe not quite as big as I f as I remembered it. Uh like I feel for that one there's a couple of like absolute superstars. Um so so that should be fine. Uh game made in the UK. Again I I had a slightly overinflated sense of the UK's role in this. Probably because of Rare. But there is there was some other stuff going on in there as well. So I thought that I thought that was an interesting uh an interesting way into a a collection of those games. Um Action RPG Feels like a bit of an embarrassment of riches. I guess like famously this is a console which people say doesn't have any RPGs, so That's kind of action RPG adventure, I'm guessing, i is hopefully how you've taken it. To be frank, it's a Zelda category, isn't it? Right, okay. Let's let's let's let's not uh it's funny how we tiptoe this around like I better not say Zelda in case he's forgotten it exists. That's the Mind games. Like maybe he has forgotten it, so that you know, there are RPG like games, um, I would imagine. Yeah, fighting sports. I thought I put that together. Uh this like I almost did a very broad multiplayer. category because it's just such a defining part of this machine. But I you know, I I I think that's that that was a little too broad. Um I think sports here is gonna be a um quite interesting fighting sports just because there there's some different directions you can take that shooter again feels feels pretty solid like feels like you'd have to really go some to make a horrible decision there. Um some of these are so broad I thought actually some of the later weirder categories are almost a way of like digging into those. Like there's some interesting strategies if you wanted them.

Samuel
34:11
Yeah, for sure. I think that yeah, uh it gets That game made in the UK one absolutely fucks up everything on the board, basically. Um, because you're like, okay, well I'll reconfigure based on that and then Yeah, it's um it's tough for sure. So yeah, I think it's really interesting though.

Samuel and/or Matthew
34:28
It's a really interesting approach to the draft that will make it quite different from the PS2 one. Yeah, I I really don't have any idea of what ten games I'm gonna end up with. So that that'll be fun.

Samuel
34:37
Yeah.

Samuel and/or Matthew
34:37
Okay, so Matthew, should we do the coin flip and then kick off? Let's do the coin flip. What what are you looking for? Uh heads. Heads it is. Whoa, really?

Samuel
34:45
I got it three times in a row. This is the thing though, because if I was doing the coin flip, I would absolutely lie to Matthew in order to win. And this is why Matthew Castle's a better man than me. He can be trusted to give the correct uh reading of what the virtual coin flip says. So Yeah. Okay then.

Matthew
35:05
If you were doing it I'd make you stream your screen so I could see.

Samuel
35:09
The funny thing is though, I don't I still don't know which category I'm gonna pick for my first game because it can fit in a number of categories. So it's tough. Okay. Alright, so my first pick then. We're gonna go with shooter. Okay. It's gonna be Goldeneye 64. So or is it Gold Knight 007? That's what's technically. That's just confusing when there's two sets of numbers that could potentially be at the end there, Matthew. So The pi the reason I picked this, obviously this is a seminal first person shooter. It was, you know, a game that I loved a lot as a kid. I've played a lot as an adult as well. A really interesting odd mix of stealth and shooting. Someone actually pointed out when we did the Immersive Sim episode, Matthew, that Do these kind of kind of fit because you can sort of take your own approach? I don't think they quite do, but it's definitely an interesting sort of like you know dynamic. Um I can see people were comparing Death Loop to Golden Knight as well, which I thought was interesting. But obviously as an extrapolation of the film Goldeneye, which I watched again recently and think is just okay to be honest, but the way it takes The way it takes like ten seconds of that film and turns it into a level is like pure magic. It's just it's what an absolutely absurd but amazing way to make a first person shooter. Obviously, you have the different layers of um of sort of objectives that you get depending on the difficulty you've picked. That's really cool. You have the multiplayer. The big reason I picked this for the mini is, okay, we know this game is like the hardest to get. So there was a remastered version made. It wasn't released anywhere else. Um so it wasn't released anywhere because a Nintendo reportedly didn't sign off on it, so it never saw the light today until it leaked this year. I think for people buying an N64 mini. This is the reason it needs to this is the reason to make it exist basically, is that you can play this in multiplayer, you know, local multiplayer with friends, this elusive Fantastic license game from back in the day.

Matthew
37:00
Thoughts, Matthew? Yeah, I mean it's a really sound pick. You're right in terms of like availability. I I think there may be uh I think there maybe is a better shooter, but in terms of like its place on a mini console and its place in like N64 players' hearts, yeah, this is uh I mean Obviously, right?

Samuel
37:18
Yeah, I I I really love this game and I think it's um it's just it's the one I wanted more than anything else. Like there's a the bunch of the other picks here are a little bit more scatter shot and we'll see where it goes. But This is the one I thought, you know, regardless of how you feel about Perfect Dark, I think that this is the one that people will have the most nostalgia for, and it's the one that you don't have access to right now, whereas Perfect Dark you do. So that doesn't fac that doesn't factor in too much for me, but Golden Knight, that's the game I'd want to play if I bought an N64 mini. That's where it's there. So Matthew, what's your first pick?

Matthew
37:49
Look when you come second, you can basically go around collecting like the leftovers or you can go bold, but there are so many other ways into the leftovers. It's not like well those are all the shooters off the table now. Like there are still things that I maybe want that you could take.

Samuel
38:05
I'm gonna go, I'm not gonna go Oh shit See I'm like I was I was ninety-nine percent sure of what you'd pick first, but now I'm not so sure.

Samuel and/or Matthew
38:18
Oh sh Shhh Jus. How are we at this stage already?

Matthew
38:22
We're already on the first pick. I know, but this it changes everything. It honestly changes everything. Yeah. I didn't realise how integral Goldeneye was until you said it, and then I'm like, you know what, actually that's a really good first pick. I'm gonna go platformer. Yep. Super Mario 64. That's the pick I would thought I thought you would take, yeah. I know it's super obvious. I know we've all played it to death. But it's also still sort of definitive N64 game. It's the game that introduced me to the analog stick, personally. It's the game which When I played it for the first time was genuinely like the biggest sleep I've ever experienced in any kind of like like full stop in all the games I've played. That is the single biggest leap where I was like This is this is this is something new. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe like the freedom of walking around that world. I know that's a sort of nostalgic reason. It doesn't really have any meaning now where this stuff is commonplace but you know in my head it it is that central it's still incredibly playable It's also incredibly available, annoyingly, um, through very various other means. You gotta have a couple of classics in the mini. It can't be all super weird stuff. I think And this is like an absolutely easy like bedrock. Also makes your platforming choice kind of interesting.

Samuel
39:42
I so I kind of planned around the idea that you would pick this first if you went second. And I now see this as a category I don't have to worry about at all until the end. So that that suits me just fine. Um because I have a few different choices for this one. Uh so yeah, I think it's um I think it's the it's the right pick. I think that I thought if you'd picked something else here, and I'd have picked Mario and Goldeneye. Like those are two such foundational mega selling games. You know what I mean?

Matthew
40:13
Yeah, I actually wanted to pick something else a bit more interesting for Platforma. Um, but I felt like you painted me into the corner a bit with golden eye, to be honest. Because I felt like I you can't have both of them because then basically this thing's lost. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So you have forced me into making a thing I didn't particularly want to do.

Samuel
40:34
Yeah. So I mean What's interesting, is there anything else you want to say about Mario Mario 64 Matthew, or do you feel like you've said it all?

Samuel and/or Matthew
40:41
Just that it really, really holds up.

Matthew
40:42
This isn't just a purely nostalgic play, you know, or playing it as part of the um the Switch collection and it's Just still gloriously inventive, kind of creates the mould which most 3D character platformers still to this day. I haven't really bettered it. That's why I'm confident in the world. There are other things like it on the N sixty four but they're very inferior to this, I think. So it's actually that's one of the interesting things on N sixty four is there I you know, I say it's the home of the platformer, but actually it's the home of the platformer, you know, this one, and then after that There's quite a gulf, I think. Um you know, it's not that far off before you're down into the gexes. Yeah, for sure.

Samuel
41:23
So yeah, that's the thing. It's um it's a narrow field. So, yeah, I I think this is a this is a great pick. Obviously, it's a you know a foundational game for that entire genre, a 3D game that, you know, would define Redefine the industry, and so is therefore a good pick. And yeah, needs to, I think needs to be on an N64 mini as much as Goldeneye does. So Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about the availability thing, Matthew. People are just gonna be voting for a straight who's got the best ten games list, so don't uh don't beat yourself up about that. Okay, so this is where I think I'm going to like Just see what happens if I cause a bit of chaos because I wasn't expecting to win this draft because I'm, you know, not the Nintendo guy. You are. And even though I have uh enough knowledge and and baked in experience to be able to pick ten good games for this, there is a part of me that thinks, what's the kind of podcasting gold element of this draft? And I think what I'm gonna do, Matthew, is I'm going to take category nine game made in the UK and I'm gonna pick Perfect Dark. So you don't you don't get either of them Which is like A betrayal and like cruel. But I was s I was thinking about it last night and I thought, okay, first of all, that is funny to do that and you know, that's good podcasting. But I did also think if I bought this console I would want both because I think Perfect Dark scratches enough of a different itch in terms of like if you're playing by yourself and you just want to rinse some bots, then you can do that or team up with a friend and rinse some bots. And I thought that by letting you pick Perfect Dark, you've got too good a counter to Goldeneye that people might weigh up 50-50. But by having neither of them, it puts you in quite a tough position. So That's why that that's why I have done this terrible act to you, Matthew. You my friend. I apologize, but I think it will be a good play. What do you make of that?

Matthew
43:21
Yeah, that's I mean that's that's a real shiter as well. Um yeah, I must admit like I prefer Perfect Dark to Goldeneye. That's why I thought it was a secret win for me that I was gonna be able to take that. Yeah. Um yeah, yeah, that's yeah, that's that's That's quite frustrating. I may have to get a bit Bit creative to deal with that. Yeah, I mean fantastic. Perfect dark. The multiplayer that we became so obsessed with uh that my friend Craig used to elastic band his N64 controller in place to send his multiplayer character running laps of just a level to get his distance stats up because he was trying to level up his multiplayer profile. And we'd go back at lunch and he'd have been running around this level for four hours.

Samuel
44:14
Um we were obsessed with that game. Um that seems like a good use of a parent's energy supply. Um yeah. Amazing. Uh I mean that's really funny. I think that this actually holds up really well. I mean obviously like we're talking about the um rare replay version or the version they did on Xbox 360 where they buffed up the frame rate and smoothed it out, gave it twin stick controls. Really, really fun to still play. Me and my pal Andrew were playing a few games of this um Recently, and we did play a few games against the bots, and then we thought we should just play against each other and see how this goes. And it got so incredibly nasty, like 90s um millennial kids nasty. Like um there was a he he beat basically beat me like three games in a row. And then It got to like the end of the fourth game where he was beating me and he went, Oh, um I I killed him once and he went, Oh, I think you might win this. And then I basically um lost that game too and was incredibly angry that he'd said, I think you're gonna win this. And then in the next game when I did win um and got to like the final kill before the time ran out. I just went to him in this really Stuart Lee like fashion. I think you're gonna win this! And he was just incre and he was like Burst into like laughter, but also just how fucking petty I was to feel that way. That a man in his 30s could still feel this way playing an M64 shooter from the nineties Um the other thing to like highlight with this game, of course, is that the guns are really novel and cool. And um I don't actually think that much of the single player, Matthew. How do you feel about single player perfect dog?

Matthew
45:48
Oh, I loved it. Um really? Yeah, I yeah, it you know, it has the same sort of s structure as as Goldeneye in terms of just stuff getting more exciting the harder it is. Um Uh I love the gadgets, I love the kind of spy fiction of it all. Um, you know, I love the uh like how playful the guns are, you know, they've all got these alternate functions. Like you can endlessly replay that game and there was just a level of detail to it I'd never seen, you know, in terms of like shooting other lights and just the little weird effects and and and how um interactive that world was. It's it's definitely a wonkier campaign. There are maybe like five or six levels I replayed endlessly. Like I absolutely love uh there's like an Air Force One assault level which I was obsessed with. I really love the very first level where you sort of sneak into um uh datadine. It's got the same idea as Goldeneye in terms of like you can go in all action or stealth and it was so rich, just like there was you know the the cheats, the you know Trying to beat the levels in fast time to unlock stuff. The weird gun challenge mode, and it's got this, you know, probably the best of its kind kind of set set of um shooting range challenges. uh in the Carrington Institute. It's just one of the most fully featured games of all time.

Samuel and/or Matthew
47:05
Um and yeah, I I love it to bits. All the more reason to take it off of you.

Samuel
47:11
Yes. Hmm. So Yeah, I think I don't I don't have the same baked in love for the campaign that I did for Golden I think. Well, I le I really love the multiplayer and like, hey, maybe this is a chance to dig into it a bit more, but I think it's also because I didn't know as many kids who owned this and so it wasn't as big a feature i as Goldeneye was. So I think that's all I'm really comparing it to. It's also a bit it's a bit cornier than Goldeneye as well, I think. Um, yeah, definitely.

Matthew
47:36
But like that, oh god, the hype for this game was so wild and it was Like one of the only games where it was just as good as they told me it was gonna be. Like that that was the thing that got me. Like, I mean N S you know, N sixty four Did hundreds of pages on this games and and when I got it I was like even then I was like I I I had no idea how like wild this thing was gonna be. Yeah. Um Oh it's it is so good. And I thought it wouldn't hurt much because there is the HD version. I thought, well, you know, other people can play it.

Samuel and/or Matthew
48:08
But actually the double whammy, uh I won't lie, it stings. Yep, it's probably uh unnecessarily brutal.

Samuel
48:15
It's uh probably the worst thing I've done to a friend in 2021. Uh so that's good. Uh what's your next pick, Matthew?

Samuel and/or Matthew
48:21
I feel like this is just you've pushed this into being a bit more of an arms race than I hoped it was gonna be. Yeah, I know.

Samuel
48:27
I like I I thought about it so much. I just thought there was such an obvious pick for my next one that I could have taken that I think you'll take now. But I just thought Got a bit more history with this game, and there's some real fire in taking it from you. So yeah, it was it was bad. What you got?

Matthew
48:44
Now you're probably gonna disagree with this. I don't think this is my predictable next move In fighting sports, I'm gonna take the original Super Smash Bros. Interesting.

Samuel
48:53
Yeah.

Matthew
48:53
It's a multiplayer classic. I think it still has value and worth because those games are Very different in feel between them. I loved this game. I played this game for hundreds and hundreds of hours. It's obviously the smallest Smash Bros. , but it's super super focused and fundamentally nails everything. good about this series, everything it ever needed to be is here. These characters you know and love fighting in worlds that didn't belong to them. And that that was the thing I remember initially that really got me excited. And it may sound dumb but you're like Oh god, it's Marrow, but he's on top of, you know, the ship from Star Fox. That's mad, you know, like a in in my head that seemed like a real like like multiverse kind of that's th I guess that's what the s the Marvel Cinematic Universe trades on now. It was just this like impossible thing. I actually loved the simplicity of it. You know, it has all the stuff I like fundamentally. It has lightsabers that you can chuck and ding your friends so that they go flying. Um it has Kirby's down B move where he turns into a rock. It has Pikachu's incredibly shitty down B move where he rains down lightning on fuckers above, as my friend Mark Lusimoore used to do all the time. I I love this game. I think it still holds up. I would definitely want it as a nostalgia play. I feel like I need uh I need a multiplayer killer in there, and this for me is it. There are

Samuel and/or Matthew
50:16
a couple of bigger games than this and you may not even have taken this one but I feel I need it. Yep, it wasn't one of my picks.

Samuel
50:23
I did think about it I thought about it late in the day because I thought okay so In a way, you do sort of need this. You need you need you know, people would expect to see Smash Bros. on there, but I think it's just that Every version of this that would follow would surpass it. It's almost like a tech demo for what would follow. Um I played loads of this first one. Yeah. And I think it's got but I think it's got nostalgia value for sure. It's just the most It feels so pared down to what would follow. I mean, even just a few years later with Melee, just like, you know.

Matthew
50:56
It's so pure though. It's so pure.

Samuel
50:58
Yeah, it is. Yeah. Uh yeah. I this was actually a r this is a really interesting category because There are, I think, two more obvious picks on the sports side, which I'm surprised he didn't go for, which makes me wonder, well, maybe Matthew uses free pick to grab one of these. I don't know. But there was also a spate of really good wrestling games on N sixty four.

Matthew
51:19
So Yeah, that's I must admit I just don't have that relationship with wrestling games. And I know for some people listening to this podcast, they'll be howling at that because wrestling is like a really important bit of the N64 story. I just c I just can't fake that. So it would be a completely fake pick and I'd just be parroting someone else's opinions. Like I just have no hold on it.

Samuel
51:40
So um Yeah. Yeah. I did play I did play a bunch of WCW versus NWO. Um I can't know what the subtitle was for that one. But um Revenge, that was it, Revenge. I did enjoy that, but I don't know if I've got the history to pick that one. So y I think Smash Bros. is a good like A good pick for this in terms of you'll look at a list and go, Oh yeah, Smash Bros on an N64 mini. That makes sense. So yeah, I don't um Yeah, I don't begrudge you that Matthew. That's uh that's good. So, okay, this is an interesting position to be in. My third pick is going to be license game. Okay. And I'm gonna take Rogue Squadron, the Star Wars game. I'm not sure what you would have picked for this category, but um I Really loved this game at the time. I did play on PC. I did later play the N64 version. I understand that like the sound stuff they did with this was quite revolutionary for N64, which didn't have much in the way of like good audio at the time. Because obviously it wasn't a um disc-based uh console. This is like a third-person shooter, you you know, you're controlling a spaceship, basically like Star Fox but you're kind of um flying around these Star Wars planets in X Wings and A Wings and Y Wings. Didn't add B wings though, the absolute fucking sick-os. Um and later the Naboo Starfire, which they added via a cheat code. And you essentially go around planets In between, I believe, Star Wars A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back, just taking off bits and pieces. And then you can unlock the um Death Star Trench Run in a bonus level, which they would do much better in Rogue Leader on GameCube. So I thought this is a this was just a really fun shooter for the time. Really straightforward, objective based, quite hard. Um to unlock the extra levels you need to get medals and that required having a certain accuracy which is really fucking hard and controlling these X wings. I would say that For Factor V who made this, they weren't the best at making shooters, but this these are this is broad and enjoyable. And the way you can go back and replay The levels as the different style was spaceship gave it a lot of value. You can unlock the Millennium Falcon with a cheat as well, which is really cool. I believe Farm Boy was the cheat on N64 that unlocked that. I don't know why I still remember that. But was McClunky one. So I thought this game was rad and it ends with a really fucking bizarre like far future of the Star Wars universe. Well not far future, but it's like after R Return of the Jedi mission where your Wedge Antilles. uh flying a V-wing on the on Mongkalamari while these giant like world devastators destroy parts of the planet and it's like basically an adaptation of a um comic book storyline from the um From the Star Wars uh sort of like a uh you know alternate universe extended universe thing. So I thought that that was rad. I really love this game, Matthew. I'm assuming you paid at the time, right?

Matthew
54:22
Uh visually like really impressive. You know, that's the old um factor five magic. For me, this series didn't really come truly uh come alive until GameCube. This Scot Hoth in it, right? Think this has Hoth as another level that you unlock. I always get this a little bit confused because there's the Hoth level in Shadows of the Empire where you're This Using the tow rope to bring down the the big boys. That's right.

Samuel
54:44
Famously called the big boys, yeah.

Matthew
54:45
But I'm pretty sure that's in this too. I liked I liked it enough. I feel like this this was a game like I don't think we owned this, but we definitely had friends, like a couple of friends who owned it. Like it it it was definitely like a key enough thing to to have entered someone's birthday list at some point.

Samuel
55:01
It was key for me at the time as like um it was quite a nerdy Star Wars game being set between the films rather than during the films. Um I think I think pe I think this game is rad, and I think people will like seeing it on my list. And they'll like to have a licensed game on the list as well that is not broadly available on um consoles. You can play on PC, but not on any consoles as far as I know. So um Yeah, what's uh your third pick Matthew?

Samuel and/or Matthew
55:22
I feel like we're both circling something quite big and I don't know why. I think I know why, but I'm not gonna say why because I want to win.

Matthew
55:29
I'm gonna go Action RPG. I'm gonna pick the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask. I'm gonna pick it because It's a more interesting Zelda game now. I feel Ocarina is a little bit played out. In fact, you can go back and listen to our extensive Zelda ranking episode for my thoughts on this very subject. Yeah, I I think, you know, I I think if you've got either of these games, um, you know, uh b at least one of them is expected. But I think this is the slightly quirkier of the two. I think if there is one that people haven't played of the two it will be this. Um so I feel like it may have a bit of extra value that that that what that way. Also it's just you know having replayed it on 3DS recently, you know, I have a newfound appreciation of it. Um admittedly that game smoothed some of the rough edges and so it'd be a bit tough to go back to. But the core magic of it and the the time loop idea, maybe it's just because I'm playing a lot of Death Loop at the moment as well, that that stuff excites me and I'm into it. But I think this is uh I think lots of people will have have great fun either rediscovering this or discovering it for the first time.

Samuel
56:44
Yep, uh a good pick. I did wonder which of the Zeldas you would take. This was the thing we were both circling, wasn't it? Because once one person pulls the trigger, the other person has to pull the trigger. That's kind of how it works. Um this wasn't gonna be the one I picked first. I thought you would pick Ocarina first, and Yeah, so um I think that's um a a good a good pick. Your reasoning is sound. I think this is still persistently popular, Matthew. I turned on my Wii U. the other day and I think this was number one or number two most downloaded um sort of virtual console game on there. So okay. You know, I think it's just because I mean you can buy it on 3DS. I think the 3DS version might not be like super cheap to get hold of, like the of um Majora's Mask, and obviously the N64 one. Um was uh a late N64 game, so it kind of um I think that's a little bit more elusive than Ocarina is as well. I'm s I'm saying that with a bit of shaky knowledge, I should say.

Matthew
57:35
Can I ask, does the N64 mini come with a mini N sixty four expansion pack?

Samuel
57:40
Yeah, I think it has to have that built in. Or otherwise, uh yeah, it rules out too much good stuff. I think like um I don't think you need it for perfect dark, right, but I think it makes it better.

Samuel and/or Matthew
57:50
I get less you have more bots or some some stuff it does. There was somewhere it was better and there was somewhere you absolutely needed it.

Matthew
57:56
I think you may have needed it for that one.

Samuel
57:58
Yeah, yeah, I think you're right, yeah, yeah.

Matthew
58:00
So it was just so so crazy ambitious.

Samuel
58:02
Yeah, for sure. So yeah, a good a good pick, Matthew. I was um yeah wondering where you'd get to that. I honestly thought that would be your second pick, but I can see why you did it the way you did it. So um interesting. Alright then. Well that means I have to pick The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is my action RPG for my fourth pick. Because otherwise Matthew can take it as his free pick. So I have to be careful. And yes, I think that. Along with I feel comfortable having this and Goldeneye as like I don't get Mario 64, which you know is a foundational N64 game, but Ocarina of Time is just as important to the N64 story as Mario is. And so I think that people will expect to see this on a N64 mini no matter what. You know, I have more of a relationship with it than Majora's Mask. Majora's Mask I've not played, so I can't say I'm an authority on that. You know, I wouldn't say I mean I'm nowhere near the Zelda authority you uh you are, but our creative time I recognize some points in the you know 3D action space and You know, it would go on to inspire everything from like 3D GTAs to, you know, it's it's an incredibly important part of the um the journey of 3D games. And I think that people always enjoy just the the act of stepping onto Hyrule Field in this game and they'll want that nostalgia rush when they pick up their N64 mini. And um Yeah, I mean you know it's there's a reason people still talk about it all these years later. You might be right in terms of the discourse played out around it, but people want this damn thing on their little console, Matthew, so that's why it's here.

Matthew
59:33
Yeah. That's that's perfectly perfectly acceptable. We can all play Ocarina for the eight millionth time and probably give up when we get to jabu jabu

Samuel
59:47
Great stuff. So yes, if you want a more informed Zelda take, go listen to that excellent episode, obviously. But um yes, I don't feel bad taking this. I think this needs to be on here. So yep. What's your Fifth fourth pick? Fourth pick, right?

Matthew
01:00:00
For racing. Oh no. I can't do that. I don't want to do that really.

Samuel
01:00:05
It's a tough one, that one, isn't it?

Matthew
01:00:06
That one's tough 'cause there's there's like a slightly obvious choice, but also there's some slightly quirkier, interesting things.

Samuel
01:00:14
Yeah, there are. That was last that was last on my preference of picks, that one, because I just thought it's actually a Fucking ton of good racing games on this console.

Matthew
01:00:22
Yeah, yeah, so you'd probably be fine. Um for my free pick I'm going to take Paper Mario uh the intelligence systems Mario RPG. I guess the spiritual sort of successor to Mario RPG on the SNES. Obviously they couldn't do an outright successor because at this point uh square weren't going to be making cool RPGs for Nintendo. Uh RPGs a bit of a sore spot for the N64. Uh widely held as as like one of one of the reasons it did so very poorly in Japan compared to the PlayStation where just everyone who you'd grown to love in the Snez era was basically making stuff there instead. Paper Mario, not the best in the series, but establishes all the rules because it is its own story. I think it's still worth playing. It's it's not like it's it ceases to exist. RPGs I think have a better shelf life um compared to their sequels than some other genres because of that. Build on the amazing combat system with sort of timing-based amplifiers for attacks and the like. What I loved about this is it does sort of sh it's like a weird loosening up of Nintendo in a way. you know, this idea that this kind of character who's quite kind of unknowable up until then, uh, gets this sort of strange adventure that investigates the sort of psychology of the characters of the Mushroom Kingdom. You know, you get to talk to like Goombas and of dry bones and find out what their deal is. Um which is just such a delightful idea and I think is really like at the heart of that entire series. They nailed it from here. Bowser becomes a bit more interesting. Peach gets quite an important role in it. I also feel like it's a first party game a lot of people didn't play and didn't experience. Like I didn't know anyone who had this at the time. um rediscovered it on virtual console. So I feel like it's too big a first party thing to not be on there and I also think people will have fun. playing it for the first time.

Samuel
01:02:17
Yep, so, you know, a good pick. I thought about it. I don't have a history with this one and I thought about playing it, but I thought I won't get far into it. So, you know, I'll just accept that Mario pro um Mario, Matthew will probably pick this. Um, yeah, a good use of your free pick to pick an RPG. So it is very odd the RPG situation on this console because even with the um, you know the uh square moving across. It's not just square that makes RPGs for PS1, is it? It's a absolute basically everyone who made RPGs for the snares as well. So it's a weird one. with the exception of uh Quest, the developer. But yeah, it's um yeah, good pick, Matthew. And uh obviously a series that would again peak on the GameCube, but or arguably. Um and so Yeah, starts here, good suggestion.

Matthew
01:02:58
I was I was tempted by and I'm gonna say this game's name because I'm pretty sure you're not going to pick it uh as your free pick. Um I was tempted by Ogre Battle 64. Um but only because its subtitle is A Person of Lordly Caliber, which has always made me laugh because it's such a ridiculous name. But I decided against it.

Samuel
01:03:17
That's fair enough, yeah. So good pick, Matthew. So we're up to my fifth pick, right? Yeah. Yeah, okay. So fifth pick, gonna go Japan only, and I'm gonna take Sin and Punishment, the shooter by treasure So this is a tough category actually because there are a few interesting suggestions, but I think this is like canonically the the big N64 game that people you know, really coveted from that system. There are other games from Treasure I thought about as well, but I think this is the one in terms of like, you know, when you look at lists of games that only released in Japan, this this is it. So it's a third person shooter from treasure. So a bit different to some of their 2D offerings. It's super, super slick and smooth for an N64 game. Like I don't know what magic they did to get this working. I actually played it for the first time when they released it on Wii on the virtual console a bunch of years ago. Uh sadly I no longer have um have that we I gave it to my ex-girlfriend so she could watch Netflix on her shitty TV and um didn't get it back from her before she moved to America. Side note there. Um bit of a bummer. But yeah, so so yeah, um I did but I did enjoy this. I probably played it for like two days and Just thought it had real kind of imagination and looked fantastic for a a game from the time. Like it's a fairly late-on game, I believe, in the um console's lifespan. But yeah, Sin and Punishment is it's a great shooter. I think that, you know, it's arcadey and fun, the sort of thing people will want to play when they um they pick up their N64 mini and just obscure enough. that it'll be um a cool coveted pick to have in that in that category Matthew. So what have you what do you make of this one? Have you played it?

Matthew
01:04:54
Yeah, played it on virtual console, you know obviously was incredibly exciting that they brought it over. I mean that was that was a really cool push from Nintendo back then. I wish I'd done it with a few more things actually. Like super far, super relevant. Yeah I mean y you can't can't really fault it. Really exciting. Treasure. The Trish are gone now. They're gone, right?

Samuel
01:05:11
I think they haven't released anything apart from re-releases for quite a long time. So yeah, it seems like they're gone. Which is a bummer, right? because you know. Yeah, and they had such a run.

Matthew
01:05:20
I mean man alive. And they had a good run on N64 as well. Like they did a few things. So I th I think for Japan only it's between a couple of things. But um I can live with it, but that's a really, really sound game and people will have a great time with it.

Samuel
01:05:34
Yeah, the one I thought about was uh the original Animal Crossing.

Matthew
01:05:38
Because Yeah, I yeah.

Samuel
01:05:40
But you know, people it that's really just like people will play it for ten minutes and then and then just go back to playing the one on Switch, you know?

Matthew
01:05:47
That's that's I think it has just been too s surpassed too much, you know, it it would be like I mean really wild if they had to localize that entire thing for this one very niche thing, but you know, I feel like Nintendo has made a couple more swings with their mini consoles than like PlayStation did with theirs, for example. You know, like when they did the Star Fox 2 thing, for example.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:06:10
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So they've got form for doing slightly balmy things. Yeah, for sure.

Samuel
01:06:16
The other one I looked at was there is a 2D Bomberman game that only released in uh Japan. And um, you know, I think Bomberman would be a fun for some local local play, but I I actually thought Setting Punishment was just more sort of like raw N64. Um it just spoke to me more in that in that respect. So um yeah that's why I picked it. So what's your fifth fifth pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:06:35
Oh god. You know what? I feel like I've really made a big sear of this.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:06:42
I'm looking at my list, I'm just feeling an increasing sense of doom. I feel like I just I put you on the back foot with that early double.

Matthew
01:06:51
Yeah, that really got me. That really f I feel so much happier if I had one of those shooters.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:06:55
Yeah.

Matthew
01:06:56
And I feel like all my interesting choices are not getting to pick because I feel I'm feeling like I'm running scared. Should I just be brave and be like, it's this, it's this weird fucking thing.

Samuel
01:07:05
Yeah, it's got according to plan for me so far, I must admit.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:07:08
Surprised I haven't robbed one of your things, which is what I want to do. Um I'm out to wound more than win.

Samuel
01:07:16
I think you can turn it around. Um there's a couple of categories here where I'm a bit on unsure footing, so you might be able to win out.

Matthew
01:07:22
For wildcard, I'm gonna take Mystical Ninja starring Goman. This is like a bit of everything, like I just trying to pin down its genre. I guess it's an adventure game, sort of a little bit sort of Zeldry, there are platforming sequences, there are action sequences, but it's also got that everything but kitchen sink approach, which I think is it's kind of got big backpage pod energy. It's one of those sort of definitive like weirdo seven out of tens that are gonna be ten out of tens for some people. A kind of a giant peach-shaped spaceship turns up and turns uh their traditional castle into like a western castle and the world is being taken over by a sort of theatre troupe. And so you obviously have to stop this. There are lots of really weird characters. Slightly wonky localization, which is now sort of treated with with more affection as as part of its comic charm. It's got song and dance numbers. You occasionally turn into a massive robot and fight other robots in space. No way near as sophisticated an action a game as a platinum game, but it has some of that like what the fuck is this gonna do next stuff that you get in a platinum game, which I really like. I also just feel like it's a thing like lots of people maybe maybe read about but didn't play. It was just a little bit too janky to kind of get the the the s the critical adoration, but this is definitely one which I feel is heralded as like a super essential kind of cult classic.

Samuel
01:08:49
Yeah, I struggled this with this category more than any others and Have a technicality question for you on that when I get to it. But yeah, this is um this is a game I remember having a good reputation in magazines at the time. And I don't think I ever really knew what it was about, Matthew, but I just read the Wikipedia description of the story. So the story follows Gomon's struggles to prevent the Peach Mountain Shoguns gang from turning Japan into a westernized Fine Arts Theatre. The plot calls for three cinematic musical features and battles between giant robots like other Gambare Gomon games. It is peppered with surrealist humour and anachronisms. So That sounds like unlike anything else, and therefore I think it's a good a good pair for this category. I mean that's just so fucking weird.

Matthew
01:09:33
It has this like spirit of N64 to it, which is This is the era where like everyone has to learn how to make 3D games of their 2D games. It's really interesting because a lot of people get it like horribly wrong. A lot of people are quite unsure of themselves, but there's also like a huge amount of experimentation in it. I guess at the end we can talk through some other choices that didn't make it, because I don't want to give you any good ideas. Um Because you don't need them. Um because you're full of them. Um he said bitterly. But I think there's some other things in this genre which I actually had the most picks for this particular category. Cause I feel like there are lots of weird seven out of tens which are are maybe a bit better than that on N64. Um because of that that whole kind of weird 3D transition period. It's a interesting time. And I don't think we kind of gave people much credit or had much patience for them at the time. Like it was very easy for you to go like, oh God, you know, the fucking platforming's rough and the camera sucks and you're like Everyone is inventing this stuff from scratch right now. Yeah. Um and it with hindsight that seems a lot more apparent, but at the time it was just like beastings left, right and center.

Samuel
01:10:51
Yeah, that's actually like I mean I I haven't picked this, but I fucking love Shadows of the Empire. Um but it was su it was such an early three D game, like so early. Like it was a launch game for the um the console in North America. Yeah. And its shooting is like not the greatest, but it's not too bad. I actually thought the shooting was a little bit better than um Jet Force Gemini to dunk on that again.

Matthew
01:11:12
Oh my god. Let's not get the rare stands coming after this podcast.

Samuel
01:11:16
There is a bit of danger of like if I slag off a rare game too much, will people turn on me in the voting? So um Yeah, but I um you know, I have plenty of respect for their other games, but that just that seemed like the obvious stuff one out of the lot to me, but I don't know.

Matthew
01:11:29
Um dash render.

Samuel
01:11:31
Yeah, yeah, budget um sort of lid all hand solo, that's his uh his vibe. So Matthew, we're five with five picks down. Yeah. So why don't we recap? Do you um so I've uh I'll just fire through mine, then you fire through yours, yeah? Yeah. Okay. So for shooter, I've got Golden Eye 64. For action or RPG I've got Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. For licensed game, I've got Star Wars Rogue Squadron. For Japan only, I've got Sin and Punishment. And for game made in the UK, I've got Perfect Dark. What have you got Matt?

Matthew
01:12:01
I've got Fighting Sports, Super Smash Bros. , Platformer, Super Mario 64, Action RPG, Majora's Mask. Wildcard, Mystical Ninja, Starring Goman, Free Pick, Paper Mario. When I say that out loud, those are five good games.

Samuel
01:12:19
Yeah, they definitely are, yeah.

Matthew
01:12:21
That's not too bad.

Samuel
01:12:22
No, it's if I it can eat me to reassure you, no, that's not too bad at all.

Matthew
01:12:26
Just tell tell me I'm okay.

Samuel
01:12:28
Yeah, you're a good boy. You're a good boy. Um Okay, so next up then, the category that I had the most choices for is free pick. I'm gonna take Star Fox 64 here. Okay. I think that I had this down for shooter at one point. I thought I could probably get away without a technicality, but it probably blogs here more. Um so This is, I think, one of the most easy to pick up and play N64 games. I say this as someone who has completed this game. four times in a brew dog in Cardiff. That's like how pick up and play this is. Back on E7N64 there. They got rid of it. Fucking full of stones. But um yeah. So I really love this. It's um, you know, kind of what Star Fox 2 was made into an N64 game. But I think it's just a really fun arcade style spaceship shooter with some really fucking rad optional levels that you can unlock and some cool secrets to find. So good replay value. I really loved it when they brought it out on the um the 3DS. I thought the um it still held up incredibly well. And so yeah, I think that you know this is this is a game again I think p everyone had on the system and a lot of people loved. So, yeah, the other pick I had for this category, Matthew, was Pokemon Snap. Because I thought Matthew won't pick a Pokemon game, and there's a lot of like residual love for Pokemon Snap. But Star Fox is definitely a stronger pick. And I'm kind of worried that you might have taken this for shooter. You probably haven't, but um so yeah, Star Fox um h holds up incredibly well. I can't say I think much of the multiplayer in this, but that's not why you play it. You play it too uh Have a really fun two-hour single player experience and then move on with your life.

Matthew
01:14:12
Weirdly, a game like I didn't have much of a relationship with because back in the time when games were super precious the talk of the short campaign and I know it's highly re replayable but like the the the length of it always gave me pause. I will say of all the Nintendo franchises it's it's the one I have like the least ongoing relationship with like I I kind of feel nothing about Star Fox. I like if they didn't make another one, it wouldn't upset me. If they made a bad one When when they made a bad one, it didn't upset me. Yeah, I just don't I don't I don't know why. I think maybe that relationship with Star Fox for most people begins on N64 and because we didn't own it, I just don't have that relationship. But that isn't to say it's a great game.

Samuel
01:14:56
Yeah, I think that the reason this series hasn't quite persisted as they've never really known what to do with it. So they try to turn into a kind of like shootery thing. More of a kind of hybrid shootery thing on the um uh the with the game Star Fox Assault on GameCube. Obviously Star Fox Adventures, kind of like, you know, a bit of a duff, uh sort of rare game, sort of Zelda like retrofitted from Dinosaur Planet. Didn't quite work. And so I don't know, you kind of end up in a position where you're just replaying the hits with uh with Star Fox. So I think that just having the peak of the series on this um on this format works for me and uh yeah I still love this game all these years later. So what's your sixth pick Matthew?

Matthew
01:15:37
For game made in the UK I'm gonna take Space Station Silicon Valley. The DMA design game, right? DMA design, really interesting platform game set in a basically a space zoo where you crush land. uh and you control this little sort of microchip with legs and in order to fix the zoo and basically solve its whole situation you can jump in and control the robotic animals taking on their abilities and it becomes this big strange ability puzzler. So you take over a robot dog and you can herd the robot sheep to solve puzzles or you know, there's this kind of ecosystem of like abilities between the different animals. This is super niche and I don't know if it was really a big thing. I don't think it was a big thing full stop and I don't know if it was if if any kind of reach it had was purely within the UK. N64 went for this in a big way. Either we owned it or like clo friend close enough friends owned it that we that we're able to play absolutely heaps of this. Really interesting puzzle platformer. It like doesn't uh exist in other form. Actually there may have been a PlayStation 1 port, but this definitely, like, belond on N64. I was quite tempted by There's another DMA game which we can probably get to later. I'm not a big rare guy, to be honest, which is why, you know, I could have easily picked a big crowd pre-pleaser like Banjo Kazooie for this. I'm actually gonna have a bit of integrity and stick with with what I think. And I think an interesting puzzle platformer about possessing robot animals in space is just what people want.

Samuel
01:17:13
I thought this was actually like your opportunity to wound me, because if you'd have taken Banjo Kazoo off the board Like I wouldn't have known what to pick for platformer. Oh okay.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:17:22
So we would have had a red faction moment. Exactly. You could have kneecapped me on that one.

Matthew
01:17:26
You would have been like Glover Oh dear.

Samuel
01:17:31
Yeah, or Rayman 2 I might pick that. But um yeah. So that's um that is interesting. Yeah. I thought you might pick Blast Core, Matthew. I played that yesterday. I thought that was fun but quite limited considering its reputation.

Matthew
01:17:42
Blast Core space station Silica Valley sort of exists in a similar space of like quite weird things that once you're done with them you're done with them. Um I just Blascore's whole thing is like it just trades on super panic and stress and anxiety of like things going wrong. It's not Massively fun to play because of that.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:18:02
I fight like it's it's just too much for me. The camera in that game is absurd as well.

Samuel
01:18:07
Like it's sort of it's over the head. Like kind of like isometric, but zoomed in so you can't fucking see anything coming up. Like it's just pure chaos. And I think that I respect that how much they get out of a very limited concept. But Um and it probably would have been quite a fun throwaway game. It was like perfect when the when the N64 had a budget line, that player's choice one, but the budget games were still thirty quid, which is hilarious. Yeah. This this was one of them. Blast Core was one of them and I thought that was kind of It's probably spot on for that, but um not as much fun to play in twenty twenty one, I would say. So yeah, this is a good pick. Um I've been sort of considering these two games for another category, the games from this uh developer that um come out around this time. So yeah, uh good pick, Matthew. A good pick. Um very hard. Heartfelt which part.

Matthew
01:18:53
Yeah, I'm just trying to create a bit of a range now. I feel like I've I feel like I've kind of got first party I've got what I've what I've got, so let's try and make it a bit more interesting.

Samuel
01:19:03
Mm-hmm.

Matthew
01:19:03
That makes sense, yeah. I just don't want like when this mini comes out, I don't want Eurogamer to write a sneering post about how conservative it is. Yeah. That's fair enough.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:19:12
I think Chris Donlan's gonna be behind my Mini 64. That what a really cynical way to try and turn it around for yourself. Perfect die. I'll mention Chris Donlan. Whimsical game about a r with a robot kangaroo, that'll do it.

Samuel
01:19:32
I think um with um uh Gomon and um and that you've ticked off that pretty um pretty firmly, I would say. So Okay, so we're on to my seventh pick. This is interesting because it's quite tough around here. I feel like I've got all the main ones I wanted. A technicality question for you, Matthew.

Matthew
01:19:48
Yeah.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:19:49
Can Conquer's Bad Fur Day be picked as a wild card? I think so. It's quite an it's quite an odd ball.

Matthew
01:19:55
Yeah, I I I wouldn't I wouldn't be upset if you did that.

Samuel
01:19:57
Yep, that's what I will do then. So my seventh pick is Wildcard Conquest Bad Fur Day. Rares game that was published by THQ because Nintendo wasn't into all of that. You know, the very gross and strange humor of this really cursed game. So uh I played this for the first time recently. I I played about three or four hours of it. And its sense of humor Is like some trapped in some 90s vortex of like British lad humour and like gross out kind of like animation, like adult animation from like the 70s. I It's an absolutely fucking weird mix of stuff. Like I say, I think this game is deeply cursed, but it's a it's a really fascinating artifact. Like how it happened, I don't know. It so obviously has um you know the developers playing the characters in the game and the voice acting does not sound professional. It's like A really strange sort of like droning British accents in it. It's got obviously the big um the big Pooh Man sort of moment. Is he called King Pooh or something like that? Or am I thinking of Mighty Singing Pooh. That's it, yeah. That's it. You know, you you wake up with a hangover. It's kind of a platformer.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:21:05
I could probably have got it in that category if I wanted to. But I wouldn't have put that in I mean, you can, but it's like it's a horrible platformer. But yeah, what what is this game? It's kind of like a platformer and a point-and-click adventure.

Samuel
01:21:18
Isn't it?

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:21:18
It's like Yeah, it's like a co yeah, a comedy adventure game.

Matthew
01:21:21
I actually really like the context sensitive thing in this, that it has like one button that does everything and that that everything allows the game to be like Well, all kinds of different games.

Samuel
01:21:32
Yeah, so it does a it does a lot with um you know it's kind of like a a rare best of compilation in terms of the variety of stuff. It has in it, I guess. I guess I come at this knowing it's a kind of like a a worthwhile part of the N64's library. A really interesting obviously it's a rare game and it's the weirdest rare game on the system. So I think it has a place on the on the on the console. Can I truly say I love it? I would say anyone who has never heard of this game who would play it in 2021.

Matthew
01:22:12
Of the worst difficulty spikes I ever faced on N64, it has a killer matrix parody, which is just genuinely really, really cool. It's like the lobby shootout. Loads of slow motion sideways jumping and it just it just looked at the time I was like wow it's just like the Matrix this really pressed my button back when I was fifteen.

Samuel
01:22:34
And that's fine. I think like I played this game originally in the format it was supposed to be played in. So a a fr uh a guy round a corner who lived around the corner from me. Played a few hours of it with him and a mate, and we just played through it at the age of like twelve, laughing at the different gross jokes in it, and the fact that the squirrel was hung over and all of the disgusting things in it. I don't necessarily think it's like a great game, but I think, yeah, like I say, it has a weird artifact of the N64, a fine pick, I think, for this category.

Matthew
01:23:02
But in putting this on your mini I think you instantly get your mini cancelled in twenty twenty one.

Samuel
01:23:08
That's the weird thing. People haven't really cancelled this game, but it feels like within an hour I thought, well, this must have been cancelled, right? But I think that people just accept that it's a product of its time and that that That that's fine. Um our pal Jay Bayliss pointed out there's um a few references to a very specific part of Liverpool or a place near Liverpool. That um come from the writer of this game and um he got in touch with that writer and asked him about about it because Jay lived in the same place. So um I thought that was quite interesting. But you know, just speaks to how weird this is. It's like I don't know, it's like a kind of Slender Man style myth that exists as a real game. Like, there's this fucked up strange, like rare game. The people who made Banshee Kazooie made this really Fucked up weird British comedy game and like it's so odd Matthew. Like it's so weird to play.

Matthew
01:23:55
The the Rare at the time, you know, they had a lot of distinct teams that were kind of siphoned like they were in physically separate barns was the Rare Studio. They often talk about these development barns. And I like the idea that there was like no cross-pollination and just that in one of these barns something but like evil was happening.

Samuel
01:24:14
Yeah, perfect. Uh so yeah that's my seventh pick, Matthew. Um I thought about tactics ogre, but honestly that just looks like hard work and I don't think anyone wants to play that in 2021. Just go play an RPG on a different system, that's what I think.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:24:27
But um yeah So what's your seventh pick, Matthew? So I've got a question about license game and the rules here.

Samuel
01:24:33
Yeah.

Matthew
01:24:34
When we say license game, does it matter what it's licensed? Like, could it have licensed a sports license?

Samuel
01:24:42
I guess I saw it as more of a movie tie-in thing.

Matthew
01:24:44
Yeah.

Samuel
01:24:45
I would I will allow I think Could th in the way that you gave me leeway for wildcard to pick a rare game.

Matthew
01:24:50
Well no, that's okay. I I don't have to I don't have to push that button just yeah.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:24:53
I'm just I will I will give you that leeway if you want to take it. That's that's probably

Samuel
01:24:59
I'm just I'm just I think I think I'm just making up for taking the two uh rare FPS games.

Matthew
01:25:03
Yeah, don't feel bad about it. This is fundamentally a competition, it's important.

Samuel
01:25:06
Yeah

Matthew
01:25:07
Um don't lose that killer instinct, because it's that which is gonna lift Big Sammy Holdings to the top. Trust me, Matthew Castle Productions does not need any help. Japan only, I will take Uh Bangaio, which is the other treasure game that didn't make it over to UK. They also made Mischief Makers, which um That was the first one and I'm guessing the sales of that is why the other two didn't. I think the problem was because it was a 2D game. There is a bit of two D snobbery in the f it in the N64 era because people are like Well this is the 3D era, what are you making 2D games for? Which obviously now is like a preposterous idea. You know, the form is respected, but I definitely think there was a bit of snobbery. Bangao is a 2D S mech shooter incredibly arcadey, like you're literally blasting up giant mazes of you know rival robots and gun turrets and they turn into fruit. Do you then collect the fruit to unleash An incredible barrage of a hundred missiles. When you see it in full swing, it's still pretty cool because like every missile has a trail and you know, I never owned this. There was a DS one, there was uh Bango Spirits on the DS, which was uh not a remake but uh ver very sort of similar in spirit and that was that was rad as hell. You know I remember this being another like if you if you can import a Japanese N64 game But you don't have to be able to read Japanese to just enjoy this insane arcadey thing. Not being able to have sin and punishment. Uh I think Bangayo is is a weird thing that people would be able to to dig into.

Samuel
01:26:38
Uh so I thought about this too, and I think there are already ten thousand copies made of this on N64 before it was ported to the Dreamcast. So I think that's Your instinct is good there. Um I thought that the only reason I picked some in punishment is it's the I think it's the more well known of the two. And Obviously, like, you know, it's the one they re-released, so Sin and Punishment is more of a obvious crowd pleaser.

Matthew
01:26:58
You know, it's a 3D action character game. You know, it's there's a lot more to grip onto. Banco is a lot more abstract. you know, it has the sort of treasure kind of perfection and beauty to it, but that is a harder sell.

Samuel
01:27:10
Good pick. Good pick. That was um actually like not as rich a font of like Cool, interesting games I thought it'd be though looking at this.

Matthew
01:27:17
My lasting memory of this period was longing for stuff I didn't have, but that that was maybe more to do with just the incredible gap between US and UK releases that we often got. And in my head that translated to there's loads of stuff we didn't get. You know, there are people I follow on Twitter who I know listen to this podcast who have amazing Japanese N64 collections who'll be like You know, I could have picked I could make a mini just out of these Japanese exclusives.

Samuel
01:27:45
So for my eighth pick, time to rip the plaster off and pick a racing game. So every time I've seen someone playing a SNES Mini, and I mean every single time, the thing they pick up and play is Mario Kart, Super Mario Kart. So I think there's probably a game or two I that may be maybe slightly more interesting, but I think that people will want with their N64 Mini a Mario Kart game. So I'm picking Mario Kart 64. Yeah. You know, there's obviously there's always like um a chatter over what, you know, which Mario Kart is the most important. Obviously there are better versions of this game available, but it's still, you know, still a highlight I would say from from the series. I had a good time playing at the time. The tracks are really good. And I think that just, you know, these things always come with a couple of controllers and they're like wim purchases in a lot of ways. And I think that Mario Kart is in the spirit of that. They're just pick up and the ultimate pick-up and play game. So Well there's a couple of games I I like here uh I like aside from this. I think um as a big obvious pick and also the first game on my list that has Mario in the title, I think that's important. Um I think this is a good choice.

Matthew
01:28:53
Yeah, absolute classic. Another multiplayer classic. I think between Perfect Dark, Goldeneye and and Mario Kart 64 you've got so many winners or too many winners. Perhaps Um Mario Kart is a series I don't particularly go backwards with.

Samuel
01:29:11
Yeah, I think it's um this is probably similar though to your Smash Bros pick, Matthew. in terms of like the ethos of it.

Matthew
01:29:16
It does have its own character and it's it's um battle mode is especially good and you know people have such nostalgia for those tracks because they played them endlessly and tried to get all the best times to get on leaderboards in magazines. Remember when online leaderboard spent sending your time to a magazine? You can take a photo of your TV and get it developed. Mad. Did you ever do that, Matthew? Uh the only game I was ever good enough at was Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4. I don't think I ever got round to like actually taking photos. I had friends who did though. My friends were often in N64 and I was very jealous.

Samuel
01:29:51
Uh good stuff then Matthew. So that's Mario Kart taken care of for me. So we're on to your eighth pick.

Matthew
01:29:55
Ugh. Well no, I mean wait until you hear these picks. So this is a bit like at the press con this is where you're at E three and the

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:30:09
the host's mic's turned on backstage and everyone hears you say that. Yeah. I mean Randy Randy Newman's just being loaded into the car. This is a load of old shit.

Matthew
01:30:19
Oh I mean, hello, are you ready for the revolution? I feel the desire to say Turek 2 for shooter, but I kind of hate it.

Samuel
01:30:32
Yeah.

Matthew
01:30:32
That's that's the dilemma. Like, I like the gun which drilled the people's brains out, but I never really got those games. It's it's pro it's probably gotta be Turk 2, but like The problem with that is when you just write this list and put it in that tweet, people are gonna look at that and go, huh, he likes Turek 2, does he? And I'll be like, no, not really. Like if you listen to the podcast You'll hear how torn I am over this. The thing the two I'm torn between is Turk 2 and Doom 64, because Doom 64 is held to be an interesting and good enough game that it got re- released on PC. You know, it is enough of a standalone Doom with its own vibe and pace. But also who truly loves it. Who's gonna be like, oh yeah, Doom 64? And you can play it. on loads of other things. We can play turret 2. Oh, I'm gonna have to bite the bullet, quite literally so, and say turret 2. Um it's got a cerebral bore. It's got um like five levels that are all like eighteen years long, which is a really bold design. Uh horrible checkpointing system, it's got some good gore in it. It's very much uh this drafts red faction, but it's not quite as bad as red faction.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:31:42
It's turret two, it's a masterpiece. Are you sure you don't want to row this one back?

Samuel
01:31:46
So let me just give you a scenario, right? So I post this list on the Twitter account.

Matthew
01:31:51
Yeah.

Samuel
01:31:51
The first thing people see is shooter Golden964. Now, do you think that looks better when it's shooter golden 964 Doom 64? Because I think I think the latter looks better and it doesn't immediately skew you a little bit. Because people I think like might write off Turok as being slightly NAF and stuff. And like you say, maybe Doom's got the restored reputation. I don't know why I'm doing this. Being, I guess charit I'm being charitable, but just thinking about the perception of your list.

Matthew
01:32:20
I think I actually think you're right. I think that's I think you I like I know it's terrible to pick this based on how it's gonna be presented in a tweet, but I think The the problem with the last list is that Red Faction in the podcast was the last one, so it left it on a really sour note.

Samuel
01:32:36
Yeah

Matthew
01:32:37
Uh here you're right, people are gonna see that. There's no shaming Doom 64. Not at all. It's it's it's respected. It's an interesting bespoke Doom. Everyone thought it was just gonna be A port of Doom. Actually, it's completely its own thing. It's a surprisingly good fit for the N64 controller. Works works very well. You've convinced me. Thank you for doing that. Um is just it's fu it's fucking rubbish, isn't it? It's Doom 64.

Samuel
01:33:05
Yeah, the thing What a journey you went on there. The thing is But the thing is, right, like I I got accusations of shenanigans for for the way that the list was posted, but I did just post it in the l in the order that Yeah, oh yeah, no, listen, i like trust me, if I thought they were shenanigans, I'd be calling shenanigans.

Matthew
01:33:21
Yeah.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:33:21
Uh I love to say that word. I love to kick off. Yeah, it's a great word.

Samuel
01:33:26
And yeah, I think that just by doing this you don't have to apologize for your picks. And I think that's just that puts you in a better position. I know that Turok has its fans, um, but I think that Doom is just a more respected game. And even before it was re-released on all these different formats, people I remember Dave Houghton, for example, was tweeting about how good Doom 65 was

Matthew
01:33:46
So I think if it's good enough for Dave Houghton, it's good enough for my mini.

Samuel
01:33:51
Okay, good. Alright, I'm glad I managed to turn you around on that.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:33:54
I think it'll make the um voting a bit spicier. So Yep. Good. Oh I see.

Matthew
01:33:58
You just want there to be a bit of competition. You're like, it's no easy if it's n it's no fun if I just uh sleepwalk to victory.

Samuel
01:34:05
No, it's just I don't want to repeat of you going, uh sorry about Turok two. You know, sorry about Red Faction, but the rest of my games are good. I don't I want you to like have picked as well as you can pick. So Well that's that's very kind. That's good. Well now I've done a bit of workshopping on your list. Time to go back to mine. Um so Okay, so I'm left with a few options here. For fighting and sports, I'm gonna go with Mario tennis. So I played that this week. I thought you would have picked Mario Golf for this category. I'm not much of a golf guy. I think tennis games are very playable. This is obviously a very basic tennis game with a lot of different characters. It does inflict Waluigi on the world, which you know is you know reminding people of that. Not sure how people feel about it. Also has these fun like Bowser levels where the um there's like, you know, uh sort of like mad nonsense going on on them. Caused by Bowser has a bit more of that Mario flavor. But also works well as a very basic arcadey tennis game. Um not much more to say about it. Just a good a good tennis game and I think Matthew said on a previous episode. These like sports Mario games were as good as they ever were on the N64.

Matthew
01:35:09
Yeah, I think so. They it's a classic example of you establish the rules, you nail it in one And then you spend the rest of your lives just adding garbage, like new features to the back of the box that are never very good. Yeah. Um I think Mario Golf run in sixty-four is definitely held as the best Mario Golf. Mario Tennis is it's between this and its Game Boy Colour or Game Boy Advance one. There's one of the handhelds which is also in contention, but in terms of the 3D Mario Tennis games, N64 all the way. Yep, I uh feel good about that pick. And um yeah, so Great multiplayer game. A particularly amazing sport for four players. Like just really suits the N sixty four.

Samuel
01:35:53
I now ha I now have like four of these different games that people can play with uh their friends and their games. I certainly do.

Matthew
01:35:58
How have I got I've got How many multiplayer games have I got? I've got one.

Samuel
01:36:07
But um How I mean yeah you have to laugh, don't you?

Matthew
01:36:12
I mean Oh my god, I've got one multiplayer game.

Samuel
01:36:17
How did this happen? How did this happen, Matthew

Matthew
01:36:20
Oh Jesus Christ The defining feature of this console and I've completely ignored it.

Samuel
01:36:35
Well look, you've still got racing to go. So you know that will get you one at least. Um unless you somehow pick a single player racing game, which would be amazing, but Ah, okay, so yeah, I've um you've got two categories to go, Matthew. So what's your um ninth pick?

Matthew
01:36:50
For racing, I'm gonna pick F0X.

Samuel
01:36:53
That was also on my list as a backup.

Matthew
01:36:54
I genuinely prefer it to Mario Carty's Obviously a series we haven't seen since the GameCube days. I know everyone likes the GameCube ones because it's got the most amazing graphics of any game that was ever made. Yes, yes, yes. Uh but the core idea of F Zero, which is just a shitload of ships going very fast over quite abstract futuristic tracks. That's all here. Everything you need to know about that series is on the N64 version. Some people say it's super ugly. I think it's actually like Very atmospheric. They stripped it down so that they can have 30 ships and that it can actually run okay. Uh runs very well, I think. I think that stripping it down actually lends it this very st this very distinct sci-fi look, you know, the kind of the weird sort of textures of the sort of cityscapes below and the shape of the ships themselves, like they're all just very interesting silhouettes rather than being specifically detailed. Just the chaos of 30 ships, racing, or battling, there's a really good mode where you get to knock out all the other ships, balancing like boost and um shields by going over these boost pads. It's really, really well done. There's a great risk reward system.

Samuel
01:38:02
I love the little man who says, three, two, one, go!

Matthew
01:38:07
at the start of every race, that guy fucking rules. Just a a really great super fast frantic game. It's got the track which is set shaped like a big hand. That is called Big hand, um, which I really like. This is fab. What a fab game.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:38:22
What a what a mini console selling game. Yeah, a great pick.

Samuel
01:38:28
I I um I actually played this one as well in research for it for it and I actually like still controls really nicely, plays really well, lovely and fast. Always impressed when a game like Sin and Punishment or this or Star Wars Episode One Racer manages to look like super slick um even in retrospect because there were so many smudgy, slow-looking N64 games. And so When it's just super crisp, you're like, oh yeah, yeah, that's some uh Nintendo magic at work there. So a good pick. Good pick for a fast racing game. Um yeah, I absolutely would have picked this in if uh you'd have grabbed Mario Kart sixty four. So a good choice, Matthew. So My final pick is platformer. Go with Banjo Kazooie. I knew Matthew would never pick this as his platformer, but I knew that if I got if I went first, I knew I'd pick Gold Knight. If Matthew went second, he'd pick Mario 64. It happened that way for me. That's very fortunate for me. Um, because obviously of all the aforementioned hate us bullshit I did to Matthew earlier in the draft um to throw him off. So I thought that Matthew wouldn't pick this and I felt comfortable leaving it to last, but I don't think it's a bad game at all. I think it's um actually of that kind of crop of Rare platformery adventure games, it's the best one. I think that I reviewed Banjo Tui actually when it came out on the Xbox 360, and I thought it was If it was it was vast, it was bigger, but I thought it was worse. I think this worked quite well because it has like smaller levels you dip in and out of and they act as like like mini hubs. And I thought the um I thought the character I thought the character controlled well. I like the whole sort of like, you know, sort of hovering a bit off of a jump and stuff like that. Um I think that maybe the camera placement is a bit shakier compared to Mario 64 in terms of controlling the characters. But uh looks really nice still, I think. Um don't necessarily vouch for the character designs. I mean there might be a bit of mileage on that one, that varying on that one. But you know, it's at the time I think they th I thought they were really cool, and they are definitely like you know, firm bits of the N64 iconography um Banjo Kazooie. That's why I think they make it they definitely make sense on this system. But you know, they they are still platforming sort of um silly characters from the 90s. So um I don't know. I'm being super dismissive there. I think I think that I think this is a good pick. So Matthew, what do you make of this game?

Matthew
01:40:36
I think my big problem with Banjo Kazooie is that I don't think it it is a platforming game, but I also don't think it is much of a platforming game. I think it's a weird character ability game. I think it's a lot more about unlocking their powers, their various action abilities. to sort of solve kind of puzzles in the map. There's not many stretches of like outright interesting platforming in this game compared to Mario 64. That's my big problem with the rare platformers in general, is I think they're they're all a bit gimmicky. The characters have so many abilities and they're locked behind quite weird combinations of buttons. It it they're just not a like a a very like elastic kind of organic platforming being, as Mario. who's like you feel like you have all his moves to throw around. Here it's like, well I crouch and then I hold this and then I press this and I'll shoot an egg out my ass. And it it feels a little bit like you're programming like a microwave or something. It's just like it's it's not quite the same thing as as Mario. But they look lovely, they've got very jaunty tunes.

Samuel
01:41:39
Um I kind of h hate the whole thing that they do.

Matthew
01:41:45
Like their vibe It just duh it just doesn't gel with me. Having played them back in the day, I then this is something I I absolutely 100% did this when I was playing it in rare replay and it just felt a lot flimsier to my adult mind than it did back then. I mean listen, it's still like a billion times better than Crash, Spyro, Slice

Samuel
01:42:09
I I think like accumulatively I've made my console tell quite a good potted history of rare on the platform. Yeah. By taking, you know, you know, obviously the different teams within Rare, but like Conquer Conquer and Banjo Kazarine, the two shooters. I think that's like um rare as well represented there. Yeah, uh so you say you say you're 100% at Banjo. Kazooie recently.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:42:29
Yeah.

Samuel
01:42:29
Well uh even though you don't really like it. I f I find that like perplexing.

Matthew
01:42:33
My not dislike for it, but like my doubts about it came out of that playthrough. Right, right, right. Because it it just felt like I looked through well, it's gonna sound really pretentious, it's like matri uh Neo looking through the Matrix. I was like, Oh yeah, this isn't much of a platformer and The these worlds which felt really alive are actually here are eight interactive things and you each one you do one of the abilities to kind of do it and I just it I I felt like I could just sort of see that see that a bit more clearly. It actually isn't like Mario 64 at all apart from the world structure. But it's it's fine. It's you know it's very shiny and you know enough people like it. More people like that than like fucking space station Silicon Valley.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:43:15
Yeah.

Samuel
01:43:16
So yeah, I don't feel bad about picking this one. I think it's um yeah, I I mean I I I haven't one hundred percentage it, but I I got fairly deep into it. I mean I can't say I really remember how it controls on 360 with the the different abilities, but I do like the idea. I think your full point about platforming is completely fair, but I do like the the way it's sort of like I don't know, a little bit Zelda-y or Metroid y in terms of like how you revisit the worlds.

Matthew
01:43:39
But Mario 64 has some of that stuff too. probably my least favourite thing about Mario sixty four is is where some people are like, I love exploring those worlds and I don't really think of Mario as an exploring character. Banjo Kazoe are exploring characters, like their moveset is built for that. But uh I used to argue with people about this all the time, so you know, I'm I'm willing to give up on it. Okay, fair enough Matthew. So we come to your final pick, Matthew. Which is licensed game.

Samuel
01:44:05
Hmm.

Matthew
01:44:05
I was thinking about episode one racing, but I I don't really like it enough, I don't think.

Samuel
01:44:10
You've got F Zero as well, you don't need both.

Matthew
01:44:12
Yeah. So I'm gonna actually pick Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:44:17
Wow. I would never have predicted that, but I suppose you are a big indie guy.

Samuel
01:44:21
But if you're a big thing, I am a big s I am a big indie guy.

Matthew
01:44:24
Um Is this good? Uh I played this on PC. It's the same game. This the N64 port came a bit later. So I played it primarily on PC. I absolutely love this game. I think this is great. I think this is like the best non Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider. Giant areas to explore. Obviously has that layer of Indiana Jones iconography which makes it super fun. It wasn't like massively adored at the time. It wasn't like a stinker. I think both the games got like 70 or Metacritic. Like for me, this has got like the scale, exploring around. It's got that Indiana Jones recognizable elements, which I really like. just brings it to life a bit more. The N sixty four they actually had time to fix a few things with the PC version so like the combat's a little easier. It has like Zelda's Z targeting in it so it becomes a little just a l a little friendlier. Like it makes more sense on console. than it did like awkwardly banging away on a keyboard, I think, um, as is often the case with 3D um action platformers. Am I gonna say it's it's one of the best games on N sixty four? It's not held as one of the best games on N sixty four, but I think a lot of people would discover this and go, oh actually this is pretty great. Um I've long thought it was a game that deserved rediscovery and re-evaluation. Uh this seems like a good opportunity to do that. I don't think it even came out in the UK on N64. No, it didn't. I think they had made it. I think people found like ROMs of like the finished ROMs of like the UK version. It was all ready to go and just never got never never got released for whatever reason. Um quite late in the life in the um lifespan of the console. Yeah, it's a really great Tomb Raidery game, but with Indy instead of Laura. So why the hell not?

Samuel
01:46:02
I think you've like uh I I think you've swung a bit too hard for how good this is, personally. Like I think it's like a wonky third person game that look looked and sounded really nice. Um because it was good.

Matthew
01:46:13
Honestly it's good. I really liked it.

Samuel
01:46:15
Okay, well I mean, you know, like you say, it got mixed reviews. I personally though think that Having this on an um on the N sixty four mini would be like compelling. You'd be what you'd want to check it out I think.

Matthew
01:46:24
So Yeah you'd be like, what the hell is that? Like It's a bit like when you can't, you know, everyone looks at a car crash, right?

Samuel
01:46:31
I considered this for wildcard briefly, 'cause it 'cause it didn't come out in the Europe I thought, oh maybe that does count as a wild card.

Matthew
01:46:36
I think I think it's a bit like What? There's an Indiana Jones game on the mini? That's interesting. I didn't expect that to happen. Yeah. Um, I really like Indiana Jones as well. Like Otherwise we get into the realms of like pod racing, which we actually had and I liked enough, but eh mission impossible. It had a couple of cool things, very shaky. The reason I was asking about the licensing is I was gonna try and do a desperate attempt to cram in Beatle Adventure Racing. Oh right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, which I actually wanted for racing, but I felt like I had I felt like I couldn't take it. I felt like I had to take something a bit more legit. But that broke my heart because Beatle Adventure Racing is a fabulous game. Um so it goes.

Samuel
01:47:17
Wavery 64 is another one I thought about.

Matthew
01:47:19
Oh yeah. The draft. She'd be a cruel mistress.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:47:23
As did who whi whichever bastard picked these categories. I mean Jesus. Take up with the I should have just come up with my list and then built the categories based on that.

Samuel
01:47:32
Yeah Okay, so we've reached the end of the draft, Matthew. Let's recap then. So we'll um we'll do it one by one, yeah. So you know, I'll read out shooter, you read I'll read mine, you read yours, and then we'll yeah. Okay, so These were this is what we picked for the N64 mini draft. So category one, shooter, I picked Goldene 007. I picked Doom 64. Category 2, Fighting or Sports, I picked Super Mario Tennis.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:47:57
I picked Super Smash Bros. Category 3, Racing, I picked Marikart64. I picked F0X. Category 4, Platformer, I picked Banjo Kazooie. I picked Super Mario 64. Category 5, Action or RPG.

I picked Bangio. Category 9, Game Made in the UK. I picked Perfect Dark. I picked space station Silicon Valley. Category ten. That one seems extreme. Category ten, free pick.

Samuel
01:48:46
I picked Star Fox 64 or Lila. And I picked Paper Mario. Uh how you feeling about that after recapping, Matthew?

Matthew
01:48:52
I'd hope to get like a bedrock of absolute unquestionable brilliance so that I could go down like the Beatle Adventure racing route.

Samuel
01:49:00
Yeah.

Matthew
01:49:01
I had also hoped to engineer a scenario where I had rocket robot on wheels for platformer. Yeah. Because that game is legitimately good. Ye It's the best game Sucker Punch ever made. Sadly it wasn't to be. I'd have let you have that for Wildcard if you wanted it.

Samuel
01:49:19
Yeah, is it worth some honorable mentions here, Matthew? I should actually I should just say to people, if you want to vote on this, I'll pin the poll uh up on the um our Twitter page at Backpage Pod on Twitter the day that this episode goes live. It should run to about the thirtieth of September and uh you can vote on who picked the best games. After a few days I will post the um the uh the image with the the games that we picked and so people can um uh have have that as a resource to help help decide who who won this draft and then We'll talk about the results probably two episodes down the line and um and yeah that'll be fun. But Matthew, so yeah, any honourable mentions you wanted to just bring up here, Matthew?

Matthew
01:49:56
1080 snowboarding in f in probably fighting sports rather than racing. Just a really different direction for Nintendo in terms of like It's quite realistic, it's not cartoony, it's quite serious, quite po faced, but has a really good atmosphere to it. Amazing snow still looks It still looks really fab today. Just a very nice sense of movement to it. I th I think that that's really really great. Maybe be a bit more of an interesting one to have on there. Bitcoin Adventure Racing, like I said before, I absolutely adore that game. Had incredibly inventive tracks with full of shortcuts and weird bits where you broke off. They were really uh like adventurous in their design and it was just really nippy fun, kind of came out of nowhere, a real like pleasant surprise that game. Rocket, Robot, and Wheels. Uh platforming game set in a theme part with just like very like physics heavy platforming, like it was i the the character had a r a real sense of weight to them and you were kind of fighting that and they had a little grappling hook. which was used in all these kind of physicsy puzzlers, had some really like ambitious things. There's like a a bit of a level where you can like design a roller coaster and then like ride the roller coaster in the level. Like it's It's really wild. Like you could you know, you were like these sucker punch guys are like ones to watch and then um they blew all that.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:51:12
There was uh I'm sure that many people who played Ghosts of Tshima will agree with that, Beth.

Matthew
01:51:16
You know, if you want to make games where you tick off like onto the map instead, then by all means. Can you build a roller coaster and go to Shoshima? Maybe the director's cut. Oh right. Oh well he goes to roller coaster island Pilot Wing 64 had some potential for like quite a defining, you know, maybe wildcard in a way.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:51:35
Bit of a softball pick that I thought.

Samuel
01:51:36
It wasn't quite exciting enough.

Matthew
01:51:37
In another 7 out of 10. with great affection. Operation Win Back, which was N sixty four's answer to Metal Gear Solid. Not a very compelling answer to. Um Seven is generous, I think. That was funny as well because the team you worked for were called the special covert action team or scat um which uh which is obviously great. I actually have a real soft spot as well for the N sixty four Castlevania games. They'd be interesting to have on an N6 So I played the first one, Castlevania, then there's another one called Legacy of Darkness. It feels a little bit like Game of the Year edition, like they added some other characters and sort of polished bits of it up. It's definitely wonky when you put it next to like Symphony of the Night. It's not what people wanted. But like I said, it's this period where people are working out what their games look like in 3D. And I would say that Castlevania has never fully worked out what it wants to do in 3D. This was a perfectly compelling take on that. Had fr had r like s really spooky stuff, like it's actually got like a lot of vampires in it and you can get bitten by vampires, become a vampire and you're in this sort of house with a day-night cycle. It's a bit like survival horror in places. Like you're in this big creepy mansion with all these people you're trying to like lead into sunlight to like expose them as vampires. You get chased by a Frankenstein with a chainsaw and a hedge maze. That's pretty exciting. There's also a skeleton on a motorbike. That's stupid. Castlevania is a game which I think a lot of people have a bad impression of because they've watched idiots on YouTube who play one level of it and scoff at it. and make a video going like, LOL, look at this Castlevania and actually if they played it they'd see that it's got a bit more going for it. Um it's a classic example of a game with uh an unfair reputation just because not enough people played it. It's no masterpiece, but it's interesting. And I also thought a little shout out for body harvest.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:53:23
I think body harvest is one I considered for wildcard, but it looks a bit too ropey, I think, by SpaceX.

Matthew
01:53:29
It's rough as fuck, but like you know, people see the origins of GTA 3 in terms of like open world game with vehicles. Yeah. You have to really squint but you see it. Yeah, it's a lot more like Earth Defense Force if it's anything. Like quite low t lo fi ropey, but you know, quite jolly game where you shoot giant insects in a range of vehicles. Um uh I always think Bill Body Harvest, whenever I think of it as well, N64 did a spoof of it on the back page called Bill Oddy Harvest. Yeah. Um which was just a screenshot of it with Bill Audie in it.

Samuel
01:54:03
Um so there was like a format of jokes they had like that. I mean the one I always remember is Turok 2 Weeds of Evil where it was a first person shooter in like a garden and it had like Charlie Dimmock and Alan Titchmarsh in it. It was like You know, the merging of video games, violent video games, and British Light Entertainment, Matthew.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:54:22
Yeah, very of that era. Um Jolly Demmock. Imagine making a Charlie Dimmick joke in a magnail. Yeah, good good picks there, Matthew.

Samuel
01:54:31
I I think that I don't have as many um uh honourable mentions just as on account of the fact that I mentioned a bunch of mine as we went. I think Pokemon Snap really would have a place in this console actually because I don't think you can really capture late 90s Nintendo without having some reflection of Pokemon on the system. It had four Pokemon games, so Two Pokemon Stadium games which are basically pointless without red and blue to plug into them. There's no need to pick those. And uh Pokemon Snap and Hey You Pikachu, which was only released in America, we could talk to Pikachu, but it was widely reported it didn't work very well.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:55:02
So that was so what's that guy gotta say for himself?

Samuel
01:55:05
Well I guess you're just talking at him.

Matthew
01:55:07
He's just gonna say his own name to you.

Samuel
01:55:09
But as someone who read like Nintendo Mags at the time, I did really cover this game, the idea of this game. I thought that sounds amazing, but obviously it wasn't very good, so um yeah.

Matthew
01:55:19
I can't think there are a few characters I'd rather talk to less than Pikachu.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:55:23
He's not gonna have any interesting opinions on art. Nope, that's very true.

Samuel
01:55:26
So, thought about that. Um I I love all the Star Wars games that came out on this um on the N64. I think it had a good run on that console. So I thought that um Battle for Naboo which is also a fact to five uh spaceship shooter, but on more kind of land-based levels for the most part. Very very good. Um I think the fact that it was episode one iconography and the fact that it had some ground vehicle bits meant that it wasn't as loved as uh Rogue Squadron was. Which is fine, but I think it was actually a pretty decent game. Ver And you can't actually get that on GOG. And so I think that um that's kind of a little bit of a lost game, but I enjoyed that a lot of the time. There is yeah, obviously episode one racer, which we discussed, R. L. Shadows the Empire. And I thought about some kind of puzzly games for this, Matthew. Like um Pokemon Puzzle League people seem to like, but I didn't play that one. Um I think there's a couple of other interesting bits and pieces, but um Generally speaking, yeah. Not not much else. Most of mine is represented in the uh in the picks we've got. So yeah. Anything else you want to add, Matthew, before we wrap up?

Matthew
01:56:20
That's that's all good. I think I've said my piece. As I said before, look at the list as a whole. Don't just look at the the don't think, oh, I don't like this one game. Think about all the general quality of them. Think of all the new games you're gonna discover.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:56:32
Sure.

Samuel
01:56:32
Don't think about the fact that it doesn't have Goldeneye on perfect dark. Think about anything else.

Matthew
01:56:36
Ignore that. You played those games so much. You know them inside out, don't you want to discover? Doom sixty four?

Samuel
01:56:43
Yeah, I mean who'd want to play Goldeneye again in twenty twenty one? I think the answer is a lot of people. But yeah, we'll see how that goes. So it's backpage pod, pinned tweet, just vote, and we'll talk about the results in a future episode. So may the best man win. So Matthew, I'm gonna just read out a couple of our listener questions because we've gone quite long here. So um we'll save some of those for other episodes. This is from um Tom Doughty. It's a kind of a sequel question to a question that came up during the indie games episode, uh a baffling sort of like sequence of questions which kind of pitch um Yoshinaka as some kind of like uh criminal mastermind, which is uh you know, just to be very legally clear, no one is saying is the case on this podcast. It's um some kind of it's uh this is a uh alternate history jokey version of Yushinaka a kind of caricature that's been built up as Matthew's rival on the podcast.

Matthew
01:57:36
So no one no one manages to convince people that like Knights is decent without having some kind of evil in them.

Samuel
01:57:42
Yeah, but I think I just the way that Tom pictures him is almost like like the main character in like um

Matthew
01:57:55
The greatest the greatest trick the devil ever pulled. was convincing Squarey Nicks to make Balan Wonderland.

Samuel
01:58:01
Okay, so after another bungle ties, Yushinaka has once again come rushing to your house to avoid the lore. While hiding behind a curtain, Yuji Naka's stomach starts to rumble, so you decide to take him to JC's kitchen to calm him down. Luckily there is only light cloud cover in the sky, so the meat tent is open for business. What menu items do you decide to feed Yujinaka to make him happy again? Thanks, Tom. What's um Um So the Rap is a classic, as is the bubble and squeak. I feel like The noodles are maybe a safe bet, just because it's a bit lighter. Um, he does noodles, it's always the same meat, but he mixes them in with like um a different kind of pro uh different carb, basically, Matthew. What do you think?

Matthew
01:58:42
Yeah, I'm I'm like strictly a bubble and squeak guy. Bubble squeak with whatever that is it blue cheese he puts on it?

Samuel
01:58:48
Yeah, I think so, yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. That is good. I've um it's funny because I I did go there fairly recently and like that um young man who runs the tent I haven't seen the the main dude for quite a while. The um you know, I don't know if he is called J C, but the guy who runs JC's kitchen. I think J C is Jesus Christ. Oh yeah, we did establish that on a previous episode. Um yeah and he just he's just been sweating all summer serving people meat and I feel kinda bad for him. I was saying to him, Oh, I I feel like I should like dab your forehead like uh a nurse does to a doctor um while you serve me meat. Um and uh that maybe that was a bit of an odd conversation starter, but you seem to appreciate it. So Yeah, I think um bubble squeak's a good shout. I think the wrap though is really good because you can have it with a variety of sources. So I think that that should make Yushinaka happy. Where he goes after that I don't know. I don't know where the whole heist thing even came from. What a fucking strange like strand of our podcast this is. But I appreciate the question, Tom.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:59:42
Anything more to add, Matthew? Uh I'm sure Eugenecker will love it. Yeah, cool. Love that bubble and squeak. That'll s that'll settle his tummy in no time. Okay. Yeah, okay. So uh here's what is one from Mark.

Samuel
01:59:53
Hi guys, sincere apologies if I missed this on a po on a pod. But not sure we ever got to hear your takes on Monster Hunter Rise. Last we heard I think a copy was on Sam's bedside table and Matt was unsure about including it in a birthday wish list. Personally it's been the Monster Hunter game that finally got me into the series and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. That's from Mark. So PS Love the Podcast, favourite GameSpace Discovery of 2021. Thanks for doing what you do. Thank you very much. So Matthew, what do you make of Monster Hunter Rise?

Matthew
02:00:16
I haven't played it. I've watched Catherine play it, and my very boring take is Core. How does that run on Switch? That looks a bit good. She seems to always be run sitting on the back of some giant beast. I should probably play this before our You know, games of the year chat at the end of the year. That list is massive, by the way. I've got so much stuff I need to have an opinion on by the end of the year. But I will have one. It kills me.

Samuel
02:00:40
I'll have an opinion. I audited my list, Matthew, and I've only had I've only got six games that I can put on there so far because I've been playing so many old games this year. So yeah, that'll be uh I've got a bit of a rush before the end of the year, that'll be fun. The games industry is no stranger to licensing deals, both epic and questionable. After a successful few years of strong revenue and positive press, Big Sammy Holdings and Matt Castle Productions are ready to strike some deals. What licensed product would you look to create for your respective companies? Coffee table books, action figures, gamer chairs, board games, etc. And what would make them on-brand for your company? For example, a branded monopoly game where Mayfair is replaced with JC's Kitchen. Holy shit, how did JC's Kitchen become so synonymous with this podcast? Um that's from David Burroughs, our Ubisoft pal, who um will regret sending me this question when I ask him for a copy of Far Cry Six in about two weeks, so that'll be good. But um what's your take on this, Matthew? What are the Matt Culsa productions um merchandise.

Matthew
02:01:35
I feel like it has to be some kind of sweets, right? Right. But does that count as merchand? Do people like merch that they eat and so it no longer exists?

Samuel
02:01:43
Could you like get a sort of special brand of Renny and then when you redeem a code you get like in-game extras for uh I don't know, Hotel Dusk HD or something? I don't know.

Matthew
02:01:52
Well like a Renny box but with like Halo on the outside. Yeah, basically yeah. I'd say like if you wanna get the new rumbly tummy emote, you need to get this Renny. Um yeah, maybe like a stick of rock

Samuel
02:02:07
Yeah.

Matthew
02:02:07
That that I think that blows the line between like sweets and something you keep forever on a shelf. Because it's you know it's already rock art. What's it gonna do? Get Get harder than rock, impossible. Yeah. So that with like, I don't know, my face running through it. Yeah, okay, fair fair enough.

Samuel
02:02:24
Yeah, very strange, but in keeping for sure. Um a diorama of a collapsing car with Randy Newman in it perhaps.

Matthew
02:02:30
Um yeah, or maybe because we've got the whole uh Forza Horizon thing going on with playground. Like a range of um like dangly like air freshness shaped like legendary figures from Matt Castle Productions. Yeah, like a a lovely smelling shoo takumi face. Because I always think if you look at him, he looks like he smells pretty fresh.

Samuel
02:02:50
This is getting weirder and weirder.

Samuel and/or Matthew
02:02:52
Every time we talk about Shootakumi. Oh we have to draw the line at you sniffing his face.

Matthew
02:02:56
He seems like a very clean man. Like there are some devs you're like, uh And there's sometimes you're like, oh yeah, I bet he's clean.

Samuel
02:03:05
Well Matthew, if I don't draw the line at you sniffing you a shootakumi's face Where do I draw the line, frankly?

Matthew
02:03:10
Um Oh no no you're not sniffing it. It's hanging there in your car. No one sniffs the magic tree like up close and personal, do they? Who puffs on a magic tree? Snorting magic tree.

Samuel
02:03:23
Okay, Jesus Christ, what a cursed bunch of objects. Um I think that uh I was thinking about this like t shirts, maybe we'd do um we'd adapt different Hideokajima uh tweets into T shirts, I think. So We'd make a fake um you know how he pitched that Mad Smacks game? It was like the ultimate Hideo Kojima tweet happened a few weeks ago where he was like pitching a game at Mads Mickelson and it just sounded very intense and ridiculous and probably Mads Mickelson was baffled. But yeah, he pitched um I think a project called Mads Max. Um featuring Mads Mickelson and we turned Mads Max into some kind of um shirt. We'd have a farewell sausage shirt as well. That was another um Kajima classic. I mean there are so many. Yeah, I think selling sausages with Hideo Kushima's name on it is just a bit too cursed though. I feel like it's just I've t I've taken things in the wrong direction. I feel like We're trying to keep things a bit classier, um, Big Sammy Holdings. We don't want to make it too British and weird. Whereas Matt Castle Productions is like, it's a stick of rock with literally the CEO's face on either end of it. And like Y you may think that's good, but I don't know. I'm I'm on the That is good. Um so yeah that'd be good and then just to annoy Matthew, we would like r widely distribute Hollow Knight Silk Song USB sticks. Um, just to really stick it to Matt Castle, who's sick of hearing me talk about the fact that I've got Hollow Knight Silk Song out of that draft. So um

Matthew
02:04:49
Admit it, like you're looking at that studio purchase now and you're like, where's the game? Can you guys hurry it along a bit?

Samuel and/or Matthew
02:04:55
You must be thinking that a bit.

Samuel
02:04:56
Well, I mean, I would be thinking that, but you know, I own Arcane, which just made Deathloop, so I don't know, things are looking pretty good. And you know, maybe we'll start talking about GTA 6 in the meantime. Who knows, Matthew? Um I don't know. I don't have to fight that battle anymore. I've um I've already won, so it's okay. But The draft in this episode, that's up for grabs. So go to Backpage Pod and vote and um we'll see who had the best N64 games. But Matthew, it was a pleasure doing this with you. I hope you enjoyed it still.

Matthew
02:05:21
Yeah, it was this was It was good fun, very stressful.

Samuel and/or Matthew
02:05:24
Uh I think I think we I think we got somewhere interesting in the end. I think so, yeah. I'm quite uh I'm actually knackered after doing this one.

Samuel
02:05:31
I think um I was just so emotionally invested in sabotaging you at the start there that I um I just after that I just lost all my um lost all my energy. So good stuff. So, yes, go vote at Backpage Pod, but we'll be back next week with another episode. I won't say what it is yet, but we've got rather a good special guest planned. Um if uh that doesn't materialize I'll never talk about it again, but I think it I think it's gonna be a good one, isn't it, Matthew? You excited about that episode? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I think people really dig that one. So If you'd like to follow the podcast, it's Backpage Pod. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter. Where are you, Matthew? I am Mr. Basil underscore pesto. If you'd like to leave a review for the podcast, many of you have. We've had a bunch of them coming in. We've got more than 80 in the UK now, which is um fantastic. to see leaving a review on Apple Podcasts really helps us with finding um new listeners so we really appreciate it when you do that otherwise we'll be back next week goodbye bye for now
