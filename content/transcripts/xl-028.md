Hello, Samuel here of the Two Giant Men Collective. This episode is something of a replacement temporarily for the 200th episode of the podcast, which was originally due to go live this week. Because that episode has turned out to be a bit more of a lift than we're used to from a regular episode, we have decided to push that back a week, give ourselves a bit of time to get it in shape.
Hopefully you will feel like the result is worth it. In the meantime, for our free feed listeners, we wanted to give you a sample of the great content that we make over on Patreon, at patreon.com/backpagepod. So in this episode, which was voted for by our listeners, we did a Two Giant Men Play Perfect Dark episode, N64 Classic, though I did play the superior Xbox version for this one.
Basically, we let people vote from, I think it was five or six games, and then the winner got its own episode for the Excel tier subscribers on Patreon, the Â£4.50 tier. So this is the resulting episode. I thought it was really, really strong.
If you have considered going back to playing the original Perfect Dark after the announcement of the sequel earlier this year, or the reveal of the sequel rather, then this might weigh your appetite. If not, it's got some pretty funny stuff in it, so hopefully you'll enjoy. In the meantime, we'll be back next week with our originally planned episode 200, where you'll get to hear me and Matthew.
Well, I guess I don't want to spoil it, but there's been a little bit of behind the scenes tension and upset over this episode, so that's part of the reason we had to push it back a week, actually, is some things have come up, as you'll hear next week, so enjoy Two Giant Men Play Perfect Dark. Let's see you next week. All right.
I'll crack on so you can have your dinner.
That's all right. I'm here for this. I'm excited about this one.
Yeah, I think it's going to be good.
My head is in the pod, I promise. It's like 95 percent in the pod, five percent in maybe a pizza.
Hello, and welcome to The Back Page XXL. No, it's not. The XL, page-exclusive episode of The Back Page Podcast.
I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Whoa, hello.
Hello, Matthew. Before this episode, which we're recording on a Friday night, I would say I was doing what could be described as latter-day Roger Moore Bond noises, as I was getting out of bed to do this. A lot of, uh, uh, uh, kind of like noises.
That's where I'm at mentally and physically. Where are you at?
Yeah, I'm kind of, I've definitely used this one before, but I'm very much the senator about to turn into a puddle in X-Men.
It is quite warm, yes.
I'm just like, please don't touch me with anything sharp. I'm that close to just bursting. I'm really very translucent at the moment.
That's what I think the boys at my gym think when they see me sweating to death on the treadmill. They just see Senator Kelly from X-Men 2000.
You turn around and go, I'm the juggernaut, bitch.
I do have a tiny bit of juggernaut energy, yeah, it's true. But like the off-brand one that's in Deadpool and Wolverine.
Oh, that one was so budget.
Why did they have the Aldi versions?
They got so many people back for that film, why wasn't Vinnie Jones in it?
I mean, I can't have had much of the budget, surely. That's like, look Vinnie, he's 30 grand. Yeah, he's 30 grand, Vinnie, just fucking come over for a couple of days.
Yeah, it's like the money runs out here, basically. Yes. So yes, very cursed energy to start this episode, which is Two Giant Men Play Perfect Dark.
So this month's Excel episode was voted for by you. Perfect Dark, the 2000 N64 game by Rare, reportedly outbid for the Tomorrow Never Dies license by EA and tired of the James Bond universe anyway, after the crushingly stressful development of goldeneye 007, Rare would instead create a sci-fi spy game inspired by everything from blade Runner to Judge Dredd, the X-Files and Metal Gear Solid. It's a very late 90s as fuck kind of game, but built on the bones of goldeneye, a first-person shooter in the same mold for sure, even some of the same multiplayer maps.
It's very much a spiritual successor, maybe one of the first. We'll discuss that a little bit as we get into this. But I've completed this game for the first time.
Matthew's played loads of it before. I think we're going to have a good discussion on this. It's got some meaty subjects to get into, Matthew.
So I think it's going to be good. First of all, obviously, we let the listeners vote for this. It beat, I don't even remember all the games now.
It beat that game that Supergiant made the first one, Bastion. Beat that. It beat undertale?
Was that last time?
I think it beat undertale.
Then it beat Shenmue and Silent Hill 2 and one other thing, Returnal. It beat Returnal as well. So it was very much a popular choice.
I can see why. Do you think the listeners chose wisely this time, Matthew?
At first, I was like, ah, fuck it. Like, I really wanted it to be Silent Hill 2 because I need to cover it for work. And I just wanted to kill two birds with one stone.
Kill two birds with one giant scary pyramid head. But that didn't happen. But once we got into it, it was fun.
And your enthusiasm for discovering the campaign and some of its quirks afresh kind of has sort of buoyed me through this process. And I've come out of the end feeling quite positive about it.
That's good. Yeah. I thought it was a good pick in the end because, yeah, I was looking for it.
I think I was looking for an excuse to dig into this. I think this probably leads nicely into my next question, actually, which is it's probably worth laying out our respective histories with Perfect Dark and the different angles where we're coming at this from. So why don't you talk about your history, Matthew?
I feel like it's come up on a podcast a few times. But yeah, just remind people.
Yeah. So before Perfect Dark came out, obviously, I was obsessed with goldeneye. goldeneye was a cornerstone of my personality, as it was for many 13-year-old Nintendo dweebs in the mid-90s.
This was the game that would most likely play with friends at friends' house. My two very close friends at secondary school, Craig and Mark, both had N64s. So goldeneye was just in constant rotation.
Then you just have to imagine along came a new game that sort of replaced it in every way. And it's kind of quite hard to explain how big that felt at the time. And you know, like someone coming on going, Oh, you know the thing you do all the time.
Well, now you're going to do this instead. And you're like, oh, OK. It just replaced, you know, like tangible percentage of every week spent playing goldeneye would now be spent playing Perfect Dark.
So, yeah, an absolutely massive one. If anything, like I think our sort of fervour for it was even greater because there was like a little bit of persistence in the multiplayer, which kind of made us even madder for it. And we were constantly trying to kind of work up work on our characters and drive up our profiles and stuff.
So goldeneye, we never left school grounds to play the game at lunch or to game it and try and drive up our profiles at lunch, but Perfect Dark we did. So I mean, it was such an enormous part of my gaming upbringing for sure.
Yeah, I can see why that would be the case. It's interesting because I was trying to rack my brains about what profile this had within my school friends system network of people who owned games consoles and therefore what you play at people's houses. It's interesting, goldeneye, I believe, sold more than 8 million copies on N64.
Perfect Dark, I think, sold under three. So it still did well by those standards. Required an expansion pack as well.
So not everyone had that. I felt like Perfect Dark was never quite as persistently part of people's collections in the same way as goldeneye.
No.
It's still reasonably persistent. What do you think of that?
Yeah, absolutely. And the way it's talked about, you know, when people talk about multiplayer on the N64, they are still much more likely to say goldeneye than probably Mario 64, then maybe Smash Brothers, as the kind of sort of trinity of multiplayer games. Perfect Dark, yeah, I mean, maybe it was like flash to the pan.
I don't know if we played it as much as goldeneye, in terms of years, because we went to college, and we went to different colleges, and that was kind of the end of that. But for the time that me and my goldeneye playing friends were still quite close and together, we played heaps of Perfect Dark. You never hear anyone have an anecdote about Perfect Dark.
On late night chat shows, you sometimes see, if celebrities have a video game anecdote from the past, is that they played goldeneye, and Jimmy Fallon will be like, ha ha, yeah, I could talk about goldeneye too. And he loves it. But if you said Perfect Dark, everyone would be like, what the fuck?
You know, if you start talking about the Farsight on a late night chat show, everyone's going to look at you like you're insane. The laptop gun, yeah. But it was good, you know.
It was excellent for everyone who was into it. It was excellent. Maybe what happened, I mean, we can probably get into this, but maybe there is just a split of, you know, there are people who, they like goldeneye because it's an amazing game, but they thought they liked goldeneye because it was James Bond and Perfect Dark doesn't have that.
And they were like, well, that looks weird. And I've never heard of this thing. Why would I be interested?
Where people who like the real heads, who knew kind of what features were going to be good or sounded interested, could, you know, looked past it. You didn't care whatever it was. It was just the team that made goldeneye, whatever they did next, you were obviously going to be all in on it.
But yeah, it just wasn't Bond, was it? You know, for a lot of people.
Yeah, it wasn't Bond. The expansion pack thing was obviously gating people out of it. Like I think the game basically barely functions without one.
You can see why when you play it, just the amount of features and additional things they layered on top of what goldeneye does, some of the lighting, stuff like that. It's a bit harder to maybe see the difference in retrospect when both of these games just seem blurry as fuck in their original forms to watch now. But there's definitely a marked difference there.
I had a little group of pals who were a little bit more engaged with games than other friends I had, and they tended to have Perfect Dark. So my friend Andrew had Perfect Dark, his brother had an N64. They had a shared N64 PS1 thing, similar to his brother, where they'd have access to each other's games, and therefore they could both play everything.
It worked out pretty well for both of them. I remember Andrew got really deep into the bots side of things as well, and doing all those challenges and unlocking every single option. He was in really deep with it, and that was the main touch point for me with it.
But I do think that because it released in the middle of 2000, its lifespan was cut shorter than goldeneye's by the fact that you're a few years away from Halo's split screen. So it's not really that long that Perfect Dark gets to be the king of multiplayer. It's really a year and a half, a little bit longer than that maybe.
So I think that was maybe part of it. goldeneye just had a bit longer to bed in, to be the sort of like, I mean, there was just never anything on PS1 that competed with goldeneye in terms of first-person shooter multiplayer. So it was the king of split screen just for a long time.
Perfect Dark didn't have as long.
Yeah, I mean, also, can you name a single character in Perfect Dark that isn't Joanna Dark?
Elvis, actually. Elvis the Alien.
Okay, Elvis. Is it Cassandra DeVries? Is that a character?
Something like that. Carrington? Avery Carrington?
Is that his name? No, that's a GTA character, Avery Carrington.
Daniel Carrington.
Well, I've just played the campaign as well, and I'm already forgetting.
Yeah, well, you just can't shit talk about it. It's hard to have anecdotes about Perfect Dark, you know?
Yeah.
She can't be like, oh my God, it's not like odd job. There isn't like an odd job, you know?
Well, no, you picked the Alien and you said, well, we'll get to this. You picked the Alien in multiplayer and like you were like, yeah, he's basically like odd job because he's like a bit shorter and has like smaller hitboxes or whatever. Doesn't have a hat though, but yeah, it's true.
Or like just, you know, just like the golden gun and all those kind of different James Bond elements that give goldeneye so much color. It's true that Perfect Dark doesn't have those, but it is objectively better, I think. So yeah, I experienced this game mostly through friends kind of second hand, but yeah, it was like the really dweeby Nintendo diehards who had this more so than the broader populace of people who had like, we talked about this loads of times, but like your basic 5 to 10 N64 games, Barry 64, goldeneye, a football game, a wrestling game, you know, Mario Kart, and then like just a dubious license thing, Turok, you know what I mean?
Iggy's Wrecking Balls.
Xena, the warrior princess fighting game.
A weird off-brand platformer, a Glover, an Iggy's Wrecking Balls, a Rocket, Robot on Wheels, a Gex.
Yeah.
Maybe if you were really spicy, a Space Station Silicon Valley.
Yeah, exactly. So it was, and I do really adore that about the N64. It's like the strange little collections people had.
But yeah, I also quite like that you get to the second half of its life and you get things like the expansion pack and these games that, the Kirby game on N64, just games that feel like they were just so small in the landscape of games at the time, even though these series would become massive or whatever. It just, the N64 becomes like a niche platform in its later years. It's just a little die-hards only apply.
Then of course, the PS2 comes along. Not long after Perfect Dark, so you're near the end of the console's lifespan here. But yeah, I always was jealous about it from afar, because the addition of like multiplayer bots and stuff like that always seemed really exciting to me.
It was cool that they brought back some of the goldeneye maps. I knew that was a feature in the game and all that sort of stuff.
I was just going to say, another tiny part of it, but a really important part of it, and why it feels like it has a bigger footprint than it actually did, is that while definitely in my school, Crayon Mark was basically the people who liked Perfect Dark, I could talk to about it. I was also reading N64 magazine, and if you read that magazine, you would think, well, hundreds of thousands of people or whatever you imagine in your head, read this magazine, and in that magazine, Perfect Dark was just the only game in town. They were obsessed with it.
They did all that huge coverage on it. They always had that amazing relationship with Rare. Basically, where official Nintendo got all the official Nintendo access for all the first-party stuff, it was all that except for Rare, and it was in N64.
I just remember reading 20-page previews of Perfect Dark in there, and you just came away going, that, well, this is obviously the biggest thing in the world. That's where so many of my misconceptions about games of the late 90s and early noughties came from, because I just read really good magazines that made them feel bigger. Yeah.
That's why we have these odd moments on this podcast where I'm like, no one had an Xbox, everyone had a GameCube because I read a magazine where everyone had a GameCube and no one had an Xbox, you know?
Yeah. But you know what, though? There's like, I think there is a real aspect to it as well in the sense that the N64, I think as was just proven out by the draft that we did, does just have like that bank of 20 to 25 fucking great games.
And it's the ultimate console that I never owned but wanted to own. Like it was still kind of like number one in that respect, the thing where I'm like, if I could just go back and plug that into my young life, it would have improved the years like 98 to 2001 exponentially. Those were crucial years.
But so yeah, that was part of the reason I was quite excited to do this. But that is something I wanted to tap into as well, Matthew, with this podcast is, let's talk about the very specific way this game was hyped up and how exciting it seemed in magazine form in the late 90s. So it had a long hype cycle.
It was in development for quite a while by the standards of the time, I think about three years. Quite unusual game. Like I said, it's a spiritual successor.
I don't think these really existed at the time. To a movie tie-in, they used the same basic core principles of how the gameplay worked as a first-person shooter that works on the N64's very deranged controller, but layers on what feels like this wish list of features they couldn't do in goldeneye. So campaign co-op, AI box and multiplayer, more elaborate weaponry, voice acting.
But that connection to goldeneye is what made it seem so enticing to me. I guess that maybe you had to read magazines to get that story. Otherwise, what Perfect Dark is, you might have avoided it.
But I was very, very aware of the fact that this was the goldeneye sequel at the time. I thought the name Perfect Dark was fucking rad. Then picking Joanna Dark as a protagonist felt like a post Tomb raider move that made sense.
In screenshot form, you could obviously see that it was like a sequel to goldeneye. So what else is there do you think to say about that hype cycle thing? Because I do think, like you say, it was a huge part of what the narrative of this game was.
Yeah, that's all true. I mean, if you read N64 magazine or any Nintendo magazine, it wasn't like goldeneye was like one and done. goldeneye, when it came out, was just a constant presence.
It was just like a core text. And games could remain a core text in a way back then and could sustain multiple years of coverage in a way that they simply don't anymore. Whether that's because there's like a turnaround of games now and things are just more easily replaced, or just people whose attention spans are shorter, or their access to games because they're better off or whatever.
But then I think we'd had this, it really was like I was saying, we'd had this ongoing relationship with this game and through the magazines and through playing it with friends. And just the promise that this was going to be as big a deal, was really all the hype it needed. There was no question that it was going to be good or bad.
It was obviously going to be great, and it was obviously going to replace goldeneye. And yeah, I don't think I can recall a hype cycle to so complete or total in how it worked on me. Yeah, I would have honestly have died for this game's honor before I even played it.
Yeah.
Because that's how... I know it's never really been anything else like it. I mean, maybe that's just as I get older, like my capacity for that kind of hype dies off.
But I feel like we're being asked to get hyped for so many different things. You know, this was like, it's like going, oh, it's the Bible too, you know?
Yeah.
You're like, oh, well, yeah, it's the most important thing in the world and there's going to be another one. So, of course.
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, it was, they made those new features just sound so, it made it sound so complete. I can't believe that they're going to improve goldeneye.
Bible 2 is a good way of putting it, I think. It's like AI bots seemed so exciting to me. I could play multiplayer indefinitely by myself.
That seemed like such a great idea. And in the game, that's the other thing. The game delivers on all the things that the hype cycle drummed up.
It is like goldeneye perfected in all these different ways. I mean, you don't have the James Bond license to it. So how you reckon with that as a player depends on how much your enjoyment of goldeneye was tied up in the Bond stuff versus the actual game part, for sure.
But just in terms of features, it's like, wow, they fucking actually did it. They actually landed the plane on this thing. That's what it seemed like it was at the time.
But just to a slightly smaller pool of people than it may be deserved, you know?
Yeah, yeah, that's very much it. I know there were points where I was playing it recently for this episode, and I was thinking, actually, the most outlandish tech plays in this game, the bits where it shows off the most, are things which it would have been hard to have found the equivalent in Bond. You know, I'm not saying that they were, like, technologically at the point where they could have done some of these things earlier.
But, you know, there was things where I was like, well, this makes sense. Like, the game is about, like, the absolute cutting edge of technology, and alien weaponry, and things beyond this world. And so, to deliver on that, you actually need to be able to do, like, guns that can shoot through walls, and have gadgets that can, like, you know, fly off and, you know, you can throw, like, a flying camera and fly it around the level, you know, away from Joanna Dark.
And that felt crazy at the time, this idea of, like, what the fuck? I'm, like, outside my body? Like, how is that possible?
And it's just a camera, you know, it's just a little camera trick with, like, a lens effect on it. You know, you are right. Like, the tech jump, it was a legitimate thing that happened.
It isn't just that this game happened to, like, lean into it. Also, like, the fact that it needed the expansion pack, like, while a pain in the ass, that always had the air of, like, now you're unlocking, like, the real shit on N64. Stick one of these bad boys in.
And this, you know, because it's like a hole in your N64. It's like it doesn't have a heart without this thing. You put it in and then it's like, now this bad boy is really ready to go.
And I never understood what it did. Like, you know, magazines never explained it. Because they didn't need to.
They were just like, this thing is going to blow your mind. And you'd be like, yep, that sounds good.
Yep, and it's Donkey Kong 64 is 79.99, but it comes with this thing, basically. Yeah. Yeah.
You make a good point as well about goldeneye being like, almost like the live service game of its day, except it never updated. It's just that the game would endlessly like sift through your brain and you would think about it in different ways. Like it was, it just bedded in and then you just kind of like relived it or just sort of like rediscovered bits of it.
It's true that goldeneye just lingered in this very specific way. Perfect Dark, I think there's a time aspect to this. It didn't seem like to me that it lingered as long, but I didn't read the later years of N64 as much as the early years.
Do you think they did manage to make it linger in a similar way?
No, because it came out in 2000 and then what? Two years later, you've got the GameCube.
Yeah.
And then it's like, fuck off N64. That's just what you did. You moved on.
There was no question of like, oh, I've got my new GameCube, but I still like to play the N64. I just don't think that's how people thought. Maybe people listening to this will really disagree with our assessment, but I just remember it being like you move on and you mourn the games that you won't play anymore even though you can play them because you're like, well, I just don't anymore because they're the last generation.
Also, we're not quite at the point where it's like it all goes online and all of a sudden all your local multiplayer friends are lost to online. That didn't happen to me. My friends didn't really get into online gaming until probably 2006.
It felt like that late into it. I went to university and my core group, we all scattered to the wind, so no one to play Perfect Dark with anymore. I didn't take in my N64 to university, took my GameCube and we played Mario Kart Wii for about 500 hours.
So that's, you know, that-
Do we double dash?
Oh, did I say Wii? Yeah, God, I played Mario Kart Wii for like 10 hours. Yeah, double dash and WarioWare and all that kind of stuff.
So its life was short, but it like, I genuinely remember it burning like brighter in that time than golden I ever did.
Yeah, that makes sense, I think. Like considering that there was like a hard stop coming to that generation, and it was definitely an era of hard stops in generations existing more generally. I can see why it didn't quite stick around as much, but as mentioned, I just think this really kind of like delivered on all of the things it promised at the time.
It's why it seemed so exciting to me as a player, like on the outside looking in or just enjoying it via multiplayer. So there's a few interesting of its time elements to this game, quite a few different elements, I would say. But it's funny that this game and Deus Ex came out in the same year, because they feel like they're drawing from such similar influences.
Like the Chicago level in this game almost looks like a chunk of a Deus Ex map, for example.
Very small chunk.
Very small chunk, fucking tiny, tiny chunk.
It's a corner.
Basically, yeah, extremely small. But like Perfect Dark is much dafter than Deus Ex. And the funny thing is, when you read about some of the influences on the story of Perfect Dark, you would maybe be fooled into thinking it's a slightly more serious hard sci-fi endeavor than it actually is.
But it's like I say, it's quite silly. Do these two games just sum up a sort of Y2K aesthetic that was in the water, Matthew? Is there something that's just lost to time a little bit now?
Yes. You can see how maybe developers of a certain age all have the same kind of pop culture references, the same kind of interests, the same kind of diet of sci-fi books or whatever. But then, the other people you're around, or other strands get mixed in with the DNA, and the Deus Ex team is this very cerebral, nerdy lot, while the rare guys are a load of goofballs in a load of barns, somewhere in the countryside.
Yeah. Perfect Dark is impressively grown up, given what else was being made was like Conker's Bad Fur Day, and Banjo-Kazooie, and Donkey Kong, which were just like sort of squawking. I'm real kind of children's concerns in terms of like tone and vibe, and very like British like pantomime and daft as hell.
And I kind of like, I'm not sure I actually like it in this game when it is sillier, but I kind of, I like the through line that you can see, like when there is silliness in it, you're like, oh, they can't help themselves, or there is a bit of British studio energy to the fact that this, you know, there are levels of this, you know, you could think it was a deadly serious affair. And then the second the aliens turn up, you're like, oh no, this is dumb.
That's the funny thing. I think actually it does hold on to that serious tone for maybe the first three to five levels. And then it sort of starts to peel back that it's a bit...
Dr. Carol has got a little bit of, like, this laptop with a face.
Yeah, just quite a daffy kind of character. And you're like, yeah.
That's the first hint that maybe you're not playing Deus Ex N64 Edition.
Yeah, that's the thing. It's got so little sort of flavor text to really explain the world or anything. It's very much what you see is what you get.
There's a tiny bit of voice acting. That's another advance, you know, like a way they've advanced it from goldeneye. Voice acting around the edges to deliver a bit of narrative, but it doesn't really do much heavy lifting in terms of world building or anything.
It's just quite silly.
The voice acting though, Elvis' voice acting is so out there as a choice. Like that character, as dumb as a little gray, like the most cliched gray alien, if you've not played Perfect Dark, Elvis is like your typical alien creature.
The gray alien in that style, the old style.
Yeah, except he has this like almost like yodery voice. And if that thing just spoke in a more soulful voice, I think you'd be like, well, this is silly because it's aliens, but the thing would feel way more coherent.
Like it would, but he does, I remind you, he does at one point wear a snorkel when he's about to go underwater. Like I just, he's quite a silly character and some goggles.
Yes, and by the end, like he's wearing like, like some really daft costumes. Yeah, like the rest of the, it's almost like the rest of the game around Elvis, it still maintains the tone of that first level. You know, like Joanna Dark is never like, like too zany a character and it's a cast of like politicians and conspirators and collaborators with these aliens.
The actual, the enemy alien forces in it, the Skedar or skedder, or how it's pronounced, are like, you know, kind of gnarly looking alien creatures. They're not like comedy rare aliens with like big boggly eyes. But then there's just this daft guy going in the middle of it, the whole time and you're like, where did this guy come in?
What happened?
I think this happens sometimes in these games. I mean, Deus Ex doesn't do that. Deus Ex is like, it maintains its tone throughout, I would say, even though it too has gray aliens in it that turn up at the end.
But it's sort of like how 343, Guilty Spark is sort of like speaks almost in a similar way. It's like Halo, do you know what I mean? But otherwise, Halo is quite a serious affair.
Like it just, it must just be the same kinds of influences that are like, are inspiring these designers in the early noughties.
But he's got a little bit of like C3PO energy of like, you know, oh, hello, it's me at Ro- That's how I remember Guilty Spark talking. Maybe that's, maybe that's wrong.
And a bit of Hal in 2001, A Space Odyssey.
Yeah, so they've got that. And I guess Dr. Carol's got a bit of that sort of like weird plummy robot voice thing going on. Yeah, I just think Elvis is like one voice actor tweak and like the game has got like a lot of tonal issues instantly vanish.
Yeah, it's sort of like, it also just loses the thread of that voice. Like sometimes it's full Yoda and sometimes it's kind of like part Yoda. It's just a mess to be honest.
But yeah. Okay, so got a few other things I want to sort of set the background of, Matthew, before we get into like our meaty game chat. Would you have traded this for another Rare Bond game?
Would you have taken Tomorrow Never Dies via Rare instead of this? If you had, you know, you could create that reality.
I don't think so. Maybe like, you know, maybe there would have been a time before it came out where I would have thought, well, I would just like more Bond, please. But actually, you know, some of my favourite things about this game are things that can only exist in this universe or wouldn't have made sense in the Bond universe.
You know, some of the kind of more exotic weapons and the kind of weirdness of that. I mean, I guess you could have justified it by like pretending Bond had a load of gadgets he didn't have in the film. But no, I think a lot of the kind of character of this is tied in to the world of Perfect Dark.
So no, I think I'm OK. What about you?
I would sort of like to see how they'd have tackled it. I wouldn't trade this game to have that. But there's definitely like a point of curiosity where Bond ends up in such bad hands after it leaves Rare.
It's basically mistreated as a license until present day.
That is true, but also goldeneye is a good Bond film and it's good material to work with as we will explore later. It's not a case of like not every Bond film has the right set pieces that you can turn into a first person shooter.
Yeah, it's true that goldeneye is unusually structured. It's got quite a lot of set pieces in it. It's got about four acts worth of set pieces in it and little mini set pieces that make perfect sense to turn into levels, like the graveyard level with the helicopter and stuff.
All the train, for example, all that stuff, it lends itself quite well. It's true that we will explore this a little bit.
I mean, that's the thing. What you're basically doing in that era is you're looking at a license and going, how much of this could feasibly exist in a corridor? Because I need to turn this into a load of corridors.
That is what games mostly are at the time. And goldeneye, the train, an amazing corridor. Just beautiful.
That's what you want. Those struts on the satellite dish, that's a load of corridors with a good background.
The damn great corridor. Just happens to be some water on the other, the outside of it. It's a spawn.
Yeah, I would be curious to see it just because I thought the EA Bond games, even though there's a couple of guilty pleasures in there, it's just such a bummer run. It's just a classic era of like, we've got the money bag, so we get to make the bad games. We get to force you to buy our bad games because we can't give it to anyone with any taste.
And it takes until Arkham Asylum for licensed games profiles to really change and for them to become as big a deal as they are now where they are, they're kind of at the center of games businesses again, licenses. So yeah, I would like to see it. I would like to sort of hem in the designers at Rare with having to make lots of slightly compromised feeling first-person shooters for me.
But yeah, this is a question I wanted to ask, because it's something I think about. There is a universe where they've got this license again. But yeah, it is what it is.
I am sad I didn't get to shoot Dr. Dirk again.
Who knows, he could have popped up before you meet Terry Hatcher in Tomorrow Never Dies.
He could be the guy you put into the big printing press.
Spot on, yeah. Okay, so did you ever revisit goldeneye after Perfect Dark was in your hands, Matthew? Or did it fall out of your rotation?
Was it just a straight swab, basically?
Yeah, they were like the very rare afternoon, like a year into Perfect Dark, where you're like, should we crack out goldeneye for old time's sake? And you're in there, and the suite of multiplayer options is so much more limited. And we were like, nope, we were instantly out.
Yeah, like even then, it already felt quite old. And I've talked before about the kind of dangers of going back to goldeneye. I know you enjoyed it a bit more than I did.
But yeah, I think we felt it even then that something had fundamentally changed in terms of ambition. You know, like most of goldeneye's multiplayer is in Perfect Dark.
Yeah.
Because they put like some good maps. Most of the weapons are duplicated. They've all got like goofy names, of course.
But you know, they knew what they were doing.
Yeah. And it is great to just revisit them because that's the thing. It's like almost us weird questions about, well, what counts as like owned by the broccoli family and what counts as sort of like, you know, owned by Rare where they're just like, we're just calling facility Felicity.
And it's exactly the same dimensions. But it's like, well, this is a location that Pierce Brosnan walked around. So it's kind of, I like it.
It's a bit of like late 90s, early noughties before too many lawyers got involved element to that. I like that. The other thing I want to talk about before we get into the game chat, Matthew, is one of the all time sort of fascinating scrapped features.
And this ties into the games magazines, hyping you up for this game thing we were talking about, where it was called Perfect Head. You could import photos from a Game Boy camera via the N64 transfer pack and apply them to heads for use on guards in missions in the combat simulator, i.e. the multiplayer of the game.
A pre-existing head model would be used as a basis for the new head, and then you could actually resize the whole thing based on a face texture from a photo. You could even change the brightness to get the face right and stuff like that. It was scrapped at some point in 1999.
It was speculated, I don't think this was confirmed. I didn't look into it that much, I'll be honest. Columbine is the reason they got rid of this.
Maybe it just seemed a bit controversial to have, you know, maybe let you scan little Timmy's head into the game and then just headshot it in with the laptop gun or whatever. Maybe that's not seen as like okay. What I'm just saying, like it's...
But there were still horrific shootings when you were allowed to input your face into like Tony Hawks or like some boxing game or whatever.
Yeah, but we became desensitized because we read these headlines literally fucking five times a week and then...
Yeah, but by that point, like the technology existed that it really would look like little Timmy, where on like on N64, it wouldn't have really, you know.
You say that, but you know, we'll talk about this. There's at least one face and there are some very recognizable. I think it's like it's quite eerily specific, like the some of the faces in this game.
Well, was that specific to the Xbox version, Matthew? That particular face?
That was specific to the Xbox version.
Well, that makes sense.
There is obviously the famous rumor about Tech Harrington, which we can get to.
Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, I always thought this, I agree that like the game doesn't lose much without this being there, but it's one of the all time great, like go Google it and look up some of the picture of like a nice looking person whose face is then like warped into this very cursed N64 model. Like it, there's some great low res screenshots of that out there for you to discover.
So yeah, always love reading about that. Even if it's, I agree, it's a bit preposterous.
The faces, I mean, there is something about like the fact that they put Rare staff's faces in the N64 game and there is a certain like, it's just indicative of what a game studio would have looked like in the late 90s. Like just lots of white dudes, basically. But also like just, it's hard to put your finger on and go like, oh, this is the face of a 90s white guy.
But there were like certain trends or certain like, haircuts or some, I don't know. There was stuff that gave them away of that era.
Oh yeah, it's the same in goldeneye as well. It's like, I know these are not based on guards in the film. There's something eerily specific.
You feel like the game is reaching out to you to tell you something about who they are with the faces and how they use the game. You know what I mean? Like that's a very specific DNA to these two games really.
It's quite a cool, unusual thing. So one of the many, many quirks of them.
It's like a time catchel of like, this is what guys look like in 1998.
Yeah, you know, that's like, that's important to preserve as well, isn't it? So yeah.
And you get to shoot them.
Yeah, exactly. All right, Matthew, let's take a quick break, then we'll come back with some more specific game chat.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, time to revisit this game. We've both been playing it all week, really, about a week and a half for me, because I got through the entire campaign, and we played a bunch of multiplayer together as well, which we'll discuss.
So, excited about that, Matthew. Can I give you my grand thesis on Perfect Dark before you tell me?
I saw you mention a grand thesis in the plan, and the second I saw it, I'm like, I cannot wait to hear this, because, yeah, hit me.
Oh, and I've set the bar too high, really.
Oh, okay.
Right, this feels like a game that's trapped between the era goldeneye comes from and the era that's coming, like the kind of, sort of like Half-Life, Half-Life 2 moved towards scripted campaign missions that end up defining sort of like modern first-person shooters, you know, like, you know, maybe like epitomized by like Call of Duty 4, for example, it's like a campaign everyone played where all the cinematic elements come together, and it's about forward momentum and all that kind of stuff. It's dabbling with that. It feels quite post-Half-Life-y, and how it dabbles with that.
And also how it uses a massive, a wider variety of mission types and settings than goldeneye does. But it is also bound to the arcane nature of some of goldeneye's objectives and old design thinking. So while it wants to do these kind of like quite elaborate scripted moments sometimes, or big set pieces, it's fucking obsessed with like fail states and you didn't quite understand how this thing works, so you fucked it kind of stuff.
And like, it wants to tell you a story and for you to participate in that story, but it also wants to rigidly be of computer game. It's like these two things fighting each other of the game designers want to turn you into the ultimate speed runner of this game by making you fuck it so many times that you have to repeat it ad nauseam until you can basically finish it like a speed runner would. But also it's trying to like move things forward in terms of evolving FPS design.
But in trying to do both, it fails at both at the same time. But I still really like it. That's my grand thesis.
What do you think?
Yeah, yeah, I like that. I mean, yeah, I noted down for this that to me, it felt very of its time in that it was built around how we played games back then in that we just played them a lot more and we had a bigger appetite or patience with this kind of design. Like it felt like chipping away at quite oblique objectives, which is absolutely fine when you're a teenager who only has like one game, you know, one game every six months, and you've got the time to put it in.
Or you have N64 magazine literally blowing open these levels. I mean, their review is basically a walkthrough for this game. And, you know, I think I said this to the DM, like I really felt like they passed a lot of the game for me.
So when they came to it, I'm like, Oh, of course I know this level, N64 told me about this. This is I've got to go and throw this camera here, and I've got to go and do this thing. Where actually, you're right, they just, there's an ambition to those ideas, but they don't yet have the like design language that is.
It's now like probably like the art of video games on a AAA space is, how do you get everyone from start to finish? How do you make this foolproof? And this is so far from that.
I mean, really, it's the one thing it does is if you go into a room, and there's a bit of voiceover between Joanne Dark and Daniel Carrington, the objective is somewhere in that room. Like you'll go in, she's like, oh, this looks like an engine. And you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
She just said something, there must be something we've got to do here. But outside of that, there's no indication. And so many of these objectives are, there's one gadget in your inventory, you have one copy of it, and you have to throw it at a thing.
And if you fucking miss that thing, and it lands on the wall next to the thing, well, you haven't got another one, so you fucked the level, and it's mission abort time. But it doesn't reset it for you, which at the time I loved because it was just like, oh, I'll just go on a rampage, like all beds are off now, I fucked the level, it doesn't really matter. But now I'm like, oh, I just wish there was a...
I wish it would just put me out of my misery. Like, it doesn't say like you fucked it. It just leaves it to your own devices.
Until you go into the options and then you're like, oh, I failed the mission somehow. What did I do?
If it notices you've been in the mission for like three minutes, without realising you fucked it, it'll be like, mission failed, please abort or whatever.
But there's like, you know, I failed because, yeah, I threw trackers onto like the wrong pillars, or I threw a tracker and just missed a pillar. There were three pillars. In that last level, you have to throw these trackers at these three pillars.
And one time I forgot to unequip the trackers, went to find my gun and just threw a tracker at the floor. And it was like, well, that was one of the trackers intended for the pillar. So you fucked it now, the aliens are never going to lose because you've just thrown a tracker on the floor in front of you.
That was annoying. Escort missions. Anyway, I don't want to get too much into nitpicky stuff because we're going to talk about that, but I'm in complete agreement.
You're constantly thinking, wow, this is ahead of its time. And wow, it can't really handle it.
Yeah, yeah, that's it. It's sort of, it is trying to do a lot. There's plenty I still like about it, though.
So I'm curious about which parts of this you think do hold up well, Matthew.
On a real basic bitch level, like fundamentally, the guns are good. The guns are good and they all have a secondary fire function. They're all kind of interesting and there's loads of them.
So there's like 40 guns and they do like two things each. So that's like 80 ways you have of like fucking with people. Now, some of those things are like a gun that can tell you if there's a mine in a room and you're like, I'm not really interested in that.
Or, you know, burst fire instead of single shot. But some of them are a bit more creative. Like you have the little tranquilizer and you can tranquilize people.
So they go like ditzy or you can just give them like a lethal injection, which obviously kills them outright. And this is the era where like the number of guns you had probably was like a selling point on the back of the box. You know, this was the like most games had like 10 guns because of the the numbers on the top of the keyboard.
It felt like that was what was limiting things. But here it's just like, there's fucking loads of guns and the more guns you unlock with cheats, these levels became wilder and wilder sandboxes of violence because you just bought more and more weapons that weren't designed to be in those levels into them. That was always rad as hell and that's still rad now.
And I think part of the reason the guns are so good, and again this is like quite a basic observation, so apologies, is I don't think many NPCs die better than Perfect Dark NPCs. Like the soundbites, the pre-canned animations here, it's not all like mad physics or anything. It's not like the Euphoria engine making people fall downstairs in interesting ways, but the variety of death animations, there's like a brief pause when you shoot someone.
It's almost like it's loading up the death animation. But in that pause, there is like, oh, that's the moment of death. Like you can see an NPC realizing they're dead, or that's what you project onto them as they then slump to the floor.
You can kill a guard while it's doing a long animation, like a roly-poly, and the bullets you put into it during the roly-poly kill it, but it has to finish the roly-poly because it's programmed to. So it finishes the roly-poly and then instantly dies, which is just daft, but it's so unique. Nothing else quite moves like that.
It reminds me of an observation Rich Stanton made on this podcast about how MGS2's guards all behave like they're in a light gun shooter. That's how they feel in this game as well.
Yes, there is a lot. Because it's built around the limitations of the controller. It doesn't ask a huge amount.
Auto-aim will do a lot of work for you. It's not built for the speed and the slickness that you can get with the dual-stick analog setup. And we'll get into playing this on the Xbox where we've both played it.
Because you've almost got an unfair advantage against this world. Because it's built for enemies who are kind of expecting you to be quite static, I think. So there's a lot of like they sort of hop out from behind cover or they sort of jump in and out of things.
There's a lot of, oh, you're going to be standing there and I'm going to get into your line of sight. It's almost pre-strafing as a concept. Definitely.
Which, very satisfying to let that auto and do lots of work for you. I love standing and just plugging people with the Falcon gun is a great feeling. I was surprised by how good the gun still felt actually.
Like so much of the pleasure I get out of this is just killing people in interesting situations. I'm probably more interested in the simple murdering in all these levels than I am like any specific objective probably. So that stuff still really works for me.
Yeah, I agree with that. I think that it underlines that this is maybe even the peak of novelty guns in first-person shooters. Like there's a lot of guns that are used well, but there is a modern games.
There's like a coherent approach to how they use. If you take like the guns in Doom or Doom Eternal, the approach is very much on like you mod them, but there's like a logic to how they're modded. So they become really cool and elaborate in these different ways.
But like, it's not as wild as the whichever machine gun it is that just its secondary fire function is it turns into a mine. That's so ridiculous.
Is that a dragon, I think?
Yeah, I can't think of a... Yeah, that's right. I can't think of a gun, like a modern game that really does that with guns.
Like it's just like where the secondary function will be so bizarre. It's just like, it's really inventive, but it asks you to just sort of go along with it. Like, isn't it cool that we did this kind of thing?
It's not really fretting about world building or logic or anything like that. It's just, hey, what if this gun shot through walls? What if this gun could also turn into a turret, but it's like laptop shape?
Like, I just like that conceit is just really cool. It's just like, it's just creative. It's just, it's kind of like it's got one eye on the multiplayer of like, what is the coolest thing we can give you a multiplayer that mixes things up?
Definitely. But like you say, you bring it to a campaign mission and it borderline breaks it. That's really cool too.
So I agree that that approach holds up quite well. I think the other thing that I like about this, and we'll get to this when we talk about some of the levels and how they compare to goldeneye is that there is very much like, it feels like to the best levels in this game, it felt like they started with a core idea and built the levels around them. In a way that I think goes way further than goldeneye does, it's like the Air Force One level is the number one example of this, but there are definitely others where it's like, well, this is the level where you have to go and find the president and get him off this plane.
That approach feels like them figuring out what the future of FPS design is going to be. It's not just going to be a series of monsters and dungeons and stuff like that. It's going to be narrative-y moments that you work up towards and give you a thrill from paying off that narrative moment and actually succeeding.
When you get to things like the TV station or the nuke going off in Call of Duty 4, it's like these are baby steps towards that. Yeah. Yeah.
That's why I really like that confidence they brought to it. Actually, when you watch the 1998 E3 teaser of this game, when they show off the day-to-dine complex that you're storming, the first level, it just feels like there's such a strong approach of like, there's no bond here to dictate what the levels are. So it's like, so the idea dictates what the level is in this really clear way.
They really feel like legitimate spaces and locations. They felt really real to me. Like my favourite levels in the games are the ones where they're kind of duplicating things that you have an idea of, like Air Force One or a holiday villa or just the offices.
I mean, it may sound boring to be like the day-to-dine offices, but, you know, I love that you go in and all the guards are sitting down in like sofas and then they jump up and then you have a little fight. It's just a load of people in offices and you don't know what's going to happen. Every office door you open, it could be a kind of quick draw shootout.
And there's also, you know, it's a trendy office, so there's always glass. So bullet holes are kind of peppering the walls and glass is shattering. And there are these glass lifts that look really cool to go up and down.
And that seemed quite exotic at the time. Yeah, if not like the narrative of the mission, definitely just where the mission is set. And, you know, the late game twist where the Carrington Institute, which has just been like the hub world suddenly becomes like a playable mission and you have to fight in it.
And you're like, wow, I thought this was just like a glorified menu. And now there's always, you know, terrorists here and hostages and this is exciting. You know, that's, yeah, by storytelling standards.
That is, that is hugely ambitious.
Yeah, exactly. That's very much in the kind of like Valve wheelhouse as well, right? Of like, you get to Half-Life 2 and the levels feel very much like we've got a really strong core idea that drives this whole thing.
And yeah, it's really cool seeing this game advance from goldeneye in that way. The other thing I was going to say that holds up well about this game is the kitchen sink approach to designing it. So just a sheer number of features.
Like when I came around to your house and we were just going through the menu and it was like, OK, you can do the level in co-op. You can do the level with all these difficulty settings and the parameters will change. You can do the level so one player is going through it and the other one is trying to kill them while playing as the guards.
Like it's like you say, it's from that era where your games just seem to go further. And it's like they understood people's very evergreen kind of relationship with goldeneye and then laid all this stuff in to sort of capitalize on that even more. So that feels so specifically like late 90s, early noughties in this way that I think is still really cool because that's like what ambition looks like I think in this era of games is just inventiveness, it spins on stuff that you've seen a million times, you know.
The conversation around that, those kind of extra features change so much. It felt like it became a bit more cynical in maybe like the era we were working in Mags because the tone of it changed to rather than extra value, people were like, oh people are just cramming in a multiplayer mode so you don't trade it in. That became like the big narrative was single player games were 10 hours, if there's nothing beyond those 10 hours that game's getting traded in and it's gonna cost you a sale and so all of a sudden Assassin's Creed is adding multiplayer modes and some are successful some aren't but it became, you know, people really sort of sneer at that era where actually whether these are just more like more innocent times but I really feel like there is just a desire to like show off, you know, there is just it's just a real flex from Rare to put all this stuff in it.
I mean, goldeneye was already this like huge rich game which held our attention for like three years. No, I imagine a game doing that, you know, a game which has no updates doing that now, you know, it's kind of impossible. But yeah, I love the just the showmanship of it, and no one was like questioning it.
It was just, you know, what a cool thing. What a, you know, like the, I don't know, like the production values weren't so obscene that wasn't like a high risk to remix all the parts like this. It was kind of creative.
Not all of them worked as well as the others. Not all of them made sense. You know, they weren't all completely polished, but to give it a go and you can see the ties that were closer to your kind of bedroom programmer days than what we've become now, which is these vast production lines where that room for, doesn't feel like there's much room for improvisation to the outsider anyway.
Yeah, sort of like what feel like someone in a weekend decided that this mode would be cool, so let's chuck it in kind of thing.
Yeah, and you're like, does it like, you know, the counter-op mode which we'll talk about in a moment, like there's some levels it's just not very good on because it like spawns you really far apart and it's kind of chaotic and you're like, if someone did that now, they're like where you'd have to play test this to within an inch of its life and make sure every iteration of this is as exciting as the next. And they're just like, well, like 50 percent of the time you'll have a good time. That's enough, you know?
Yeah, absolutely. It's left the player to figure out, much like the maps in goldeneye, like what are the levels where this will sing and what are the ones you're going to play over and over again?
Yes, exactly.
I agree. Yeah, that's a really good point. So which parts of the game hold up less well, Matthew?
I mean, again, you referenced it there earlier, but I think the trial and error and nature of some of the levels, I'd kind of forgotten about, but some of the levels are like a really bad hang in the way that you can easily fuck them up or the objectives are just very hard to identify, like work out what you're actually meant to be doing, you know, or it puts your fate in the hands of some horrible, like, AI escort stuff. Like, you know, problems of this era, I mean, they were just like manifold, like, everyone. If you put to play games in this time was to hate, like, confusing level design and bad AI, you know, it still has those problems.
Yeah, I'd kind of forgotten how much of that there was in this, weirdly. Kind of reminded me that when I played Perfect Dark and I used to play the single player, I didn't play the whole thing over and over again. I played a handful of levels, and they are the levels where there's not a lot of that stuff in them.
Like, I like the levels which are, here's just the space, it's full of enemies, you can probably stealthy way through it, but if the shit hits the fan, it's not game over. Where the levels where, you know, if you don't kill this guy in like three seconds, he's going to hit an alarm and you fail. I was like, I maybe play, like, there's some levels in this game I've played only twice and I have like very poor memory of them.
But there's other like, the Carrington Villa, you know, probably played that hundreds of times, because it was just a great sandbox with very little like judgment in it. You couldn't really fuck it up too badly outside of the initial, you know, once you'd saved the hostage negotiator, you were kind of off to the races.
Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, yeah, it's sort of like, I think in some ways like playing the XBLA version of this game allows you to bypass some of the more dated elements of it. But I do think the how pernickety is about just failing objectives, it does get on your nerves in some levels and like absolutely spoils experience if you're a 2024 player.
That's like one way in which it doesn't hold up very well. I think it's sort of like, I don't know if I'd hold much more against it though, necessarily, because that really is the thing. That really is the thing that I, you know, there were some levels I would finish in like 20 minutes of effort, and there are some levels that genuinely took me like three hours to finish.
Right.
And like, but the runtime of the level is like eight minutes. So just think how many times I'm fucking that up when that happens. And again, we make the point about games being polished with an inch of their lives these days.
I definitely agree with that as a strength of this game, that it is a bit more, we'll take a punt on this and that sort of thing. But it is just so, so picky about the very specific ways it wants you to behave in the game. And it can be a bummer, it can genuinely ruin entire levels when the objective is just so annoying, or there's just one enemy placement that's such a pain in the arse, or there's a minefield that won't always clear when you throw a grenade in there because of the very specific way...
That's it, yeah. Area 51 is a trilogy of ass. Like, all those levels are bad, in my opinion.
But like, trilogy of ass.
It's just wildly inconsistent. And I think that is the thing about this games campaign specifically. It is wildly inconsistent.
It just is.
Yeah, oh yeah. Like I say, I probably played five levels endlessly and the rest I didn't. I mean, I think I said to you at some point, I think you were about halfway through and were saying you're having a good time.
And I said, I thought the last third of the game was quite weak in how I remembered it. And when I played through it, I definitely think the last runner levels isn't really for me. I don't really like the last minute kind of flip into sort of Scythar assault ship and then the Scythar ruins.
Well, that assault ship is so shit. That's such a bad level.
Yeah, it's just some levels which just feel like 90s PC FPS ass. You're walking around looking at the same texture. You can't find the one bit of the level you can interact with while some quite basic music kind of goes hank, hank, hank, hank, hank in the background and you're like, why am I doing this?
This sucks. I'm having a really bad time.
Because you're recording an Excel episode, Matthew. That's why.
Yeah. That stuff is brutal. I just think the last run of levels, a few too many like just tunnel levels, where you're just in endless corridors.
Basically, from the whatever it is, the Pelagic to onwards. I barely remembered those levels because I played them so little back in the day, because I remember thinking they fucking sucked.
That's the funny thing actually is that the Carrington Institute really stands out because it's like the one really great level in that last run of levels.
Yes.
So it just comes out of nowhere and reminds you of why the first few levels were so good, because it's in the spirit of those levels in terms of tone. It's only got one alien in it, the rest is just fighting blokes. You got loads of allies around and it's like, this is reminding me of what I liked about this game until I got to about Air Force One onwards and just didn't quite click with it the same way.
Yeah, that's long been my memory of how the game flows and replaying it through. I was like, yeah, that memory is correct. Apart from the Carrington Institute.
All of the levels feel so small to me now. Playing through this game, it was like going back to an old infant school or an old home, or seeing a childhood bedroom when you're an adult. And you're like, this place seemed enormous to me once.
I remembered them being these sprawling facilities. And you're like, this thing's fucking two rooms. Or the Chicago being a corridor.
For years, I would have been like, oh, yeah, remember? They built a whole chunk of Chicago, the Chicago streets. And you're like, no, no, it really isn't.
It's one street, a drain, and a staircase. And that's about it, basically.
And a lift. Yeah, but that's just... I don't know if progress was just so slow in those levels that you never really got the full run of them.
And maybe that is something that's been unlocked a bit by the slightly easier controllers playing the Xbox version, is that that is an area where you're like, oh, actually, I can take this level at real speed now in terms of movement. I can move around it more easily than I could with just the one analog stick. And now I realize that this was just two rooms stuck together.
And the Carrington Institute is like that upstairs bit, like four offices and then, you know, mirrored underneath with the traffic garage. And like, takes like a minute to run to end to end of it. And I would have told you that was like as epic as like at two hours of Die Hard or something.
But it isn't. It's still cool. Like, I'm like, oh, this is cool.
But it's all a little bit quaint to me now. I must admit.
I think it's worth transitioning into the level chat here, Matthew, fully because it is the most interesting part of this game besides the weapons for sure. It's like I want to talk about how the levels compare pound for pound with goldeneye's, whether they're better or worse and what they do differently from each other. So it strikes me that some levels feel like they are takes on some of the same ideas in goldeneye, but like a remix of them or like we tried to do it better.
So, for example, a level that you messaged me about, the Air Force One crash site, feels like another run at surface to me. You know what I mean? Just doing a really sprawling, slightly spooky level.
I didn't mind Air Force One crash site as much as, I mean, after Area 51 and fucking trying to push that alien out of the gassy room about 80 times, because I was like fucking up that drug, getting that bloke to follow me across that bridge so many times and him getting killed by NPCs or mistiming the guard spawns and all this other dog shit, like objectives that I was messing up. Like that didn't seem quite as bad to me. But my feeling is that it's a better set of levels than Gold Knight overall, because like I say, I think there's a core conceit to some of them that really works.
There are some levels in Gold Knight that just feel like they kind of exist like the surface levels like Bunker 1, the first Bunker 1, at least the second one's got the prison break. It's not much of a level otherwise.
Yeah.
Like there's like a level design conceit at the heart of these that isn't just driven by Pierce Brosnan ran past this thing in a film. You know what I mean? So that intent drives some better level design.
I fucking love Carrington Villa. I think that to experience that first time in 2024 is still magic. I still loved it.
I thought it was amazing. I was like, it's a level I tweeted about. I was like, this is really fucking good, man.
There's some great levels in this game. Yeah, maybe later on it curdles a little bit. But what do you think?
How do you think they compare pound for pound?
Yeah, I think you're definitely right. Like they don't have, the conceit of every goldeneye level is, it's probably a thing you remember from the film. And what you're excited about in Facility is getting to throw the remote mines of those big gas containers because that's sort of what James Bond did.
And that feels exciting. And you get to meet up with Sean Bean and that's exciting. Yeah, this doesn't have that.
So they just have to kind of exist as spaces. I think a lot of it, like I said before, is the thrill of being in what felt like at the time amazing recreations of real life things, like offices or the villa. I quite like the level, even though it is a bit trial and error and it's got a lot of bullshit, I quite like the one where you break in to Air Force One by dressing up as the hostess and then you can kind of walk around that level and everyone's like, hello.
And you're like, oh, this is exciting. No one knows that I'm a spy. It's a bit like a Hitman level.
I really liked Air Force One. Air Force One to me was always, like, that's a level I played so much back in the day. And even playing it now, that was one where I was like, this is tiny.
I can't believe I spent so much time playing this level. But the thrill of like, oh my God, I'm on an airplane, like Air Force One with Harrison Ford. And I'm shooting these guys in big white coats and I've got all these guns.
And it's a small enough level that I can just master it by doing it over and over again. And I can, I can take kind of complete control of this space. That was always the thrill back then.
And I kind of still tap into that now. But yeah, for me, it's pretty like weirdly still between like Air Force One just because of the nostalgia hit, but you know, and Carrington Villa. It just felt like it's a huge open level and it's all there.
You know, there's like no fakery. It's the guards you can see at the start. You'll find their guns when you get to the mansion later.
You know, it isn't a very clever smokes and mirrors Call of Duty set piece. It's like a legit space. And if you play it in the counter-operative mode and you can just see that like all the guards are just there waiting for you.
And I know that's just how games worked back then and it feels quite old fashioned. But where things are, you know, things now just feel like such a trickery in making these hugely ambitious levels work, that the thrill of it's you and 30 guards in this space, they're all waiting for you. You can kill them kind of however you want.
You know, good luck. I think that's still that's still kind of magic and there's nothing caught. You know, goldeneye had a similar, like, you know, all those guards are waiting to be killed, but there's something about the layout and, you know, the multi, you know, there are a couple of, like, open approaches to that villa.
It just felt very sandboxing, very ahead of its time, like sniping, you know, there was a bit of sniping and then you're shooting in the basement. It just mixes up. It's great.
It's a really good level.
For sure. Yeah, it's I think that it has probably the same number of, like, levels that really stick in your head as goldeneye does. But I think that the appeal of those levels is a bit more tied to their origins in the film.
Like, Facility is a great play, partly because, you know, like the objectives are good, like blowing up the sort of gas canisters and stuff with the mines. But also you meet Sean Bean and Orimov in it, you know what I mean? Like, there's a bit more appeal tied up in the Bond thing itself.
Whereas, because Perfect Dark doesn't have that, the ingenuity of like how, yeah, like you say, like the Carrington Villa allows you to sort of like play with it a little bit, in a little bit of a sandbox-y way. It just seems a little bit like it matters more, you know? I was curious how you think the difficulty compares to goldeneye, Matthew?
Because playing it, I couldn't work out if the levels were being a bit more like, it felt harsher playing Perfect Dark now than goldeneye. But I can't tell if I'm just so used to how all of goldeneye's different objectives were that I was like, I was like brushing up against failure states less. But it just felt like I was fucking up more here.
What do you think?
But I think you fail the poorly explained objectives rather than you die to gunfire, you know? Actually surviving is okay. And I think easier now, like with dual analog sticks and just a lifetime of first person shooting on a pad has just made us much, much easier to survive.
And the enemies are all kind of quite slow. And yeah, I didn't find it too difficult. I mean, I must admit, like the second half of the game, I kind of blasted through on Agent.
Right.
Because I was just like, I just want to get to the end of this. And I actually think it's quite fun because of the stacking objectives. It is quite fun to start on Agent, get like the base understanding of the level and then knock it up and then do it again, a bit harder with a bit more and then do it again, even harder with a bit more.
It's almost like how you learn a Hitman level starting with an opportunity. And then you get to kind of get the basic sort of layer of the land. And then you can start riffing on it in the future.
And, you know, there's almost a bit of proto Hitman in Perfect Dark, in some of its, some of its like spy craft, I guess. But yeah, generally fine. Like the things where I failed the most and the things which frustrate me the most.
And the reason I fucking hate the Air Force One crash site is the AI doing mad, mad bullshit, like running in front of you. So people haven't played it. You go on Air Force One, you save the president, and then you crash land in this sort of snowy mountain area, which is quite like surface from goldeneye, except it's got really confusing, labyrinthine paths around the mountain.
So it's like very, very confusing to navigate, not very fun on that level. But also you have to find this fake president and kill him and save a real president. Yeah, that's actually not too difficult.
You've got a gadget which literally points you to them. But the real president, if you save him too early, he's with you for the level. He's not really got anything to do.
Once you've completed all the other objectives, it's like get the president to the extraction point. But up until then, he's just tagging along and running circles around you. There's a horrible bit where you're in this dark cave and you have to do it with infrared or night vision.
Everyone just turns into a white blob, including the president who likes to run in front of you. I killed him several times. I got so cross with it.
My patience now is just... My patience for that kind of bullshit is like zero, you know? Back then, I would have just been like, Oh, that's fine.
I'm just going to play this game over and over again until I do it. That's what you did with games. But now I was like, if it wasn't for this XL, I almost temper tantrumed out of it and like, I'm just going to call it a day there, you know?
Oh, the same brother. That definitely almost happened. It wasn't that mission necessarily.
It was like the last two Area 51 ones where I was like, Oh man, I'm just really having not a good time doing this. I don't understand why this fucking guard behind the door went and let me in. I was like, Oh yeah, because I forgot to activate the disguise from the fucking menu and all this shit.
The funny thing about the Crash Site one, the reason I don't hate that level is that it is the only level that feels like it's got a load of real estate to it in terms of like actual space.
But it uses it in such an obnoxious way. It uses it to go, you're lost and you don't know where you're going. And well, like there's no logic to how these caves connect.
Well, there's a couple of things to that. So first of all, another interesting quirk of this game is that sometimes you'll do something at a previous level that will affect the next level. So the Chicago is an example of this.
You like set a bomb, you can drop a remote mine outside one of two doors, basically, and then blow them up in the next level if you want to use that as an escape route. And the game will correspond to that. It's quite a nice touch.
And the crash site level, you can drop in the Air Force One level before that. You can lower like a hover bike to basically use that in the level. Therefore, when you're zooming around, it takes up less time to get from one side to another.
That's quite a nice idea, I think. And again, so you don't really see another first-person shooter. It's like one of the ideas Perfect Dark has.
It doesn't really go anywhere in any other games, you know? But I do also like the silhouette of the downed airplane and stuff. The fact you're in the snow, there's a spooky kind of like, almost slightly the thing style to it.
And the fact there's a presidential clone is a bit weird.
Yes, but I think that's a concept that someone could do a really good version of that, where there's a huge amount of tension between, they actually blow that. You know, your objective is like, identify the fake and kill them. And it's like, the real one is just being held hostage, and you're like, well, it's not that one, then is it?
It's the other one running around. You shoot that, and often you don't even know that's what you're doing. You're just shooting an enemy in the distance, and then it's like, objective complete.
And I just don't think there's much drama in it. That level really bummed me out. I quite like surface in goldeneye.
Because it's so quiet. You're like, you're stealthing your way through and picking people off where this level, I found it was more about navigation and the mountain, the graphics on the mountain parts, there's these sort of polygonal shards jutting out of this hillside. And it just looks quite ugly, that level, I think.
The N64 fog did a lot for it.
Yeah, I imagine that was a big factor actually. But the thing I was going to say about it is that you are right, that if you get the present too early, it's like you fucked it basically. It's a huge burden.
It's just like you've optionally taken on an Natalia basically, to like fuck up your run. But that's one of the ways in which the game is dated for sure. The game is sometimes about figuring out the exact order in which you're supposed to do things.
And that level, there's a clear logic to it. Once you've played it enough times, you understand, they want you to go and get, go to his escape pod and activate the distress beacon or whatever. Then they want you to go and get the medical thing that tells you which of the two presidents it is that you're trying to get.
And then they want you to go and kill the fake president who, when you've played it enough times, you understand is in like a lower cave, you can reach from above and just shoot down and get him. And the real ones with fucking Mr. blonde or whatever he's called, whatever that guy is called, the dude who likes the president is not Mr. blonde, it's the other guy. And so basically, the level is about figuring out where the beacons would be that tell you to go to the objectives would be in a modern FPS game but aren't there.
So the challenge is about understanding what it is you're even playing. And so that's a way in which it's definitely dated. And I would agree it's not a strong level.
I just didn't think it was quite near the bottom of the pile.
Yeah, it just got me. I was making quite quick progress and I got really cross at that one. I got Catherine to do it in the end for me because I was in such a strop.
A level I hated but then played it enough time, for enough time that I think I developed like a Stockholm Syndrome thing with it, was the first Area 51 level where you got to destroy all the... You think you saw me play this at yours, actually. That you got to destroy a load of turrets and then you got to basically go.
There's like a robot thing, you got a hovering thing, you got to blow up at a certain point with a rocket launcher, and the rocket launcher is surrounded by mines. Then eventually you got to go underground in this lift thing and then there's loads of guards who take shots at you and stuff. There's nothing that's fundamentally unfair about the level.
The turrets are very annoying, they're annoying to deal with. It's the fact that the grenades in this game and how they work are so shit, that they'll just instantly kill you because there's no grenade marker on the UI to be like, it was a fucking grenade, like they will be in Call of Duty basically. It's just like, fuck you, the grenade went off, you're dead, start the level again.
That's one of the worst things that happens in this game generally, is you not understanding if someone's thrown a grenade at you because it's just too early for them to figure out how to do that. So the game just fucks you over and you're like, I can't believe that happened again. That happens loads in that first Area 51 level.
Then I would say consistently throughout the game, it's kind of a bummer.
What about the fact that the game's final boss is the concept of manual aiming?
Yeah, exactly. Shoot an alien thing, and then having to blow up a load of these crystal things behind it.
It's like the only thing the gun doesn't auto-aim lock onto in the whole game is this statue, so you have to use the manual aim.
How was that on N64? How did you find doing that level on N64?
For a long time, I couldn't do that level. I think I had to pay my friend, Mark Looson, to do it for me, because he wouldn't do it for me. I think I had to give him like a couple of quid, and he'd complete it for me.
I'd give him the card, and he'd complete it and give it back to me, because I just could not do that last bit to shoot these five prongs on this statue. Shooting manual aiming at speed is just not what that game is about.
Yeah, it's true. It's just not something it really accounts for. I suppose that's probably a good time to talk about the XBLA port a little bit, because I don't think I realized some of this, because I will confess that with that last mission, which is not very good at all, and again, I failed a bunch of times, because the aliens in the...
It's like basically a load of valleys with aliens. It feels like a different game, basically, completely. Just like someone made a...
It's like a Turok level or something. It's just full of dinosaur-ish things.
Full of fucking trigens or whatever they are.
Yeah, there's no humans there. It's just a bunch of dinosaurs, and then a bunch of these weird pillars that Matthew was discussing earlier, that you have to attach little signals to, and then a final boss with a... Once you understand it, an alien that's not that bad to kill, but it's definitely not fun.
And I ended up looking up a bunch of walkthroughs for this. I didn't quite realize the graphical gulf between this XBLA version that was made in 2010, I think, by 4J Studios, which I think is actually like holds up really well. It looks really nice, apart from flickering lights that do your head in, I would say.
But then you look at the original and you realize there's a huge gulf in sort of visual detail. Do you think it is masking a lot of the ways the original game is dated, Matthew, this version?
Yeah, I mean, I did go into the Switch version. Obviously, I don't have the N64 pad, so maybe that's on me. But I really struggled with the bad Switch controls, which just like the way they've mapped N64 to dual analog sticks, and one of the analog sticks is actually the D-pad.
It's crazy. And like, by Nintendo's bad standards with curating their older games, like particularly bad. But this version, like, it's just so slick and fast moving.
And I know I said it earlier, but you really can, like, you can just run circles around enemies in a way that you simply couldn't on the N64. I just don't think the pad was made for it to give you that freedom of movement. And it's, you know, that original game was a lot more about, like, peeking your head out from around the doorframes and then sniping people out.
And the new version, the, the Xbox version, it maintains some of the odd decisions. So, like, when you do the zoom in aim on the left trigger, which, you know, iron sights, I guess, it's not really iron sights. It kind of zooms you in on the screen you're currently looking at, and then you aim your cursor around that screen.
So you're sort of shooting within a box. The gun doesn't move the aim, as it were. It's kind of locked in place, and, like, that's probably, like, would have been a change too far.
Like, you would have been too powerful if you could have just had traditional iron sights in this game. So it had to make you use this slightly jittery cursor, which can oversteer a lot, and trying to kind of get it onto a headshot, you know, headshots are, like, instant kill in this game, and they obviously don't want it to feel like a kind of twitch shooter, I guess. But that one, like, oddity aside, like, it's just really easy to play, and it moves really fast as well.
Like, the animation, like, the way the bodies fall, and just the speed of it, like, having it, like, 60 frames is just a real treat, and you forget that it was, like, 15 or 20 or something on the N64. Like, really slow moving, and kind of grim-looking, but absolutely fine in the time. I think if you play it now, it has to be the Xbox version, surely.
It does. The level I was watching was the What's It? defence at the end, and I couldn't believe how slow it seemed, because I did think I would genuinely struggle if it was moving that slowly to actually finish it.
So I played the entire game on Secret Agent, basically, because I wanted to get the full sweep of objectives. The only level I gave a try on Perfect Agent was Carrington Villa, because I heard that you start as in negotiator position and have to fight your way from the pier, which you do, and it was really cool. It's specific to this difficulty.
A, that's really cool, the idea of changing things up based on which difficulty set you changed up, you picked, I mean, another way in which the game's got loads of value, of course. I didn't, the idea your hardest difficulty starts you somewhere else is really cool. No FPS would really do that now.
There's no real reason to, but that sort of stuff is really cool. But I will admit that I would have struggled to finish on that mode if I didn't have the XBLA controls, because it feels like the game's meeting you halfway other controls and you're playing at the Xbox version. I think you can forgive its other foibles a little bit more.
When it is kicking your ass or failing your objectives because the game has decided that the antenna that you're throwing a little tracker on isn't actually a hard object so it passes through it and you didn't technically connect to it. So better start the mission again, go fuck yourself. Area 51 stuff.
You can forgive that a little bit more because you understand you have this combat advantage and these enemies were never meant to be strafed around in this way. Like they can't quite understand or the fact that when you turn a corner you're just like you've kind of shot them straight away already. But yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's like really unfair. It's like world that's waiting for a kind of 1999 heroine to step into it and instead it's got this like fucking brute from the future that can just move like nobody else.
The guards, they just don't have a clue what's going on half the time. No. And it has that thing where you have to beat the levels in a certain time to unlock the cheats and they are like, I was unlocking some of those without really even trying, almost by accident, it's just how much faster it was to play the game.
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, that is quite funny. So I was curious, this is just briefly Matthew, the alien stuff in this game does feel like such an obvious misfire.
It's not interesting. The enemies are not interesting. In the ads, I don't like Elvis as previously discussed.
Elvis feels like such a British game designers in a barn came up with this ass conceit. And so, which I think is like novel about it. Like no Americans would ever come up with Elvis.
You know what I mean? Like, he's just so damn British as a creation.
So the thing that really made me laugh when I was playing this, Catherine was watching and I was talking to her about how much I hated Elvis. And she was like, I won't say who to save him the embarrassment, but one of her brothers was like big into Elvis. Like thought it was the best thing and would like do impressions of it and like named all their like first email addresses after it, like all their logins and usernames.
Oh my god.
Because they were like all in on this thing. So like Rare obviously tapped into like one person's mind.
Elvis was like his Randy Newman, Matthew, you know, that was very-
Well, it was, yeah.
Or his Northern Exposure, you know, just went all in, too many chips on the board. That is funny. I also like the idea of like, I'm going to protect the identity of this person by only narrowing it down to one family of siblings.
I love that. I don't want to name which sibling.
No, yeah, I think I could guess which one. I will ask you after this and confirm. Okay, so I think let's talk about, so what I want to ask off the back of that was, did the alien stuff seem duff in the moment?
Or were you like, oh wow, it's mind expanding? Or did playing at the time, it seemed like a left turn the game didn't really need?
Playing it now made me realize maybe how little I actually ever understood the story of Perfect Dark.
Yeah.
Because I played it over such a long amount of time, it took me so long to get through levels, that I think I just lost track of what I was doing. By the time you've mastered a level, it's become quite an abstract thing that you don't really know. Oh, what was I actually doing?
I was trying to get some files to help someone. I sort of know who the bad guys are. This time, playing it in quite quick succession, I was like, oh, okay, you know, these people are...
There's a shady organization, they're trying to get rid of the president. You save the president, it turns out there's a bigger alien threat. You save this other alien to tackle that alien threat, and then you go to that home planet and destroy them, and that's the end of it.
And yeah, I just... But I wouldn't have been able to tell you that until I played it again recently, you know? I knew there was a lady, like, in a powerful blue suit in the first level, who you weren't allowed to kill, and then she turns up later and sacrifices herself but that's basically it.
It is quite bad. I just think, you know, we've really dunked on Elvis on this, but like, the Elvis of it all makes it very puzzling to me because it's not cool without him, but it's way more coherent that it's, like, the power plays between all these shady organizations and, like, men in strange suits. There's a weird bit where there's this, like, massive Scandinavian guy in a white coat.
Yeah, and he turns into an alien.
Yes, he is the Skeeter. Yeah, the Skeeter are posing as these, like, giant white men who look a bit like, sort of, Johnny Bravo. It's just, like, killing an army of Johnny Bravos in, like, amazing white coats.
You know, white coats, lab coats, white coats, anything white in Rare Shooters is just an invitation to, like, paint it red, which is always fun. Good blood and violence in this game.
Yeah.
Yeah. Like, NAF. I mean, I guess it's interesting in terms of, like, what the wider Perfect Dark universe is about.
And, like, Perfect Dark Zero and, like, the new game they're working on, you know, I don't feel like they owe any kind of debt to the story of this. I don't think they have to, like, honour any of the details that are in this game. I just don't think that's really what people care about.
No. No, the funny thing is, as well, like, this is so... I think this game, the alien thing, speaks to the fact that this game is, like, a bit campy in quite a British way.
So it feels like the alien stuff. I can see why maybe some game designers who grew up watching, like, Doctor Who or Blake 7 would be like... You know, would put something like that in there.
I just just... I think, as well, like, Joanna Dark has, like, the whiff of a kind of, like, Emma Peel, a Vengezie kind of character. A bit like, you know, the whole kind of Kate Archer thing where no one lives forever.
She's not, like, outright parody like Kate Archer, though.
She's not, but the voice and the... There's just something about her attitude that's a little bit, like... I guess, like, they are making a James Bond archetype, so it makes sense to sort of draw from similar...
Yeah, it's an arched eyebrow, for sure.
It is, and there's just... Sometimes it's just, like, really, really goofy stuff in it, out of nowhere. And it's an interesting contrast to, like, when you first play the game, I think it does feel very legit and a little bit more...
Because, like, the first thing you see in the game is, like, the Datadyne building and the amazing skyline that surrounds it, which feels like...
It's like blade Runner.
Yeah, exactly. It feels like... Did more art resource go into that one skybox than any other area of any N64 game?
Because it's so... It's, like, such a treat for the eyes. It's, like, it's something that goldeneye never really does.
It's, like, an amazing detailed setting that surrounds you. It just suddenly feels like this vast... The scale is set.
It's, like, the first impression of the game is, like, look at the scale of this thing we've built, and it's a really beautiful thing. And, like, it's a bit, like, it's quite dramatic. You're going to go into this building.
You're finding this woman. You knock her out, take her car. It just...
It feels... It feels quite serious. And then the campy layers are kind of peeled back as the game goes.
And then every... Like, the hackers in CyberThemeJigBase, like, he's got a really goofy voice.
Hey there, Joanna.
He's kind of like... He speaks like that. You've got the guy who...
I would say, like, maybe this has dated a little bit. Very campy air host that you meet, who identifies you as, like, not a real air hostess before you get on Air Force One. He goes, you shouldn't be here, girl, when he spots you.
That thing... Every now and then, like that, it just... It's almost like the mask slips of, like, quite serious sci-fi thing to quite silly sci-fi thing.
And then by the time you get to the alien stuff, it's like, oh, this is like full on sort of like goofy 70s Doctor Who kind of stuff.
Well, it's the fact that Elvis's UFO is like the most bang it out in five minutes comedy UFO design you've ever seen. Like a proper flying saucer.
Yeah.
And they go there and they have a little comedy argument about how they can't all fit in it. And you're like, oh, really?
Yeah, that's it. That is all of that's really silly. And then at the same time, it's like there's two endings to that mission, which is really cool.
And it's like, just I think of quite sophisticated game design for its time being next to this really goofy tone or stuff. It's just an odd and interesting universe this game is set in. So yeah.
But I did want to switch focus, Matthew, to the multiplayer. I think we should get into this because you and I, and Catherine, we all played a bunch of multiplayer last Saturday night before we recorded this. We thought that's something you can do with this game that you can't really do with most of the games we're going to select in this primarily single player stuff we talk about in these podcasts makes sense to our for our sensibilities.
But do you think the multiplayer holds up well, considering how local FPS multiplayer has fell out of fashion in recent years?
Yeah. And as much as we can tell from our few hours with it, like it works, it works well enough. You know, you fall into the old rhythms of like shit talking.
It's satisfying when you feel like you've, you know, pulled off a particularly slick move and it's annoying when someone else dicks you over. It's hard to say without giving it like a hundred hours to see if the same obsession is set in. Because so much of it is just the extreme familiarity and like, particularly with a game with a multiplayer suite this big, you know, part of the appeal definitely for us back in the day was really kind of honing in on what we liked about it and then that becoming our multiplayer experience.
Because there's so many modes and maps and potential weapon combinations. And we really got into like, you know, we play on like these three maps and we have these custom weapon sets. You know, we've really, you know, we like particular styles of things.
We aren't just like, oh, let's just pick a lot of random maps and random weapons and see what happens. You know, we really found the very tailored experience. And that to me is like where the real magic lies.
But in terms of like the pick up and play of it, yeah, we had a good time. I probably enjoyed the stuff with The Sims more just because those maps are a little empty with just like three people in them. Yeah, that's true.
But with The Sims, you suddenly have like this, you know, there's just encounters everywhere and there's like rockets flying about and you can hear people fighting in other parts of the map. And maybe that is an indication that it's harder to go back to like just four people after the era of like, you know, 16 players online or whatever, that you just expect there to be more life in the maps.
Yeah. When we played, we just started, we basically did the three players, me, you, Catherine, I think it was like handguns, we did. And it was really apparent that I just played like 12 hours of this game kind of non-stop basically, because I just like destroyed you and Catherine like immediately basically.
I was just too used to it. I just came out of corner, completely fucking wiped you out. And then from there, we kind of like, as the Sims entered it and as we, the Silio weapons joined in, it was a bit less predictable who would be number one.
We had like, I think we all won at least one game. And yeah, the Sims thing just turns it into this like, big comedy extravaganza in a way that like, I don't think goldeneye ever quite was that. And that's where I think this is quite specific to this game, is having the silly meat Sims in there and the absolute carnage that can ensue.
It's like it almost dials up the comedy moments you did get in goldeneye. Does that make sense?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. There's something to be said for like, having very competent AI and you know, even if you just have like the normal Sims, they're pretty on top of their shit, just because they know where all the weapons are and are like really quick to grab them and they can just absolutely monster you. But there is so much fun in like mulching your way through meat Sims and also just flooding a level with like idiots who can pick up guns and just like throw grenades and stuff like they're going to get you just in the chaos.
Like odds are the crossfire, there's going to be some collateral damage because of these clowns. Yeah, there's that level. I can't remember if it's called like base or grid, but it's the one with the elevator and it's got the glass.
And we played that a few times with the Sims. And, you know, back in the day, me and my brother would play that and just get in that lift and go up and down in the lift. Oh, doors had opened.
And then we just shoot the sea of Sims that had gathered there because they all knew supernaturally we were in the lift. And just playing like how long can we last against this sort of like, you know, butch and Sundance siege scenario where the doors open and then just all the bullets come in. We spill out and see what happens.
And that stuff, like we didn't do that exact thing when we played, but, you know, instantly took me back to just how those things look and behave and move. And that's still there. And that it runs so smoothly on Xbox as well, just made it like, oh, this still feels like a viable thing to play.
Oh, yeah. Because when you turned it up with all the sims on in N64, I remember it being like, blurry ass, basically, just sort of like, just, yeah, just a blur of a screen, just a smear, basically, of like yellow and red running around. So, yeah, I really like that.
That level as well, that's got the kind of like, it's a bit sandy and there's like the courtyard and there's like a kind of villa and stuff.
Like, yeah, it's like the map, which is a riff on Carrington Villa, right?
Yeah, yeah, basically, that was great.
Is it ruins or something maybe?
Something like that. That was great fun with The Sims as well, because there would just be, I mean, just so much carnage of like rockets coming around the corner and there's like quite vast areas and quite small areas. There was a bit, I don't think I heard you happier this year than when I went to pick up your dragon and it was now a mine that blew up.
I killed me. That's the happiest I've heard you, for sure. It was really enjoyable.
It sort of made me think I should come around to yours and we should play multiplayer more because it was a good time. There's just so few games like this. Even at its best, I don't think that Halo in local multiplayer was ever like this good unless you had like a LAN party.
That was such a fucking elaborate thing to set up. The Sims thing is just such a generous multiplayer option. It gives it such a long, long tail even now.
Because I just don't really know where I'd go to find this kind of thing.
Yeah. The thing we didn't really get into is that it has a character progression system. You create a multiplayer profile and save them, and it has ranks.
You don't get anything for unlocking them, or at least I don't remember you getting anything. Kind of a Call of Duty multiplayer profile years before, that was a thing. You'd level up from level 20 or Hopeless or whatever, or Meet Sim level, and all the way up to Perfect Dark or Perfect Agent or whatever the number one was.
But it was all based on stats, so matches played, victories. I think also the medals that you get at the end of matches, like most Ruthless or most headshots or whatever, factor into it as well. That just gave it a bit of like...
Continuity?
Yeah, continuity, I guess is the thing. A sense of progression. We all had our characters saved on memory cards, so we take them to these houses.
So all the games we played over those two years were just feeding these character profiles, and that really felt like ahead of the game, and just an idea of where multiplayer shooters would eventually go. Like the idea that your online career belonged to you in some way was really cool. But that aside, it is just great maps, great weapons.
It was a bummer that I hadn't unlocked more of the creative weapons. You have to play quite a lot of the games to unlock cheats, and do challenges to unlock all the weapons in multiplayer.
They should have turned that off in the Xpele version. They should have just let you play them from the start.
Yeah, who cares if they just give you all that stuff for free? I want to be using Farsights and the tranquilizer, and the lethal injection, and the crossbow, and all the kind of weirder guns and weapons. That stuff is really what I played in Perfect Dark way back when.
But it was still fun. Like, the gun which, when you drop it, becomes a mine but looks like a gun that someone can pick up. The art of placing that so it looks like it could be a legitimate gun pick up.
That's why I was laughing so much, because it was just like, well, there obviously shouldn't be a gun here. Or putting it in a place that you know people have to go through, like a very thin tunnel. Oh, God.
Like, just shithouse-ery, you know?
Yeah, exactly. There's no game. The games just aren't built for that in the same way now.
It's all about fucking balance and skins and all that stuff. Like, it's just- Balance is just kidding.
You know what I mean? Like, it's all just quite joyless and driven by, oh, these people on Twitter fucking complain that this shotgun in Apex Legends is too powerful. Like, that's such a joyless way to design computer games.
Like, yes, it's what you need to do to feed the machine of like a live service thing. But this game is all preoccupied on like, what is fun? What is going to generate joy and frustration and like primal emotions in this very specific way?
And it's just like, it's just such a lost art, you know?
That match we played in Facility, which was just, I think it was just timed mines and throwing knives. And you just, like the time lines, because obviously the gap between throwing them are things like three or four seconds, which is enough for someone to actually leg it quite far. But like, just two people chucking mines at each other, and then the whole room just erupts in flames.
And you've got someone who's desperately trying to kind of stab someone, or they've got a poison knife in them that's slowly leeching their health, while the other person's trying to kind of kill them with time mines. And it's just the toys in that game are so much fun.
And the hitboxes are so fucking weird that you're swiping knives, you're dual wielding knives, you're swiping furiously and missing people constantly. And then there's this beautiful series of explosions that go off at the same time and all three of us die. And it's like the Michael fassbender perfection gift, basically.
It's just, yeah, so, so good. I thought the multiplayer side of it held up really, really well. It was fun to play a bit of co-op as well in the main game.
That was, I would have found that so exciting to be able to play this whole campaign in co-op at the time. Like, I feel like I really missed out there because I just really loved that about every Halo campaign. I still do.
Counter-operative mode is worth discussing there, Matthew. I think that's pretty special. As explained this, if you don't know what this is, it is a mode where one player tries to complete a single-player mission from the campaign quite normally, and the other player takes on the role of different NPC guards within the mission to try and stop the player.
So basically, it's like a heightened skill level to all the NPCs you're fighting because one of them might be like your mate. It's so good. It's like a more primitive version of Deathloop or Gambit and Destiny where someone might invade your game.
What's another good example of this, Matthew?
Yeah, I guess like a Souls invasion mode or something.
Yeah.
It's the idea that you're going about the already natural challenge of a level and there is just a human AI who also knows how the level works and what you're trying to achieve.
Yeah. And it's so, so fun and funny and silly. And like you say, unbalanced and the game is like only really partially built to support it.
Oh my God. It was so much fun. Like I managed to stop Matthew.
No, I managed to finish a level while Matthew tried to stop me. It was the only Carrington Villa on like agents. It wasn't that hard.
You don't even have to kill the snipers in that level, which is like kind of the main challenge of it really. And so I managed to do it. But the frustration for Matthew that once I'd like killed all the guards in the mansion, that the only way he could respond was basically the game kept placing him at the start of the level and he had to jog back towards me.
As I got deeper and deeper into the caverns of this mansion. And your escalating frustration of that was chef kiss. It was beautiful.
Do you want to explain how that whole thing went?
Well, it's because obviously part of it is because it's a split screen. I can see how close you are to the end of the level. And I'm aware of how long it takes me to get from the start of the level to get to you there.
And also, it's such a long journey to take. Even playing it normally, wherever it spawns you, you're probably going to be reasonably far away from where the person is because it never spawns you right next to them. And it's so much effort to get to them.
And the guards have way less health than Jynadark. They can still only take the single shot or two shots that the guards commonly can in the game, while Jynadark can take 10 or 15 or whatever. So the whole game of it is basically chipping away and trying to make their life a bit more difficult.
And you're like, maybe over several lives, I'll accumulate enough damage that this level will become quite difficult for them.
Yeah.
And there comes a point where you're like, I haven't done enough damage and I haven't got enough, like there just aren't enough guards in this level left to do any damage.
Oh, so thrilling though.
It is. And it's like, you know, there are particular choke points where you're like, well, I know she's got to come through here. Or like where it gets a little bit more next level and why Carrington Manor Villa is so good for it is you know that there's a bit they're going to have to snipe the rooftop snipers out and they're going to have to look down that fucking fiddly ass scope.
And it means they're going to be standing still somewhere in the level, probably for a few seconds every time. If you can coordinate and get there when they're doing that, that's the kind of next level thinking. You're like, that's the time I can actually kill them because they're going to be, their mind's going to be somewhere else.
There are bits in this level where they're going to have to pay attention. And you know, that to me feels like the beginnings of something. I'd love it if there was more ways to sabotage.
In one level, I thought, because you just kept winning, I ran down to a computer that I knew you're going to have to activate in the Carrington Villa and I was just trying to shoot it, see if I could blow up, to see if I could fail the mission before you got there. And it doesn't allow for that, it protects you. But I figure if someone was to take another swing at this, I'd love to see a version where, I don't know, just more opportunities or just maybe a little bit more kind of creative power in the enemy's hands, rather than just being like some mook who dies instantly.
Yeah, I do think, yeah, we talked about it when we were playing as well, the idea of taking on the role of one of those snipers and suddenly being like a massive threat to you.
Yes.
That could have worked really well. But yeah, there's so many games that I was thinking, it's kind of a shame this was a bit of a dead end for this idea. No one ever did this in Halo, where they were like, you get to be a grunt in Halo 3, and you got to try and fucking run over Master Chief with like one of those little purple bike things.
You know what I mean? But that would have been great. That would have been really good, because that's how I played the game with my friend Andrew anyway, is I clubbed him on the back of the head with a pistol or whatever.
I really like that about it. And I did think if you and I ever streamed that mode, would be a great thing to just stream, to just try that in a variety of these levels and see. I mean, it was when me and Catherine were playing it, and she had to stop me basically.
It ended with her spawning endlessly on the helipad on the top of the fucking Datadyne building at the start, and her and I having a fist battle, just punching each other, Joanna Dark and this random NPC, on the top of doing this action style set piece that we've created on top of this building. Just really, really cool. The game just allows you to do that dumb bullshit.
It's not mega polished in this way that I think is very endearing and still really fun. So that was good, Matthew. I think the multiplayer is dated very well actually, because you can't really get this specific mixture of things anywhere else.
So as long as you're willing to meet it halfway on the weird old controls, basic strange stuff about Perfect Dark and that goldeneye era of shooters that just doesn't really exist anymore in modern first-person shooter games, you will have a good time, I think. So last thing I want to ask you, Matthew, about this game then, because I think we both agree that we've had a pretty good time with it despite its flaws. Do you think in retrospect this strand of console FPS games was never going to last anyway?
In so many ways, they're built around the limitations and challenges of doing simple things like aiming in first-person using an N64 controller, which requires three hands anyway. Something that Halo would solve on consoles forever arguably in 2001, twin stick controls are nailed out of the gate in that game. It's why to me, Halo was dated way better than the TimeSplitters series, which that is a series that even though Halo exists, is still making you fiddle like a motherfucker with the aiming to even land a headshot.
It's about skill in the wrong way. That's why I think there was a kind of evolutionary reckoning to these games. Even as great as they are, the fundamentals of them were just outdated even a couple of years later.
Is that unfair? What do you think of that notion?
No, I think that's fair. I mean, TimeSplitters obviously has a lot of ex-rare people, so it's probably just the way they thought it worked, and that one made perfect sense. Yeah, I think that's okay.
This is just making the best of quite a weird situation, and the thing, to be overly defensive about it, but the thing that did jump out to me is playing it with dual analog sticks now, it still felt like a game built for one so clearly. It was so clearly tuned to the platform it was on, and there's incredible artfulness in that, and it only seems silly or a bit perverse because it's not on that platform any more. But that's just the way of things, these things will always get supplanted, and crucially, it's a game that's so rich in ideas across the board, just outside of how it controls and feels.
It's a game of weird functionality and weird modes and whatnot, and that stuff I think still feels super timeless. I don't know if that really answers the question.
No, that's fine. I was curious, just Perfect Dark Zero have a local multiplayer. Did you ever try that?
I honestly can't remember. I've played a handful of levels of that game, and it was just so arse. It was really wider than what it looks, so grim.
I really hated the art style of that game, and apologies to people who worked on it. You may listen to this podcast. I just thought it was really misjudged.
The key to Rare in their Xbox era was just letting them cook on new ideas, which is what they were always good at. There was a time Perfect Dark was a new idea, and that's why it seemed exciting. The idea of just recreating these things, that never made sense to me.
They became so much more interesting when they started doing maybe less Grab by the Ghoulies, but like Viva PiÃ±ata was like, oh, no one else could do this. No one else would have a go at this. And now Sea of Thieves, which is also just so rich.
And actually interesting, when we were talking earlier about the kind of multiplayer games with room for just like shithouse-ery and that put fun first, not really worried in like the results and like the science of competitiveness.
Yeah.
Sea of Thieves is that.
It is.
Like, there's sort of no stakes to it in a way. And because of that, it can just be really fun.
Yeah.
Yeah. Just as you were saying it, I saw the through line from Perfect Dark to Sea of Thieves in a way that hadn't before. Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is cool. So, you know, that exists. There is still room for it.
I still don't think I've answered the question.
No, that's fine. I think just a fundamental thing that changes is that they solve all of the basic design problems of first-person shooters on a pad that PC shooters never had to worry about. And, you know, like goldeneye is the perfect darker stepping stones to getting to aiming not being a problem in Halo or like aimed down sights coming up in later games.
But then the thing is, when you add things like aimed down sights, like a game like Perfect Dark and Split Screen Multiplayer is not as good anymore. Like that wouldn't improve this game at all. It kind of needs to be exactly what it is in order for it to be as fun as it is when you play it now.
So I do think it's a dead end. I'm not saying that makes it bad, but I'm just saying that like this couldn't actually last because the genre was moving, was evolving too quickly, you know? But yeah, I would like to have seen, time split as a side, like where else this, because you can trace back to Medal of Honor Allied Assault, where the designers of Titanfall and Apex Legends came from.
You can understand the sense of who's inspired those. Britain hasn't really been the home of first-person shooters in the peak of their popularity. It's not really where the genre has been driven from here.
I wish there were more of them, that there was more of a British strand of games. Instead, it's just an odd little pocket of about four or five games. That's it.
That's the one slight bummer out of this, I think, is it just doesn't really continue. But still very much enjoyed this, Matthew. I don't really have any other closing thoughts.
I think we both agreed that despite its flaws, we had a good time with this, right?
Yeah, absolutely. And I wouldn't have probably gone back to it if I hadn't been forced for this episode. So once again, success.
I think I had more fun revisiting this than Beyond Good and Evil.
Yeah, I definitely did. I thought this is like a way better game to play now than Beyond Good and Evil. Playing Beyond Good and Evil has allowed me to ensure that it won't make our top 50 third party Nintendo games next month.
Playing this also made sure Perfect Dark didn't make our top 50 Nintendo games.
No, but that's only because you don't have the blissful controls of the XBLA version on the Nintendo platform.
Yeah, that's true.
Quick question. Do you think I should go and play Perfect Dark Zero after this or maybe the Game Boy Color one? What do you think?
Should I extend?
Yeah, in the Game Boy Color one, I remember being cool. It's more like Metal Gear Solid.
Yeah.
It's how I remember it.
Nice looking game.
Yeah, and never owned it, but I remember playing it when we were doing a school play and someone in the backstage area where we all sat while we went on. I'm not going to explain the concept of backstage. You know what it is.
There was another boy there who had a Game Boy Color and was playing Perfect Dark. I remember thinking, oh, that's so rad. So yeah, that's probably the most I played it, was like dressed up as fucking Mr. Sowerberry and Oliver Twist or whatever.
Waiting to do my five minutes of Alexa.
It's a beautiful anecdote and yet more to add to the Matthew Castle Wiki. So yeah, these people could enjoy that. Okay, final comedy segment then Matthew.
We have to come up with five or so levels for a Tomorrow Never Dies game that was not made. What have you got?
Well, I thought we were going to brainstorm these together.
Yeah, we can do that. The first one I was going to suggest is you find the low resolution corpse of Terry Hatcher, but then moments later have to control a vehicle remotely using a little device and the steering is fucking terrible on N64. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, that's good. Well, you see, my worry was that based on the technology that they had, they would have got rid of the car and you've just been on foot in a car park. So it would just be James Bond running around the car park.
No, but he'd be running at like five FPS, the car, just sort of like doing loops basically.
But a car park is like God's gift to like 1999 level designer. It's just the same thing, you know, stacked five times.
Yeah.
That's good. I definitely thought they'd do the street sequence where the helicopter chases you on the bike, but with so much fucking fog to disguise the helicopter, that you've really only, like we're talking like turic levels of fog. You'd only be able to see like two meters around you, and occasionally the helicopter would swoop down, like instantly kill you.
It would be like a notorious difficulty spike, predicting the movements of a helicopter you can't see because of draw distance.
Yeah. That's good. I really like that.
So what about Jonathan Price's base thing? That feels like that's like a, what is that? Is that a boat or a submarine?
I can't remember.
So I was trying to think if there was a bunker equivalent in Tomorrow Never Dies, like a space that you could feasibly return to twice over.
It's got a bit of a momentum really. I don't think it quite has that or maybe I'm misremembering it. I didn't re-watch the film ahead of this, I'll be honest.
Well, there's the ship there. Don't they sink the ship and steal from it? Then James Bond goes to the ship in a diving level later.
I like that idea.
For some reason, Bond is there when the ship sinks now. You get to see the ship maybe above water. He's on that ship, on the naval ship, gets sunk and then later you investigate it under the water.
But you're like, wait a second, this is just the same level except now it's full of water.
They struggle to get a surface out of this film, I would say. It wouldn't quite happen.
I did wonder how about the equivalent of the damn bungee jump in goldeneye. You just walk off the dam and they fall a little bit. I would imagine it would be exactly the same for when him and Michelle Yeoh jump out that window and tear down that poster outside the skyscraper.
Yeah, definitely. That would be stretched into about three different levels, I think. There's also the kind of like snowy bit at the start, which I remember is the only level I ever played of the actual Tomorrow Never Dies game, which was complete ass.
They would stretch that into about three different levels, I think. They'd definitely prolong that one.
And that would have a horrible time segment, because the whole bit of that set piece is a missile gets fired at the camp where Bond is, and he has to get out in that plane, doesn't he, before the missile comes and blows it up. And so the final stretch of it would be a really nasty two minute time limit with a very stressed, like stressful, fast version of the Tomorrow Never Dies theme tune.
Yeah, that perfect. The only other thing I really wanted to see was like a mode where some kind of like printing press multiplayer map, right? And like definitely something where you end up beating Jonathan Pryce to death with one of his own newspapers, like that definitely like some kind of like physical like slaps, but it's like with print media, like something like that basically, I kind of like vaguely conceive.
Yeah. And I want to see Jonathan Pryce do his very problematic thing to Michelle Yeoh, where he starts making what I would say like racist noises. It's probably the best one.
Like that's what you see in the subtitles on TV, isn't it? It's like square brackets racist noises. I want to see like that reenacted, but like without any voice acting basically, and like in the bad primitive N64 graphics.
So I think we kind of made that work, Matthew. Anything to ask to add?
That weird doctor guy who assassinates Terry Hatcher, is definitely, because he's really tall, he's quite a lanky, strange man. He's like your, don't ever pick this guy in multiplayer, just because he's so tall. So his character model is like a good head hot higher than everyone else.
Yeah.
Yeah, his hitboxes are just, he's got like a 50% more health, but he's got like way more like hitboxes basically. That's good. I think we've thought enough about that.
I'll be honest, my original intention was to rewatch Tomorrow Never Dies in full before doing this.
I mean, I don't know if that would have been worth it.
No, I don't think so. I think playing Perfect Dark to completion was enough, I think. But hopefully people have enjoyed this episode, Matthew.
I enjoyed talking about it. This is a great meaty subject for one of these. Thank you so much for your support.
As mentioned, next month we're going to do top 15 Nintendo third-party games, so look forward to that. Less list making, more an actual list for you to enjoy, should be good. This month, the XXL episodes, we're going to do the Alien movies ranked.
Me and Matthew have been doing the homework for that. Just got to find a way to watch Romulus before we record that one, Matthew, coming later this month.
It's going to be too scary for me.
I don't think so. It'll be fine.
I don't know. I'm actually dreading it.
I've got three stars written all over it in that film, I think.
Such a wuss, though. Yeah. It'll be fun.
It'll be part of it.
Just take your whole family with you. Just invite them all down and then just, you know, your brothers and just, yeah, your mum, just go watch it.
It'd be the end of some members of my family, I think.
But yeah, looking forward to that, Matthew. This was good. I don't know when we'll do the next poll for this because we've got busy game season coming up.
I wonder if maybe we should save some of our time playing games for the AstroBots and Metaphors and Dragon Ages of this world. They're going to take up our time a little bit, Matthew. So something for us to think about.
Maybe this returns in the New Year or December or something like that. But we will do another poll. We will add some new games to the mix for you to vote for, and we will make sure you got some entertaining Excel episodes to enjoy in the months ahead.
Thank you for listening. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
