Hello and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
We return from the wilderness of a week off, well, not really if you listen to the Atari episode on Patreon, but theoretically a week off to bring you a mail bag. How exciting.
At last.
Definitely the best of our podcast formats, Matthew. Easily the most popular, easily the most talked about. It has actually been three months since we did one of these.
Yeah, so before we get into all that, how's it going, pal? You enjoying Mad Men? That's like all I've got on my mind at the moment, is getting back to watching Mad Men.
Oh, right. Yes, I'm making my way through Season 1. I'm enjoying it.
I've never actually rewatched Season 1 since I first saw it, basically, when it originally came out. So, yeah, it's quite wild going back to it. But yeah, no, it's good.
I'm having fun. I was actually going to bring up, I've been watching the new season of Only Murders in the Building and on Disney+, they've started doing podcasts on Disney+, about the episodes. So basically, an accompanying feature for each episode.
They did it for Alien Earth and they're doing it for Only Murders. It's got big DVD bonus content energy to it. And I wish more streamers would do it.
But have you watched Only Murders? I can't remember.
I watched two episodes. It seemed like comforting. It's sort of like Ted Lasso for people during COVID, but with more taste.
Right.
So then you know that it is about some people who set up a podcast. And in this podcast episode about the first episode of the new season, Steve Martin was talking about how much he hated comedy blather at the start of podcasts. Like how it was his major bugbear.
And I thought, I'll bring this up in our opening blather as a kind of like meta homage to Steve Martin.
Fucking Savage Takedown by an 80 plus comedian. I like that you snuck that in there because it's clearly a real bugbear that he has. Because why else would it be in there?
It's too specific not to be.
Because he sort of says, oh, I'm listening to a podcast because they're talking about art or history. I don't want to listen to like five minutes of people trying to be funny, I think is what he actually says, which is kind of brutal on whichever podcast Steve Martin's listened to, which I'm pretty sure is on the back page.
No, I mean, I don't think it would be, would it be Mark Maron's podcast? But then he's never really funny in his. He's not, I was quite shocked to learn Mark Maron is a stand-up comedian because the opening preamble of his podcast is so unfunny.
Yeah.
It's sort of like a stack of admin. He just seems like a sad man who has some good guests, you know?
I bet Steve Martin listens to something pretty highbrow because outside of his daft comedy, he's basically obsessed with art and art history and not a lot else. So I bet he listens to some pretty hardcore, you know, I wouldn't even know where to begin. I can't name one art related podcast.
No, that's it.
Is there a Desert Island Discs but for paintings? Five paintings I'd take with me on an island and look at?
Desert Island Canvases? I wish I had a better fucking gag to go with that, but didn't. Gag not found.
This is exactly the kind of preamble that Steve Martin's character in The Only Murderous Ability would hate Matthew.
So there you go.
Is that a show that really sort of, I got the impression that the first season was good, and then it's had like diminishing returns. I'm surprised it's still on. Feels like a two, three season show, Max, but it keeps going.
It's because it got really big, and it's basically become a dumping ground for like massive star cameos. And that's what defines each season, is like which famous people have signed up. You know, unexpectedly famous people.
So like Meryl Streep being in it a lot, or Paul Rudd being in it a lot. And because of that, I think it has lost some of its oddball charm of the first season, which was a lot more about Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez, which in itself is quite a weird gathering of people. And I think the more megastars they put in it, the more you're distracted from that sort of central chemistry.
That's my general critical take on Only Murders. It's kind of, it goes down half a star every season.
Oh, that's tough. That is a, that part of the diminishing returns as it gets, really. Yeah.
I feel very self-conscious if I was one of those old men and I just had to stand next to Selena Gomez all the time. I'd feel like a competition winner, you know? I sort of got the right whiff of that when that boy from Adolescence was on stage with Sydney Sweeney at the Emmys.
That's a tiny bit of a whiff of like, I won a competition on Live and Kicking in 1998 or something. Do you know what I mean? That's how I feel like me being next to Selena Gomez, but I'm in my 70s or 80s, you know?
Yeah. She does have quite an odd energy though. There's something of the loner about her.
I don't know a huge amount about real life Selena Gomez, but she fits in sort of surprisingly well. The central tree of it works. One day they'll realize this and stop feeling like this season's added Christoph Waltz and Ren√© Zellweger.
And you're like, why? Don't do it.
That just sounds irritating. Also, I mean, it won't matter because by season eight, it'll be down to zero stars based on your criteria. So that's like, we'll no longer have a reason to exist.
How are you finding Alien Earth actually on this tip? I'm sure we'll talk about that at the end of the year on the XXL episode that we do. How are you finding that?
Because I honestly really hated the first half of episode one and never went back to it, but I will go back to it this month.
Oh, that's tough.
Yeah, you enjoying it?
Yeah, I don't know. I just think I've got myself blinkers on a little bit with Noah Hawley and I just assume he knows what he's doing and it's definitely done some stuff which I've found a bit odd. I think the major critical reaction to it has been the illogical behaviour of characters to set certain story beats up.
Like a lot of very smart people are doing a lot of quite dumb things, but I've never really been a kind of viewer who's massively affected by things like that. Like, I'm not really a nitpicky TV watcher. If a whole show will feel like a bust to me rather than, oh, well, I can't watch this because someone made a bad decision.
It's like, it's artifice, isn't it? It's just, it's the story mechanics, it's gears slotting into place. I'm kind of okay with that.
And I feel like that's really the thing more people have issue with. People have to make dumb decisions or the alien would lose quite early on, I think. That's the truth of any alien thing.
It's not like all the alien films are full of people making good decisions. It's like, who goes to the dark room with all the chains and the alien, you know? You're obviously going to get munched.
I think it's pretty good. It's pretty weird. It's got interesting people.
Timothy Olyphant is fucking great in it.
In a slightly different mode than you normally see him as well.
Yeah, it's all that matters. It's because we've been doing a bit of a justified rewatch slash first watch because I never finished the later seasons. And so we're just like all in on Olyphant at the moment.
One of the best to ever do it, I think.
Yeah, I mean, you know, you can see why I was so excited when he turned up in fucking Star Wars. You know, that was a big moment for me. I was like, fuck, we're going to get Star Wars justified.
And it all went so wrong because these things often do in Star Wars. But, you know, for a little while there, I thought it was going to go well.
Yeah.
Justified in Star Wars. And it was Timothy Olyphant in it. I'd fucking be so there for that show.
But I mean, justified literally opens with the who shot first scenario.
So it's very true. Now, as a big fan of Justified, I did three seasons of it. And then I think tailed off after I think maybe I got halfway through four that didn't carry on with it.
Because three is not as good as two. But then two is like one of the great modern TV seasons, I think. So yeah, so it's tough.
But yeah, I should go back to it. I did watch the revival season last year and quite enjoyed it. I thought Boyd Holbrook was a pretty good opponent in it.
And, you know, he just likes seeing Olyphant in the fucking Stetson. You know, who doesn't enjoy that shit?
He's so cool. Like, even though he's doing stuff, which is often quite reprehensible, like he basically goes around threatening to murder, like anyone who gets in his way. But that's his whole, that's how he does his job.
But he says it in such a cool, alluring way that you're like, yeah, this is, this is awesome. It's awesome when bullies shoot people randomly. And you're like, wait, no, I don't believe that.
What am I saying?
It's like, as long as there's not a guy doing that in the UK, it's not my problem, really. So that's...
I can't see Morse gunning down a man.
Very different vibe to Morse in that.
Why did you shoot that guy in Miami on holiday?
The latest series of Lewis where he's got a flamethrower. Just not quite the same vibe. And with that, we transition to the mailbag portion of this episode, having offended Steve Martin with the first ten minutes of this episode.
And our listeners.
And our listeners, of course, who matter most of all. Do you want to start with this first question, Matthew?
Yes. Listening to the Metroid Prime episode, Matthew compared the artifact hunt to the Triforce pieces in Wind Waker, along with Luigi's Mansion and Mario Sunshine being less expansive than the plumber's N64 outing. Do we think Nintendo underestimated what it would take to make game worlds with the higher fidelity of the GameCube?
It's widely reported that something similar happened with the leap to HD, cementing the decision to step away from the graphics arms race and only have one console rather than two. That's from Luke Summerhaze.
I don't feel like this was the main problem on GameCube. I think Nintendo had other problems. The thing mentioned at the end here about having one console rather than two as development becomes more intensive.
It's a slight bummer in the sense of you and I are documented enjoyers of Nintendo handhelds, so that's gone away. But at the same time, as we have discussed before as well, there are like tiers of Nintendo games where you can tell, well, this would have been a DS game in 2005, but it's like a less expensive looking Switch game now. GameCube, clearly their problem was the lack of third party support.
It seems like that is an issue that both the big Mario and Zelda had on that platform, but it's not a problem that Twilight Princess had, is it, really? So it might be localized to those games that perhaps like they, it was just getting them on shelves as soon as they did was the major sort of sticking point there. Maybe that is kind of like part of the problem.
Matthew knows more about this than I do, but yeah, I would say third party support first and foremost. It'd be interesting to sort of see what the GameCube generation looks like if you had the GTAs on there in the same way that Xbox eventually got the GTAs. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I'd agree with that. I think definitely with Wind Waker, it's quite well documented that that had specific development problems in terms of like not being able to decide on a vision and changing to the cell shaded look quite late and then having to build a whole new production line approach in order to make that game. I don't think that was a company suddenly struggling with more power.
I think that's just a company struggling with trying to make a follow up to like Ocarina of Time. You know, they kind of made it in‚Ä¶ They began it adjacent to Majora's Mask, I believe.
I'd say that's more been Nintendo's problem. It's like how you follow up legendary titles which are held in such high esteem. You get a bit of like choice paralysis about like oh shit, we've got to make the right thing here.
You know, there's plenty of games on GameCube which are as, you know, don't have this problem. You know, like the Mario Kart and Smash Brothers are both very generous iterations of those games. Luigi's Mansion is short, but it's also kind of the size it needs to be.
Like I can't really imagine Luigi's Mansion but twice as big being any better than Luigi's Mansion. Like just, oh, there's another 20 rooms or 20 ghosts and, you know, I think it would be a bit plodding. I think maybe the idea is just smaller in nature.
And I don't necessarily agree with Sunshine being noticeably smaller feeling than Mario 64, but that's mainly because it's hard as balls and trying to get through it with that jackpack. Such a nightmare that ends up taking twice as long as Mario 64. So yeah, I don't know.
I think there are specific stories behind the games which do feel a little bit stretched out, rather than this being like a edict from on high that we have to paddle these games out because they feel too short. Yeah, it's weird. The Artifact Hunt in Metroid Prime I don't think is thought of in the same way as the the Triforce maps.
Like in my head it wasn't. When I replayed it I thought, oh this is, you know, structurally this is sort of similar. It didn't feel like, oh, there's a big chunk of the world missing here, which it maybe did in Wind Waker.
Yeah, that's it. I think that's a classic game design quirk of the time where things weren't user-tested as relentlessly so you wouldn't have had as much feedback. Also, you know, that game was, I went through some real teething pains to come together.
And you know, most of the artifacts you can sort of pick up. If you know where they are, you can pick them up as you're going. In the second half of that game it's not too bad, even though some of them, I don't think any sensible human being would ever stumble across, personally.
I don't think it's quite in the same ballpark as that, no. So besides, it definitely wasn't the only game from this generation to kind of like pad itself out with some nonsense, like plenty of games to do things like this. Matthew has recently been playing the Onimusha games.
And those are games that reuse environments. They have like a whole section where you go into a hell dimension and fight identical floors of enemies. The enemy layout has changed, but the environment stays the same.
Gamers were just always doing this back in the day, you know? Any escort mission you've played in the GTA, that's filler content, baby. So, okay, let's move on to the next question.
I can't wait to do the artifact hunt in Metro Prime 4 Beyond, where I'm having to pick up 500 things in a big empty desert on my bike.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to the one that is hidden behind a rock you can only access by driving the motorbike up the side of a larger enemy and sort of precariously popping it over. That will be really in the spirit of the original Metro Prime, so we'll see. Okay, next one then.
Bad news, you've been put to death. Good news, you're allowed to play one more game and eat a sandwich. What sandwich do you pick and what game do you pair it with?
That's from an improved vegetable tart.
I think it would be more interesting if we tried to guess what the other person would pick for this.
I've got a real answer then, like a joke answer. I've blown it in advance really. God, I feel like you'd probably pick something.
What are the games where you're talking about the food? Well, I guess Zelda's got Tears of Kingdom, Breath of the Wild got a lot of food stuff going on, but an actual sandwich, I don't know. I don't know where you get your old milk bun, green chicken sandwich and what that would pair with.
So you think I'd choose a game where I also ate a sandwich? That's what you think would happen.
No, I think you're a bit more inventive than that. But then you might look at the mailbag questions, and think I'm going to fart this one out because this is an easy episode. So you could go either way with you.
You know what I mean? What's your thought process behind how I would tackle it?
Well, I think you would want to sincerely champion a sandwich you love.
Well, I guess there's some part to that, yes, for sure.
But what that sandwich is, like I can't...
You'd never ever guess. It would take too long.
It's not the ban me.
No, I wouldn't bring it up.
It's not the ban me that you have to get by going into a secret room.
What would I pair the ban me even with?
Well, I took this question as like, I didn't really see there had to be a connection between the sandwich and the game. I thought this was pick a good sandwich and pick a good game. That's why my answer is not very interesting.
See, I've matched the sandwich to the game.
Oh my god. Like a sandwich sommelier.
I think it's time to reveal what the sandwiches are. So I've gone with a New Yorker bagel and Grand Theft R84. Which I think makes sense because New Yorker bagel, you got your pastrami, mustard, cheese in that as well.
Yeah.
I think so. And so that's just, is it sauerkraut as well that goes in that? I think it is, isn't it?
Or something like that.
I don't really like mustard, so I don't really touch stuff like that.
Yeah, so it's, yeah, like pastrami is like the key ingredient, pastrami and mustard, but I'm very big into those. And they do a good one at Macoco near us, Matthew. So that is up there.
And then I've got a joke answer, which is, would it be appropriate to pair Echo the Dolphin with some kind of seafood sandwich, i.e. a kind of like a lox with smoked salmon, cream cheese?
Surely, just a tuna baguette.
I'm not saying that Echo would be like in the sandwich. I'm just saying that like he eats a lot of fish in that game too. You know, you fly into them to get health back.
So subnautica as well, but all those sea life are like fixed up.
I don't know if the last thing you play on this earth would you want to be subnautica.
Just be horrified by creatures of the deep and then electrocuted.
While you've already got the cold sweat of the approaching executioner.
Yeah, that's true, I suppose. GTA IV though, some of those missions get quite hairy, especially if they do the XBox Backwards compatible version where the framerate fucks the difficulty and I can never finish it.
Can they not execute you until you finish the game?
That's another question really. It's like, do I get limitless New York bagels until this is done? Like, is that a thing that happens?
Can I theoretically never die and permanently eat sandwiches and have some serious stomach issues as well? I wouldn't want to be in that room with me is what I would say there. But OK, those are my answers, Matthew.
What have you got?
Oh, man. I mean, I really played this pretty straight. I thought, what's my favorite sandwich?
Which is the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich at Sandwich Sandwich in Bristol. Yeah, which I famously ate on a live stream every day on Yogscast for two weeks.
Famously.
Famously. Which has got Southern Fried Chicken, a bit of coleslaw, a bit of Creole sauce, whatever's in that. That's very nice, especially if the bread's freshly baked.
If it's warm and the chicken's a bit warm. I mean, that's an absolutely killer sandwich. Yeah, and I just played like Super Mario Galaxy.
What a boring answer, because it's a game I love. So, yeah, I should have picked a longer game to prolong my life.
When you did say, I didn't think that much about the connections, I thought you were going to be like, Danganronpa and a bacon sandwich. It wasn't like too far away from that in the end, but the sandwich was at least, you know, there was some detail there.
Danganronpa has people being executed in it, so I think that'd be a bit too on the note. Like, I want to play something just as far from being execution-adjacent as possible. Like, I really wouldn't want to be thinking about my impending death.
I don't think there's anything in Married Galaxy that suggests execution.
The crushing difficulty, perhaps, of the platforming, but not quite the same. Whereas GTA IV does have bits where you have to decide whether to execute a character or not.
Yeah, oh yeah, you're gonna have a bad time. That's gonna prove to be upsetting.
Yeah, but then I'll get back in a car and I'll put on Smashing Pumpkins. I'll be like, oh, I'm in Times Square, isn't that nice? And soak up the Obama administration era vibes of that game, Matthew.
And anyway, let's move on to the next question.
You, you're the new Doom Slayer, though he still holds trademark of that name. So what are you the something slayer of from Beatamax Bandit?
I don't know why I kept this one, because I don't have a good answer for it.
Yeah, I just wrote Cake, question mark.
Oh, I just wrote Discorders. I've been doing a bit of that lately.
You're a Discord Slayer. You've slayed one.
You're a Discord Slayer. Yeah, slayed one, but I may slay more. I could slay up to five, so who knows?
Yeah.
I eat a lot of cake.
That's tough.
Yeah.
That's tough. But you know what, Beatamax Bandit, you are the moderator of our Discord, and I thought, I can't not include your question. It seems like a microaggression if I don't.
So I'll just include it and do it badly.
Seems like a macroaggression to answer it so poorly.
Yeah, it does. A bit like offering to clean the pots and doing it badly or smashing the crockery or something. Bit of that vibe.
Oh, that's tough. Okay, so we're not necessarily off to our best start with the mailbag, but on it goes. So next question.
Are there any Back Page pod episode formats you've come up with which you secretly think would slap but which you can't or won't bring yourselves to do or which one of you has vetoed? Unrelated, I submit my unworkable suggestion, The Cursed Game Box Art Draft, in which you have to not only pick a winning selection but also describe the art out to listeners. Categories could include most egregious disparity with in-game visuals.
Atari 2600's got that wrapped up, Matthew. Warlords. You heard that, Yars Revenge.
Two horny brackets 90s, two horny brackets 2000s, the X Award for a disastrous rebrand, Bad Game slash Good Art, Good Game slash Bad Art, or the Blinks Award for a juiceless mascot debut. This bad idea brought to you by an unfortunate Google search for Gauntlet Dark Legacy. Many thanks for a juicy podcast, Swimming in Source.
That's from Nige. So first part of this, Matthew, I thought we could talk about the second part first. It's a nice idea, but you actually kind of answered some of the challenges of the first part, which is if you have to describe something that really you need people to look at, that becomes a bit onerous for a podcast.
So you almost don't want to make people do the work. When we did the covers episodes, for example, I think we knew the chat was good, but we thought maybe the barrier to entry of having to look on a Pinterest page at all the different covers and kind of follow along was a bit too much to ask. And someone said, Oh, what could you do a video version of it?
And it's like, well, that's too much work, to be honest. And I don't think we had the Patreon at the time, so we weren't being paid for it and all that stuff. And so, yeah, that's why I don't think that idea quite works.
If the key component of it, the punchline, is not actually present for the listener, it's not self-contained, it doesn't really work. So, that's kind of why I don't think we've done any more of the cover ones, Matthew, or things that describe mag specific things. Do you want to comment on that?
Anything with covers. I'd say adjacent to that, talking about music is a little bit tricky as well, just because you kind of like want to hear loads of stuff. And I always worry that we're on slightly shaky grounds, filling the podcast full of music.
That's another one that I always think, oh, I'd love to, I love video game music so much, and it's something I'd like to talk about more, but how we go about it has always proved a bit of a mystery.
We went weapons free for the draft that we did, soundtrack draft.
Yeah, that's true.
And Square Enix didn't say they're lawyers after us. Well, that's it, no lawyers, all good. No YouTube strikes because we're not on YouTube.
So all good.
Other episode format ideas we've come up with, not many things have been shot down. I've definitely had a couple of failed attempts at coming up with a Christmas extravaganza, but then I think we actually did eventually solve that problem and our Christmas episode format is pretty solid now. I think there were definitely a couple of years early on where I pitched trying to basically do the equivalent of a magazine Christmas feature, like a variety show with lots of little segments to it that neither of us thought really had the juice.
Oh yeah, I remember that.
Yeah, yeah, but then I think we eventually settled on the kind of Noel's House Party thing, where we just do a regular episode and then we hear the ding-dong and guests turn up and talk about their game in the year, and actually I quite like that format now, so I don't have to try and get a Christmas episode off the ground again. Yeah, but that's the only thing that really jumps out, but then that probably speaks to how few ideas I actually contribute.
It's funny, me and Matthew went out last week, and actually do you want me to talk about this before I talk about it?
Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I think you were like, I don't have loads of ideas for the podcast. I think you're talking about how the idea of like, how could we step up to the next level, do something larger than we already do, and I think you're like, I don't really have loads of ideas. I think you were nervous that as we run out of the best games of the different year episodes, that our backbone of the podcast is disappearing a little bit.
Something I think about as well, but I also think that the sort of Two Giant Men play episodes and the four person drafts have kind of become the backbone of it quietly. So I was spooked by that for about 48 hours, and I was like desperately trying to come up with ideas, which is why I pelted you with ideas all weekend. I was like, we should do this, we should do that.
Because I think I just wanted you to not be spooked by the idea that like it's coming to an end. And so I was like, we can still do great podcasts. But yeah, it's also I was saying to Matthew, that I don't need Matthew to contribute like a million ideas.
Like he brings his A-game to every single idea I suggest, which is more than you can ever really hope for from a co-host. So it's all good. I was thinking about how the Metacritic one was, it feels like one that was, there were different versions of that.
Like we talked about it a while or like I think we thought about using numbers in some really complicated way and then that sort of like didn't really. It just feels like it was in limbo for a while that we're going to do something with scores and numbers and then you kind of talk to yourself out of it. Maybe it's more of a fantasy football style thing.
I'm thinking of Matthew but you were...
Oh no, that was the fantasy critic thing because which we nod to in our predictions for the year where we each pick five games and at the end of the year see whose five games scored the highest. That is a very reduced version of fantasy critic which has a larger structure to it and my younger brother does it and with his mates and I always whenever I meet up with him I love hearing him talk about like how they're all fairing and there are like not like transfers as such but there's some kind of swapping and bargaining and you can sort of buy games as they appear through the year and I did like the idea of having that running kind of narrative of how this how this thing's going but it hasn't really kind of you know taken off we do a little reduced version which I'm absolutely shit out I lost last year and I'm going to lose this year because I picked a load of games which aren't finished and not coming out seemingly ever which is a bummer.
I think we're even on that front because I think Fable was one of your games and then one of mine got delayed as well but I don't remember which one it was.
Oh so maybe it's back on.
Yeah I can't remember which mine one was I sort of try to think like what might be the best way to figure out what that would be I probably have to look at Graham's backpagepod.co.uk in fact I'll find it right now Matthew. Okay so yeah I picked Monster Hunter Wild, Split Fiction, Civ 7, Snake Eater, Reanimal was the one that got delayed. Why did I pick Reanimal?
That's probably because we didn't know about any games that were coming out when we started doing that. You picked Hollow Knight Silksong which seems like it was a good call to be honest. Ghost of Yote, Doom the Dark Ages, Elden Ring Night Reign which I think got a slightly mixed reception and Fable.
So I think actually it might be...
Oh, maybe the competition is back on.
Yeah, it might be actually a bit more even than we thought. Civ 7 kind of came in a bit lower than expected. But the other games did alright.
Split Fiction did very well. So yeah, it might balance out.
I think that as a kind of dialogue through the year, I think there's potential in it and it would work. But I think we also have so many competitive elements to this podcast with drafts and, well, mainly drafts. So we probably didn't need like a higher meta-level stressing us out throughout the year.
I will ask you this though. I thought after doing one episode of the Metacritic sort of game that, I mean, no offence, you might have already ruined it in the first episode by, like, you went to the deepest, darkest depths straight away in terms of strategy. And I wonder if there's like nowhere to go with that afterwards.
That's been the sort of my, the question on my mind a bit with that one. What do you think?
I don't know, we'll definitely do a second one at some point and see how it plays out. Yeah, it's on a sort of, yeah, quite fragile ground, that one. I think you can go darker and weirder.
Well, I look forward to seeing what that looks like. I'm slightly more interested in the Edge score draft that I pitched to you. You've got all the categories are basically Edge scores, so you have to pick games that Edge gave those scores.
So if you can get Final Fantasy X for 6 out of 10, that's a good pick, I think, for example. There's a big spreadsheet of all of them in there, Matthew. So that's something good.
Maybe we can ask Chris Schilling if he'll do that one with us.
Oh yeah, but then we'll end up with ex-Edge writers feeling miffed when we're like, what idiot underscored this to the tune of 6 out of 10? What idiot overscored this to the tune of 10 out of 10?
I might also email John as a cursing, be like, hey, do you mind if I do this episode? I promise I mean no disrespect, like going to the mafia and be like, sorry about that, capo I offed or whatever. Anyway, second use of capo on this podcast in several weeks.
Okay, Matthew, so the other one I killed before it went anywhere. I did briefly consider something called Gamescourt Digital Justice where people would put their digital purchases in Gamescourt, but it just doesn't work as well as physical. Physical is physical and the supply and demand, sort of rising prices and all that stuff is perfect for it.
So I just don't think you can fuck with Gamescourt. Gamescourt is what it is, you know?
Did we once throw around Gamescourt, but for more anecdotal things, like just whether I was in the right or the wrong for this. Did we ever talk about that?
Oh yeah, what the idea of using Judge Castle. I mean, we used Judge Castle for the GTA clones.
Yeah, it was like people would send us a story about like, oh, I fucked over a friend in a game by doing this, and then we'd decide whether or not that was bad behaviour, or maybe.
I quite like that. Yeah, that rings a bell. That's maybe like three years ago we talked about that.
But I do like the idea of using Judge Castle in other contexts, because I think the only time we've used Judge Castle outside of, I'm talking about like he's fucking Tony Soprano or something.
But he is one of the great literary creations of the 21st century.
Exactly. In that PS2 GTA clones episode we did with Jeremy, which was actually really fun. The idea of like putting some shit GTA likes on trial was good.
So I'm all for using Judge Castle. Let's have a go at this. So this is a call out.
If you want to email backpagegames.gmail.com or go into the pod questions channel, give us your gaming anecdotes where you or someone else was, you know, wronged. Said to be in the wrong. Yeah, well, someone was wronged and there was a perpetrator and Judge Castle makes a call.
More like Judge Judy kind of scenarios.
Exactly.
It's like Civil Corps.
Exactly. And so if you put those through, if we get enough of them, let's say like we get 10 to 15 of them, we'll give that a run and see how it goes. I am also, I'm curious about the Fantasy Critic thing doing a more involved version of it.
Though I do like the idea of committing to something at the start of the year, then it being a punchline at the end of the year when it all goes horribly wrong. So I'm in two minds about that one. Like you say, we've probably got enough listy stuff anyway.
Okay, Matthew, let's move on to the next question.
Dear Giant Men, I recently found gaming overload in the loft. I expect you've heard of it and maybe even got into journalism because of it. In case not, me and some other dweebs wrote it in school.
We sold it for 15p on a little table after an assembly in which Mr. Rick, head of year 8, described it as a computer paper. More copies went unsold and Issue 2, trailed here with some killer apps like The Weakest Link on PS1, never made it. We were bullied for some time for writing it and I think time has proven us right.
With your expert hats on, please place it in the pantheon of 2000s games mags. I expect it's not quite NGC or Edge, but it's at least not that weird earlier official Nintendo mag they had. That was mainly just pictures and a 98% score for Mario Party 3.
Excellent burn. If any publishers are lurking, I'm happy to revive this for the right fee, and obviously also available as an XL tier guest or most likely the main feed given my star power. That's Matthew Cubed.
Let me say why I wanted to include this, Matthew, because I wanted to ask if you ever did any hobbyist little games magazine thing with A4 paper or anything like that, because I did with a little mate across the road called Reese when I was a kid. I did about 10 pages of a fake PC gaming magazine basically, because I was just so into PC Gamer at the time. I cut loads of screenshots out of pretty good US magazine called PC Gaming World or something that I bought.
It was one of those mags. I was like, oh, I've never seen this before. I'll give this a read and then thought it was pretty good, but decided to cut it up and then repurpose it as my own magazine.
Incredibly lame 10-year-old boy shit. But I was curious if anything like this had happened. If you ever had a blog where you talked about games, that kind of thing.
No, I didn't, unfortunately, for to give us an interesting answer. The closest I came to this was I had that Simpsons book, Bart Simpson's Guide to Life. Oh yeah.
Yeah, I tried making my own version. Like about like, but instead of Bart Simpson, it was me.
Right.
Which obviously doesn't like, doesn't have like the law of the Simpsons to tap into. But I definitely remember like drawing out and just like ripping off jokes from Bart Simpson's Guide to Life, but putting myself in them. That's something I did.
That's sad, isn't it?
It's okay. It's not any sort of lamer than mine really. I was going to say that there are some things in life that, you know, you're certain of, right?
Death and tax, as they always say. But I say also, you can be certain that credited author on Bart Simpson's Guide to Life, Matt Groening, did not write that fucking book. Let me tell you that right now.
He was far too rich to do that. Someone got paid probably 500 quid to crank that out, and they were very happy to do so. Just no way Matt Groening wrote that, Matthew.
That's, I'm saying that off the bat.
That book was an absolute banger.
People do like it. I think my little brother had it and seemed to quite like it. But yeah, I will also say that this podcast kind of is Matthew Castle's Guide to Life.
It's sort of like play Ace Attorney Games, eat these sandwiches from Morgbund and also Sandwich Sandwich. It's kind of turned into that, but in audio form, really. OK, yeah.
So that's all I wanted to ask was whether you did any kind of hobbyist games journalism.
Did MattieCubed include scans of gaming overload in this question?
I don't think he did, actually, no.
OK, because it sort of feels like, can you read this and evaluate it? And there wasn't anything attached. So I've just got to imagine this thing that bombed out.
I mean, I would say, just put my editorial hat on, if the strongest pitch for your second issue is the weakest link on PS1. I mean, that's tough. That doesn't suggest a hugely strong editorial eye.
No, that will have a stub that's like red on the magazines from the past wiki page, that one. Gaming Overload would just be over in like five issues based on that.
Gaming Overload, though, quite a good name.
That is a good name, actually. If there's a site now called Gaming Overload, I think people would even blink twice at that. It's pretty good for little kids coming up with that.
It's better than Now Gamer. People actually pay money to come up with that. I also love that burn about original official Nintendo mag.
What odd little pamphlet thing that was. That was very odd, like if the Argos catalog was a magazine or something. Very strange.
Next question, Matthew, is from Chris. Do you think we could get a community Patreon top 10 suggested listen podcast list pin somewhere? I probably should have put some commas in that as I'm saying it out loud.
Basically, with this one, Matthew, I thought we should just recommend some of the Patreon episodes we've done. We've made loads now, hard to keep track of all of them. We do two a month, but I was wondering if you had any recommendations to go along with this question.
Not necessarily 10, but just some ones that you thought were good.
I like how film swap episodes. I think they've generally been quite good. I think the Dazed and Confused and 21 Jump Street episode is pretty strong.
Yeah, just because it had a lot of stuff, a lot of like school memories and also they were like, I think the ones where there's some good sort of supplementary reading to be done to add a little bit of meat on the bones. Because that one, yeah, we had that All Right, All Right, All Right book. And that was great.
Yeah, that really helped. I really like the Bully episode, which conveniently went up on the free feed for everyone for similar reasons. It's just sort of the perfect meeting point of talking about an interesting game, but it also allowing us to talk about some bullshit from our school days.
A sweet spot for us. I'm trying to think what else we've done in Patreon.
Oh, I was going to say, by far the best one we've done this year. I said not by far, actually, like it's definitely up there. Austin Powers.
That was that was so I mean, I had a great time. That was there was maybe not like loads of meat on the bones of that one. But I think those turned out to be perfect films to discuss because it kind of complemented our Bond episode quite well.
Yeah. Which is also in the free feed if you want to go listen to that Bond ranking. So some good ones have gone up in the free feed.
But I would say Two Giant Men play GTA Vice City. Really good. Oh, yeah.
Two Giant Men play Metro Prime. Those are both from this year. Those are really good.
I also like the film sort ones. One of my favorite film sort ones is Threads and Speak No Evil, which we did. Made Matthew watch the 1980 something or other BBC film where Sheffield is nuked.
Made a joke about I wonder what Jeremy Peel would do in this scenario. That was my highlight of podcasting last year. And then Speak No Evil, just an unbelievably horrible film with an all-timer, nasty ending.
Talking about that with Matthew is just great fun. I just really enjoyed that.
I like that one because there was a lot of, I think we engaged with it in a very open-hearted way of trying to imagine ourselves in that scenario. And rather than just focusing on the sheer kind of gruesome horror of the last 10 minutes, I think we had some good stuff to say about social awkwardness and being a good guest and a good host.
Yeah, for sure. The other one I would throw in here is that we did an episode where I went around Matthew's with a modded Dreamcast, we played loads of Dreamcast games back to back. And we just did very similar with Atari Games last week on Patreon.
Yeah, to balance it out, because this seems too much like an ad, I'll tell you two of my least favorite ones, they were rubbish. When we did like, I think five years later, Xbox Series X versus PS5, like our first ever episode, which was not very good. And then we obviously did the idea again and it was not very good again.
And we were like, why did we do this at the end? And it was like, and charge people for it. That was a complete failure.
I wasn't very happy with the, let's go back to old Game of the Year lists and like from 2020 onwards and do those ones and revise them with anything we would change since we did the podcast. I think that could have been better. I sort of wish we'd done just 2020 again, as like best games of 2020 again, but like five years later.
So I might still do that at some point down the line, but yeah, so I don't think that one was very good either, Matthew, but generally speaking, they're pretty decent. Things that make us go, oh yeah, and oh no, those are pretty good as well. Boss Bowls, they did two Boss Bowls episodes, those were good.
So those are, there you go, some plugs and also some self-critiquing there to balance it out. Do you want to read out this next one, Matthew?
Hello venerable lads of an enviable size. Thinking about the games mentioned in best games of 2005 episode, reminded me that in those house in days, memory cards had cute little symbols, 3D icons, or even animated characters that represented the save. Any favourites?
Are there also any whimsical features you miss from days of consoles past? Cheers for the pod, Dynamic Galleries.
Yeah, I suppose like the, I think the PS2 memory cards have rightly recommended us the, or so rightly remembered as the sort of like best of this, or one of the best things of this. I would say some of the old Nintendo UI stuff. I mean, people were like Street Pass, don't they, Matthew?
But I was going to say like Picto Chat, I really enjoyed. That's such a relic of the time. I kind of miss having consoles having their own deranged interface.
Like one of the worst interfaces of all time on a games console is the PS Vita with all those little blobs that can only fit so many on like one screen. So about eight different screens of your games kind of scrolling back and forth between them.
All these apps that I never opened once, I don't even know what they do.
Exactly. There's so many of them. It's got its own trophies app, it's got its own party app.
Did anyone ever do a party on PS Vita? It's got Nier. Does anyone know what Nier is?
I'm not talking about N-I-E-R, I'm talking about N-E-A-R. Friends button on there, photos, because the PS Vita had a camera on it. I mean, who was using it to take pictures of people?
Welcome Pack, what does that do? I say Welcome Park. Who fucking knows what that is?
I think some of these you couldn't delete, you were just stuck with them. So yeah, PS Vita was sort of like awash with dumb features, wasn't it, as a console. But the UI was, it's like charmingly naff, I would say, compared to how good the UI of the PS4 and PS5 is.
So let's come to mine, Matthew, any from you?
Yeah, I watched a video montage of GameCube save icons. That was something I did on my lunchtime. And I actually thought the GameCube ones were quite powerfully underwhelming.
Most of them were quite sort of static. If they were animated at all, it was like Mario sort of, I don't know, not like winking, but sort of giving a little sort of suggestive eyebrow wiggle or something, which I thought was quite unpleasant. So yeah, I can't really get behind any of those.
Little touches I did like. I like the little 3D models that would appear on 3DS, as like the startup icon that would appear on the top screen when you were starting a game. So like if you put a DS in, if you put a DS cart in, it would be a little 3D DS cart with the game sticker on it.
But some of the other games had like a little character would come up and do an animation or something would happen. A little early taste of has this game done, you know, thought about how 3D this console actually is. Like if they nailed it before you even started playing, it kind of got you excited for what was to come.
Something I have a lot of nostalgic fondness for, you know, in the era of games magazines, games magazines giving away decals for consoles and controllers. And because of this, when I think of an N64, what I'm actually thinking of is an N64 with a Majora's Mask decal on that was given away in N64 magazine. That was on so many of my friends N64s, because we all got the same magazines, we all got the same decal.
You're like, well, this is great, this is going to be like transformative. But it would get really tatty. So by the end of the generation, everyone's consoles were covered with slightly fading or like peeling images of Majora's Mask.
Same on GameCube. I had these GameCube controller stickers that NGC gave away, which kind of helped give them a bit of identity, like player one is always Mario, player two is always Cell Shaded Link. But even those would get kind of grubby over time.
So consoles being covered with unlicensed decal tat that would gradually get shitty over the years. And that being a big part of their identity, that I miss. The worst example of this is definitely some of the decals we gave away on NGamer for the Wii.
I've got a Wii in this house, which has got a kind of like a cartoony John McEnroe from Grand Slam Tennis, EA's rubbish tennis game for the Wii. And that is just what that Wii looks like now. When I think of the Wii, I'm probably thinking of John McEnroe and like grass, because that's what is on the front of the Wii that I see most often.
Yeah, that's reminded me of 360 faceplates, those are long gone. I think I had one of Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII, she just sat there with a little sword. That one was pretty tasteful because it was like a white background, so it's the same colour as the console.
But I also got given, for some reason, I ended up with one, probably from some kind of Imagine office clear out thing, a Civilization Revolution one that I think had like fucking Napoleon on it or something. I was just like, who wants to let their 360 doing that? It's a completely different colour scheme to everything else on the 360, so incredibly tacky.
I just think if you ever went into someone's house and saw like a Napoleon 360, you'd be like, what the fuck is going on with this guy? That's not good.
Yeah. It does seem like the Lightning One was a real thing. So I think I must have vote.
Then again, I don't remember the pink bit of it. I think I did have this at some point, but nonetheless. Then eventually because of the fact that the disk drive wouldn't open properly and I had a fucking 2P coin stuck in it, I just ditched the faceplates all together.
It's just this horrible skeletal 360 sat there and you're like, in a way I understand why they stopped doing this on games consoles. Yeah. A couple of other shouts here actually Matthew.
So the slightly naff feature, but the thing I enjoyed about the environment the PS3 was launched in was the fact that you could play video files like a video tab on the console. That feels very lost now as a thing. I don't think you can dump video files on PS5 just like a.mov or.mp4 and then just play it.
I might be wrong, but as far as I know, that's never been a sort of main feature of the console. Whereas PS3, they were very big on like famously, they went with it's a multimedia device. So it could do all those things.
I had the old cursed PS3, PS TV thing where you could record things off the TV, export them as video files onto your XMB. And so I just had fucking Team America on my PS3 for about seven years. Like never watched it back, but it was just there.
Kind of missed like just how, it's sort of like a slightly quaint element to that now because that's just not the world we're in at all, streaming services and stuff. But finally, I mean, the go for me was the old PS2 browser screen. Good vibes, that little light thing going back and forth, no notifications, just people enjoying the moment, man.
The PS2 browser screen was very, very good. So I think we were pretty comprehensive there, Matthew.
You said it's so surprised that there was finally a good answer in this mail.
I think I've still my highlight of the episode so far is you describing Steve Martin's take on podcast etiquette.
I was just thinking Steve Martin had to wait 51 minutes before he got like a proper nutritional answer.
Are you saying that like cravenly recommending episodes on our Patreon feed is not good content, Matthew? Heaven forbid. Okay, next question.
Back to malnutritious content here. We're back to McDonald's Happy Meals questions and answers. Hello, Mighty Games Colossi.
What are your favorite moments in games that make you feel represented? For me, it's that bit when an early stage 3D platformer boss does a big attack, then has to stop for a breather for a bit. That's from Nathan Redland.
Yeah, I get that. Well, I went super specific with this. That bit in Shibuya Scramble where a freelance journalist jumps through an enormous amount of hoops for a failing publication, just out of like friendship and the principle of trying to do good journalism.
That's got an extreme... Anyone who has ever written a single piece of freelance for a games magazine knows that there has to be a tiny bit of something beyond the financial benefit in order to do that. So that really resonates with me.
Not quite in the spirit of the question. More broadly, how hard it is to pass a driving test in Driver or GTA San Andreas. That is so true.
Driving tests are a fucking nightmare. And it just makes sense that some of the hardest stuff I've ever had to do in a game is very reflective of some of the hardest stuff I've ever had to do in real life. Driving tests, the absolute worst.
Those are some fun answers, actually, Matthew. I went way more basic than this. So you tried a lot harder than me.
I basically go with, I think Snorlax is a vibe. The idea of being dangerous but asleep. And the idea that like, if you wake me up, that it will be dangerous.
I think there's a bit of that because I'm just so, so tall and so big. But also when I'm asleep, it's so obvious because the snoring is so bad. So I think there's a bit of that Snorlax vibes to me.
Then the idea of like going back to sleep after like exerting yourself very gently. That's kind of, kind of a vibe. And I could see myself also like being in the way of an exit from a small town at some point and it becoming like a civil issue.
So that's not ruling that out.
Bradford on Avon. No one can get out of Bradford on Avon.
Because I'm sleeping in front of the train station. Yeah, I'm still wanted dead or alive in there, Bradford on Avon. More for my shivering aisles joke than anything, Matthew.
The other thing is, you know when people get, they like hit pause in Super Smash Bros at the exact moment, like Kirby's eating something, like Profane. You see like Mario's legs disappearing into this pink blob, and like in those frames where you're like, oh, something inhuman is occurring here. That's a bit of me vibe as well, I think.
That's like if you watch me eat, you'll get many sort of like frames like that.
I thought you were talking about like taking photos of you, that you always get snapped and looking slightly unusual.
That's probably a good shout as well, to be honest. But those are my very basic answers to this reasonable question.
Anything where someone gets a bit tired over time, it's true. I'm not going to say I have the stamina of a GTA hero, but even when they've been running for a while, and then they have to stop for a little breather, that is simulating something that's very true to life. I just never ever run, so I can't even pretend that I'm like running and getting out of breath.
I just refuse to move faster than a walk, so just not going to end in disaster.
I think that that, that's a funny thought. I think that that big lad in Resident Evil Village, the retailer, the merchant, sorry, I think that-
The retailer, as he's famously known. Legendary character, the Resident Evil Retailer.
Retailer? Oh my God. I absolutely fucked that.
Oh my God, my brain is just mashed potato at the moment. So I was going to say, he had a bit of like post-COVID weight gain energy, where I was like, oh yeah, the same brother, you know? And I wonder if like he'll turn up again in Requiem, but having lost a lot of weight, because it'd be like, oh yeah, COVID ended.
So I like basically went on the 5-2 diet, I hit the treadmill and I'm sort of, I'm eating like 1800 calories a day and I've really got this down, but he's got a lot of excess fat, fat bastard and gold member style, Matthew. So I guess he's a slight vibe. It never got, my COVID weight gain never got so bad that I was like airing out my belly button in the way that he is, with his sort of tummy sticking out.
But again, like I say, I just really, I sense my energy in that guy, you know, if not my physical size. Okay, let's move on to the next question.
Long time listener, first time discorder. I don't think anyone would have predicted the colossus that GTA would become when Grand Theft Auto 1, 2 and London launched. What early game series would you like to have seen blow up in the way that GTA has?
So, a video game from an early video game that could have become a massive thing. That's from Steve Martin.
Yeah, he's definitely not listening after this episode. So, I think that it's a good question actually, because yeah, it's an unusual journey from GTA 1, 2 to 3. It's strange that that happened.
It's just the ultimate 2D to 3D translation and it's going really well. Actually, when we talked about this previously, I think the comparison we made was, it's as good as it was for Mario and Zelda, really, GTA 3. It was as ambitious, as important.
It was along those lines. I think the Houses have even mentioned those games when talking about GTA 3 in the past. So, good question.
I think Onomusha really is this for me. And I think if this new one, which looks amazing, and people say, plays wonderfully, if this game is great, I think it will sell really well, because it's the right time for the setting, it's the right time for the kind of game they've made, which looks a little bit more Souls-like than, you know, sort of retrofitted Resident Evil, which is kind of what Onomusha was. So, that kind of is it for me in some ways, Matthew.
But I was also going to say, though, that I think Dino Crisis would be a good shout here. Like, it's Dino Crisis feels like when you watch that sort of Shinji Mikami documentary, he made it sound like it was a project that was salvaged a bit from, you know, from sort of like complete disaster. And it basically became a Resident Evil clone because it had to be.
But I don't think anyone can really dispute the idea that, you know, survival horror with dinosaurs is still a great concept. Those fucking Jurassic Park films keep coming out. They keep being absolutely shite and people keep going to see them because they like dinosaurs and I think that Dino Crisis could have had that moment.
Similarly, you know, I love when there's, I love when we have big budget survival horror games around and I would love Parasite Eve to have become bigger than it was. I played the original one of those, you know, for an episode, I can't remember, like maybe a couple of years ago, and just really, you know, really enjoyed what it had in common and what it didn't have in common with both survival horror games of the time, but also games that Squaresoft was making of the time, you know, making of the time. It had a very similar art style to Final Fantasy VIII, so it feels like a relative of that.
And, you know, this kind of slightly weird kind of like a city, sort of civilized location is suddenly kind of like awash with these weird monsters and strange psychological horror stuff. I think it would have made a good, you know, sort of like big budget franchise, but never really happened. So those are my answers, Matthew.
I guess like a series which died quite young, not super, super early, not like GTA early, would have been No One Lives Forever. I think just having a big FPS series, a big shiny, expensive FPS series that actually has a sort of sense of humour and a sense of style beyond just like military photorealism, that would be interesting. And I was trying, you know, if I could think of any shooter which, you know, had that and okay, No One Lives Forever has RPG elements in there as well.
It's almost like it's almost flirting with immersive sim in places. But that being a valid approach to an FPS rather than just like super grim hard work games, that's a strand of the FPS. I would have liked the industry to have explored a bit more.
I always thought there was a little bit more life in Beetle Adventure Racing on the N64. A much more like playful version of the racing game, sort of lent in to the natural inbuilt silliness of the Beetle being a kind of weird squat little car. And so they were driving through quite outlandish levels.
The structure of Beetle Adventure Racing is that the levels had huge branching paths and there were boxes with points you could collect on different strands. But over the course of three laps you'd have to plan it that you'd taken basically like every strand of the course to collect all these boxes if you wanted to unlock stuff. And I played that game religiously on the N64 and it exists somewhere between Mario Kart, silly kart game with weapons, and a more serious racing game.
I like the attitude of that and stuff like that just doesn't seem to be able to exist. I guess the case in point would be what happened with Blur, trying to make an in-between, shiny, sexy, but also a little bit silly and a little bit fun, and it didn't take off. So I can understand why those things didn't explode.
I actually struggled to think of anything else. I know what happened to point and click adventure games, for example, and why they didn't continue being the predominant narrative form without the mega backing of LucasArts behind it. There's a bit of a what if with that genre, even though Indies have it covered fine these days.
I was going to ask you along slightly similar lines, right? This might seem controversial, but I wondered if you thought that, they're rebooting Tomb Raider for I think the third time they're doing that. And it sort of feels like a series that has always been pretty big, but never consistently big.
And I always wondered if that's because they didn't take proper care of it when it first launched and made too many. And the later ones on PS1 were just not considered very good. Then when they launched on PS2 with Angel of Darkness, it was a disaster.
It just felt like they didn't... It feels like that series could have been every game sells 10 million copies, if they're all as good as the first one was, or they're all as good as the 2013 one was, or Legend, or Underworld, which I know you liked. And it feels like each one has to really prove itself for people to properly give a shit.
But if they hadn't rushed out so many of them and cashed in so early, and kept the quality bar super high, could that have been like... Is there a world where core design is a naughty dog and not a footnote in history? Yeah, that came to mind.
I just thought, man, something that has had as many games as Tomb Raider, it feels like it's always reached a point where people stopped buying them or stopped caring about them. And when they all re-released a few years ago, people were like, yeah, the last few were just not very good at the original set. And it's like, wow, why was that?
Why did they have to rush so many of them out? Shouldn't they have taken better care of it? You know, just a theory.
What do you think?
Yeah, I can see that. I guess they want to know that someone else would come along and do a very expensive, very shiny version of that in Uncharted and that it would become this huge first-party fan favourite. Imagine they're kind of kicking themselves.
I mean, I don't think some of the Tomb Raider games, the most recent trilogy, they're not that far behind Uncharted as games.
No.
You know, they're definitely up there. I mean, I loved playing them. I thought they were absolutely brilliant.
I loved the last one. I thought it was great. I really, really hope Crystal Dynamics can deliver on that next one.
Yeah, that is a weird series. You don't want to say it was like mismanaged or mismarketed, but I don't think it's ever quite found the crowd it deserves. If they'd not bodged that sort of generation handover between like PS1 and PS2, because by the end of the PS2 you've got like Tomb Raider Legend, and that's pretty healthy.
I think if that had arrived earlier on, people wouldn't have questioned it at all. You would have just gone, yeah, more great Tomb Raider. Love it.
That's the thing. So Uncharted 4 has sold over 18 million copies. It's an absolute fucking monster success of a game.
I think Tomb Raider, the 2013 one, is one of the best selling ones and it sold like six. And it's like you say, the games are not that far apart. It's just that, yeah, the Uncharted series is incredibly consistent, you know?
However you might feel about the first one, going back to it, it's like, for its time, every game for its time was perfect. And Tomb Raider just, yeah, it just feels like out of the gates, they just used up people's goodwill on it. And I just don't know if there's like as much residual excitement for it as it maybe deserves based on how good the games have really, they've all been pretty great really in Crystal Dynamics' hands.
It's not like they've ever really properly messed it up. So yeah, that's one of those things that came to mind of like, Tomb Raider has had some weird absences. We're now at like, what, seven years since the last one?
And so, yeah, I don't know. That came to mind when I read this question. So I thought it was worth litigating, Matthew.
Okay, this next question then is from Drew Phantoms. Gents, you've discussed your non-games writing here and there. Satan appears in your living room.
He gives your cat a knowing nod. He then offers you a bargain. You can be a wildly successful novelist, dot dot dot, but your debut novel will only ever exist as an audiobook read by Charles Martinet.
You may choose either Wario voice or Waluigi voice and he will stay in character throughout the recitation, the reading. Or you can be a wildly successful writer for stage and screen, but your first series production or movie must be directed by Yujin Naka and you can only cast characters from the extended sonic universe, including cursed human Jim Carrey. Your novel or screenplay cannot be shit.
Satan will know if it's shit. Which do you choose or do you try and trick the trickster? Thanks as always for the pod.
Had a great relisten during a gruelling 12 hour plus road trip. Okay, so you've got success but cursed, Matthew, in each case. It's rare for Satan to be like, oh, this is the awful consequence for the dream I'm going to grant him.
That's not how they handle it in Faust, is it? It's like, it's a bit more like, oh yeah, let's get this off the ground first before you find out what the terrible...
Yeah, and then there's a sting in the tail.
Yeah, exactly. Not like, here's the... By the way, here's the fine print.
I'm just going to say it out loud.
I like how upfront this version of Satan is. He's a very honest Satan. He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, before you commit, it is Charles Marsley is going to be reading it.
I do make sure your lawyer looks at this because, you know, I want to make sure that you're happy.
You're like, man, that is diabolical.
I struggle with this. I think probably the stage and screen option because I think it would get a lot of attention more so than an audio book read by Charles Martin. People would be like, oh, the latest installment of the Sonic franchise is here, but they go there and it's actually like my fucking screenplay being acted out by Jim Carrey and Sonic played by that bloke from Parks and Rec.
You know, I think people would like pay attention to it even if it's terrible. What about you?
The actual price for being a wildly successful novelist is only your debut novel is fucked by having to be Charles Martinet. And it's like, well, I can live with that. That's one book out the way.
And then I am a wildly successful novelist. I can continue enjoying the fruits of that career. Also as a wildly successful novelist, it's all about you, your front and centre.
You get to do the interviews, you're on TV. When is the screenwriter ever on a fucking TV thing?
Well when an author is ever really on TV, that's got to be like a tiny handful of people that go on the TV.
Yeah, that is true. Maybe this speaks more to the fact that I go and see a lot of book talks and everything and I'm very envious of people who get to do that. But I think having one odd quirk, which is that Charles Martinet is reading my debut novel in The Voice of Wario, is not the worst deal for what I assume is going to be a very comfortable life of doing book festivals and signings.
Basically I get to be Richard Osmond for the rest of my life. All I had to do is occasionally answer questions where people are like, what was up with that first book and the audio book being Wario? That was weird.
And I'm like, yeah, but you like the second and third books, right? And then that's fine.
No one ever talks about the fact that the Thirsty Murder Club was actually read in a Wario voice. But that's true. If you go and find that on Audible, you'll...
And also, I just... I think it's a bigger taint to have your work enacted out by Sonic characters than it is to have Charles Martin voice it in Wario because...
It becomes a debacle at a certain point, doesn't it?
Also, I mean, the only good thing is if you wrote a film that was acted out by Sonic, it's the only chance the Sonic characters have of ever being in anything quality, truly crude quality. I wouldn't want to do them that favour because I don't want people seeing my film and then off the back of that going, oh, I might play Sonic Frontiers because I really liked Sonic in that excellent film. I'd be like, no, no, no, I don't want to do that favour for them.
So it's got to be the book and the Wario thing.
Yeah, just maybe think about, you know, if you did like have to recast classic films with Sonic, let's say Phantom Thread, right? And you've got, you know, sort of like, instead of Daniel Day Lewis, you've got Knuckles, right? And there's no world in which that's good.
And people will be like, oh, do you remember how Paul Thomas Anderson was doing great making like these incredible films until he did that. And then, you know, it was about Knuckles being slowly poisoned by his wife, played by Cream the Rabbit.
And Jim Carrey playing the Leslie Manville part.
Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, I also like the idea that usually Knuckles has been roped into this. Like a franchise has not worked on it two decades, but it's like, yeah, sorry, sorry, old Knuckles, man.
You got to be doing, you're in charge of this whole debacle now. OK, I think we've answered that one with the sort of a level of attention and detail that it deserves, Matthew. So next question.
What's the most 10 out of 10 game from Guildia 44?
There's a very short question, and I feel like it's something we talked about before, but something that kind of like fits the 10 out of 10 perfectly would be something like Breath of the Wild for me, Matthew.
Yeah, that's what I put.
Yeah, I think that is it. I think that is the answer. Like it's the moment in which it was launched, you know, and what it represented for the series, what it represented for the open world game.
It's like, you know, it's a stellar example of sort of like gaming its own series, but also changed a genre, was influential in some ways, it's not in all the ways I would like it to be, but a very, very important game, and just feels like the easiest 10 out of 10 to justify. Yeah.
And sets us up for the 11 out of 10, that is Tears of the Kingdom as we both agree. Yeah, I'd agree with that. Just on a moment to moment basis, it's one of the few games, I think, even if you put the controllers down and just like look at it and listen to it, that's still probably a 10 out of 10 experience for me.
Like I just like that the vibes are so strong. That's definitely the one which I have to sort of justify the least, I think.
That's even like in, you know, relative to the ones like the games I have given 10 out of 10 over the years, like, you know, G2-5, G2-4 or Mass Effect 2. I think those are all the 10s I gave out. Those in their time were quite easy to justify, but I think Breath of the Wild are still easier to justify than any of those are.
So, yeah. Okay. Next question then, Matthew.
Off the back of alternately loving slash raging at Capcom's action strategy hybrid, Konnitsu Gami, which genre mashups do you think work well? Which not so well? Which mashups haven't been tried yet that you think might work?
That's some balladeer.
I think the ultimate genre mashup of all time is Persona.
Oh, great shout.
Monster catching, dungeon crawling RPG with social sim. It's a pitch that when you first hear it, you think, oh, I wonder what that's going to be. Or maybe I'm not even interested in either of those genres, but I think they not only go really well together, I think they make their respective genres seem much more interesting.
You know, like it actually gives me the impetus to play a social sim that I might not have in a standalone one, if that makes sense. It's not a thing I would probably be interested in, but being able to see the tangible rewards in the other half of the game. I think that is the one, the main one, really, for me.
Yeah, my main one here was, I would say, like the most recent XCOM games, where there is that... I don't know if you... Maybe you wouldn't count this, but I would say that the strategy and tactical layers are quite distinct from each other in that game.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Definitely one is more detailed than the other. Like, on the ground combat, it's more detailed than the other. But they both matter, and you can...
You know, if you fuck one up, then you'll fuck the other up. So I think those two, that does come to mind. They're very elegantly put together.
They also manage to make those elements work well if you had a controller for the XCOM, for XCOM I Know Me Unknown and XCOM 2, because, you know, it was an old school PC series they were bringing back. So yeah, that comes to mind. But I think Persona is a really great example, Matthew.
I can't top that. Would Ninja Golf make the...
Oh, that was just about to say. My second pick is Ninja Golf on the Atari 7800, which of course mixes together a highly detailed golf simulator and a pulse pounding ninja action game as you run to hit your ball a second time. No, that's ass.
Speaking of golf, I did quite like that golf roguelike thing that Liam Edwards made. Cursed Golf.
What the golf was it?
Yeah.
Oh, Cursed Golf, sorry.
Yeah, I thought that was... I thought, you know, of the take a thing and make it a roguelike, the actual idea of no shot in this game will ever be repeated because of the nature of the courses or the unique power-ups you've been given makes every shot count in a way that does mimic golf. I thought that was kind of neat.
Were there any shot in the mashups where you were like, that's pure ass?
I'm not pure ass, but I really hated Dave the Diver, which we talked about. And that's a game that tries to do a lot of different things, many more gameplay mechanics than I ever reached. I think we talked about the idea of good compulsive versus bad compulsive on previous episodes.
And I talked about why Bellatro is good compulsive, because you are still learning things about what it is, even on the runs that you fail, and it doesn't feel like a waste of time for the majority of the time you played it. Whereas I felt a demonic hand at work in Dave the Diver being like, don't you want to do this? Don't you want to do that?
Isn't it? Don't you think you should do this? It felt like the game was trying to force me to have compulsive behavior.
And I thought, I think that's bad game design. I don't like it. So that came to mind as one that doesn't work so well.
The other one that I would say that I quite like and I do want to give a shout out was Yoku's Island Express, which was kind of like a bit of platformer Metroidvania vibes, but it's like a pinball game as well. And also developed by Jens Anderson, who worked on Indiana Jones, The Great Circle. I talked to him about this game a little bit, at DEVELOP this year.
So that's a pretty cool Team17 game. Don't know if Ash worked on that one, but yeah, that kind of comes to mind. Have you got any that don't work so well, Matthew?
I haven't played it in a long time, so maybe I've got the shape of this wrong. But I remember thinking that I really hate Battalion Wars, the third person version of, I guess, Advance Wars on the GameCube and the Wii, where it has like a higher strategy level. But I was trying to remind myself of how that strategy level like manifests itself.
I don't think it's literally like a top down map that you're moving units around, but there was definitely like a higher level strategy, but you were also responsible for playing as an individual unit on the battlefield in like not a very nice feeling third person shooter. It may just be, it's a third person shooter with like quite advanced, like platoon command controls on the D-pad. That might be the shape of it, but whatever that game was, I remember that being bad, which might be a bit of a random drive-by on a game, which isn't ultimately a genre mash-up.
Take that, Kuju, RIP.
Yeah, I just, I thought it was a bit, a bit rancid. Another good one, of course, is the collision of Phoenix Wright and Professor Layton in their 3DS game. We get a little bit of a Phoenix Wright game with some Professor Layton kind of weirdness thrown in, and you get some Professor Layton puzzles with a little bit of, well, actually, Phoenix Wright doesn't really affect the puzzles at all, but that's more worlds colliding rather than any particular interesting marriage of genres, but I am fond of that game.
Yeah, I'll throw in one more fun, hybrid one. Dark Cloud and Dark Chronicle on PS2, which were, I mean, fucking rock hard to play now, but I can't say how novel it was to go into a dungeon, get part of a village, and then like literally build it on this, you know, this little town that you were creating and place it where you wanted to go. And it was there and there'd be an NPC there.
And that's, it's just really cool, the idea of like combining very rudimentary city builder with dungeon crawling RPG, nice looking games. They're on PS4, I think you can play on PS5 as well. So if you want to give those a try, they're interesting old level five games.
Yeah, that's actually reminded me of Rune Factory, which is Harvest Moon, but with a bit of dungeon crawling and fighting. So I would say a little bit more exciting and interesting than Harvest Moon, which I always run out of steam in because they're, you know, just farming endlessly. But I think Rune Factory's got a little bit more going on under the hood.
Would you chuck 100 line in here Matthew? Because I know that was a big obsession for you this year.
I guess that is a genre mashup. It's a visual novel meets strategy RPG, but a lot of, you know, like Fire Emblem, that has a big narrative element and a lot of hanging out with characters. So I don't know if it's that unusual.
I think the fact that it's like a 100 hour long visual novel is probably does mark it out as something slightly different. God knows. Am I ever going to finish that game in time for our, you know, it is going in my game of the year list, but like where it should be placed, I haven't quite worked out.
We should get Lucy back on to talk about that, because she's finished it, right? She finished the whole...
Yeah, she's put in the time.
I'd really like to get Lucy back on the pole, actually. Let's do that at some point. That'd be fun to hear about the sort of like how you feel at the end of a journey like that, because it does sound like an absolute year-eating game.
Okay, this next one, Matthew, do you want to read it out?
Hello big lads. I recently played Danganronpa, another episode, Ultra Despair Girls. And although I've been primed for the grottiness of the series by Matthew and been able to handle it okay in the first two games, this game was so gross that it made me feel quite ill with some of the subject matter.
I was wondering if you have any other game series where you'd mostly recommend them except for one entry. Perhaps that one racist resident evil is from Strike Chicken.
I think most series have one or two duff entries in them, don't they? If they last for a long time. Metal Gear 2 is sort of like an interesting game, but I feel like I've seen Tony Ellis on PC Gamer, playthrough MGS3 and heard him talk about it.
And he was talking about how fucking bad the writing was at the end of the game. He was like, he completely bounced off of the last part of that game, despite otherwise really enjoying the actual game of it. And I think he's a bit like, if you didn't grow up with the Hideo Kojima storytelling experience, then being confronted with it when you're like in your 50s is like, you know, for the first time, it's maybe just too much to ask.
And so for most people, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't necessarily say, but I think MGS1 is still an easier recommended, MGS2 for example. But I would say it's like a bad entry in the series. Like it's, I don't even know if I would say that any of the mainline Resident Evil's are bad.
Like I think 6 is a harder recommendation than the other ones. I think 5, the racist one is better than 6, I think. So I think most people will probably agree with that.
It's a very good co-op game, Resident Evil 5. Yeah, sort of like, I guess you got something like Mass Effect where people didn't like Andromeda. I've not, I only played that for four or five hours and it didn't grab me straight away.
But I also, I remember when we did a poll on PC Gamer, we asked the readers, what is, do you think is an example of one of the most underrated or overly hated games of the last few years? And the number one upvoted answer was Mass Effect Andromeda. I genuinely think some people really like that game.
That isn't just like a weird Reddit gets its hand on it.
I don't think so. I think that some people just didn't mind it. But I can't remember what your experience was with it.
Like it's come up before at least once, but‚Ä¶
I don't think it's‚Ä¶ Like it's definitely the weakest of them. But it's maybe like a 7 out of 10 compared to a 9 out of 10.
It's not a total car crash. The characters are quite bad hangs. I don't really like any of the characters in it.
But the alien worlds are quite interesting. There's some pretty stunning environments in it. There's this like ice world where these giant alien whales kind of under the ice that you can see, which I really liked.
I don't know. With this question, I was trying to think of like, are there any where it's not just that they're bad, but they're like insulting in some way or this particular, like the Danganronpa example, Ultra Despair Girls is like the third person shooter Danganronpa. I actually think there are elements of it that are borderline reprehensible.
Maybe I'm being like ungenerous in my reading of it, but I thought some of it was like a little bit paedophili. In a way where I was like, is this actually like super bad, or am I just misunderstanding the scenario? And I looked at, when I remember this coming in the Discord, I remember looking at other reviews and seeing people be like, hey, out of ten, you know, cons, some of the content's a little spicy.
And it's like, I actually thought some of this game was like disgusting. And I'm not like, I am not like prudish about these things. You know, I'm not big into policing games for this kind of stuff.
But, Matthew, I've simply, you've simply got to say what those elements are on this episode, because this guy's alluded to it. You've alluded to it. I need to know what the problematic content, it's a great talking point for this episode, surely.
I mean, to be honest, I've put some of it out of my mind because I dislike it so much. I mean, they're all very young characters, and if I remember it correctly, the villainous people at the heart of them, one of them presents as a very young child, but the way they act is very adult. They're just hypersexualised in their behaviour, like it makes me quite uncomfortable.
I mean, that's really it. It's not anything too clever or interesting. But then I read these reviews and you're like, well, it didn't register with all these people, so maybe I just misread this?
I don't know.
Interesting. Okay. Well, that's probably sort of pro that one enough.
Any others you wanted to throw in here, Matthew?
Devil May Cry 2 is a load of old shit.
Yeah, that is rubbish.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5.
Oh, yeah.
Latter Tony Hawk's is bad, but to have the Pro Skater name and do that. I did wonder, is Hitman Absolution this? I don't know.
Well, I don't know if I would recommend any of the older Hitman games to someone now, anyway. You know, I just say play World of Assassination, right? So I don't want to hold it against Hitman too much.
But yeah, I mean, that definitely was the pariah game for a while, wasn't it?
Yeah. But again, like, it's not quite the same thing. There's not like a...
But there's some films you recommend to people, but you're like, oh, by the way, there's a scene in it that you'd like. I don't like, you know, I'm not saying I think that's good or like, I'm backing the attitude of that scene. I had this with...
Have you ever seen Drop Dead Gorgeous, the documentary about the beauty pageants?
Yeah, we've talked about the podcast a long time ago.
I love that film, but there's one character in it who's just like, that's a stereotype you just can't do anymore.
No, it really jumps out in an otherwise quite smart film.
And I remember saying to Catherine, I was so enthusiastic in my support of it, but then it got to that and it was like, yeah, apart from this bit, I've forgotten about this bit.
That's just watching 90s content now, isn't it really?
Yeah, but that one was particularly rough. So I was like, every bit of this film's funny.
The fact is that every major franchise you can think of has got some shit that uses its name to sell it. Like, it's, Resident Evil's got all those shooters they do every now and then. They do a new, some guys in gas masks shoot each other game.
Like whether it's Operation Raccoon City or Umbrella Tactics, whoever it's called, there's some other game they did a few years ago. And they're never good. No one likes them.
They get three out of ten across the board. They disappear without a trace. And we're all going to get on with our lives.
That happens. But everyone knows that the mainline Resident Evil games are hot shit. So it's all good, really.
But you're not going to think less of someone who recommends you one of those games. You'll just be like, oh, that seems a bit duff.
Yeah, exactly. Let's do two more questions, Matthew. I'll read this one out.
Hi, lads. I just saw the Superman film. And while looking on Spotify for the soundtrack, I came across official playlists put together by James Gunn that are supposed to be the songs the characters from the film would listen to.
Seems like the sort of thing you would hate, Matthew. If you two were major characters in a film as yourselves, what songs would be on your playlist?
Oh, God. I actually missed this question. What did you pick as he desperately scrambles to come up with some songs?
Well, then all this is really asking us, what are your favorite songs, isn't it? Like, it's not, like it's, you know, that's the point, right? I mean, it's, the Superman example is interesting because they are fictional characters, so he has to think, James Gunn has to think, what would Lex Luthor listen to?
I think he would listen, by the way, he would listen to everything. What's that fucking, Subblu, Irresistible? He'd listen to that.
Anything from the American Psycho soundtrack, I think he would listen to that basically. But that's not the answer to the question. I mean, fucking all my favorite songs of all time are really obvious.
I enjoyed The Silence by Depeche Mode, New Order, what would New Order be? True Faith probably by New Order. You know, just very, very obvious ones really that come to mind.
Yeah, so yours are probably fucking Randy Newman.
Yeah, Randy Newman of Divine Comedy and a bit of Ben Folds. I mean, it's not like a rip-roar of an answer. I've recently, just to throw in something of note, so this isn't a bust, I've been trying to build a little music quiz to test out on you, at some point, where I've noticed a lot of songs I like sound a little bit like they could be tracks from 3D Mario games, like the vibe of the music, the sort of synthy vibe, a lot of 80s stuff.
A lot of them sound like they could specifically be water levels from a Mario game, so I've been building this little playlist of levels of songs that I think sound like Mario 3D levels, which I'll test on you at some point. But at the same time, I'm absolutely obsessed with this playlist that I'm building. I listen to it all the time.
It's become one of my favourite collections of music, and they all sound like slightly off-key underwater levels in Mario 64.
Is this going to be the live stream as you get me to listen to this music and guess live?
I need more though, because at the moment there's... I was trying it on a couple of people saying, do you think this sounds like a Mario level? And some of them people are like, oh, absolutely, I 100% see it.
And some of them, they're like, well, that's obviously like a David Bowie song. I'm like, oh, OK. So I need to kind of work on it a bit more.
Yeah, I get you. I would say that on every album by Everything But The Girl, there's at least one track that sounds like it could be from Persona when you're either in the school or you're in the sort of town somewhere. So there's a track, there's a hyper specific example of this, but the opening notes of a song called Hatfield 1980, which is on a later Everything But The Girl album.
I hear that and it's pure like I can imagine back streets of Tokyo in a Persona game listening to that. So I mean, I could try and do this back to you as well. And it could be one of those like episode ideas or like, you know, it's skits that goes completely wrong.
But might be a laugh in the moment. Something for us to think about.
Yes, but anyway, that's what I'm currently listening to. So yeah, I'll tell you what I'm really getting into at the moment is pre-Fab Sprout.
All right. I don't know much about that.
I think off the back of like talking about them on one of the GTA episodes, because I thought one of their songs would make a good track for a radio. Yeah, I just got the algorithm started serving me a lot of it. Some great stuff there and some very Mario sounding tracks as you'll eventually find out.
I'm afraid I'm still in my sort of like club mix era of listening to music. So it's like a lot of a state of trance and, you know, anyone who's kind of vaguely familiar with this kind of music, will know what I'm talking about. But a lot of it is club music from the 90s or 90s that the people who listen to it as kids have grown up and like remixed in into different cool stuff.
You sometimes put this in the newsletter and I always click on it because you give them such enthusiastic write-ups where I'm like, oh, this better be amazing. And then I listen to it and I'm like, maybe this isn't my cup of tea, musically.
The funny thing is as well because I think sometimes with those mixes, it's about the journeys. The first track or two you might hate, but then there'll be something in the middle that is life-changingly good. And that always happens with those playlists, I recommend.
There'll be probably four or five songs that I think are very good. And then ten songs that I think are really good, then two that I'm like, that is outstanding. And the mix is really good.
And that's kind of like a way to consume music, I suppose. But yeah, I can't really explain what that is. I don't really get into albums quite in the same way that I used to.
I sort of, for whatever reason, that is kind of how I consume music. Now, I imagine a lot of people are in this boat because of, like you say, Spotify algorithms. You click on a song, then it takes you to a vaguely connected song.
And before you know it, you're listening to Sweet Home Alabama. You're like, how the fuck did I get here? I feel like I started on the other side of the planet.
Have you played the new Lumines demo?
I think that was the demo I played at Summer Game Fest.
Did you play the level with the two chameleons that lose their shit as the level goes up?
Yes, I did.
When you were talking about that, like the build-up to suddenly hitting the tracks where you're like, those are the two I'm really into. I just pictured you and those chameleons going mental. That's very much the vibe you conjured.
Well, it's funny because this is something very specific came to mind recently, because of Lumen as Arise and because also The Rites to Child of Eden, which was published by Ubisoft but made by Q Entertainment, were acquired by Atari, I believe it was. Those games are presumably, that game is going to come back in some form. That's like a lost, like res-like, rhythm action shooter game.
That was originally made a little bit with Kinect and PlayStation Move in mind, but it's obviously really good on a controller as well. And that reminded me, there's like a track by, I think it's Mizuguchi's band, The Genki Rockets. They've got that track on No More Heroes I've talked about before, Heavenly Star.
That's really good. But they've also got a track called Starline, Stratos mix that's on Child of Eden. I fucking adore.
And so I can't wait for that game to come back just so I can play the level that I remember has that in it, because the game is not otherwise backwards compatible. But that I remember like around 2010, 2011 time when that game came out, that song was like, I probably listened to it like 400 times. I was so into that.
Just going full chameleon mode.
We should definitely talk about Lumines and Depth when that comes out, because I just, yeah, like I missed the boat on Tetris Effect when that came along. And I know that you historically are not a huge, like Lumines, the game guy. So I think that would be a really good meeting of our interests.
So PSP Core kind of like rhythm action game. So I look forward to that. Last question then Matthew, and perhaps the most important question of the episode.
Two Mrs. Gigantes, which individual serving cake, perhaps on the Mr. Kipling range, would you most desire as a full birthday cake size version? That's from Laurie.
Uh, a big Bakewell slice, probably.
That's what I got. Yeah, that's a good shout. That's a good shout.
I think I could probably eat half a kilo of Angel Slice before I finally like collapse.
So the problem with Angel Slices is I went through a period where I got into them in a big way. This is like, this is years ago, pre probably knowing Catherine, even. I ate so many of those things in my bachelor lifestyle, like in one, you know, I ate like boxes of them at a time and made myself really sick, gave myself like a version therapy for Angel Slices.
So now the idea of them, I'm like, oh, I just couldn't, like, if you had that as your birthday cake, I could not go to that birthday party.
Yeah, I mean, I had a birthday party in the time I've lived in Bath, but you know, it's a funny idea. The one time I do, I've got this cake.
I mean, you and me and a giant Angel Slice.
Or no one else. The caffin's not even there. That's tough.
Yeah. I mean, I always know I'm going to get podcasting gold when I hear something like, the problem with Angel Slices is, and they're like, and I'm like, we're in the zone here. We did it.
We achieved everything we set out to do.
You know, took us a bit of time. See, this is what Steve Martin should have hung around for.
Yeah, Steve Martin's favourite version of this podcast would be like 40 minutes long. You know, that would be his preferred version.
You don't know how many listeners are nodding along to that thought right now.
No, I bet those listeners are just like me, where you probably have a certain amount of washing up or laundry or similar to do, and this podcast has filled just enough of that time for you to be like, yeah, good product. I am pleased with the output here. And hey, no one ever says the mailbag is the peak of The Back Page.
They just make life a little bit easier in between playing 90 Atari games or what other bullshit we get roped into. Speaking of which, we've got two fun Patreon episodes coming up in the next few months. So we've got doing two giant men play some old NES games, that's coming in October.
It's very similar to what we just did with Atari, but we're going to play everything on Nintendo Switch Online's NES selection, and then we'll play a couple more besides too. That'll be a fun little episode in the vein of that Dreamcast one I mentioned earlier. And something we thought you'd give us some proper notice for is that we're going to do an episode all about the Marrow Galaxy games, both of them, because they're being re-released on Nintendo Switch.
Obviously, in early October, we're going to do an episode on that in November for our Excel tier. So look forward to those, Matthew. Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzillpesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both of those. The podcast is our Back Page pod.
patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us. And we'll be back next week with the best games of 2017. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
