Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. My name is Matthew Castle, and I am not joined today by Samuel Roberts, as he's away at Summer Games Fest rubbing shoulders with Geoff Keighley and other people who aren't Geoff Keighley, I would imagine. So instead you've just got me.
Well, I tell a lie, you've also got a very special guest. I've enlisted my old future colleague, Geraint Evans, who used to work on N64, NGC and Gamesmaster Magazine, to come in and tell me some stories about the good old days, and also tell me about what it's like working on the other side of the fence, as he's now the head of publishing at PQube. He's got a great story about Mad Dog McCree, which is I think the first time I've ever said that on this podcast, or maybe anyone has ever said on any podcast.
We also talk about what it's like to cover video games consoles at launch. As the Switch 2 came out yesterday, I thought it would be fun to talk about the madness and excitement that surrounds those events. So I hope you can tear yourself away from your shiny new Switch 2 for a couple of hours in order to listen to this episode.
And Sammy will be back next week for our thoughts on the Switch 2. But for now, here's Geraint, enjoy the chat!
Hello, Geraint, thank you for joining us on the podcast. How are you?
I'm very well, thank you. It's nice to hear your voice again. It's been a good while.
Yeah, we were just chatting about the last time we met in person. Might have been at Gamescom, maybe even pre-COVID, though that sounds mad.
It could well have been. It may have even been an EGX, I think, because we've had the habit of kind of bumping into each other at either of those two shows. And neither of us ever having enough time to speak properly, so it's nice to finally actually get to sit down with you.
There'll be a panicked exchange of texts as I try to grab five minutes of your time and you're always very busy because, well, for the last, I don't know how many years, ten years maybe, you've been at these shows in your games publishing capacity. So it feels wasteful to waste an interview slot or a time slot on hanging out with me when you've got important journalists to be schmoozing.
No, it's a pleasure to speak to you. Because like I said, obviously we worked together for such a long time. And yeah, like you said, it's been, I think I've been at PQube for maybe 12 years or so and obviously worked at different companies a little bit before that.
So I think I left the future maybe 2009, 2010. So yeah, it has been a good while.
A long old time. Well, we got a lot to chat about as I've hopefully set this episode up in the intro. I wanted to chat to you about your Nintendo Magazine days, a little bit about Gamesmaster.
I thought we'd maybe try and talk a little bit about covering console launches if you can remember back to those golden days.
Yeah, definitely. I think the time is good.
And a little bit about what you've been doing since, because it's super exciting. Yeah, I will say, obviously, I read the Nintendo Mags growing up, so I was always super familiar with you before I ever met you. But I don't think we ever have chatted about pre future days and like growing up and getting into games and stuff.
So I really wanted to kick off with that and talk me through the gaming life of young Geraint. What was your gaming history? What were your founding texts?
I mean, my probably my earliest gaming memory for sure is I can remember my father bringing home an old Spectrum 48K, the rubber keyed one, and I probably would have been around four or five years old, I think, at that time. And I think it was primarily for my brother, who was a couple of years older than me. And he kind of seemed less interested in it.
And I can remember my dad setting it up in the living room and kind of being in awe of this device, which would allow me to manipulate things on a TV screen, because before that, it was just something that you kind of sat and looked at in your living room. And for the first time, it was something that you could you could kind of manipulate. And I remember, certainly to begin with, we didn't have that many games at the time, but it came with like a booklet that you could type out basic code, basically.
So Namer Brother just used to just type out the code that was in it and then run those programs was my kind of my first contact with it. And there was a couple of programs in there which would let you move an object around a screen at the most basic level. So it's almost like a basic programming tutorial, basically, which just came in a book that came with a machine.
And from that moment on, I'd kind of fallen in love with gaming. And then obviously as time went on, then we started to play things like Manic Miner and Chucky Egg together in the living room. And it became effectively my favorite pastime from that point on.
And then as I kind of got older and you kind of mix with friends in school and stuff, I kind of dabbled with the NES, of course. And then the first kind of major console that we had at home would have been the Mega Drive. And I think that just kind of cemented my love for video games even further.
So that was the kind of the driving force. And then I was lucky enough my step-brother at the time had a Super Nintendo as well.
Oh, both in one house. That's quite rare.
Yeah. So we were quite lucky to kind of have access to both the Nintendo side and the Sega side. But growing up, I was probably more of a Sega fan, I think, than I was Nintendo, even though obviously I had access to and I kind of appreciated both.
So those were my kind of formative years. And then for a while in the background as well, because of my dad's work, he would bring home PCs on a regular basis and he'd bring home a different PC pretty much most weekends, obviously for his own work. And then also like a stack of pirated games from Monkey Island to Doom and Wolfenstein and Catacombs Abyss and all of these kinds of things.
So I also had like an underbelly of PC gaming as well, albeit not something that we owned, but something that my father would bring back. And I can remember, like we'd wait eagerly for him to come back on a Friday night. And if he didn't have a PC with him, both me and my brother would kind of be crossing him for not delivering the goods for the weekend.
Dad is bad this weekend. We don't love dad this weekend.
He's not brought a PC back with him. And like he'd never bring any speakers with him either. So we'd always play all of these games in total silence.
Oh, how abstract. Yeah, it's really weird. So in some cases, I can remember like playing games for the first time, playing Doom for the first time, this sound like months and months and months after having experienced it in silence was mind blowing.
So all through my childhood, really, we had regular access to a whole range of games either because of the consoles that we owned or just because of my dad's kind of enthusiasm for computing and his willingness, I think, to kind of furnish us with games, which was lovely, really. And to that point, I'd kind of had a real kind of encyclopedic knowledge, I think, of games which I think not many people had access to, I think.
Yeah, that's interesting because, you know, we've talked to a lot of people over the years on the podcast about their years, and, you know, some people were super into a platform which they then went on to cover on a platform-specific magazine, but very few people who were lucky enough to get that kind of grounding in everything. Were you actually reading games mags back then? Like, were you interested in that side of things?
Yeah, I was. Were you kind of like finding your way through it?
I mean, pretty much from an early age. I mean, I remember buying your Sinclair for the first time, and it had like a cover-mounted tape on it. So that was again, it was just kind of easy access to more video games to play.
And I absolutely loved that magazine, like wholeheartedly. And the thing that struck me the most about it at the time was even though I enjoyed playing the games, I used to read your Sinclair from cover to cover, like every single page, every single caption. And it used to genuinely make me laugh out loud in my bedroom.
And I fell in love with that magazine as much for the process of reading it, as I did the fact that it was covering video games. In fact, it was probably more really for the quality of the writing, I think, at that time than it was anything else. And I then kind of went on to read, like Me Machines again was another real big favourite of mine.
It kind of flirted a little bit with the likes of CVG and a little bit with Superplay at that time. But I just kind of fell in love with the process of reading about video games and good writing. And it kind of made quite a big impact to my schooling as well at that point.
I was kind of indifferent about studying and things like that. And I really enjoyed, well, reading about video games, but also kind of employing a lot of the stuff that I was reading and in my own writing at the time when I was in school. So it kind of kickstarted a desire to write as much as it did for me to play video games.
So in the back of my mind, even at that age, even when I was kind of 10, 11, 12 years old, the idea of writing about video games kind of featured very heavily, I think, in terms of my kind of aspirations, I think.
I like the idea of every school essay ending with like a score and a rating for longevity and just the language of it folding in.
It's not really that far from the truth. I can remember going through a period of writing in a specific way and my English teacher saying, no, it's nice that you're trying to be creative, but like you're being way too kind of woke up in everything that you're ever about to say.
Oh, right.
It kind of definitely rubbed off on me. I think Rich Pelley's probably got a lot to answer for in terms of how I ended up writing my school essays. But yeah, it was really important part of my life growing up.
I think reading about video games as much as playing them.
No, I felt very much the same way and I was actually a little bit mortified when I first joined NGamer because I'd been at university for three years writing quite dry academic essays. And there was still like a kind of like aftershock of that writing style in my writing. And I can remember the screener being like, this is a bit like, it's a bit dry.
It's a bit academic. I think he actually said it's a bit like Edge magazine, which was like not at all, you know, NGamer and NGC and N64 and Superplay before it, you know. So trying to kind of get that out of my system.
And yeah, I really looked up to people who wrote those magazines. So kind of wanting to fit in and everything. So it sounds like you had good training for this.
So was it something like you had in mind? Like, did you think, you know, I want to do this for a living?
Certainly when I was younger, it definitely was, you know, I used to kind of make my own games magazines as a kid, you know, with online day for paper, with with Biro drawings and that kind of thing. So at that age, it was definitely something that I wanted to do. And I think as kind of time goes on when you, you know, when you finish school and you go to university, I'd kind of forgotten about it a little bit.
I was still playing video games, of course, and it was still in the back of my mind as being something, but it's one of those things where you never really believe that it's a real job that you're going to get, right? It feels like a very kind of pie in the sky kind of ambition. And when I left university, I was very sort of clear in my mind for you that the only thing I knew loads about was video games.
And the only thing that I could genuinely say kind of hand on heart that I was reasonably good at was writing.
What did you do at university?
I did literature, art, history and culture. So it was books and paintings and theater basically. So a lot of essay writing.
But when I left, I moved back to Bristol, which was a city that I really enjoyed and that I had fond memories of growing up in. So I just kind of like anybody else that graduates, right? I ended up getting a job in an accounts department in a hotel, which was like awful.
And then I went to go work at a publishing company that kind of wrote magazines about industry like shop blasting or agriculture or whatever. And I actually worked in the sales, in the ad sales team when I went there. And it was just the most awful job I've ever had.
Like, you know, people talk about toxic masculinity and things like that. But it was that, that is worst. You know, the ad sales floor was just a real grim place to be.
And I stuck it out for maybe three or four months. And I kind of looked around me when I had my headset on thinking, like, what on earth am I doing in this place? So I just stood up and walked out and just like got my headset, put it on my boss's desk and just said, this isn't me, I'm out.
So I just walked out of the job, which is quite unlike me to do that kind of thing. At that age, it wasn't really the sort of move that I would usually pull. And I can remember leaving going, my dad is going to absolutely kill me when he finds out I've just walked out of a job.
But so I walked out of that job.
No more PCs at the weekend for you.
Yeah, exactly. So obviously I didn't have a job, so I only had maybe like four or five weeks worth of money left. And so I walked out of the job, immediately went to the pub and met my friend.
I said, I've just left my job. She said, well, we'll go and we'll look on the internet, we'll see if we can find you something. So I went back to his flat and the first thing I saw was an advertisement that said, do you know your Pikachu from your Pingu?
And asking for a 200 word review of my choice, of a game of my choice and to send it into future publishing, which I did. So I wrote a review for Street Fighter Alpha 3 and then sent it off. And then I kind of forgot about it really.
And maybe about a month after that, I got a call from Marcus Hawkins, who was working on a magazine called Nintendo World at the time, like a kid's Nintendo mag. So I went in for that and interviewed, I thought, you know, reasonably well. And then in true future style, I just didn't hear back from them for like four months.
I was like, well, you know, that's that, that's that, that's over. And eventually he got back in touch and gave me a job on Nintendo World. So that's how I kind of got my foot in the door, so to speak.
And more through luck than anything else. I think if I hadn't walked out of that job on that day, then, you know, I could quite easily have missed that that opportunity. But there it was, you know, sometimes I guess you make your own luck and that was the beginning of it.
And you did know your Pikachu from your ping-pong.
I did. I absolutely did. Although quite why I wrote a Street Fighter review for Nintendo.
That's quite hardcore for Nintendo World.
But there we go. So, I mean, it obviously worked and that was the that was the beginning of my games career really.
Because it wasn't aimed at me. I never actually read Nintendo World, so no sight on it. What was it like as a magazine and going on to do other magazines aimed at maybe a more traditional kind of older audience?
What were the big differences there?
I think it was a good entry point because it was quite easy. And to be honest, at the point at which I joined, I was so astonished that I was even in the building. Do you know what I mean?
Like it was something that I really wanted to do with a great deal of passion. And so I was kind of dumbstruck really that I was actually walking into that building every day and writing about video games. So it was just pure joy more than anything.
And obviously because it was skewed quite young, there was kind of less scrutiny, I think, in terms of what I was writing and how I was writing. I was just enjoying myself and playing Pokemon and writing about Jigglypuff and playing Perfect Dark in my lunch breaks. And at the time I was thinking, wow, this is great.
And it was quite a small magazine, so I think it only had like 80 odd pages in it. It was like a saddle-stitched kind of kids mag basically. And there wasn't, you know, the amount of copy wasn't the densest.
Do you know what I mean? Like it was all kind of quite light-hearted. So I didn't really feel much pressure, I think.
I could just go and my boss Marcus Hawkins at the time was just a really lovely editor and really nice guy. So I kind of eased into future life quite gently, I think. And we were actually, we were kind of segregated from the rest of the games magazines because I was in what was effectively the basement of Seven Dials.
I didn't even know it had a basement.
And everybody else was on the top floor. Well, it wasn't quite, as he went in through the door, it was just like a tiny little office on the right-hand side and then all of the magazines were upstairs. I only really had contact with the people that were working on that magazine, so we were kind of somewhat isolated from the rest of future.
So it was kind of quite a nice gentle intro basically to that environment.
Amongst that team, given that it was slightly isolated from the rest of it, did you have a good standard of perfect arc or did you run circles around people?
No, I mean I remember playing stuff like Chirrock 2 in particular just being absolutely dreadful at it compared to everybody else. But yeah.
Surely you didn't cover Chirrock 2 in Nintendo World.
We did, yeah. We covered Chirrock. It was mostly all Pokémon because at the time obviously that was becoming huge.
So there was definitely a pressure to double down on Pokémon.
I like that it's Pokémon and the Cerebral Ball. Like just those two things, just supposed.
So yeah, we covered everything. I think perfect arc. I think the time was an 18 if I'm not mistaken as well.
So yeah, there was no kind of restrictions in terms of the kind of content and the games that we were covering.
Oh, nice. Well, it's good to know that you were sort of warping young girls back there from an early age. Did you go from Nintendo World to N64?
What happens there? What's the sort of... How do you enter the sort of then unofficial Nintendo, that fat sort of lineage of magazines?
I think the threat of redundancy, I think, was there. Because after about, I want to say five or six months, if I can remember it, they decided to shut the magazine down because obviously the circulation was pretty poor. And there was me and a guy called Mike Jenkins who were working on that, with the staff writers on that magazine.
And I think Mike Jenkins went off to work online for Daily Radar, which is now obviously Games Radar. And I can remember Andrew Ball coming down to the office and saying, Oh, can I have a quick word with you? So he went for a cup of coffee around the corner.
So she asked me some personal questions and stuff about my aspirations and things like that. And then effectively asked me to join N64 Magazine, which at the time was kind of quite a scary thing because I'd read the magazine through university and obviously liked it very much. And like so many people knew who Martin Kitts was and who Mark Green was and who Jazz and Tim Weaver and all these people were.
So I knew of them. But we haven't really crossed powers. I'd made a couple of forays into the N64 office to go and pick up some import Japanese games.
I think I'd gone in there to go and get Kirby and the Crystal Shards. And I can remember being quite intimidated by that space, actually, because obviously I knew who they were. They had obviously no idea who I was.
And going in, you know, cap in hand, going, please, may I borrow some of your import games? We've got stuff to cover. And I can remember feeling quite intimidated.
And obviously, next door to them was Edge and PC Gamer and all of these mags. And I didn't really spend much time up on that floor. So when Andrew had kind of come down and effectively just offered me a job on the magazine, I was once thrilled that I was still going to be writing about video games.
And on the other hand, I was just kind of aware of this magazine that I was going to be going into, and I guess the caliber of the writers that were on it. So I did have a few sleeper nights before I had actually started, and it was quite a scary thing to go into. I guess I would have been 21, 22, I think, at the time.
I absolutely get that. I mean, I remember interviewing for NGamer and being like, oh shit, I'm going to meet greener. That's crazy.
Like I'm going to be interviewed by this person who I've really, really liked in magazines all this time. And I remember sitting in the entrance hall of Future Key House waiting to do my interview. And I think you and Jez walked out together, must have been going to lunch or something.
And I can just remember thinking like, oh shit, it's them. It may sound nerdy and apologies if it sounds like I'm sort of blowing smoke up your ass, but these people are kind of like rock stars to me.
No, absolutely. I totally get it. I had the exact same kind of feeling when I started working there and on N64 specifically, just because I'd read so much of their stuff and I knew exactly who they were and I knew what they looked like and I knew what games they'd reviewed and I knew which reviews that they'd written that made me laugh.
There was already this kind of like precedent for the way in which I had to kind of level up my game, so to speak, once I'd got there.
Right, right.
Because also, you know, working on Nintendo World with all due respect to that magazine, it was so light-hearted and it was so easy to write for and kind of fun and silly, but it was kind of intimidating, I think, to have to go, right, okay, now I'm going to have to actually pull my socks up and start working properly. Yeah. And I remember when I joined, I think it was issue 47, it had Mario Tennis on the cover.
And I think for that first magazine, they didn't really let me write anything. I just kind of had to do little bits and pieces and product reviews like controllers and toys and stuff like that, and write up the tips and stuff like that. So they didn't really get me going until the following issue, where they basically had gone, here's San Francisco Rush 2049, off you go.
And I can remember thinking, okay, great. And I started writing it, had written it, and our production editor, Steve Jalim, at the time, had kind of come back to me with my work printed out. And it was just, it was just red lines all the way through it.
And I can remember thinking, oh my god, I'm like such a fraud. But he was very kind, and he kind of set me on the right path. But yeah, that was quite a brutal blow to go, I think this is actually okay.
And then Steve going, yeah, this is not great. This is unpublishable work. So that was hard.
That was a hard thing to take at the time.
Yeah, I know. I completely get that. That's like absolutely brutal.
Who was the team when you joined N64?
So it was me and Alan Badrill with the staff writers, and Mark Green was there. Jez and Tim Weaver weren't there at the time. Andrew Ball was there as well.
And then obviously the art staff and Steve, the production editor. So Mark Green was there, and I was obviously very much in awe of him. He kind of sat with his back to me most of the time.
Doing endless phone calls with developers. So I didn't really have a huge amount of interaction with him. And kind of where I was sat at the time was with Paul Edwards, the deputy art editor.
So the two of us sat together, and he was actually quite a good, calming influencer, I think. Because he did most of the art web for most of the pages that I did. We ended up striking up quite a good relationship really in terms of what the review should look like and what the box set should be and all that kind of stuff.
So he was very much a kind of a calming influence, I think, when I joined the magazine at that time.
Yeah, I think everyone relies on the kindness of a welcoming art editor at some point.
Yeah, it was. And Andrea was lovely as well, of course. She was very easygoing and she was more kind of production orientated as an editor, less so than some people like Tim Weaver or Jess, who were like super creative on the kind of the mad craft side.
So she was quite nice to work with as well. She kind of helped me kind of navigate that kind of workflow, which was the other big thing for me was just, oh my God, there is so much stuff to write here on a monthly basis. And that part of it was quite intimidating.
Obviously, like N64 was famous for those like epic reviews, blowouts where it was, you know, the review was maybe 10% of it and then it was pages and pages of box-outs. It was basically like a sort of impromptu guide for the whole game. Did you, like, do you remember having to do one of those for the first time or really dig into that kind of stuff?
Yeah, it was. I remember doing, I think it might have been the same issue that I did the San Francisco Rush 2049 review was, they'd give me a copy of 2-Up 3, I think. And they said, here's 2-Up 3, you've got eight pages to fill, of tips this was as well, off you go.
And I can remember thinking, oh my god, like how do I even begin? And that was probably more of a baptism of fire, I think, than my first review. And I think what that exercise taught me more than anything was just how to brutally deconstruct a game and kind of pick every last bone out of it.
Because you know you've got to fill those eight pages. So you have to kind of meticulously know the game, understand the game, and come up with ideas as to how to fill those pages in a kind of creative and interesting way. And I found it really difficult, but it was probably the single best exercise joining that magazine to go, here's something which is not great.
We need you to milk it for everything it's worth. And I did. And it kind of served me well, I think, going forward, because it was something that I had to get used to quickly.
And as you know, I joined at the end of the N64's life cycle. So it was kind of slim pickings when it came to creating readable content, right?
Yeah.
So yeah, I mean, it kind of set me up really for the next kind of year, where I was just trying to find entertainment out of a very small amount of entertaining things that we could cover.
Which was harder, the box-out scene on N64 or the box-out scene eventually on Gamesmaster?
Oh, gosh. I think, I mean, the good thing, I think, about working on any Nintendo Mag is, like a lot of the games that are on it, certainly the first-party stuff is so good, and there's so much depth to a lot of them, whether it's a Mario or a Zelda or a F-Zero or whatever it is. But actually, like creating box-outs and stuff for those games is quite easy because they have enough depth to actually carry it, right?
Yeah.
Whereas something like Gamesmaster, if somebody came to you and said, hey, we've got NHL 2003, can you write eight pages on it? Like that's a tough one to do.
You mentioned that you're there towards the end of the N64. Can you remember what the vibes around Nintendo were?
There was definitely optimism for the future, for sure. Because I think in the issue that I joined was just on the cusp of Dolphin not being called Dolphin anymore and being confirmed. I think we may even have had initial pictures of the GameCube at that point with the old controller before they changed the buttons.
So I think there was this awareness that this really cool thing is coming. And I think we actually knew that stuff like Luigi's Mansion was a thing. Obviously, we hadn't played it or seen very much of it at all.
So there was definitely enthusiasm for the future. So a lot of the content we were doing was around that in terms of the first half of the magazine. But also in line with that, most of the new N64 games that were coming through were not great.
So there was a lot of kind of, I don't know, Daffy Ducks, Platforming Adventures 3, or whatever. There's a lot of that kind of stuff that we had to kind of like limp to the finish line with. But there was also some good stuff.
I remember like Conker's Bad Fur Day was a thing that was around at that time. And obviously, we did a lot of coverage of that. I think Banjo 2 wasn't quite out at that point.
So, there was still a lot to go at. And obviously, you could still do stuff on Perfect Dark and things like this. So, from my point of view, it was fine.
I was working in games and I was playing stuff that I enjoyed. There was kind of good things on the horizon in terms of GameCube. I think GBA was also on the cusp of coming out as well.
I think GBA might have come out maybe four or five months after I joined. And that was like another rich scene of exciting stuff to talk about. And that's been a common thread, I think, for all the Nintendo magazines that I had worked on.
Whereas you still had going through the console life cycle of launch and then the demise of a console. But also the handhelds were ever present. And I actually found that part of the work actually quite exciting in and of its own right.
So there was a richness to those magazines just because effectively they both had two consoles to cover.
Did you really enjoy being a staff writer? Or were there other roles down the line that you enjoyed more? Because I often think back on it as some of the most fun I ever had in terms of the amount of writing I got to do, the amount of stuff I got to kind of interact with, but also a general lack of responsibility, which was quite fun and quite stress free.
Also particularly in these magazines, like the staff, they're so characterful, this lineage of Nintendo magazines, and the staff writer was so present in them. The running jokes, and often getting dragged in to like nonsense or comedy box outs or back pages or whatever. Did you enjoy that side of it?
I did. To be honest, I mean, all of my time at Future, really, I absolutely loved. And like you said, as a staff writer, you have a lot more freedom, you know, once you start getting to kind of editor and dep editor, you need to start having some kind of commercial awareness about what needs to go on the cover and why, and what makes a good cover line and all these kinds of things.
So as a staff writer, you don't have to worry about any of that stuff. You don't even have to worry about, you know, I need to contact this person to make sure this review code comes in on time. So you're kind of just given games to sit down and play and write about and then, you know, inevitably you kind of write the tips guides and stuff like that.
So I did, I loved the freedom of it, and I loved having the time to kind of find a voice, which as we said before, kind of takes a little bit of time to kind of grow into a role and a character.
Do you think you can describe what your character or mag persona was?
It's hard, I think, because I think a lot of it was dictated by Tim Weaver and later on.
This is what I was going to ask, just because you joined when Tim wasn't on the mag, are you waiting to be anointed at a later time, or how does that work?
I think it's a gradual process. Andrea was much more kind of process driven, right? Let's make sure this magazine comes out on time, which is fine.
And it was probably a good grounding for me at that point. And I think once Tim had come in, he was a lot more kind of forthright in terms of how he wanted a magazine to be and what people's kind of caricatures would be. And he would kind of dictate, I suppose, the mood of the office really, and not in a negative way, like purely in a positive way.
And he would kind of know there'd be kind of banter in the office and like jokes made about everybody within the office space. And then those jokes then kind of went into print and those kind of characters were formed. So I didn't actually mind it at all.
And it was just a lot of fun because everybody was kind of subject to the same kind of weaverisms, I guess, as we work together. But it was such a joyous place to work. And like every day was when you weren't working to deadlines, the office was always filled with laughter.
There was never really any, other than the stress of trying to get something out on time. And you got a lot of pages to write and the work has to be done. But I just remember it being like my days filled with laughter.
And in some cases not really wanting to go home. Do you know what I mean? Like there were games to play and there was stuff to write.
And I quite easily have kind of stayed in the office until 6, 7, 8 o'clock at night, just because it was just nice to be there and nice to be in that environment. And nice to be playing video games with people who were just genuinely really lovely. So, yeah, it wasn't as a staff writer, it's perfect, right?
Because, like you said, you don't have any of these stresses and you can just go and enjoy it for what it is.
You were there when it transitioned into NGC, is that right?
That's right, yeah.
What was that like from the inside? Because we've talked a little bit on the podcast before about relaunching and rebranding a magazine and what happens at that point. But yeah, I was always curious what this particular one was like, because they're both very meaningful magazines to me, N64 and NGC.
As a writer, it was weirdly like a slow evolution, because there was a period of time where it was N64, and then obviously the content had well and truly dried up at that point. Then we shifted from N64 to what was basically still N64, but it happened to have an NGC logo on it in the N64 style. I think that period covered maybe four or five months, I think, maybe even more.
Then Tim effectively went away, I think it might even have been Jez Bickham was involved at that point, where they went to a secret office in another building, to then make what would then become NGC, the big format in time for GameCube's launch. A lot of that work was done away from me and Martin and the rest of the team.
Yeah, so you just suddenly find out this is what you're working on now.
Yes, exactly. Then eventually they called us into that office, which was kind of separate from where we were, to go, okay, this is what we're making, this is what we've been working on, which was this kind of huge, like monstrous magazine in terms of page size. Yeah, what did you make of it?
It's just unbelievably exciting at that point. Because with all the best will in the world, you are feeling that the N64 is winding down, and you are kind of struggling for things to cover, and you are doing a lot of leaning on the hand-held side of things to keep things going. And then all of a sudden there is this kind of...
One there was a kind of much bigger kind of console to go after, and a freshen up of the magazine, and new staff as well. I hadn't worked with Jez at that point, so I think that was really my first introduction to Jez as well. So for me it's a massively exciting thing to be a part of.
Yeah, I associate you and Jez sort of quite close in my head for some reason. You know, I know you two are really good friends, and maybe it even just goes back to seeing you guys leaving that building that very first time of like, oh, these, you know. So in my head, you're quite kind of inseparable in this sort of period of like, the magazine's history.
Here's something that I think happened, but I'm curious as to true. You or Jez, some kind of device that shouted at children in the street. Is this a thing?
We did. Jez was editor at the time. He'd made this device, which was basically a big long cardboard tube with just this kind of polystyrene box thing on the end.
And we used to, because there was no air conditioning in the office in those days. So we had to leave all the windows open. So there'd be like kids skateboarding up and down the street.
So Jez had kind of like got this booming device, like extended it out through the window to shout at the children in the street below, stop skateboarding, with it like resonating through the streets of Bath. I guess you'd also then employ, if you were kind of not really doing any work, and you had your back to him, he'd kind of maneuver this cardboard tube and polystyrene monstrosity, so like right next to your ear, and then just boom, work harder! Down the pipe, you would like to scare the living Jesus out of you at the time.
Yeah, he was an interesting guy to have as your boss, but like I said, again, days filled with laughter more than anything else, which is lovely.
Did they refer to the device as the Metatron?
He did refer to it as the Metatron, yeah. In fact, he had a kind of penchant for making things out of cardboard, because in that office environment, you would just be surrounded by toys, right? And equipment and cardboard boxes from stuff that had been sent from publishers and developers and stuff like that.
And so he'd made a cardboard effigy of our publisher at the time. He used to leave halfway through the day, kind of wine bottles clanking in his bag as he left. So one afternoon, he made a cardboard effigy of our publisher, our boss at the time, his boss, and just wheeled it behind his desk for him to find in the morning, which had his face on it.
It actually had the face of Simon Cowell, which he was a dead ringerball, with buttons on it that said imbibe, which were all broken with wine. I mean, how we never got fired, I'll never know.
Was it appreciated?
It was met with a raised eyebrow and a smirk, so he took it in the spirit in which it was intended, thankfully.
There was definitely a robot figure in the magazine. Was that the same thing?
That very same robot then became Gozen, the managing director of Nintendo Europe at the time.
Right.
Which then became the butt of many jokes. I think he appeared on many back pages and various stages through the magazine.
Gobot or something, yes.
Yes, that was it.
Yeah, I loved all that stuff, the weird shit around the edges. I was looking at some old scans of NGC and was laughing at the virtual reality box outs, which used to be like...
Oh, God, yes...
.which was like video game logic, or video game mechanics, if they happened in real life.
If they were real.
They often resulted in the death of you or someone else.
Of me, I think Kitsy photoshopping a lightsaber up my anus, I think, at one point and that kind of thing. Bring it on, Django, you pot-bellied gimp, I think, was the thing from that. But it was...
I mean, a lot of that stuff just came just from the environment that we were in, right? So we were a bunch of 20-something year old guys in an office, doing something that we loved and inevitably, there would be some kind of free time, right? Where you're just kind of messing around with stuff and invariably, all of that stuff that we were joking about and laughing about and kind of jokes in the office would inevitably kind of spill out onto the pages.
And I think that I love the most is that readers would really love it. And then so we'd get correspondence about those things. And there was a, I guess, there was a real feeling of like sharing our day-to-day experience and day-to-day existence and day-to-day joy really in those pages.
And to have people enjoy that and kind of feedback on it and for it to resonate with people was a lovely feeling. And I think that's something that stayed true right from N64 all the way through NGC and actually even into NGamer as well. And that's not an easy thing to do, I don't think, is to kind of have that length of lineage where that kind of joy is carried through for such a long period of time, right?
One thing I wanted to ask you about, I had quite a chip on my shoulder writing about like the really big Nintendo games, so like the Marios and the Zeldas, because they were often series associated with like iconic reviews, you know, like in N64 and NGC, you know, everyone would talk about like, oh the Mario 64 review, the Ocarina of Time review, you know, not just because of the excitement around the games, but just as a piece of writing, they were often like standout pieces. And you've got to review plenty of biggies in your time. I know that I think you did like the first review of Super Mario Sunshine in NGC.
I want to say like a Japanese import review, perhaps. Did you feel similarly about, you know, did you feel yourself, you know, working in the shadow of something that kind of came before?
Yeah, definitely. I think like having read a lot of those iconic reviews pre my working at Future, you know, so like Jez's work on Ocarina of Time, being one that kind of stands out. And so there was a certain amount of pressure there, I think, to make sure it's good and make sure it's funny and make sure people enjoy reading it.
So there was a bit of pressure there. But I think as with all the Nintendo stuff, it was because those games are so good and because I was so enthusiastic for them, they were generally quite easy to write. They didn't really write themselves, but you weren't tackling something which was problematic, or trying to find the right words, because they were always great.
And you would sit down and start playing through it, and you'd go, okay, wow, this is great. This is so much fun. So many standout moments in those games, so many great set pieces and imaginative stages and stuff like that.
So they were generally the easier ones to write, because you could just gush about something for 10 pages. And I quite like that. And also to a certain extent, because they were good and because you knew that there was so much anticipation for those games, then actually readers just wanted to know as much about them as possible.
And for you to share the enthusiasm that they would also have for that once they started playing. So there was a pressure there for sure. More often than not, it was just down to time as well.
Because I think on that Mario Sunshine review, I think I had maybe kind of five days from the minute I got the game into my hand to actually getting it done and in time for deadline. So there's a lot of kind of late nights around it, just making sure that I played it as much as I possibly could. So because obviously you don't really want to do a review of that magnitude only having played like a third of it, right?
Because it you just be exposed to it. So you have to kind of put the work in on that side of things. So I think there was a pressure there for sure.
But I think I enjoyed doing them so much that I never really felt it.
I think specifically Super Mario Sunshine, quite a difficult game getting your head around it for the first time, quite different kind of movement with the jet pack. And I remember playing it in my own time as a punter and getting really stuck at several places because there were just huge difficulty spikes in that game. Do you remember that kind of stuff?
You're pretty good at games, I think, generally.
Yeah, I mean, it was difficult at times. And there are parts of that game which is really, really frustrating. And I did find that at some point it was very difficult to know where you were going to land on occasion as well.
Yeah, yeah.
It's probably not my favourite Mario game, really, on balance. In fact, I've not gone back to it for years. It'll be interesting to see how it holds up now.
But I think, generally speaking, it was kind of fine. There was the pressure of making sure that I got through it and actually wrote a comprehensive review on it. But I think probably the biggest pressure I think I ever felt in that situation was on Metroid Prime when I didn't actually do the review.
I think Jesse's brother, I think, wrote the original album and wrote the original review on that. But I had to write the guidebook for it, which was a 150 page, the book that came sellotape to the cover. So I had agreed to do it and it was a full walkthrough.
Defeat the final boss and collect every tank, every weapon, all the health thing. And this was at a time where, because obviously we had early access to the game. So I couldn't just go on YouTube and look for the solution.
I couldn't go on GameFAQs to find everything. So I actually had to find everything in that game all on my own. And as each kind of passing day was kind of looming towards deadline, and I realized actually I'm a long way from 100%ing this thing, let alone actually writing the guide, right?
Oh my God.
So I could remember, like I must have gone to bed maybe like four, five o'clock in the morning when I actually managed to kind of finish it and write to put the last full stop on a sentence and send everything off to be printed. So that was like really extreme pressure, which I didn't enjoy at all. I mean, it was nice for the opportunity to do it.
And I really liked the game. But by the end of it, I really hated Metroid Prime at that point, because it had very nearly broken me, because there was a very real possibility that I wouldn't find like the last health upgrade, right? And I have no idea where it is.
And obviously you kind of feel honor bound to make sure that you do actually deliver on the promise of a complete guide. So that actually nearly broke me that process of doing that.
We recently did a Patreon episode where we went back and replayed Metroid Prime just as a like a retrospective. And I hadn't played it since the GameCube days. And I don't know if Sam had played it all the way through, but he had a really frustrated time with it.
And it definitely reminded me of playing on GameCube and being reliant on probably the NGC Tips Book. There's like that artifact hunt in the second half of the game where they've just hidden a load of stuff inside some rocks in different rooms in that game. And short of going through the whole game with the X-ray visor and looking at every surface, you wouldn't know that there's secret rooms behind some of those walls.
And you can take some solace in the fact that your nightmare brief saved, you know, that game for a lot of people. You know, I don't know if I would have ever completed it without that guidebook.
So yeah, there's the process of writing those was, I mean, I like a like an idiot. I did two more, which I did the F-Zero GX one, which also Nubo, because that game is really hard. So trying to unlock every stuff goes to Matt was, which weirdly actually is a game I still love to this day, even though it nearly broke me.
And then probably the worst after that was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. And I had the Japanese version of the game had got about two thirds of the way through it. And had like an idiot, just selected the wrong option and formatted my memory card.
So I had to go all the way back to get it. And I was playing on my own as well. So, you know, you could play, you could play with a GameCube controller or you could play it with four people, right?
The famous co-op Final Fantasy.
Trying to solo that game from beginning to end was that was, and especially after having lost all my progress, that was another one that was really crushing me. So those things that stand out in my memory as being, you know, when it's like 4 a.m. and you just want to cry, that you have to kind of like get through this work. And there's nobody that can help you at that point either.
It's just entirely down to you. So yeah, those are probably the hardest things that I did in my time there, for sure.
So something we always ask guests on the podcast is about press trips or E3 or whether you ever got to go and do like a mad studio tour or like interview anyone. I'm just wondering if any sort of stories jumped out at you, you know, if you ever saw some like wild shit in your time.
Gosh, wild stuff. I mean, I went on a lot of trips. I think I have had the privilege of meeting most of my game heroes, for sure.
So I met with Hironobu Sakaguchi, the Final Fantasy creator. He was lovely, met me in Moto, which was just the loveliest experience in terms of meeting your heroes. He had just won the French Order of the Letter of the Arts.
I think it's like the French equivalent of an OBE or CBE or something similar. He'd flown from Paris to London, and I had the opportunity to meet with him. So I spent a good hour and a half with him, which was great.
I was so nervous as well. I was visibly shaking at the point at which I had to go in and interview him. But he was really nice.
He really put me at ease, and we just chatted about video games in general for weirdly a really long time. Typically, a lot of those interviews are really short, you're in and you're out. But I think there was only me and one other person got to speak to him on that day.
So I just had loads of time with him and he was lovely. He was genuinely really, really lovely. So that kind of lingers in my memory as being a really nice thing that I'm glad I did.
Probably the worst one actually is another one of my heroes. I met Uji Naka who was the creator of Sonic the Hedgehog. And at the time, I'm a massive Phantasy Star fan just in general.
And if anybody that kind of read NGC, N64, kind of know it's one of my favorite games of all time. And the Phantasy Star series in particular. So, I had the opportunity to interview him and I was extremely excited.
Not nervous, it's just like really thrilled to have the chance to kind of speak to him. And it was around Phantasy Star Online Episode 1 and 2 for the GameCube.
Right.
So, I thought brilliant, you know, it's a chance to kind of like, you know, ask him so much stuff that I've always wanted to know about him and the creation of the series and everything. So, I kind of got in to go meet him and there was an interpreter there. And it was just the weirdest time with him.
Because he was kind of sat looking at screen playing Phantasy Star Online. And I think he went on, I realized that he'd not actually turn around to look at me. So, he basically made no eye contact with me for like the entire time of this interview.
And was like broadly kind of disinterested. I don't know whether he was hungover or whether he was just genuinely displeased. So, I kind of went in there bounding with enthusiasm, like a enthusiastic puppy and he was just like completely deadpan, like just wouldn't look at me for the entire interview.
So, I just remember feeling kind of like crushed by the whole thing. Like this isn't how the meeting of my hero is supposed to be. Right.
That was really hard. But what made it worse is at the end of the interview, I had a copy of NGC. I think it had Sonic Adventure 2 on the cover.
So, I said, oh, can I just have some photographs with Iijinaka holding up the cover of the magazine? And at that point, he completely switched to being like super enthusiastic photo man, thumbs up all round, big smile. So, he kind of like switched from being completely disinterested, but for the photo, he was like mega enthusiastic.
Absolute mind games.
And then once the photos were done, he kind of went back to looking at the screen.
Went back to I detest you.
Yeah, exactly.
I've told this on the podcast before, but I don't know if I've ever told you. I went to the E3, maybe like the year the 3DS was announced, or the year where they were like showing off 3DS games properly. And I went to the Nintendo Conference.
And then the gimmick was they'd set up a load of 3DS demo stations outside the conference, like before you got to E3 proper. So it was in like the plaza outside the, you know, whatever the venue is. I queued up to play Luigi's Mansion 3, Luigi's Mansion 2 on the 3DS, and Eugene Iker was in the queue behind me.
Right.
The demo was quite long, and I was trying to get as much time with it as I could. And I could hear him tutting and huffing behind me that I was taking so long to get through this demo. And he was really making it known, that I was really wasting his time, and that this was bad for Eugene Iker.
And because of that, he's become a bit of a joke villain of this podcast. So any story that presents him in a slightly icy light is good.
I'm glad I wasn't the only one, because it was hard not to take personally at the time as a 24-year-old me, desperate to have his Phantasy Star questions answered.
That's brutal, because I'm not particularly into the games that he made, so it didn't really affect me at all. I was like, man, that guy was a bit crumpy, but to go in as a big fan. Oh yeah.
I mean, I can remember just leaving that room feeling utterly crestfallen by that whole experience. But I think on the whole, I think the only two bad interviews I had, one with Yujin Naka, the other one was with Atsushi Inaba, who did Beautiful Joe. But I think only because he was obviously extremely hung over.
So I think he genuinely didn't want to be there, so I didn't take that one too personally. But most people that I've interviewed that have certain amount of renown around them have always been really lovely. Sakurai as well, I interviewed him for Meteos.
He was really personable and really nice as well. So yeah, I mean, I've been quite blessed, I think, by having met most of the people that I would want to meet as a games journalist and have the opportunity to speak to. I've met them and they've generally speaking been all really lovely people.
Oh, I am jealous. I've met like fucking no one really in the grand scheme of things. I've met like Shootakumi, the Ace Attorney guy, and that's basically it.
It's quite hard when you're on a single format magazine, though, I think. Like most of the opportunities I had came from Gamesmaster, which I guess had the weight of circulation as well and kind of like fairly broad at the time, comparatively at the time. So a lot more of those opportunities came from the Gamesmaster side rather than the NGC side generally.
Well, I obviously made a big, big career mistake.
Because I should have gone multi-format.
Yes, I should have gone multi-format. Blast. And on that bombshell, let's take a break.
We'll be back after a lovely bit of music.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, Geraint, what I wanted to talk about now, how did you end up moving off NGC? Was it from NGC to Gamesmaster?
Is that how it works?
Yeah, it was. So I think a lot of it was to do with just kind of career progression, right? Like I've been on NGC for a really, really long time, and I loved it.
And I loved the people that I worked with wholeheartedly. And at the time I was working with Martin Kitts, I think was the kind of the last kind of surviving member, I think, of the kind of old school NGC crowd. And he's a thoroughly great guy and I loved him.
We were very firm friends. But I think the issue I had really at that point was there was, as I'm sure you know, at Future, the only kind of way to progress really is kind of dead man's shoes, right? And people don't tend to die, to move around as much.
Yeah, certainly back then. So an opportunity came up and I was good friends with Robin Allway, who's the Editor on Gamesmaster. And actually I remember him going all the way back to your Sinclair days.
I think he was a sound surgeon on that magazine. So I kind of knew of him from when I was a kid, which is weird. And so the opportunity came up.
So I decided to take it. And I think a lot of it was to do with, kind of timing wise, I think PS3 and 360 were kind of on the horizon, if I remember correctly. So it felt like the kind of right time to kind of move on.
And so that's what I did. And it was a very big shift, I think, really for me in terms of different environment and different staff members, and also a very kind of different pace, I think, of life working on that magazine. It was completely different in terms of compared to NGC.
It was like night and day, right? And on NGC, you had time to kind of like really deep dive into games and stuff like this. And then on Gamesmaster, it was very much the opposite, right?
You had pages to fill, a million box sets to write, just so many games to cover. It was unreal. And then kind of navigating that space of going, okay, we've got a hundred potential things that we could cover.
How do we fit all of that into 98 pages or however big the magazine was at the time? So that was a very big shift.
Yeah, no, I can imagine. I was going to ask if during that going to a multi-format magazine, you still had a kind of sneaky loyalty to Nintendo. When you were on NGC, were you playing other format games still?
Yeah, I mean, I was a lot because I was playing PC games. I loved the Dreamcast, for example, as well. And so I was playing a lot of games, playing games on PlayStation stuff as well.
So predominantly Nintendo, I think, just because you have only got so much time to play games in an evening. And if you're working on, whether it's like a Metro Prime or whatever it is, then you're automatically going to be kind of spending your time doing that. So it's quite hard to play everything, of course.
But I think by the time I kind of moved to Gamesmaster, I was a lot more kind of platform agnostic, I think. I didn't really have the time for loyalty. You know, somebody gives you a 360 and a copy of Blue Dragon or something, right?
Then that's what you're going to be playing for the next two nights, right? And there's nothing you can redo to change it. So I think just more by necessity rather than anything else, my kind of my focus had shifted, I think, by that point.
You are quite an RPG guy, right?
Yeah, massively. I think, and this is certainly true during the NGC days. Obviously, you had all the kind of the big GameCube games, but actually in reality, the things that I love the most, was the really kind of more obscure stuff, right?
That was at the time was coming out on DS. I mean, certainly when GBA first came out, it was very much the same thing. But when DS came out, there was like a ton of just really odd things, whether it was Wendan, which I think was like Elite Beat Agents or, you know, Phoenix Wright was a thing, and then Trauma Center, exactly that, right?
And 999 and stuff like that. So there was a lot of games on DS that were way more interesting to me than actually the mainline first party games in some cases, like I would, I can remember when Project Rub Rabbits was it? I can't remember what the English, what was the English name of it called?
It was like this kind of weird silhouette.
Feel the Magic.
Oh, Feel the Magic. Feel the Magic x, y, x, x, right? So when the DS was first coming out and people were like, oh, great, we get to play Mario 64 again.
Actually, I was looking at these kind of slightly more unusual games and going, actually, there's something here for me that I really enjoy. So actually, by the time I was coming to the end of my NGC career, so to speak, I was already really invested in these, I guess, more unusual Japanese output more than anything. That's actually something that's carried on through my whole career in the games industry.
But by the time I'd gone into Gamesmaster, the difficult thing was you never really had time to fully invest in something. I remember getting something like Crackdown, which I remember at the time nobody really knew very much about. Because I think the only reason people wanted to play it was because it had a Halo demo disc that came with it.
Yeah. Then it was almost like the game itself was secondary. I remember playing that and going, oh wow, this is actually great.
Then wanting to invest loads of time and do loads and loads of content on it, and it's just like, no, you've got two pages, you've got two pages, two days, that's it. Then you have to move on. So I found myself playing a lot of the stuff that I enjoyed from the magazine, from just the brief contact I had with those games.
Those would then end up being the stuff that I would play in the evenings then to actually just enjoy them for enjoyment's sake.
I was a real fan of Gamesmaster growing up. I really liked it alongside N64 and NGC. That and Gamesmaster were the two mags I read.
I think there was sometimes a bit of sniffiness towards Gamesmaster, where people maybe forever associated it with a TV show, or they thought it skewed super young. Where actually my read on it was that it was largely written by all the writers you like from other magazines, because it kind of pulled from everywhere. And also, because it was multi-format, it was like pure games.
There was no industry shit in there at all. There was no news or you'd never hear a Michael Pack to quote in games.
No, no, and I really loved it for that. And I think Robin Alway had a lot to do with that kind of direction. He was a very good magazine crafts person in the same way that Tim Weaver was, and people like Marcus Hawkins were as well.
So I had a lot of respect for him, but he was very much like a boundless enthusiasm first and foremost. I can remember him saying that it takes more bravery to be really enthusiastic about something that other people don't like than it does to kind of like rubbish something. So if you take the standpoint that you can be really negative about a game, you could take Wind Waker or Twilight Princess or whatever, and any kind of game, Nintendo game, and you could be the guy that says, actually, this isn't really up to scratch.
I'm going to give it a six, right? Then you can never be the one that's in the wrong, right? Do you know what I mean?
Because it's almost like you've got some kind of, I've got secret knowledge, which means I know that this isn't as good as you think it is kind of thing. Like, do you know what I mean?
The secret knowledge.
And that kind of ran true for me. It was just, it was, was actually, it's, I mean, you've done it with Red Steel to my San Francisco Rush 2049, right? Where actually there's nothing wrong, I think, with taking something and enjoying it and seeing the good in it and then communicating that, I think.
Yeah, I was just an, I was an idiot.
But I think, but I can totally see how that happens, right? In terms of you go, I'm really, I'm loving this. I can see the good in this and I want to communicate and I want to celebrate it and share my joy.
I think it takes a lot more bravery to be that person than it does to be the guy that gives, you know, gives GTA 7 or whatever. It's a four out of ten, right? I never really wanted to be that guy.
So when you kind of came to Gamesmaster, I think you're right. I think there was a bit of sniffiness about it, but also it was just games, games, games like breakneck speed and finding the joy and stuff. And actually, like you said, Gamesmaster was actually written by most of the best writers at Future, right?
Because it was like the freelance engine for so many people. Yeah. And so, you know, it was written by like a melting pot of really great talent, you know, from Kit C and Jez, right the way through to people like Kieran Gillan on PC Gamer and Dan Dawkins on PSM.
So like you had all of these really great writers who were contributing to this kind of melting pot of games enthusiasm. So I really enjoyed my time on it. I really loved the staff that were working on it as well.
And I kind of liked the freedom to be able to touch on a whole bunch of stuff, deliver some enthusiasm around it, where it was where it was deserving. And more often than not, because you had so many games to cover, you would automatically not cover some of the really bad stuff, right? Because, you know, you had a hundred games in a month you could potentially cover.
And so automatically you're going to go, well, actually, this is the top, you know, 20% of the games that I have in front of me for this month that I'm going to cover off. So, yeah, it was a very different experience to NGC for sure. But I just liked the enthusiasm.
And it wasn't even childish enthusiasm in the same way that something like Nintendo World was when I started. It was just enthusiasm for games written by really good people. And like I said, it wasn't, it felt like it was skewed young, but I don't think it really was in reality.
I tell people this story all the time because it was like one of my defining early memories of working at future. When I did my first bit of freelance for Gamesmaster, I got given a style guide. You print out the kind of do's and don'ts of writing for this magazine that all magazines had back then.
And there was a point in the Gamesmaster style guide about not relying on like lazy, rude words, like trying to be kind of creative with the way you described things. And I remember it gave this very specific example. It said, instead of fart, say phantom bum it.
Yes, I do remember it.
And because I remember, you know, it tickled a lot of my friends that I was doing this job out of university. You know, I'd go back and see my uni friends and they're like, I can't believe you're writing about video games for a living. That's crazy.
And then I told them about this style guide thing. And they were just like, what a world you live in.
The dig tap from on high is please refer to it as a phantom bum it.
Yes. But it was just like a very technical document. It was the technical nature of the document.
It's like, please use something like phantom bum it instead. As if that was just the most logical thing you could say to someone.
It was. It was such a... In some ways, a really difficult thing to write for because you had no room, right?
Like you couldn't... Like on NGC, if you wanted to write two and a half thousand words in your body copy, then great, off you go, right? Whereas you just didn't have that luxury, so everything had to be condensed and it had to be so super edited, like right the way down to the nearest pixel, right?
In terms of, actually I can't put full stop on this caption because otherwise the lines are going to overrun. So it was like that meticulous in terms of how it was. Probably the greatest compliment I ever received from anybody.
My whole time at Feature was I'd gone out for a drink with this guy, who had done some freelance production work and said, I really hate having to write, having to prod ed your work because it's impossible to edit, which I don't know whether or not was just because if you changed anything in that magazine, it would change everything, right? Like if you change one word, you'd have to change a whole bunch of sentences to make it all fit. So yeah, it was weirdly, if you look at it from the outside and go, okay, it's a really busy kind of kids focused magazine, but actually it's quite hard to write for and do it well.
So yeah, it had a very strange relationship with that magazine.
Speaking of games that you have to be brave to like, weren't you a big too human liker, or at least a defender or a slight believer in it?
Oh gosh, I was, yeah. You know, I wrote the review for Edge at the time and I think it was one of the first, I don't think it was the first thing I'd written for Edge, but it was one of the first things I'd written. And I must have written and rewritten that review, God knows how many times, because we were talking about magazines that are kind of difficult to write for and the kind of the pressure, like when you get given your first Edge review, it's a fairly monumental thing and you're just like, this can't be shit.
I haven't actually read that review for a really long time. I haven't actually played the game for a long time. I think I definitely got it wrong, I would imagine.
But at the time, I again, I could kind of see the good in it. I'm gonna have to go and dig that out because I would be very interested to see how reasoned my argument was for liking Too Human.
Yeah, I just, for some reason, I think one of the things that will pop into my head is Too Human and...
I think I've got a bit of a long history of liking stuff that people, like really genuinely liking stuff that people don't like. I don't know where that's really come from.
I was going to ask you at the end, but I guess we're talking about it now, like you were quite a battle-born guy, weren't you?
Oh, God, yeah, I was a huge Battle Ball fan, genuinely. Actually, it's one of the... I wrote something for Rich Stanton, so I wrote something for Kotaku, which was like why Battleborn was my game of the year.
Yeah, I remember. I wasn't like being kind of contrary, I was just being like genuine, it was a genuine heartfelt thing. I think that's actually the very last thing I ever wrote for anybody.
But I loved it. I absolutely loved it. And I can remember feeling, you know like when you write something in a magazine, right?
And then you go on to the forums as it was back then.
Yeah, yeah.
And then you've got somebody like tearing your review, a new one over the fact that you've said something about the game. In that instance, when it came to Overwatch and Battleborn, I was that guy, I wasn't going to forums and slacking people off or anything, but I can remember reading people's coverage of Overwatch and Battleborn and just feeling just like hot, boiling anger at like how could people not see what I could see, right? And the thing that really that I found the hardest was just the comparisons between the two games, because as far as I was concerned, they were completely different video games, right?
There was no comparison to make. I mean, they're both excellent video games. But I ended up really hating it.
Every time I see Overwatch, any thumbnail on any first party platform to download, play now, whatever, I can't, I can never bring myself to play that game now. Because my love for Battleborn was so deep.
You're forever, Lottie. I mean, very briefly, because your love is obviously deep and complex. What did you like about Battleborn?
I think it was, fundamentally, I really like playing massively multiplayer online RPGs, World of Warcraft and Out of Scrolls and stuff like this. But I don't have the time to play them.
Yeah.
So I think that the thing that I wrote for Kotaku, I don't think it exists anymore. I think they-
No, I would recommend our readers go and read it, but it all got nuked.
I think that the crux of it for me was, I loved MMORPGs, but I don't have the time to play them. What Battleborn did was it distilled that experience into 10-minute blasts. In a way that Overwatch did, but it didn't have the RPG underbelly to it.
So in Battleborn, you could still have the PVP side, where you're going in your- there's a MOBA-esque mode, and there's a deathmatch mode and stuff like that. So you can still do that in the same way that you have in Overwatch.
But actually, there was the raiding element where it was PvE, where you would go into an environment, and with your chosen class and your chosen skills, and then you'd go in and then you would fight your way to the end, and then you'd get gear at the end of it, which you could then use to ever so slightly tweak your character build to be able to go into the PvP. So it had this light MMORPG aspect to it, like raiding parties basically, PvP raiding parties, which would then influence what you did in the PvP, which Overwatch didn't have that element to it. So I first and foremost saw it as a MMORPG light with PvP elements, whereas Overwatch was a straight skill-based PvP.
So that was the main thing. So it basically took a genre which I loved, but didn't have the time to play, and kind of distilled it into kind of the 20-minute nuggets of play, which was perfect for me at the time. So I loved it.
I mean, I could see its failings. Like, I didn't really like the character design, and I'm not a big fan of Gearbox's kind of, you know, that kind of borderlands humor stuff I'm not particularly a big fan of. But mechanically, what it was doing was actually really, really compelling and really interesting.
And it kind of really annoyed me that people didn't see it in the same way.
Has there been anything in the last few years that you had put in that same kind of, not specifically Battleborn, but the classification of, like, underrated gems or things that people didn't get that you were actually going into?
Yeah, I think the most recent one for me is Dauntless, which was, I don't know if you know it, it was the free to play Monster Hunter. So you got, like, why would you not play Monster Hunter? Right?
And I was very much in camp Dauntless. I mean, they eventually went on to break the game. And I think it's actually being disconnected today.
I think they're shutting the service down today.
Oh, no. Wow.
But for its time, from... I played it from beta right the way through to probably the middle of last year, really. It was excellent.
It was a really good Monster Hunter clone that was just way more convenient. Like, Monster Hunter's got a whole bunch of stuff, right? We got to cook and, you know, faff around with different things.
Whereas this was just straight, straight kill and kill the monsters, get your loot, come back, make yourself stronger, go back in. So, yeah, I think Dauntless is probably the thing that I have loved really deeply enough to have. I mean, I must have spent easily 2,000 hours plus in that game.
Fucking hell, I wasn't expecting that number.
I played it a lot. And, yeah, at one point, I could have seen you good with one particular weapon. So, I was like, worldwide, I was ranked quite highly with this one weapon.
Wow, higher ranked in Dauntless.
Yeah, I was a very highly ranked War Pike player globally.
It's like, it's all slightly kind of Aldi Monster Hunter.
It is, it is. That is exactly what it is. But at its peak, like it went through a number of revisions and changes, but at its kind of peak, when it went into the kind of the kind of the reforge era of that game was excellent.
And then they got greedy and broke it with really bad microtransactions and gating of content and stuff. So, yeah, kind of. And then-
That's great.
Yeah, then because they broke it, they ended up having to shut it down because I think the whole community kind of rebelled against it, which was sad. But, yeah, that's the last kind of random thing that I've-
The last sickness.
Yeah, the last sickness has been purged. So I've yet to find what my next target is going to be.
Well, I wish you the best in the search for it. I'm glad that you chose to do this episode of the podcast rather than logging in just to sort of dab at the end of Dauntless or whatever it is people do in Dauntless.
Gathering in the streets of Ramsgate and see it shut down. I think it is shutting down today, if I'm not mistaken.
Oh, just the idea of having such an intense relationship with something which is, I mean, it's big enough, but not in the mainstream. It's just, that's very funny to me.
I think I've always been that way inclined, like Phantasy Star was probably the very first one. That was the gateway drug for me, for going all in on something that not many people really play.
Oh man, that's great. To give this episode a bit of a topicality, I guess, this is coming out, actually the day after the Switch 2. Are you interested in Switch 2 on a personal level?
I am, yes. I watched with great enthusiasm the Switch 2 kind of reveal, because I watched it the same as everybody else would have done, I think, whenever that was about six weeks ago now, maybe eight weeks ago.
Yeah.
So, of course, Mario Kart, super exciting. The price of it, probably less so. But I think, you know, I will obviously go all in on that.
I haven't actually pre-ordered it, but I will buy it as soon as it is available to mortals. I don't know, is it available to pre-order now if you're not a Nintendo Online member?
Yeah, I think it is broadly available in places, or people keep putting new batches of them up to pre-order. So I think they've stockpiled them. So, yeah, you can still do it.
It's kind of exciting to think by the time people are listening to this we'll be playing a new...
A brand new game. I mean, it's always a time to celebrate, isn't it? I think, although if I'm honest, I think the first thing I'll probably do is play F-Zero GX on it.
Right, right. Well, I don't know if the GameCube games are going to have like the save states and like rewind functions that the other emulated games have. But if they do, like I may finally actually make some progress in F-Zero GX because I was so shit at that game.
But if I can rewind it, maybe I'll have a chance of seeing like more than 5% of the content or whatever. The thing I wanted to ask about was kind of covering console launches in your magazine days. Very specific moments in a magazine's lifetime, like obviously on the Nintendo Mags, it would be a new era of the magazine for that console.
Gamesmaster would have covered every launch, so just going launch crazy. Can you remember your feeling in the run up to console launches? And was it one of like just the excitement for a new machine?
Or was there like stress or dread at the idea of having to cover a console launch?
There was definitely, there was never really any stress or fear of it. The opposite really, I think it's a time for renewal, right? Kind of scorched earth out with the old, in with the new, and the excitement around that.
I think there's a, certainly on NGC, I think there was a little bit, and I kind of, as you kind of went into the Wii, there was a little bit of anxiety around it in so far as the success or failure of that console will determine your employment, right? Or how difficult your time is going to be going forward. So, you know, if you end up working on a console and nobody buys it, and there's not much third-party support and all that kind of stuff, you kind of know that your days are numbered, right?
There's a little bit of that in the back of your mind. But I think overall, you can't help but get caught up in the enthusiasm because you know your readers are enthusiastic for it. And you know, you're kind of lapping up every little morsel of kind of information that you can get and kind of feeding that over to your readers and getting the launch games for the first time and playing those.
And you know, the feeling of excitement around that. So I think it's never anything less than a really good thing, I think, a console launch. Just because it kind of reinvigorates everybody that's working on the magazine as well, right?
Everybody's got lots more to talk about, you know, which of the launch games do you really enjoy playing and you know, what else is coming up? And it always kind of fills, and certainly at future time, it would fill the whole office with excitement, right? Everybody will want to see what we know, what you know, when the first PS3 stuff comes in, everybody wants to kind of see what that's like.
And same thing with 360.
Do you remember what made like the biggest ripples from your time there? Was there ever anything which had like… I mean, whether it's a console launch or maybe just a specific game, but had that like, you've got to see this?
I think the thing that had the biggest impact, noticeably, I think, was Halo on the Xbox, on the original Xbox. That was the thing where people were like, oh wow, okay, this is how things are going to be now. So I think that the one that probably stands out more than anything.
I don't think there was really anything that kind of hit with that magnitude. And I think people didn't really expect it at the time. And it was only when people started to play it that people were like, this is something that everybody has to play.
It was such an important game at that time.
You know, as someone who was on Nintendo Mags at the time, and obviously kind of had like the run of the FPS Roost with GoldenEye and Perfect Dark, was there any dread of like, oh no, the world has moved on? Or even tribalism of like, no, our thing is still better?
I think, no, not really. I think most people that were in that office all loved video games, right? So you have a general interest in emerging technologies.
And in the case of Halo, it was like, oh wow, actually, AI has got to the stage where enemy behavior is much more realistic and stuff like this. And the world has become more open and all these things. So there was always enthusiasm for that across the board for everybody.
You're saying Halo had better AI than Dr. Carol in The Dark.
Yes. That's slander. But I think in some ways, when you work on Nintendo magazine, you are somewhat shielded because no matter what happens, you've always got first party, right?
And no matter what it is that Nintendo makes, it's always going to be excellent in its own way. So I think to a certain extent, you've always got that to fall back on where actually when you worked on like on a PlayStation magazine, for example, you never really had that luxury. You didn't really know what was going to happen moment to moment.
Of course, you'd end up with your Final Fantasies and stuff like Shadow of the Colossus or whatever would come in, or ICO or these kinds of games where you go, oh wow, this is amazing. But it wasn't as regimented as it was on Nintendo machine because you know, well, there's definitely going to be another Mario and there's definitely going to be a Star Fox, and there's definitely going to be a New Zelda, or there's definitely going to be a Metroid. So those games would be like the heartbeat of the magazine, right, as you went through year 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
And then also you have the other stuff as well. Like whether it's a New Wario game, which would always be interesting or invented in some way. Yeah.
Whereas I think for PlayStation magazines and for Xbox in particular, it was much more lumpy, right? Things would catch you by surprise, like whether it's Halo or when Jet Set Radio Future came out, similar kind of time as well. You go, wow, this is actually really good.
I think Night of the Old Republic was another one, I think, on Xbox, which kind of people were like, okay, wow, this is great. But I think those formats were not quite as reliable in terms of having that regular first-party thing to look forward to, right?
You're talking about everyone gathering around Halo reminded me of, we were in the office when Gears of War came in for the first time. I remember that being a bit of a thing.
I went to, speaking of precious, I went to Raleigh to go and see it for the first time before it had been revealed.
Right.
I went around Epic Studios and met Cliff Bozinski at the time, and Mark Ryan, who is CEO of Epic. They were also both lovely. I came away from that trip with a real feeling of like this is, because the fidelity in that game at that time was amazing.
The game itself was good. I wouldn't say it was phenomenal, but it looked absolutely incredible. As soon as I'd come off that trip, I was very much, there's no way that I'm not buying an Xbox 360 at that point.
My mind was very much made up, this is amazing. Then of course you started to get things like Crackdown and Just Cause, and a lot of these more open world games. Just the whole gaming landscape at that point, both in terms of what games could look like, and also the scope and ambition of games had ballooned at that point.
I just remember that the one time I was brave enough to go down into Edge's dark corner of the office was to see Gears of War on there, you know, obscenely huge flat screen TV. So I remember there being a bit of a buzz.
Yeah, it was a real step up, I think, wasn't it? Just in terms of environmental detail and architecture and stuff like that. It was ruined beauty, I think it was termed as.
But yeah, it was phenomenal at the time.
Being on a Nintendo Mac, you know, we were still playing Wii on CRTs. It was like 480p Macs with a component cable. We just, everyone else had flat screen TVs in the games cage, and we had that absolute monstrosity that really massive, deep CRT widescreen.
It had like a load of yogurts built on it, which I remember. I used to joke about reviewing things in YogoVision, which is like an extra graphics layer you only got on the games cage. Depressing stuff.
Do you remember which console launches you actually got to cover? I have a vague recollection of Gamesmaster going to other countries to get the Wii.
I don't know if that's right or not. Obviously, the GameCube GBA DS I had covered. By the time I got to Gamesmaster, I think the Wii...
Because I went to New York to go and buy a Wii.
That's right.
I think we were only allowed two, so I bought one for Mark Green and one on Endgame at the time, and one for Gamesmaster. We were limited. Rather foodishly, I had gone thinking I would just go and get one, but I actually had to physically queue up in the line in Times Square to go and get one.
I think I queued for something like 16 hours to get it, and hadn't checked the weather before I went. This is in the middle of winter. In New York, it's like minus god knows what, just there with a jumper on in the freezing cold.
So I queued for ages to get it. But it's actually quite a fun experience just being there with other Nintendo fans waiting to go in and go and get it. Remember, the launch lineup wasn't that great.
I think I got Zelda, of course, Twilight Princess, Madden, I think, Excite Truck was there in the launch lineup. I think Monkey Ball, Banana Blitz, Red Steel, all the greats. So yeah, I covered that.
Of course, that was an exciting time. I remember seeing the initial wee trailer when they unveiled it for the first time and people going, what the hell is this? But similar to the DS, I had this firm belief that it was going to be great because I think the DS certainly lived up to its promise in a lot of ways and it was a really great machine for a really, really long time.
So I was kind of hopeful that this kind of new motion technology, oh, Wii Sports, of course, it would be another one. But I think it was, I don't think anybody really realized how much it would blow up and it did like hugely. I can't remember how many units they sold in the end of that hardware, but yeah, it was a phenomenal success.
Not so much as a kind of hardcore gamer, but in terms of as a mainstream machine, it was incredible.
I just love the idea of you flying out to New York to buy consoles. That's wild. The idea of a company paying to fly someone out to do that as a little mission, especially with it not being guaranteed.
I don't know whether or not, I mean, I don't think those things even exist in that way now in terms of games coverage.
I mean, there are still midnight launches and whatnot, but generally speaking, behind the scenes, the platform holders, they tend to get you the consoles a bit early. We had the Wii U on O&M maybe two weeks before it came out, and you know, definitely people had switches for about the same. You know, they get them into the hands of the press.
The idea that the press has to...
Fly to go and get it.
That might have just been like a regional date difference though. Like if it came out in the US a bit earlier, maybe that just made more sense to go and get it. Because I wasn't privy to any of those conversations.
When I was on NGamer, I just remember a Wii turning up and us all being really excited. I didn't realize you were the one stuffing it into the suitcase.
Yeah, because I remember having to travel without much in my suitcase, knowing that I'd have to put two Wiis and a load of games in it. So I think I was there for about four or five days and had like two pairs of pants and a t-shirt. So just to accommodate enough room in my suitcase to make sure I could bring everything back.
That's like some spy shit. It was.
It was quite a weird thing. But I'd also had no idea that I'd also have to queue up for 16 hours to go and get it. But it ended up actually being quite a fun experience, quite a fun thing to do.
The only other one I did was the PlayStation 3 launch I covered. I went to Tokyo to go and cover it during TGS. It was when they were showing the Japanese launch lineup for the first time.
So I went to go to that, which was a really nice thing to be able to go and do. The launch lineup actually wasn't that interesting from memory. In fact, I'm struggling to remember what was even in that.
There was Warhawk, there was the Dragon thing from Factor 5, was it Lair?
Was there that Genji something?
Yeah, Genji, Days of the Blade, that was the whole Giant Enemy Krabs thing, wasn't it? From the press conference. The most historically accurate action game.
Here he is flipping Giant Enemy Krabs. I think that was the Ridge Racer moment as well. I think that was that.
Yeah, I mean that whole thing was just an absolute debacle.
Yeah, and then they kind of, but you know, they clawed it back, so it was okay.
Yeah, because I think the price was extortionate as well. It was like $699, it was a big...
Yeah, it was like mega hubris time.
Yeah, I mean now, as a result of it, I'm still very much an Xbox player at this stage. In terms of my, once we finish talking, I'll probably go and play Oblivion on Xbox. But yeah, I think that ever since 360, I've been kind of tied into that ecosystem, whatever it is that people refer to it now.
And so that's where most of my digital collection lies, outside of Steam, of course, which is just a kind of cesspit of unfinished, unstaffed games on Steam. My pile of shame is ridiculous on PC.
Did you ever get the Steam press account?
No.
OK, because I didn't know if on Gamesmaster you were qualified. It is real. People had these things and...
Was that just like unfiltered access to the entire content of Steam?
Yeah, some people have a press account. It basically means you get everything on Steam for free.
Oh, wow. No, I sadly never had that, although probably for the best, I don't have access to it, to be honest.
Think of the number you'd have done on like Dauntless DLC.
You're quite, I think it's a really interesting thing that if you look back, I can remember a time when I was in 7D else, I was working on N64 Magazine at the time, and I think the Dreamcast was around, I think Tim Weaver just moved on to like a weekly games magazine, come on, what's called now. Yeah.
Video Gamer.
Video Gamer, that was it. So all of these magazines were kind of close proximity, and I can remember a time thinking to myself, I have a pretty good handle on all of the video games in existence at this moment in time. I was like taking it as like a monthly snapshot, right?
So I've got a good idea of what there is on PC. I've either kind of read about it, seen somebody play it or played it myself, right? So at that moment, this probably would have been around about, I want to say maybe 2002, 2003, where I had a pretty good idea of what the gaming landscape looked like in its entirety.
The gaming oracle.
Right, at that moment, because there wasn't quite so much. I mean, there was a lot of video games, but you'd have a good handle on what existed, right?
Yeah, yeah.
To do that now would be impossible, right? You can't know everything that exists as a snapshot on this particular day. I think on Steam, you've probably got like 500 games releasing on any given day, right?
Or thousands of games that are on Switch or small games, indie games, to right the way through to first party games. So that's the scary thing for me, it's just how much stuff there is now versus what there was 20 years ago is incredible.
Yeah. Well, and with a Steam Press account, you can download all 500 games every day.
I think exactly. With Steam Press account, you could gorge yourself on everything on that.
You could pick up your poor PC hard drive and say, kill me, please stop. Take away his access.
Yes. It's crazy. But in some ways, it's great, right?
Because the sheer diversity of stuff out there is incredible.
Yeah.
Also, as a journalist, where do you even start to cover stuff? Right. It's crazy.
With a podcast, we don't really cover new releases. We cover maybe one a month or whatever. So we cover 0.000001% of games.
But what can you do? I've got a really nerdy question about covering console launches. And maybe it's just too inside baseball and not interesting to people.
But I thought I'd put it to you anyway and see if you had any thoughts on it. I was curious if you recalled any, like, technical challenges that arose when a new console came around, like GM going into the HD era. The materials you were working with are suddenly quite different.
And maybe this is only of interest to me. On Nintendo consoles, like Nintendo used to make capture devices for the handhelds that you'd kind of take screenshots from and it was bespoke hardware that they made. But everyone else, it felt like people were trying to find solutions to how you actually covered these new games, which had much higher pixel counts or whatever.
Any thoughts on that? Or is that just too boring a question to ask?
I think it's, I mean, looking back, well, when I joined N64, there was like future had like proprietary capturing software.
Yeah.
Which was made by this guy. And I don't know what his real name was, but Tim Weaver referred to him as Jansson Interceptor. Jansson Interceptor.
So I don't know who he was. I don't think I ever met him. But he would.
I don't know where that came from. Or I think I think I think it might be a plain reference. I have no idea.
But anyway, so there was this kind of like gray box proprietary software that future had when I joined, which apparently was made by Jansson Interceptor, according to Tim Weaver, who exactly had made this. I don't know. And it was kind of unwieldy because it depending on whether or not you were running PAL and TSC, all this kind of stuff, you'd have to capture it.
And back then it was actually a real pain to work on because it would capture like between frames, right? So once you'd captured your screenshots, you'd have to deinterlace it to make it into one image. And then, so quite often, and this is especially annoying, if you were like taking, if you're doing a tips guide, right, you'd have to play, I don't know, let's say you're playing Sin and Punishment, which is like brutal, and you can't play it with one hand, and you'd have to like hammer away at the spacebar to take a whole bunch of screenshots in a second.
And then you would deinterlace them all. And then you haven't captured the thing that you wanted to capture in that moment. So then you'd have to go back and do this hard thing that you just have to do all over again, right?
So there was that kind of annoyance with it. I think by the time we kind of got into the HD era, that kind of problem had kind of gone away. And you could also just record stuff, right?
So you could just record 5 seconds and then take the screenshot that you wanted to. But because it was in HD, what you took was what you got, right? So you would be able to, like it opened up, I guess it sounded really boring to people, I think, but it would open up a whole world of annotated screenshots, right?
That you could sort of do it, but you could do it much better. If you wanted to zoom in on a screenshot, you could because the fidelity was that much higher and the resolution was that much higher. So it made Minecraft a little bit easier.
Like you could be a lot more creative with what you wanted to do because you wouldn't have to capture the specific second by accident that you wanted to capture.
Very inefficient way of working.
Yeah, exactly. Or you could highlight things that you couldn't ordinarily highlight. So by the time you got to 360 PlayStation 3 time, it gave you a lot more flexibility.
And the thing that really helped is those, going back to trying to do Metroid Prime at like four o'clock in the morning or whatever, a lot of the harder, boring stuff. Like once you'd written something, you'd have to go away and take all the screenshots that you needed for it. And that was like a body of work in and of itself.
And quite often it was the end point. So I've spent a couple of days writing all this stuff and now I need to go and get the images for it. And it just made that process much, much simpler.
You could just like play through something for an hour, capture everything that you needed and then that was it. So it didn't have the same kind of annoying pain points.
And people today, with consoles having screenshotting built into them, they never had it so easy.
Yeah, so record the last five seconds.
Yeah, unbelievable. They don't know they're born, Geraint.
Yes, exactly. I envy the screenshotting person at wherever it is that they're doing that work now. They don't know they've got it so good compared to what they used to have to do.
Because I can remember an anecdote. I think it might have been Robin Orway. It might even have been Rich Pelley had said this.
But going back to your Sinclair days where they had to play a game and they'd have to pause it and then put a sheet over the TV and then just capture it with a normal camera. Which would have been, yeah, and I think some games didn't necessarily have a pause function as well. So it made them really difficult.
That is just mad.
So to go back to those days would have been absolutely brutal I think.
You probably don't remember this and you may even deny it. Do you remember when you melted our capture unit?
Oh God, no. Did I melt your capture unit? How did I melt it?
You did like a couple of months of freelance.
I did, yeah. I came to work on NGamer for maybe about four months.
You came back and you did some stuff on NGamer. So two things I really remember about that time, you did a really funny box out in our Pokemon section where you photoshopped some fake Pokemon dialogue into the game and it was all quite like dark and it was all Ash's mum saying awful stuff or whatever. That was really funny, but you also melted our capture device for plugging it into the wrong power converter.
So that wasn't as funny because the issue after it took us a little while to get like a new capture thing signed off. And we did a joke page where it was the page 89, which used to have dumb gags on it. We said, oh, Geraint melted our capture device.
So from now on, like all the screenshots in NGamer are gonna have to be hand drawn from memory. And it was just like a wall of hand drawn games from that issue. So, yeah, I'm pretty sure that was you.
I think it could well have been. That would be my... I think I destroyed somebody else's equipment as well.
I think I blew up Gamesmaster's Japanese Dreamcast, I think, with it doing the exact same thing.
Your previous form.
But yeah, I fried their Dreamcast playing Icaruga in my flat at the time. I didn't have a Japanese Dreamcast, so I borrowed theirs, excitedly went back to my flat to go and play it on the lunch break, turned it on, and I think within about 20 seconds it was spinning smoke out of the lid. I had to go back and explain why they didn't have one.
People aren't really happy about this. I'd have to snuck it back into the office and pretend it's someone else did it.
Just feigned ignorance. I've got no idea what I'm doing.
Oh my god.
The smell of smoke still puns you.
And then people come to your house and go, what's your house stink of burnt drink, Aust? Yeah. Just a quick go back to the launch things.
This is, again, a super broad question, but I've been thinking about previous launches off the back of the Switch 2 coming out. And I was curious if you had any like all-timer, hall of fame launch games or games that you just remember like really blowing you away from day one.
Going back, I think Gears of War, definitely stands out for sure. I don't think it was a launch game, but it came out a few months later. A little bit a little bit later on.
I mean, Twilight Princess, like without a doubt is was an important one, because I think at the time, I seem to remember we broke the fact that it was going to be on Wii as well. I think that was kind of one of the biggest exclusive things that we had done as a magazine. It's kind of poignant for that reason, certainly.
I think it's probably my favorite Zelda, maybe even alongside Breath of the Wild. It's hard to separate those two, but I've got very fond memories of Twilight Princess. And also because I kind of played it a little bit in advance, I'd gone to Frankfurt to go and play it as well.
So I'd had some kind of early contact with that, which is quite rare for us with Nintendo at that point to have that kind of access. Gamecube wise, Gamecube was a weird one because, I mean, Luigi's Mansion I reviewed, but I had no real love for it, particularly when I think I gave it 90%, I think I gave it. But...
Yeah, sounds like you really hated it.
But I enjoyed it at the time, like a new kind of console energy. But I think on that console, the two, there was Rogue Squadron stood out because I was looking forward to it so much. I was a big Star Wars fan now, and the same with that, and even more so back then.
So that was really exciting. And it just looked incredible. Like it was the standout visual game for the GameCube, like straight out of the gate.
It was a beautiful game and sounded amazing. And it kind of felt like the future, right? In a way that Luigi's Mansion didn't necessarily.
Right.
And then kind of secretly, Monkey Ball then ended up becoming one of my favorites. Like genuinely one of my favorite games in general, actually. But the very first Monkey Ball.
Yeah, I mean, it's a great game.
Well, it was a surprise. Like I didn't know what to expect from it. And I played it a lot, like personally, like I'd play it in the evenings and I kind of got a little bit obsessed with it.
Me and Green used to play it loads. I played the multiplayer part of that game a lot as well. Like we played Monkey Target constantly for a really long time.
And so that sticks out in my mind as being kind of secretively one of my favorite launch games. I think the very first Monkey Ball was.
That's all right. It doesn't need to be like a secret shame. I take care of it.
It's not controversial to like Monkey Ball.
Yeah, I think it's. Yeah, I mean, I think it's been surpassed even by subsequent ones. I wouldn't necessarily play another Monkey Ball now, but the kind of the purity of it at that time, I really kind of gelled with.
Other standouts, I mean, like definitely, there was a period of time on GameCube. Obviously, Resident Evil 4 was probably the biggest kind of review, I think, that I had done. I think it was like 12 pages, both in terms of size, but also I don't know if people viewed in the same way now, but I think at the point at which Resident Evil 4 came out, I think it changed action games in general forever after that point.
Oh, yeah, for sure.
I think, I don't think the influence of that game can't really be understated. I don't think people often, you know, you can look at stuff like Mario 64, Idol Tomb Raider, or a lot of these games and go, this is a really important seminal work that's kind of changed what games have been like. And I think, I think Resident Evil 4 definitely did that.
And I don't think it quite gets the accolades it deserves, specifically for that reason. It won a lot of accolades for being an excellent video game, but I don't think its kind of influence has been noted as much as I would, I think it deserves really.
Yeah.
And it was a game that I just played so many times through just because it was just, it was just superb. So that one sticks out as being an important one.
Amazing game. Did you play the remake of the company's game?
No, I didn't actually. I did go back and play the original Resi 4 when it kind of came out on Xbox. But it was kind of disappointing.
One, because I was very good at Resi 4. I played it so much. I was like super good at it.
But I couldn't play it on a 360-degree. It just kind of didn't really feel right. And I felt like it hadn't aged particularly well.
But then I remembered that the GameCube version was gorgeous. But the PlayStation 2 version, which then all the subsequent ports have come from, is the weaker version in terms of, I mean, it's got more content in it. But it's not as good looking as the original GameCube version, which was far richer, I think.
And the polygon count was higher, and the lighting was better and stuff like that. So it's a shame that it's kind of been somewhat tarnished. Like subsequent re-releases of Resi 4, I don't mean the remake, but the further ports through history have been kind of tarnished by its kind of contact with PS2, if that's not too mean a thing to say.
Yeah. Yeah, that's not at all petty.
I still have some loyalty. But there was a period of time where because Resi 4 came out and there was a bunch of stuff that Capcom had done. So Piano 3, I really enjoyed, very kind of media game, but I really liked what it was doing.
And then Beautiful Joe and Killer 7, there was that kind of body of work. And there was one other which never came out. I think Dead Phoenix, I think never appeared.
But there was the Capcom 5, I think as it was at the time. Killer 7 and Beautiful Joe in particular kind of really excited me at the time. Those are really, really cool, really inventive games.
So yeah, those kind of stick out of that kind of generation of games that I hugely enjoyed. And 64-wise, weirdly, I don't really have a huge amount of fondness for that console, oddly, considering where I kind of came from. Obviously, Awkward Time is amazing and Mario 64 is amazing.
But I enjoyed those games as a normal person, as a normal consumer because they came out in my first year of university, those games came out. And annoyingly, Awkward Time came out in my last year of university when I was doing my dissertation, which didn't help.
Which one out in the end, Awkward or a dissertation?
Awkward definitely one out and it kind of scraped through my degree. But annoyingly, Final Fantasy 7 came out around about the similar kind of time I remember as well. So like those two games did my education no favors whatsoever.
But I think that on terms of N64, the game that I would probably go back and play now would probably be Sin and Punishment. It's probably the only thing that I would physically plug into that machine and play again, experience again. It's probably my favorite of N64 would be probably Sin and Punishment.
It's probably my favorite game on that console.
Hardcore pick.
Yeah, I think it's, I mean, I did the tips guide for it, so I had to finish it. But I loved it. I don't know, treasure stuff in general, right?
Whether it's Icaruga or Radiant Silver Gun or Gunstar Heroes or Mischief Makers, anything from treasure around those years, I was always a huge, huge fan of.
I did want to ask you about console launches with regards to what you do now. I mean, to touch on that in a second, but you're now on the other side of the fence, you're in Games Publishing at PQube. I'm just curious what a console launch means to you in your current line of work.
Is it a big, exciting opportunity, or is it a huge amount of work? What does a Switch 2 mean to you?
I mean, there's a lot of parallels, I think, with working on magazines so far as you have this thing that's coming up, which is a new, exciting hardware, and you're excited to see what people's reaction to it is, and what games are going to be on that console. Likewise, for any kind of staff that you're working with, whether it's a magazine publisher or a games publisher, there's that feeling of excitement around the console's launch. Because to a certain degree, it is also going to dictate what you're going to be doing with your time for the coming years.
That is very similar. More so, I think, as a publisher, without being too dry and commercial about it. But I think you have a situation where when a new console comes out, and if you're lucky enough to be able to release a game that's fairly early on in that console's lifecycle, those games typically have a pretty big head start, because there's not a huge amount of games to choose from.
So if you're in that mix, then automatically your sales are going to benefit from that reduced competition. So there's that excitement around it. Also, from the publishing point of view is, if developers are making games for it, what are they?
What are the games that you don't know about, that you're going to discover for the first time and go, okay, this is something that we'd want to invest in and want to publish. So there's just as much excitement for sure, but I think there's also probably more trepidation than there is from the journalism side, because I guess you have more skin in the game, so to speak, right? Like the financial implications of a console launcher are felt that much more clearly from the publishing side.
So I'm trying to think, going back to when the Switch launched, for example, we released CatQuest fairly early on in that console's life cycle, and I think there weren't that many games out. I think there might have been like 40, 50 games available at that time. So we kind of featured quite prominently.
If you went into the eShop, you could find it really easily, right? Because it would be in the top 20 charts or whatever. So the discoverability of it was really, really easy.
And it was an excellent video game, so it sold really well. But then kind of cut to seven, eight years down the line at the end of the Switch's life cycle. If you go into the eShop now, I had a look at the weekend funnily enough to look and see what games were kind of discounted.
I think there was like three and a half thousand games on sale in the eShop at that time. And there's so many games on sale that the hardware struggles to actually load the menus. It's not great.
Which obviously had discoverability as well. So I think at the end of a console life cycle, it gets really, really hard to kind of cut through.
So many games the store can't actually load itself.
Yeah.
That's a worst case scenario, really.
I think that's the legacy of having a console that survived so long. I mean, the Switch has had an unprecedented lifespan. I think it's eight years.
Whereas, typically, a console life cycle was like four or five. So I mean, fair play to Nintendo. I mean, the Switch is a great piece of hardware, but obviously, it's kind of showing its age now.
But yeah, so I think it's, like I said before, it's a time for renewal.
Yeah.
So it's also a time for excitement. But on the games publishing side, where there's a pretty significant amount of financial risk in that business, there is, I guess, as much fear as there is excitement as well. For you know, what lies ahead.
Yeah, exciting times. Well, you'll be glad to hear, at least, it really made me laugh reading around the Switch 2. I think, I don't think it was in the Nintendo Direct, but on the official website, there was a little bit going, the e-store shop will run fine now because of the extra hardware power.
And it was like, Jesus, it's mad that you even have to say that.
To actually run your own store. I think a lot of it is down to, I don't know whether or not the US store is slightly better because I think it also has to run all the languages in the European store. So I think the European store is actually the slowest of all the stores, I believe.
There you go. A little bit of insight. I mean, more broadly speaking, obviously there, I've kind of jumped ahead a bit.
You are now at PQube. What eventually sort of inspired that move? And how have you found this journey within the industry itself?
I think, I mean, the scary thing is, I've been on the other side of the fence, I think, for longer than I was a journalist. I was a journalist for 10 years and so I've been on the publishing side, games publishing, marketing for, oh gosh, 20, 16 years, I think, 16, 17 years. So yeah, a good while.
I mean, in terms of the move, I've been a journalist for 10 years and as much as I love Gamesmaster and everybody that I worked with, ultimately was really financially viable for me to carry on. My son was, I think, two or three years old and it got to the stage where I needed to buy a house and look after my family and things like that. So the financial side was obviously a big motivator.
And actually kind of climbing up the ranks of future was going to be a long process, unless people, unless Robin kind of quit or whatever, that could be an editor. But the other thing that motivated was, I remember Robin went on sabbatical for, I think it was like five weeks. So I had to look after the magazine for like two issues or something.
And I kind of got a little bit of a glimpse, I think, of the, I guess the politics around kind of magazine publishing, I think, in terms of pressures around what goes on your cover and people scrutinizing your cover lines and all this kind of stuff. And obviously, there's the pressures of deadlines and making sure that you don't miss a print slot and the penalties around that. And it kind of, it gave me enough of a taste of it, I think, to go, actually, do I even want to be an editor?
And most of the fun I had going back to a staff writer and having that freedom, I loved. But that side of the magazine publishing business, I wasn't really, it wasn't really something that I wanted to go into. And I can remember speaking to, you know, Jez and Tim Weaver and Robin about the kind of pains that they went through on that side and the responsibilities that they had.
So I kind of knew what it was like, but I kind of got my first taste of it when Robin was away. And I kind of realized that actually, you know, I love making magazines and I like writing about video games, but is this a path that I necessarily want to follow? And I think the answer to that was really resounding.
So it felt like a good time to do it. And at that point, there weren't that many games publishers. There weren't that many kind of games publishing, marketing PR opportunities in the kind of West of England, right, in terms of Bath and Bristol.
But a job came up at Majesco, which was based just opposite Temple Meads. And even though I had no real love for Majesco's games, like at all, it was just an opportunity for me to do. So it was a marketing PR position.
So I went for it and got the job and then kind of started. And it wasn't really that easy. And I like the people that worked there were lovely, like John Merchant, my boss, who was the kind of marketing director at the company.
He was a really lovely guy. So he kind of took me under his wing and to kind of learn that whole process of games marketing and games publishing and, you know, deciding what games you're going to publish and what a P&L looks like and all that kind of stuff. So it was good to get a taste of that.
But I really didn't like their output. I can remember, there's two things that kind of struck me when I was working there, that stay with me to this day. One of them actually haunts me to this day was, I remember seeing Demon's Souls came into the office as something that maybe we should publish.
Right.
Because it was available, the rights were available to publish it. And it was an exceptional game. And obviously, we all know what's happened to that, to From Software since that point.
I remember playing it and John Merchant, my boss at the time was the same guy, and this is something really, really special about this. We should absolutely try and pursue this. But we were kind of led by the US office.
And so even though it was something that I really believed and I would have absolutely loved to have published that game or worked on that game, it got turned down. The general consensus was to do stuff like Zumba and a lot of the kind of wee things that were around at the time, right?
Oh yeah. I mean the thing is Demon's Souls and Zumba are both equally revered.
I think the agenda there was very different in terms of what the games that the company wanted to publish. The other one that came through which I really loved was BlazBlue from Arc System Works, which I did actually end up working on separately. And it was another game that I loved.
I was a massive 2D fighting game fan just in general right from Street Fighter to King of Fighters and Guilty Gear and stuff like this. So it was a genre I loved and it was a really good example of that genre. The game is excellent.
And so I kind of secretly really wanted to work on that game and again, it was something that we worked on.
Wow.
So there was the kind of disappointment around that. And then probably like my lowest point was we were working on Mad Dog McCree on the Wii, which I don't know what the meta critics were, but it is just fundamentally. I mean, Mad Dog McCree is not a good game in and of itself anyway, right?
Like it's not a game that I look on fondly in any shape or form. But the Wii version of that game is just awful. And I can remember I had to go to game to like demo the game, the game headquarters, the UK retail store.
So to go to headquarters to demo a game to them, to try and convince them obviously to buy X amount of copies to put into store to sell, which is a fairly common thing. It certainly was back then when physical was massive, right? So I can remember like practicing this game and the game is so broken that you couldn't aim at something and shoot it, right?
Because the tracking of the Wii remote wasn't very good. The latency on it was really bad. So then when you fired the gun, it would fire like five seconds later or like 0.5 of the second layer and also it was kind of randomized.
So you couldn't learn it either. So like where the cowboys and stuff would pop up, you didn't really know. You had a rough idea where they might do, but you couldn't react in time.
So anyways, it was a fundamentally broken video game, which I hated. So I remember practicing this game just thinking, oh my God, I have to go to game, I have to demo this game and also be enthusiastic about it as well, right? So like kind of fame, this is a fantastic game.
You should take 50,000 copies of this, please. So I practiced it and I was kind of dreading it. And I can remember the day that I had to go up and demo it.
I was really ill. I had a really bad stomach upset. And but I had no choice but to go.
I couldn't just like bail on this thing. So I had to go and do it. So I was kind of like on the train, I was like sweating profusely and had the Wii and a copy of Mad Dog McCree in my bag and ready to go.
So I had kind of gone into the meeting to demo it. And at the point at which I was doing it, I so desperately needed to go to the bathroom. And so I was trying to talk enthusiastically about the game, not being able to shoot anything because the game was so bad.
And I was locked in this like cycle of anxiety of like, I need to demo this really well. But I also might actually as a grown adult, like have an accident in this meeting. I was so sick.
So by the time I kind of endured this like horrible demoing moment at games headquarters, I had to basically sprint out of the room and just run into the first toilet that I could find. And I remember like going into the toilet and then realizing that they were like no urinals in it, but I had no choice. I sat down, I just realized I'm just in here, sweating profusely, evacuating into like the ladies toilets and game headquarters after having done with Mad Dog McCree and just like with my head in my hands going, this isn't really the future that I'd kind of find myself up for.
So it was at that point I was like, yeah, I don't know whether or not I've made the right decision here. And then shortly after that, actually, the European office of Majesca shut down. And that was, I think, when I joined you on NGamer.
After Mad Dog McCreegate.
After Mad Dog McCreegate. Yeah, it was a particular kind of low point. And I definitely kind of questioned my life choices at that moment in time.
So anyway, they shut the European office down and eventually I came back to future. I think I was at future for maybe eight or nine months, I think, across. I worked on Official PlayStation for a little bit and worked with you guys on NGamer and obviously did some work on Gamesmaster and stuff.
So it was kind of nice to be able to come home.
And now our equipment.
Yes, and not your equipment. I'm so sorry. And I think at that time, I discovered that the people that had the rights to BlazBlue, which I'd looked at when I was at Majesco, were actually Bristol based.
They were across the park, actually from the apartment where I lived at the time. So I ended up talking to them because they were looking for someone to do their marketing and PR and eventually got the job and that's where I kind of started, really, afresh after Majesco. And that's how I came into contact with PQube, who are the distributor for the game at the time.
And then eventually PQube kind of absorbed me and the team into PQube as part of a... because they weren't a publisher then, but they became a publisher once I joined them. So that was the beginning of it, really.
So again, a lot of it is kind of luck based more than anything else. But yeah, that was the kind of beginning of my publishing journey, I guess you could say.
Man, I didn't know about the mad dog McRee stuff. That's crazy.
Yeah, it was particularly... I mean, it's hard, right? Because it was something that I wanted to do and I wanted to be successful at.
But also it was like working on projects that I just didn't have any belief in. I think the only good game I think that I worked on while I was there was was A Boiner's Blob and Wii, which was kind of nice and wholesome and cute, right? But I think that was the only game that had any real kind of affinity for at that time.
Did Majesco publish Major Miner's Majestic March?
Yes, yes they did actually.
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh, that was heinous. The idea that they were like no to Demon's Souls, but yes to that.
Keep on marching! Or it's just like screeching out of your Wii remote. Absolutely.
One of the biggest pieces of shit, aren't we? Me and Kitsy just crying with laughter how shit it was.
But the thing was, it was also, it was the, it was proper the rapper's creator and, and Green, and Rodney Greenblatt, the artist as well. It was like the, it was the coming together of those two great minds, but the actual execution.
Should have kept him apart.
Or just even the subject matter in general was bizarre, right? Like of all of the things, of all the musical things that you could choose, you know, you could go with marching bands or male voice choirs or, or something like that, or Morris dancing or whatever. Yeah, it was bizarre.
Really baffling. In what you're doing now at PQube, what are you sort of responsible for now? What's, what are you doing?
So I'm, my job title is head of publishing is, is my, is my job title. So, I mean, ultimately, it's about finding games to publish and then signing those games and then obviously bringing them to market. So we have, you know, we have the finance teams, the marketing teams and PR and social media and video and production teams and everything in house.
So typically I travel around a lot. So I go to Japan three, four times a year and go and speak to, the developers and decide which games we want to publish. And also indie games globally, whether it's in Indonesia or the US or the UK or Spain or wherever, like looking for like really nice indie projects that we want to work on.
And then releasing them all around the world. And then the kind of the third pillar of the business at the moment, which is kind of the newest part is, is game development and looking at games that we want to make ourselves, which are our own IP. And then finding the right teams to make those games with us, like co-development or whether we make them in-house.
And then releasing those. So those are kind of the three broad categories of what we operate in. So yeah, ultimately, it's looking for games, finding games, signing them, releasing them and in the night of the world, making them successful.
Probably an impossible question to answer. But how do you know when you found a good one? Do you get like a special thing or is it like tapping into the old games journalism instincts or, you know, how do you know?
Because it's quite a big bet you place on these things.
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely an element of that. I can remember, like when we were at Future, you know, people used to joke about, you know, being able to guess the score just by smelling the box, right? You like you have a kind of a pretty good idea of roughly where a game is going to fall in terms of its kind of rough score, how good this can be.
Sometimes you get surprised by something, right? But generally speaking, you have a good idea whether or not it's going to be something that's excellent or not. And I think there's definitely an element of that.
Like over the course of a year, I'll quite easily look at over a thousand games in different ways, whether or not that's playing demos or looking at pitch decks, or even if it's like somebody sending you a YouTube link to a trailer or some gameplay footage or something. And so you're kind of looking at a lot of things quite intensely. Like through the course of the week, like today, for example, I must have looked at maybe 25 different games just today.
Wow.
So there's an element of that kind of five-second rule to a certain degree, where you look at something and go, do I feel like this is something that might be interesting? I think a lot of the time, trying to think of two examples, really. Like Turmited Souls, for example, which is one of our best-selling games.
Yeah.
I think my first contact with that was just a GIF on Twitter, which basically showed off the fixed camera perspective horror. So it was like very kind of-
It's kind of like a Trap Resident Evil style.
Exactly that. I'd seen like five seconds of that game in motion at that point, and I immediately knew it was something that I really wanted. Well, one personally wanted to play, but also wanted to explore what the option was, where it was in development, whether or not it was something we could sign.
Inertial Drift is another one I saw. I saw just a very small GIF of that, and I immediately fell in love with the aesthetic of it and what it was doing. Then actually later on, I ended up going to GDC, and it happened to be at that show when I got to play.
I played it pretty much solidly for the entire morning. Those two games stand out as being examples where it just appeared. In a matter of seconds, I've made a snap judgment that I think it's definitely something that I'd want to work on.
In those cases, both of those games went on to do really well. I think there's an element of that initial judgment. To be honest, I think whether or not you're a journalist, or whether or not you're a games publisher, or whether you're just somebody looking to buy a game, I think if people are honest with themselves, I think everybody is prone to that snap judgment.
You can look at whether or not you're browsing the Xbox Store for what's new, and all you can see is just the thumbnail for the box art in digital form on your TV. For Overwatch, and you're shaking your fist at it. People make those snap judgments, I think.
I think it's important to remember that whether you're involved in the industry, and you're either working on the game, or about to sign a game, or about to review a game, actually the people on the receiving end of that game, or the people that may or may not buy a game, are also making that very quick judgment on some things. I think there's definitely still an element of that which is important to go, is this immediately attractive to me as a player, and does it immediately look fun, or is it something that I can immediately understand? So I think quite often that's half the battle, I think, in cutting through, is can you capture somebody's imagination within that really short space of time?
Yeah, because I often think about the whole game scouting thing, and it sounds like a job which would tap into a lot of the skills we had as games journalists, or the ability to make those calls. But then, yes, also, it just feels a bit high stakes. It's like a game verdict with actual major repercussions.
Yeah, I mean, it is, isn't it? You can look at a game and go, well, I've given it a 73%, but maybe I should have given it a 90 or a 50 or whatever, right? But there's nothing really attached to that other than a reader's disappointment that you haven't understood the magnificence of Battleborn, for example.
But when it comes to...
You don't worry about that, the ability that you enjoy things which are, I would say universally not enjoyed. You don't ever worry that when you see a game like, is this about Battleborn? Or do you get a second pair of eyes on it and you're like, am I crazy about this?
Yeah, I mean, there is, but also ultimately, yes. And I think the difficulty is from the Games Publishing side, there's a significant financial investment in those projects at that point. And obviously, if it does well, fantastic.
If it doesn't do well, then much less fantastic.
I obviously hope the things you select do well for you. And I'm just also aware of, I've been talking to you for a long time, Geraint, and I don't want to eat up your whole evening. So I think I might wrap it up here.
No worries at all.
What have you guys got coming up at PQube? What should people be looking out for? What are your next releases that you can tell us about?
I think across, because we have the three divisions, we've got PQube Asia and PQube Indies, I guess you could say, and our own IP projects. I think in terms of the stuff that's coming up right now, on the Indies side, we've got a game called Discountee, which is coming out in August, which is, I guess it's like a mix of Stardew Valley meets kind of grocery store management, which is really lovely. And on the face of it, it looks really wholesome, but it has a really kind of pithy writing style to it.
So you kind of move into a little town, you take on your aunt's grocery store, and you kind of set that up. So it's kind of wholesome in the initial, but then you obviously then start to need to expand it and improve the efficiency of it. And then you kind of get caught up in the kind of the politics of the town, where the towns, people kind of rebel against your kind of corporate goals, I guess.
So it's kind of wholesome, but also interestingly anti wholesome at the same time, which that's a lovely project. Tomorrow's Souls 2 is coming out towards the end of the year, which is, as I just touched on, is easily one of the favorite games that I've worked on. And on the Asia side, there's a game called Iwakura Aria.
As you know, I'm a big visual novel fan. So I'm a big fan of Steins Gate and the Monterrey Games and stuff like this. And it's made just for us in EYP in a very long time, which is a very dark visual novel set in 1960s Japan, where you're this maid to this mansion, and you're discovering these awful secrets that are taking place within this mansion.
So on the Asia side, that's probably my favorite upcoming release that comes out August of 2014.
Yeah, oh, I'm into that.
But yeah, anything The Majors does, I really enjoy. And obviously, I'm a huge Steins Gate fan. So yeah, this for me is an exciting thing from them because it's the most recent new original work that they've done in quite a long time, and it's lovely.
Didn't they do the, did they help with the Famagon Detective Club? So is that someone else?
I believe they did, yes. I believe they did, yeah. They did that, yeah, on behalf of Nintendo, I believe, yeah.
Yeah, no, they're a great team. Was Regent Loop one of yours back in the day?
It was, yeah. Yeah, Regent Loop from Chemco. That was, yeah, it is excellent.
Actually, we've got another game which is set in the same universe coming out towards the beginning of next year, I think, which would be DMLC, which is another visual novel set in the same, very different, but set in the same universe altogether.
Oh, right. Oh, well.
So, yeah, we're still doing a lot of visual novel stuff. We're doing quite regularly still just because it's a genre we love.
That's awesome. Geraint, thank you so much for talking to me for so long this evening.
No worries. It's been a pleasure.
I feel like I've really kept you away from Oblivion, which I feel bad about.
I really shouldn't be playing this for the second time, to be honest with you. But yeah, it's my go-to late evening comfort food before I wrap up and go to bed.
Do you do the social media thing? Do you like to do it? Can people follow you online?
I do.
I'm not. I mean, mostly, I would probably like to post more than I actually do. I mean, I can be followed on Twitter.
I'm just DeraintEvans on Twitter, but people won't be following that. I don't post as much as I used to, actually, mainly because I don't really have a huge amount of time. I should probably get back to being a little bit more vocal about the stuff that I'm personally working on and things like that.
But yeah, over the last year or so, I've ended up not being around on Twitter as much as I used to be. So maybe that's something I should probably pick up.
Well, yeah, a huge thank you for talking to me and being really great talking about the Nintendo days and Gamesmaster and I'm glad everything's going well now as well.
Oh, thank you. It's been lovely.
We'll have to hang out in person soon.
Yes. Yeah, hopefully we'll hopefully we'll bump into each other across another crowded show floor somewhere and hopefully actually get the chance to go for a beer or something. It's been lovely to talk to you.
Thanks again to Geraint for joining me on the podcast. Now this is the bit where Samuel would usually do an outro and in one swift graceful manoeuvre to explain all the various ways you have of contacting us. I of course am a buffoon and do not have them to hand.
So I will just say if you enjoyed this episode please give it a positive review on Apple Podcasts or Spotify if you're listening there and check out the podcast.
