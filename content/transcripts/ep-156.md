I'm Samuel Roberts, and joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how are these end of the year pre-Xmas times treating you?
Very busy. I have a lot of work to do, because as anyone who has worked in video or media or any kind of feeding an audience content kind of job, you have to feed them over the Christmas holidays. So we have to pull ahead, and we are a team that is never ahead.
That is not my Superbowl, getting ahead.
No one's ever ahead in media, though. They're always behind. That's the thing.
And it's always just like a long slog and, oh, I'll log on on the 27th of December and just make sure this thing goes live. That's basically the life of media people this time of year, you know.
Yeah, it's really grim. I've had some seriously traumatic content producing times for previous Christmases. This year, I think, like, I don't want to jinx it by saying, I think it might go okay, but like, maybe, maybe it'll be all right.
Yeah, okay, good. Well, I've got my fingers crossed for you. And you have to worry about this podcast over the Christmas break, because obviously we are away.
In fact, as people are listening to this, we put Patreon pledges on hold as we are, taking a little pause. So that's interesting. Resumes again in January.
I'm already missing my sweet, sweet green.
Yep. Oh dear, yeah. So someone was saying to me, oh, why don't you set up a Kofi account?
And I was like, it's fine. We'll just take a month off, it's okay.
Yeah, it's honestly, it's fine.
Yeah, it's fine, we'll be okay. Yeah, it's sort of like, it might be different if this was our only job, but it's not our only job. So I think we'll, we're okay to put a lot of work into it.
I think it's, you know, definitely sort of like, we're supporting, obviously, if people want to, but yeah, it's above, above is fine. But yes.
Standing nervous there, pal.
Yeah, I don't know, I just, I'm backing myself into a corner. It's not what you're not meant to do as a PR, you know, is like not, is to just avoid the difficult topics and move on. So yes, a break.
I will also be flying to Japan when people are listening to this, Matthew. So that's the start of my 14 day trip. So to Tokyo, so.
I like to imagine a little blocky polygon figure of you walking across a global world map, a la the world map of Final Fantasy 7. You're gonna get in a little biplane and go along only the light bits of water, not the dark bits.
Oh, what a great transition into this week's subject. So yes, Matthew has been playing disc one of Final Fantasy 7 as evidenced by the fact that he thinks he crossed the world map in a little planer, not an airship, which is what you actually do. No, I am talking about the planer.
No, I know, but you do at the start of the game.
Yeah, well, I've only done disc one.
Yeah, exactly, yeah. So this episode then, I thought with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth coming out in February next year, a massively anticipated game, does the whole Final Fantasy 7 remake thing, but blows it up into the parts of the world map that you explore in the first half of the game. Therefore, expanding the scope significantly past just Midgar that you could explore in the first game.
That's very exciting. It'd be a good time to get Matthew to catch up on the story so far in the game and reach the end of disc one in Final Fantasy 7. So what does that mean if you never played the original PS1 release of Final Fantasy 7?
It's basically the point where, spoiler alert, Aerith dies. It's essentially the end of the first act of the story, though it's maybe slightly more than that. It's quite a lot that happens in that first disc.
So you basically spend the first few hours in the city of Midgar, leave Midgar, go out into the map, and then you get some background detail on the villain in the game, Sephiroth, and you're essentially following in his trail for the next few hours. So we're going to talk about that. But Matthew, I suppose before we get to your exact experience with the game this time, have you been playing on Nintendo Switch?
No, I've been playing it on PS4.
Okay, interesting. So why don't you tell us the story again about you renting a PS1 to play Final Fantasy 7? And I think it'd be the third or fourth time that's come up on the podcast, but nice context for your pre-existing relationship with this game before we kick off.
People who might only just be listening to the podcast now, and I know they exist because we often get messages going, I've just started listening to this and I'm going back through the back catalog. So for their sake, we famously, he said, I grew up in a Nintendo household, we didn't have a PlayStation 1, but I coveted Final Fantasy 7 because if you read multi-format magazines in the mid 90s, well, you're bound to covet Final Fantasy 7. This thing always looked amazing in Games Master.
And so we rented a PS1 with Final Fantasy 7 from a local video shop for one weekend. So I had one weekend to make as much of a dent on it as possible. But we didn't have a memory card.
They didn't rent it out with a memory card. So I had to play Final Fantasy 7 until I died. And then I had to restart Final Fantasy 7.
And so I spent that weekend basically like grinding and learning to speed run Nibga and doing it over and over again and praying. Basically the big sticking point was that big fucking house that appears in that junkyard section.
Hell house.
Hell house. Like if that thing turned up, you were just dead meat.
Yeah.
I don't know if it was just designed for you to like learn that you're to run away from some enemies or something. This game's, to think that this game is designed with that kind of tutorializing in mind is kind of ridiculous because it just kind of leads you to your own devices a lot of the time. So yeah, I basically, I'd play through the Midgar section until I got killed by Hellhouse several times over.
I made it up to the top of the disc where they're gonna blow up the disc and drop a big part of the upper city onto the lower city. And I got killed by a guy up there. He came out of a helicopter.
I think what he did, if I remember correctly, is he had a spell or a move that put your characters in pyramids.
Yeah, well he like sort of froze them, I think. Like he, yeah, yeah.
If all three of you ended up in pyramids, you were basically, you were just dead and it was game over. Because the only way to get yourself out of a pyramid is to attack the pyramid. So my three guys got pyramided and then that was that.
I think we did actually, like at the very tail end of the weekend, get out of Midgar. I think we did a whole clean run, no hell house, no fucking pyramids, climbed the Shinra building, fought whatever that thing is at the top. Yeah, you can already tell this is gonna be a really thorough episode.
You fought that thing at the top and then rode a motorbike down a road in like, it becomes like road rash for like two minutes.
Yeah, that's basically right.
Yeah, and then you're out and that was it. And then we had to skip it back to the video shop. And for years, that was as far as I played.
My brother Alex got it on PC. And I remember watching him play it at my dad's house at weekends. I'd be playing, you know, well, I must have been in 64, but I remember him playing that.
And I remember him having the walkthrough guide because it's so fucking difficult. He never knew what he was meant to be doing. And I remember reading that rather than playing on PC.
So I had this sort of like, as I was playing it now, for the first time, I kept having these like flashbacks to what must have been this walkthrough of like, oh, right, the S, Sid, Rocket Town. There's a rocket and there's a man called Sid inside. I know this, I know this.
And there was another boss he turned up and I had a really clear memory of reading about that. It was like, it's like a big face that comes out of a wall. It's like an evil door in the temple of the ancients.
Maybe it's called Demon Door or something. Yeah, and that was like, oh yeah, I remember them saying that this was a huge difficulty spike and it was, they were right. That walkthrough was bang on the money all those years ago.
It was a difficulty spike and I didn't have fun with that bit. So yes, that's a roundabout way of saying, I've kind of crisscrossed with it and it has a weird, it's left a footprint on my life without having properly played it. And so to finally put that in context and understand what these disjointed memories were and what you and the Discord members have been talking about all these years, I was like, oh, okay, I now know what that thing is.
So it was exciting.
Very inspiring. Yeah, I think the only thing, the only missing detail there is, I believe there's a boss fight at the end of the Midgar section when you get to the end of that big runway, right? Isn't there like a big robot thing?
Oh, is it like a big evil bike or car?
Something like that, yeah. It's sort of like, it's actually like in Final Fantasy 7 remake, you actually fight the car while you're on the bike, I believe. It's like a boss tied to that, yeah.
Yeah, so I can't remember when I started playing Final Fantasy 7 this year, but it was some time ago. And I did Midgar about maybe six months ago when we first talked about doing this episode. And then I took a long break and I've basically been playing the rest of Disc 1 in the last like three or four weeks.
So my memory of Midgar is now basically as patchy as it was before. So thus there's gonna be a lot of like the thing on the road and the man in the tower and the sexy bit. And the sexy bit.
You go to the sexy bee club where they all dress as bees and you like look through peep holes and it's all a little bit twin peaks, it's quite cursed.
What you mean the honey bee inn?
Yeah, that's it.
Is there peep holes in that? I thought you just dressed up as a dress cloud up as a dress.
You either look through the doors or you listen at the doors or you look through key holes, I think, and you can see the legs of a man on a bed and he'll be saying, yeah, that's it. Give me some of that good stuff. And then you'll see someone cavorting around as a bee.
I think you go into one of the rooms and it's him and a load of dudes. That punchline in this game is there quite a lot. You think it's a woman, but it's actually a giant muscly dude, which is powerfully mid-90s.
It is, but I would also argue that sort of like Cloud, sort of like dressed up in FF7 remake. I would say like pretty like, I'd say the approach is a little bit more tactful. And you know, dare I say it, he looks quite nice.
So there's that element to it as well. And I think it's less, it is played for laughs, but I think it's a bit more sensitive in its portrayal.
Oh, yeah, don't get me wrong. This didn't offend me in the slightest. I was just like, oh, oh, 1997.
Oh, I think it's a bit too silly to be offensive, honestly.
Yeah, it's just, it's just, it's just daft. I just, there's a lot of strange sort of streaks of humor in this game, which kind of come out of nowhere. It's a very odd thing.
It's like, I think what's funny about Final Fantasy 7 is it's a much more all encompassing game than people remember. Like there were so many little bits in it that where something bonkers happens or where the story just like goes off on a massive tangent.
Yeah.
Yeah, like I think there's a line I really like in the bit where you're being chased by the dudes, where he says, I wouldn't shack up with a bunch of scrubs like you. He says to the bunch, to all those guys. And I find that quite funny.
And also the very zombie like way they kind of move towards Cloud to basically, I guess, I guess the implication is assault him, which is not great, but you know, that's certainly, yeah, certainly reflection 1997, like you say. So yeah, so that's interesting to hear that you've forgotten a lot of the key details that you didn't know in the first place. That's quite funny.
No, I remember some of it.
Yeah, don't worry.
This episode won't be a total bust.
No, it's, by the way, the end of, the boss at the end of the bike chase is called Motorball. It's like a big, silly sort of like robot thing with a big wheel and yeah, it's quite daft. So yeah, you can see why maybe they thought they needed an extra boss battle at the end of the FF7 remake that wasn't Motorball.
So, it's a Sephiroth that had to come in and do a bit of-
Do you think all the time that they're working on that game, they're like, well, we're only doing Midgar, but that does mean this game is going to end with Motorball. And when are we going to address the Motorball problem in the room? Because that is a thing.
And so they decide to frame the game with all this mad bullshit so they can get a different boss fight in there instead.
Yeah, basically, I think that was probably the panic. That something else has got to happen here. So yeah, Motorball still gets his due.
It's actually an incredibly irritating fight in the remake, Motorball. But yeah, it's actually, but it is interesting to hear you play it because I think, yeah, people do forget a lot of the sillier aspects of these games. And in the kind of way that remake presents the FF7 universe, I don't think they've like, they've actually like, I don't think they've, I think they have embraced the silliness, but at the same time, they can modulate it a little bit by, you know, let's say sticking Hell House in the Coliseum area, right?
Like the kind of arena bit. So you don't have to fight like eight Hell Houses every time you walk past, like from one sector of Midgar to the other. So they sort of like thought about that on some level, I think about how best to address that sort of thing.
So yeah. The kind of irony of Hell House is that he turns up in an area where no one has a house as good as that. So like to not only be faced with a house that's kicking your ass and is demonic.
So you're like, that's bad. But also to be like jealous that you, if you survive this encounter, you basically got to go and live in a fucking bin.
Yeah.
It'd be much easier if you could exercise Hell House or tame it in some way so you could live inside it. I'm assuming there is a house in there. Like you've got rooms.
He's got a little head and he attacks you, remember? So you'd open it and you'd just see his face.
He's meat. He's like solid. He's like meat.
Stop saying meat on this podcast.
Yeah. Yeah.
But yeah, there is a living being inside. So yeah, I mean, you could be like a commuter coming back from the Shinra building and you're like, oh, maybe I'll move into this abandoned property. And there's like a living being inside there, like arms and legs and shit.
That's Hell House's whole trick, is that he thinks a drunk salary man might accidentally move into him on his way home from work.
That's something I've got to ask you about actually. Didn't you say that you have the energy of one of those commuters who's scared of Barrett on the train?
Oh yeah, like in that sequence, there's several sequences where people go down the train and Barrett's just like, don't you look at us, man, all this kind of shit. And you're like, all right. And there's all these guys who've, they either interact with them directly or they're sitting at the kind of front of the car and see him coming and then like piss their pants.
And they're like, oh no, I'm in for a really bad time. Yeah, that's very much me. I also spent a lot of this game thinking for all the big talk of we got to save the planet and we've got to be one of these freedom fighters.
We all know that I'd be straight up Shinra if I lived in this universe. Part of a nice, safe company, nice structure, beautiful offices, climbing the Shinra building, it's just, it's like pleasure after pleasure, that thing. Very envious.
I can, like, I would want to live in that world. And I actually find a lot of the Shinra people you meet, like in their kind of chaos, quite endearing, you know, all these sort of idiots who work for them. I think I'd fit in.
Yeah, which department, do you think you'd work for, like, Heidegger or something? Or would you, like, work with Hojo, but be very wary of getting on his parasite?
I don't really know what Heidegger's deal is.
Is he just, like, the military sort of guy? Is that not his whole thing?
Yeah, but Hojo, Hojo is sort of making weapons. He's, like, the mad scientist, right? He's, like, they keep talking about he's making big weapons.
Heidegger just seems to follow Rufus around, like, just sort of generally brown-nosing him.
Yeah, I think that's because, like, there are a lot of, like, Shinra dudes and Heidegger's in charge of them, I think. He's just sort of, like, military-winged.
But then you've got all the Turks who just seem to be having, like, a very bad time in lots of supernatural caves. You just keep pumping into them and they're, like, we're lost in another fucking cave. And you're, like, yeah, that's me.
Like, a guy joins a company, ends up in a cave somehow on a, I don't know, corporate retreat.
No offense, I don't think the Turks would induct you into their organization. I don't think they think you were cool enough. No offense, I don't think they think I was cool enough either.
But I don't think you'll get in in, I don't think you'll be going around with, you know, Rude and Reno. I don't see that as your vibe. Do you disagree?
Oh, no, that's, that is, that is fair. Well, in which case, I just don't really see where I fit in in the Shinra organization. I'd love to join them, but I'm not Shinra.
I'm definitely not Avalanche. I just think, I just find, they're just all so loud. And I'm just not brave enough for that.
I don't know who else you'd actually want to be in this world.
You don't think you'd be one of the Avalanche guys who gets like, murked on the way to like, try and blow up a Mako plant or something? You don't think you'd be one of those guys?
Yeah. There's probably a bit of that. You do meet, I guess, some people in like random towns.
You just own shops. You seem to be doing okay.
I sort of think, I want to place you in this world now. I want to give you a job. I think like, I would sort of like fail to fit in at the gym at the at Wall Market or whatever it's called.
I think I would struggle to get to make it in there. But you've probably seen me sat at like the noodle bar in there or whatever the little sort of like restaurant bit is. I'd probably be sat in there.
I guess Nibelheim is kind of, is sort of the bath of Final Fantasy 7. Not a big city centre. But it's quite built up.
It's quite nice. It's got like historical element to it.
Well, yeah, there's also, there's Calm as well, which has sort of a similar vibe to it. You know, Calm's a little town outside of Midgar, where it's probably like, you know, like Bristol is sort of like would be Midgar, I guess. Then Calm might be bathed.
Calm might also be Chippenham, or something like, or Keynsham, or something. But not Keynsham. It's not quite got that vibe.
But yeah, there's more work to be done here to figure that out.
To work out where is the Keynsham of Final Fantasy 7's continent.
Which version of Nibelheim would you have lived in? The one that Sephiroth burned down? Or the one that they replaced with fake people who work for Shinra?
That is me. That's like, indebted to the man in a kind of sinister way. Which is like, very much me.
But also enjoying kind of, not countryside living, but like, town living within commuting distance of a big city. Yeah. I think that's me.
I wouldn't, there's no way I'm walking up that mountain that's nearby, though. That's just too much of a hike.
Yeah, Mount Nibble. That'd be like a one time walk for you and then never again. And you tell people, you complain about the one time you walked up there.
Because Catherine insisted you go up there for a day or something.
Oh, Mount Nibble's got like, your friends come to visit, your friends who are like in better shape than you, and are like, oh, let's go up Mount Nibble. And you're like, oh, you don't want to go up there, it's terrible. It is terrible.
It's really confusing to navigate. That's one of the few places where I actually felt like the pre-rendered backgrounds has completely lost me. Like, I just couldn't read what I was looking at at all.
It's just this like, massive, snaking paths, a lot of them go behind one another. Yeah, I had a bad time on Mount Nibble.
Okay, I think we're getting slightly ahead of ourselves. Let's rewind slightly. I was going to tell you a bit about my time with FF7 just to kind of compliment your sort of odd, speedrunning, Dark Souls-esque experience of playing this game where you got pyramided multiple times by a big lad.
So, yeah, basically I played this game after 10, which is my first Final Fantasy, and after 8 as well. So I can't remember how much of this I talked about on that episode we did about Final Fantasy this year to mark 16 coming out. But basically I played 7 afterwards.
It was quite hard to reverse engineer in my head because you have 8 where the characters look semi-realistic and 10 obviously where the characters look realistic in the same way that 8 is. And then suddenly you're looking at these very stylized little sort of like Playmobil men in Final Fantasy 7. And it's quite hard to go back to it.
And then you're like, oh, there's a vast difference between how they look in the battle screens and how they look on the, you know, when you're wandering around the map or whatever. And so there's a little bit of acclimatizing to be done then. And it was actually like there was just there was just always so much sort of like baggage with 7 in terms of like people have very strong opinions on it.
It was either, you know, a really important game to them during the PS1 era. Or you'd hear people be like, I played this and never got it. You know, the old most traded in game ever thing that was sort of like going around.
And yeah, and so I think it's sort of. Yeah, that was like a long sort of like peddled thing that was just not true about like it was the most traded in game of all time. There's never any stats to back that up, but people used to say it.
Yeah, well, I don't know what maybe I've got this into my head, but like I'd read this like definitely in like magazines and on websites in the noughties about how it was the most traded in game ever because people watch like the CG sort of like trailers for on TV, the adverts on TV, and then we're like, oh, this game when they played it, they were like, what is this game? I don't really understand this because, you know, for a lot of people, it was their first touch point with the Japanese RPG genre. So maybe some of that stuff seems surprising.
But I got into it. I played the first disc. I would say I played a lot of it in like early 2003.
I like put it on hold that I came back at Christmas and on Christmas Day watched Aerith die and then like went into the sections afterwards, which involves some snowy mountains, which I quite like. And then I just very gradually just like started sort of like, you know, pushing through the rest of it over the next couple of years. And I think I finished it just before FF7 Advent Children came out because that was a huge event of my teenage life quite tragically, obviously.
So did that. And then, yeah, really loved it. But it's actually like it's like one of the most dense Final Fancies in terms of stuff happening, like a bit of a spoiler alert here, but there is a bit where Cloud goes into space and like that's the thing that happens.
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So that's what I mean. Like this is a game that's got like snowboarding in it, like motorcycle chases and, yeah, Cloud going into space, a man being hit by a lorry.
There's all kinds of like weird shit that happens.
I love, I'm looking forward to talking about the lorry stuff later.
Good stuff. Like, yeah, and then the, like the, well, actually, I don't know if you know what, the thing that happens for the listener's benefit, something comes out of the crater and that's fucking rad. So there's lots of like big, big moments in this and I almost found it exhausting to digest at the time because there's so much going on.
It's a bit different to the pace of 8, which is, 8 was very much paced with like a, I guess like a four act structure. Each disc felt like it was deliberately, like it would peak at the end of a disc with like some big dramatic battle or something like that. And it felt like that was part of the cadence of how you'd play the game.
7 just felt like it was, ram it with more stuff, ram it with more stuff. And there's just so much going on in it. And like the tone of it bends all over the place, like you say, like goes from really jokey to really serious.
The characters go from like really cool looking to incredibly goofy looking. And just like all over the place, really. But that's kind of what's wonderful about it as well, is it like, there is this big umbrella of what FF7 is.
And then Squaresoft just rammed anything they could think of underneath it. And it just, it's just all encompassing, massive, amazing game. And I don't think there's another Final Fantasy that's exactly like it in that respect.
It really does feel very, very, it's complete the right way to be, excessive maybe is the right word for it, but in a good way. So that's my history with the game, Matthew. Yeah, so, do you think, does it make sense to you after what you've played that this is the FF game people seem to revere the most?
Yeah, I get it, in terms of like, the amount of mad stuff you see. And it's all quite interesting, it's all quite memorable, despite me not remembering the exact specifics of a lot of it. You know, I know the broad shape of a lot of these things.
It has this amazing music, it has this really interesting collection of characters. Narratively, it's really experimental, you know, it really keeps you on your toes. Like, there's very little downtime, you know, aside from if you choose to go and kind of grind out in the world map or something, you get through a lot of stuff quite quickly.
Yeah, like the sheer variety of locations packed into it is really impressive. Maybe not the writing itself, but the plots and the characters and yeah, like I say, the sort of set pieces and the kind of incidents that happen along the way, you know, would still be pretty impressive and good if they happen now, you know, at a time where, you know, interactive storytelling, you know, isn't hugely sophisticated or a certain standard has been set and is expected from like the 16-bit RPGs, to come into this thing, which seems so sort of fully formed and just so confident, I get it, is maybe the word. I can understand why it instantly embeds itself in people's heads and there is a timelessness to it as well, and that stuff does still land, you know, it's sort of surprising and shocking and funny in a way that I wasn't really expecting, given that I thought I kind of knew everything about this game and that it was pretty played out, you know, as a sort of pop culture artifact, that it maintains, you know, the ability to, for those things to really land is really impressive.
Yeah, it's just a really good hang. I also began, like, it took me a little while, but I began to kind of appreciate it as an actual, like, mechanical thing as well. You know, for a long time, I held it.
Well, you know, because I mainly played Midgar, which is this sort of linear narrative rush from sort of start to finish. You know, you don't really get a sense of what the game is going to be. And it's not until you start, you know, adding more party members, developing material, getting a range of material, that you begin to sort of see, like, how you're meant to craft and kind of grow these characters out.
And, you know, for the longest time, I thought it was like a JRPG that kind of lacked a, you know, job system or a class system, no sort of skill trees to speak of. I didn't really know what the game was. And that's been really nice to actually kind of get to grips with that.
I feel like people don't talk about that as much as well.
Yeah, it's pretty good on that level, I think. It's sort of like the materia. Basically, they each have each of the abilities in the game have a self-contained progression system, right?
And you basically that the other thing is that you can only equip a finite amount of them. You don't just have unlimited spells like you do in the other games and go from there. You have to slot them into your items and your weapons and equipment, basically.
So you've got a finite number of slots. So you can only progress an ability sort of like XP, I guess, or use it when it's actually equipped into one of those slots. So you can do that.
And then the other thing you can do is you can actually basically connect two together and amplify their ability. So let's say you've got the All spell and the Cure spell. That means when you heal, you will heal everyone in your party at once.
So lots of nifty ways you can do that. Because obviously you can then use all with offensive spells as well. And then you'll get some things later on where you get like sort of like double and triple versions of different abilities as well, which is ends up being really crucial to how you conquer the end game of this, which is basically a series of very, very hard sort of like giant monsters to go out and find and kill.
So yeah, I think it really is. It really does work on that level. So yeah, it's nice for you to observe that.
I think Materia is one of those systems that's held up quite well. It's quite easy to understand, but there's a lot you can do with it, you know?
Yeah, yeah, it did take me a little while to kind of get my head around it. Or rather, like, the only time this game ever really explains itself is in, you know, every once in a while you'll bump into a character who then offers you, like, you know, ten tutorial dialogue options. And, like, going through those is quite hard work, where it's kind of like, tell me about this system.
Like, it doesn't ever show you. Like, you know, Catherine's been watching me getting frustrated at bits of this game and, like, cursing certain old-fashioned ideas. Like, there is quite a lot about it, which is really old.
And you're like, well, nowadays you just wouldn't do this. Nowadays, you know, with a system this good, you would tutorialise it better and you would introduce that more gradually so people maybe appreciated it more. Because I was really missing the point of it until someone at work, Rob Pearson, who was on the podcast previously, was talking me through not like basics, but things that I just missed or I didn't understand why certain things were behaving the way they were.
So like, you know, like that all thing, you know, when you connect an all-mortarier to another spell so you can cast it on everyone at once. But it would only do it once per fight and then never again. And I was like, well, why is that?
And he's like, well, you level up. You know, every level, every time you level up the all, it gets another use in battle. And same with the summons as well, I think.
There was a lot of things like that where I didn't, there were things I couldn't quite unpick why they were behaving the way they were behaving. And like that just wouldn't happen in a modern game. You know, like that stuff is just focus tested into oblivion.
You know, it's all so smooth. And I think, you know, I can imagine a version of this game which does smooth over a few of the rough edges. Like the fact that when you die, it bumps you all the way out to like before the title screen.
That's such a dick move.
Why would you do that?
You know, it's like, why am I? Oh, I've got to go through all this. Okay, it's three button presses, but like, come on.
That does suck in the sense that if you just played this on, let's say a naughty emulation device, you could just load a save state and instantly go back to like, you know, wherever you placed it. So, yeah, I do agree with you on that one. I think it's interesting though, because you're probably right about seven not tutorializing things.
You mentioned the Hell House thing, where you didn't work out at the time that you're supposed to run away from this. It's meant to be kind of a tutorial, but not a tutorial on this thing. But I came into it having played 8 and 10, so I knew that I had to flee that fight before his monster stuff popped out.
Or like, does he do a thing where like a door opens and a load of gas comes out or some bullshit like this?
That thing just fucking kills me so far.
Yeah, it's got to get out of there basically. You and the salary men of Shinra. So I came into it with knowledge of the sphere grid and junctioning and all these dense fantasy systems that...
8 is quite good at explaining how junctioning works. I think even by then they'd worked out they needed to do a little bit more to explain things to you. And 10, the sphere grid is one of those things that is...
if you're not paying attention to the tutorial, you're basically fucked in ever understanding how that thing works. And so that stuff had educated me to the point where nothing in 7 really seemed that perplexing to me. There were some abilities I just straight up never used because I didn't really understand them.
But generally speaking, I got my head around it. I think that probably speaks to the fact that you haven't played many of these games.
Yes, that's true.
Yeah, so that's one part of it. But I think that is also fair criticism. Did you understand the concept of switching the limit break levels?
Does the game explain that? Or did you have to have someone figure that out for you as well? Like the fact that if you wanted to cross slash, you needed to do stuff or whatever.
What do you mean?
So there are different levels of limit break and you have to set the level, which gives you access to the different limit break abilities. So I think there's like level one and that's like your very basic sort of like braver. Maybe it's braver and cross slash are the first two that cloud has.
And then I think you start getting like more of them, but they unlock it. Like you then have to like equip the new limit break level to use them. Did any of that sort of like come up or?
Oh, no, no, I feel the limit break bar and then I use it instantly.
Yeah, that makes sense.
I've got some of them have a choice of like two moves and I can pick between them in a drop down menu.
Yeah, that's right.
But I've not heard of like a level, an extra limit break level.
Yeah. So this took so for cloud, for example, he's got two limit break levels per so two limit breaks per level. So you got your level one ones, which are like your braver and your and cross slash.
And then he's got like on level two, he's got blade beam and clim hazard. And then level three, he's got meteor rain and finishing touch. And then level four is omni slash, which you have to go and unlock.
But basically, like, I think you can't use all of them once. You just have to like select a level and use the ones on that level basically.
Oh, no, I didn't know you could do that.
Yeah. So that's the sort of thing I mean, you know.
Oh, right. Yeah. There's also on the interface, there's a bar which never seems to fill up.
And I don't know what it means.
Oh, I think I know the bar you mean. Yeah. Yeah.
The one next to their names.
Yeah, I think that may be that maybe that's like something like status effects. Like it might have some kind of shield or something like that. Like it might come up later in the game.
I actually can't remember what that does though. But I do always remember thinking that's a weird part of the UI.
Well, I didn't even notice it until like nearing the end of disc one, where I said to Catherine, oh, is that a bit of the interface? Like I've never really noticed that. Yeah.
It says something above it like, oh, yeah, it says barrier.
Yeah.
And then there are two bars and nothing has ever appeared in those bars. I don't know what that is.
Yeah, I think that's if you use like whatever the version of Protect and Shall I Call then in a set. I think that's what that does.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's I mean, there's god knows what other stuff is going over my head. I don't know if there's a way of rearranging some of the drop down menus in battle. Like you have to scroll through nothing to get to something.
And I'm like, is this right? Like some of the summons. It's like the game imagines as a there's a checklist of 20 summons.
And if you've got the top one equipped and the bottom one equipped, you still have to scroll through all the empty space to get to the bottom one.
Yeah, I think you can I think you can rearrange your inventory. But I don't think you can do that with summons. I might be wrong about that.
I don't think you can.
The other thing was while we're talking the battle system, I had to put it on to the mode where everything stops when you're making decisions.
Oh, yeah, everyone does that, though.
Oh, OK, good. Because I was like, how the fuck I'm literally not fast enough to keep up with this. Oh, I tell you the thing that really pissed me off.
When you select a phoenix down and one guy's dead, he should automatically go, the dead guy, right? That's the guy you want to bring back to life, rather than go, no, you have to press the d-pad buttons. And for some reason, sometimes it highlights the enemy you're fighting.
And it's like, this guy, you want to bring this life monster back to dea- And you're like, no, no, I obviously want to bring fucking dead Tifa back to life.
It's like Dead Island's dead Tifa.
Why would I want to use anything nice on a monster? That shouldn't be an option.
Ah, but you're wrong, Matthew, because the zombie ability means that healing spells will injure them. So you actually do have an incentive to use it sometimes. But you can do it for them.
But you don't do it for, like, you know, if it's a zombie, I'm like, oh, OK, automatically that's fine. But like, if it's like a frog that also turns you into a frog, so that's a thing. I'd never heal that guy.
No, that's fair. Well, I'll save more of your lowlights for the part two, Matthew, because we've got lots to discuss there. Can I ask you this, though, actually?
One thing that I think is still dazzling about the battles in FF7 is that camera. I just think that the battles look fucking great, like the staging of them and the way that the camera zooms in and out and stuff like that. If you think about the progression between SNES, FF games and that, that 3D camera is doing so much heavy lifting to make the battle seem more exciting than they actually are.
I don't know if you noted that either.
Yeah, like constantly swooping around. I also played quite a lot of this game on the PS4 version. You can play it at triple speed.
Yeah, yeah.
So I definitely did that for when I was just like grinding out in the world map and things. And that thing's just like demented at triple speed. Like the cameras are scuttling all over the place.
It's, yeah, it's got great energy to it. It has a real sense of style.
Well, do you feel like Roger Moore going in the big spun around basically when you're watching that thing at three times speed? I would imagine it.
It's just like a real kind of style, like a filmmaker who's like an ultra stylist, just having a way with the time. It's a bit like Michael Bay is filming every battle with just like zooms and sweeps. And you're like, oh my God, it's like Oliver Stone directed those battles.
Yeah, it's like how, yeah, I can see the sort of like the connection between this and Ambulance, for example.
Oh, Tony Scott.
Yeah, yeah, I can see that. So yeah, yeah, okay, interesting. So last question, Matthew, before we get into some, you recapping the story and some deeper thoughts on this game.
Did FF7 Remake leave you with a hankering to know more? I know you were mostly watching Catherine play this, but I was curious to know how much it planted the seeds of, well, what is this actually? Should I like get under the skin of what this is?
So I, you know, it's going to be a big part of games for the next 10 years, this remake stuff. Like, should I kind of like understand what the deal is? Like, to what extent did Remake like plant that seed for you?
Yeah, definitely. I mean, you know, watching Catherine play Remake, you know, I've played the first couple of hours of it myself, but watching her play it, you know, I had played Midgar, and so I remembered a lot of it. And, you know, when you have a, like, a foundational text that's as iconic and memorable as this, it's where a remake makes a lot of sense, because there's so much stuff you just want to see in modern graphics.
You just want to see, oh, I wonder what that thing will look like. I wonder how they'll do this moment. I wonder what this set piece will be like.
You know, knowing that it's a bit more energetic than just the traditional turn-based battle, like, I kind of want to see some of these fights in real time. You know, the cinematics in Final Fantasy 7 still have, like, their charm to them. But, like, seeing those stories play out with, like, amazing CG, you know, has a huge amount of appeal.
And, you know, when I got to the end of Disc 1, you know, I'm so energized for Rebirth now and definitely playing Remake as well so I can go into Rebirth. If anything, like, you know, I had no investment in this Remake project at all. And I don't really know where people land on the kind of modifications they have made to it.
That it is this, it has this slightly, like, meta framing device going on and that it's kind of playing with your expectations. It isn't a straight Remake and, like, playing, you know, I didn't really care about any of that. I don't still really know how I feel about it without having played Remake for myself.
But on the strength of what I play in Disc 1, you do think, I can sympathise with people who might think, why, you know, why do you need to mess with this, you know? Like, just these sights and sounds are good enough. It maybe doesn't need much, much, you know, you're probably over egg the pudding.
Like, just seeing these places renewed would be enough. You know, I don't need to see them removed and then enter into this weird dialogue with, you know, the legacy of Final Fantasy 7 through its own remake, necessarily. But I don't know, how did you feel about all that extra gubbins?
I think you basically arrived at the conclusion, everyone else did, but like, later. So, yeah, with less, you know, you have less background with it, but you still understood, I think, what the overall sentiment was. I guess this is just from, you know, anecdotal sort of like evidence or discussion with people.
But I think that most people felt like it was the, it was like the problems that plagued Kingdom Hearts creeping into Final Fantasy 7. So, Kingdom Hearts as the first game is very straightforward about like a boy who basically tries to find his friends and goes to a bunch of Disney worlds, gets involved with a plot of those films as a kind of like Mary Sue type figure, and then like exits the story and then continues on his own larger meta story. And it's quite straightforward, like just a light and dark battle, finish the game, you know, almost finds his friends, but they just like misses him at the last minute basically and then has to kind of start again next time.
And then it becomes this whole thing of like, they're like each human in the world has a nobody who's kind of like this sort of like evil clone of them themselves. There's this whole council of like Tetsuya Nomura-ass guys with like spiky hair, like Organization 13 who pop up everywhere. They say, and then it's just like you've got like all this stuff where like Goofy's going Organization 13 and you're like, we've got off the boil here somewhere.
And then it just gets like madder and madder from there. And like basically they just start to bury the thing that was good and pure about Kingdom Hearts. And the problem is, I think it's created this thing now where that fandom likes that stuff and doesn't really care about the Disney stuff or the Final Fantasy stuff in the same way because they are investing in its own lore.
And like I've read like some news story, I think. I can't remember which website it was. So they talked about how there's like some Kingdom Hearts themed hotel room that Nomura worked on.
And people are looking at it for like lore crafting or like theory crafting purposes. This is the game where it's like Sora turns up, he teams up with Tarzan and he fucks up the bloody like, I don't know, sort of Rudyard Kipling ass character guy with the gun, I can't remember his name. I can't remember who the fuck I'm talking about.
What's his name? What's the British guy called? I don't know, him.
Him and then there's like probably a fight, there's like a fight with an invisible like bug or something.
He's like Tarzan's Gaston.
Yeah.
He's a Gaston reskin.
Yeah, basically. So, yeah, just sort of like, you know, big colonial energy to that boss basically. And like you, without the Phil Collins, the background probably because it was too expensive, I'm guessing.
And also just spares the audience a bit of Phil Collins, which is an act of kindness by Square Enix. So got pulled all over the place, all kind of like warped basically. You're like, I think people just sense that the author's hand at work with this as well.
You know, like it was like, yeah, it couldn't just be a straight FF7 remake. Maybe that would have been too predictable. And I think at first it plants seeds of intrigue with like, oh, well, what's going on here, actually, because not everything's happening exactly the same way.
And then like when the penny drops and you're like, oh, it's fucking Sephiroth. You're like, it's just it's a bit of a shrug. But it's still the bits of like FF7 that Nomura will allow you to enjoy.
It is like still the appeal of these games. Like the rebirth trailers they put out so far, obviously fantastic. And they're just rammed with stuff.
They're like, here's us giving you all the things you want to see in this. And like to enjoy it, you just got to put up with a little bit of bullshit that reframes this as the creatures wrestle with their own creation. That's kind of like the journey, basically.
Does that help, Matthew?
Yeah, it's like that. Eat your vegetables.
OK, Matthew, let's take a quick break and we'll come back with some deeper thoughts and you recapping the story of this game.
Yes, that's it.
Welcome back to the podcast. Go.
Right. Cloud?
Yep.
He turns up in Midgar, and he works with, well, Shinra would call them a terrorist organization called Avalanche, who are going around blowing up Mako reactors, which are power stations that draw energy from the planet. Is Cloud an Erkugun for hire? Is that how he fell in with this lot?
Yeah, he's like a mercenary, basically.
Yeah, so he's turned up, he does that. You go around blowing up the reactors with Avalanche, and which is Barrett, who's a man, he's got a... Is his arm a gun, or has he got a special gun glove?
His arm is a gun, he got his hands shot off and he replaced the gun.
Okay, there's him, there's Tifa, who for the longest time I thought was Barrett's wife.
I don't know how... That's a failure on the part of the writers. They should be fucking those two.
That's what I think.
Well, I mean, she was kind of... I had a vague idea that there is a sort of romance, or would you even call it a romance system in this game?
It's like an element of it, yeah.
You can go on a date. I knew that there was a famous scene where you'd go on a date with a character and I've been trying to sort of will that to be Tifa.
By having her in my party and I don't feel like there's a lot of branching moments where I've had a chance to express much to her, but I've not done anything weird in front of her basically. Where I've been noticeably cold towards Aerith, for most of Disc 1, which I'll get into. As cold as you can be in a game where you can't really express yourself, I guess, is the thing.
Anyway, yeah, they all live in this bar and you go there and you blow up. Several reactors get blown up and in the course of blowing up these reactors, you sort of, the cloud splits off and meets Aerith, a girl selling flowers in this sort of like busted church who is of some interest to Shinra, the big organization who make the reactors. I think that's right.
There's definitely the Turks turn up at the church for some reason.
Yeah, that's right. They're like keeping an eye on her because she's got connections to, well, actually I'll let you talk about it.
Yeah, and there's quite a good bit where you run around some rafters like dropping bags on people.
Yeah, that bit rules.
Yeah, and it plays like a good, this game has got one of the all time great ticking clock theme tunes of like, oh my God, you're in so much trouble, everything's going wrong where it's, you know, it's like do, do, ha, do, do, and you're like, oh shit, and you hear, even here it's like click, cluck, tick, cluck, tick, cluck in the background. Great, whenever that tune's playing, you're in a good scene in that game.
I'm that sicko's meme right now. That's me listening to you talk about that bit.
That song's awesome. Yeah, so she works, you sort of become friends with her and then loads of people get taken to a brothel. I think that's kind of the shape of it.
But aren't you aiming to infiltrate something by going to the brothel? Isn't that the point? Like, isn't there a connection between Don Corneo, the guy who owns the brothel and then Shinra?
Oh, I thought it was just that she got kicked. So you're kind of walking back home past the Hell House stretch of town. And then you see Tifa, or you see Tifa or Aerith, you see one of the women in this sort of brothel caravan.
That's one of the strangest moments of the game, I think. Cause aren't you like at some kiddies play park and it's like, oh, there's Tifa in a nice dress going past or whatever.
That's a great turn in a game because you're suddenly having to do this very elaborate set piece sort of out of nowhere that someone's just been kidnapped. There is a bigger gain from doing that. But I thought primarily you were trying to save Tifa first and foremost.
That is, yeah, I think she, okay, I think I've remembered this. So Tifa's going into Don Corneo's mansion in order to get closer to Shinra. I think is the point, and you and Aerith want to go in after her because you're worried about her, basically, and I think that's what happens there.
Yes, but in order to infiltrate it, you have to go through this quite long, sort of goofy side quest to disguise yourself as a lady and go in to get into his brothel. And so you sort of take part in all these mini games, and the better you do in each individual sort of game, you get like a dress and some perfume. I think you get some like sexy lingerie and, you know, the better a package you put together.
We should use a better word, then. I mean, you know, that's tough, I've got to say.
Well, yeah, you know, that's what Don Corneille would think. The better offering you can make, you get some kind of prize for that eventually. It's a really characterful section of the game that way, because you're in this like, yeah, kind of like cut, like rundown kind of market, and there's always like quite strange businesses full of sort of charismatic drunks and sort of kind of freaky people and like weird commuters.
And given that you don't see like a vast amount of mid-grain, it's actually quite like a quite limited route that you'll push down quite quickly. You come away with like a really great sense of the place and the people who live there and the sort of just, you know, the slightly kind of tired vibe or these people who are who've kind of making, you know, a sort of swing of it, living in this slums in the sort of shadow of this giant plate. And that's really, really evocative, even with all like the sort of slightly seedy stuff.
It's very funny. Like the honeybee in is like has played this really creepy tune. And like I said, it's like there's definitely a Twin Peaks fan on the staff, because when you look into the rooms, they've all got that like slight red room, you know, look to them.
And, you know, lots of like weird drapes and weird patterns on the floor. And it plays like a slightly kind of sort of sleuthy kind of noirish, sort of jazzy tune and things like that. It's it feels it feels like quite a clear homage to me anyway.
But yeah, you go through all that, you go into Don Corneille's base and I think that's where you find out that they're going to blow up the disc.
Yeah.
And they're going to drop they're going to like drop this disc on one of the slums to basically try and kill Avalanche because, you know, they're a guerrilla army in the area. So if you get rid of everyone and you fight your way to the top of the tower past several save points that I couldn't use when I was 12 or whatever. But now I use them an awful lot and it was a real pleasure.
This game with save points, I recommend it.
That should be in a review, I think, you know what I mean?
Yeah. Got to the top, survived the pyramids because I remembered that. I remembered to attack the pyramids.
But in the course of it, a lot of your Avalanche buddies get murdered and fall to their deaths. And the disc does drop and crushes a huge section of the town.
The plate. The plate.
The plate. Sorry. But luckily your friends are okay.
So you come out and then you're like, yeah.
Not Bigg's Wedge and Jesse, they're fucked.
No, it's bad for them. Do they survive in a remake?
I think like Wedge does. Do you like the bits of dialogue that are like, oh, I'm so sorry you're dead or I don't really know who you were actually, fuck you kind of like dialogue options you could give a response to each one? Did you like that?
Oh, I don't really remember that.
I think each one, you can like, there's one of two things you can say to them. It's like, don't say this is the last, the last time we'll meet or something like that. But then there's another one that's like, I don't really care.
Like this with each one. And they could, the last thing that they will ever hear will be something like cold that Cloud says. I'm pretty sure that's in the game.
I would have said whatever made Tifa fancy me. So remember, that's that was like the core of all my thinking with this game.
So I keep thinking about what you said about Mass Effect, how it's like, well, I stopped at my girlfriend, that's Commander Shepard's girlfriend, I like the idea that you're still very invested in like, well, this was Cloud's girlfriend, I'm trying to help Cloud have a nice girlfriend.
She's quite a like strange presentation, like she seems so obviously childlike.
She's very, just very passive character, that's the thing.
I don't really get how old she like, she seems like a kid, and that's a bit like, nah, they're all about the same age.
They're all about like, 17, 18 kind of age.
They don't really set like, she doesn't come across that, she comes across as, I mean, maybe like innocent, but quite sort of simple and naive.
I think when she's like, oh, actually, well, actually, I don't want to give things away about Crisis Core now, because you don't know exactly what happens in this. So I'll leave that for now. You carry on, Matthew.
Yes. And I think it's then after this that you climb the Shinra building for, for reasons. One of the greatest video game stories ever told this.
You decide to climb the building. I know that you can walk up a load of stairs. I think I took a lift.
And I had a great time in this section, because like I said before, you know, you've spent all this time in the slums, and it's all very industrial and brown and sad. And there's lots of like freaky dudes in sewer pipes who say slightly cryptic things to you, which I didn't really understand. There's lots of...
This game hints at a lot of strange stuff, which I think is just for mood, you know, unless there's shocking revelations to come. But in the Shinra building, it suddenly becomes like a lot simpler. It's very, very glossy.
You know, it's this like meant to be this like grotesque, the absolute peak of of kind of corporate indulgence. But it just looks like a really nice workplace to me. And it's full of all these kind of Shinra executives constantly wigging out because, you know, everyone there is sort of evil.
It's a real kind of dog-eat-dog world. And it's probably one of my favourite things about the whole of playing Disc 1 is the presence of Shinra and how, you know, they're this sort of quite convincing enemy in that they're so big and so successful and all-encompassing. Like there's like no question they're a legitimate threat.
There are some really like nasty villains in the mix, but there are also some quite jokey people. There's always like weird office politics. There's almost like an entire soap opera playing out in the ranks of Shinra that you're constantly kind of hearing bits of as you go through the world.
You keep bumping into them and you sort of hear what the different factions are up to and they're all in complete disagreement over like who should be in charge and what should be the direction of the company and that's really good. They're just a really, really good villain and they're deployed. Like they always turn up just when you're like missing them a little bit.
Yeah, I love Shinra. I'm just going to jump in and say the reason that they go to the Shinra building is because Aerith is kidnapped and they need to get her.
Oh no, that was Tifa.
That was Tifa. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, no, I agree with you.
I think that the Turks are really good because I think they walk a fine line between they are a little bit intimidating, like Seng or whatever he's called. He's a little bit intimidating and I like Reno and Rude as a combination and yeah, I think they just turn up and they're a bit of fun. They're just going to chuck in a sub boss for a bit of a laugh and at the same time, yeah, the top tier are just absolute bastards but they're all quite distinctive bastards as well.
Yeah, they all have their own shit going on which I like and there's a bit of back biting going on, a bit of backstabbing going on and you get the impression that Hojo is completely fucking off the reservation but no one really has the power to stop him so he just does whatever he wants. Yeah. Yeah, I think I agree that's really richly done.
Yeah, and I've only fought them a couple of times, I think I fought the Turks a couple of times and when you get to the top of the tower the president of Shinra has been killed by Sephiroth and you meet his soon to be successor Rufus and he's quite a flamboyant character, you fight him on the roof of the building, he's got a pet dog he attacks you with and he's wearing a quite cool white suit. I didn't really remember this from the original, in my head it all had quite a universal art style throughout but what I really like is that in the world map and the cutscenes the characters are presented as almost like chibi little figures with quite chunky limbs but in the battles you get to see the quote unquote photorealistic version of them and that's always cool it's like you're zooming in just a little bit and you get to suddenly see like Rufus in his coat and like what his hair looks like and the kind of you know the heroes you see them in more detail and you know it's only in the fights that they look really cool and then you're back to this this almost like sort of action figure way of playing out the story that's that's always very charming but yeah I just that whole Shinra building section like the fact that each floor kind of has like a puzzle gimmick to it there's like a one way you kind of build this model of a city there's another one with a very elaborate like library puzzle where you're kind of collecting all these books it was a bit of a pain in the ass and I may have had to use a walkthrough in the end for some of this stuff but like I think it's definitely part of the game's appeal that it can be like here's a long.
So, we've got Red 13, and we've got that dog, Red 13. In my head, my memory was, you fought that dog.
I don't think so, no.
No, you don't, no. I thought he came out of a tank and was like mad that you'd smashed up the lab.
He's a chill dude.
Yeah, but a monster does come out of a tank and you fight that.
Jenova, is that Jenova?
Yeah, maybe it's a sustainable monster.
Maybe it's another monster, actually, but then Jenova you fight later on. But you see Jenova in the thing, don't you? Right, you can go up to the little viewing window and see Jenova.
Another thing, so in a long list of weird things that really jumped out, along with the ticking clock theme tune, is this game does a very good line in something horrible is inside a tank that you can't really see. There's a lot of places where people look through windows and maybe you get to look through the window well and you get to see a bit of what's inside. There's a lot of horrors, contained horrors.
Which, like, that's just good, that's just good sci-fi shit, you know?
Yeah, nice observation that, contained horrors.
I love a good tank. There's a good, because that's feet go up and you're like, what's in this tank? And they're like, it says like, Jenova on it, I think.
Yeah.
And it's all a bit like, oh my God, there's something, it looks like sort of meat and tendrils.
Yeah, also, shout out to that, that sort of like corporate sort of like shinry music that plays that, do, do. It's like the FF7 music, but like office kind of like lift version kind of thing.
Yeah, but it's got a good, like you're in the office after hours, you know, it's slightly kind of quiet, slightly low key, but. Yeah, I think it's also building. It's a great like, oh, you're building to something quite big here, you know?
Yeah, I think like that building really succeeds as like a space in a world that feels like you're sort of existed before you got there. You know what I mean? Like it feels like if it's got, there's like good world building, I think, in Midgar generally, but it's like plausible that place.
And then that building is like, oh yeah, there's all these people here who work for this company and live their lives like above this plate. And that's kind of like how it is. So yeah, sorry to derail you there, Matthew.
No, not at all, no. Yes, you fight the big monsters, you then escape the building on your motorbike and that takes you out of Midgar. And then you are in...
Now, I don't really know how exactly the world works narratively. If there are events you can miss by not going to them or if it subtly leads you everywhere. Like it seems weirdly freeform in places.
No, you can't miss anything because the thing you have to do after that is calm, right? You go to that village and then you hear about Nibelheim. Is that not what happens?
And then you can't actually like leave that continent because there's a big snake in the...
Yeah, so it does a lot of stuff where it gates off things with like vehicles. But I swear there are places where I'm like, oh, I wouldn't necessarily have come here and have seen that, you know, like I don't actually know what I, you know, that I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit here, but there's like a place called Gone Gaga. Very silly name for a place.
Side note, but you go there and you just see the Turks up to something, but you don't get any like items or equipment or vehicles. You don't fight a boss there. You just see the Turks doing some stuff.
And it did make me wonder if the game was, you know, allowed you to miss those things or if something else would have taken me there later and I would have seen it.
I think it sometimes just creates like, you'll get through one of the things gating a bunch of stuff and then you can go and do a few things like at your own pace, like the Mount Fort Condor stuff, for example, like, you know, that sort of thing that I don't think you have to do or at least like...
Well, I went there and couldn't really do anything. Like it felt like I couldn't trigger it or it was...
Right, you have to come back later maybe.
Right, yeah.
But yeah, in any case, like, yeah, I think it is always leading you along, but I think it does try and let you like at least explore.
You know, I guess like after, you know, Mid Girl, which like, when I think back to it, it's actually now doing it, you know, I got through it quite quickly, but I remember I used to think that could be a whole game, you know, because, you know, in my head it was like 20 hours. It obviously wasn't. It's like, it's like maybe like four or five hours or something.
It's quite a short little section, but when you come out of that and you're suddenly in this like, you know, open world, you know, that almost feels like, oh, here's the game now. This is what the game's actually gonna be like. And, you know, that's sort of, you know, a little bit shocking in its own way.
I think it doesn't like, it doesn't, I wouldn't say like it loses the thread at this point, but it becomes a little bit more sort of vague and open in that you are on the trail of Sephiroth, you know, always kind of pursuing this man in a black coat. And that's the sort of impetus to move between different locations. It always kind of comes back to that.
And that's the sort of backbone of what you're going to be doing in this one. But you go to these kind of interesting locations along the way. So that's right, you go to this town and you have a, you go to Kaam and you have a kind of flashback to a point in the past.
I think it's like two years, something like that. Maybe it's a few more years than that actually.
I think it might be five.
Yeah, five, five is right, yeah.
Where a load of soldiers and Sephiroth came to this town to investigate something and it's being, who's recalling this? I must admit, some of the flashback stuff confuses me in terms of like, there's deliberately some stuff that's a bit screwy about it. And I don't really know what it is.
Like I don't really know where that storyline's going even after all these years, but I know that there is something screwy with the flashbacks and all is not as it seems, but Tifa's there as like a young guide. Cloud is there working with Sephiroth.
But Tifa doesn't remember Cloud, right?
Well, that's it. She's like, you weren't there and you didn't do that, but he's there and he remembers it that way. So there's some kind of conflict there, but the long and short of it is you kind of, I think this is meant to be, isn't this meant to be the origins of Sephiroth sort of going a bit mad?
You kind of go up into the mountains to this laboratory where you find another tank with a window on it that you look through and he kind of goes berserk. That's how I remember it. And then burns the town down.
Yeah, that's right. He finds out he was created, doesn't he? He finds out he was created and not that he, and like his life is kind of a lie.
That's basically his revelation. He's in that library in the mansion reading books, like for days, right? And that's like, and then he, and then he's like, and then the town is burning.
And that's basically, and then he turns around in that famous shot. And then like, you know, basically grinning as the town burns. Like it's a classic Fill in Origin story really, you know?
Yeah, yeah. And this sets up like why you're going to be searching for this person. And like that becomes like the reason that you're moving between these towns.
And what I like about it though, is that like each place you rock up has its own little kind of sort of drama going on that you often have to solve to progress or to get through it or to get, you know, some MacGuffin, which will unlock the next vehicle, the next kind of step of the way. So even though I did this all recently, maybe the order of this will be wildly off, but you go to, you have to learn to catch a chocobo to ride across some sand, which if you walked across it, this big snake comes out and gets you, but the chocobos can run across it. And that takes you to these mithral caves, which are-
But before that, before that, you see the snake impaled on the tree, don't you?
Oh yeah, that's a really dramatic sight that I forgot.
But that's like the whole thing, because they create this breadcrumb trail, because you find the president of Shinra with a sword stuck in his back, like the, you know, his, is it Masamune or whatever they call it, I don't know. His Sephiroth big sword. And Sephiroth's meant to be dead.
And the reason you're watching the flashback is that was the last time he was seen five years ago. So he's not meant to be alive, but he clearly, it would appear that he is. And so you are on the trail of Sephiroth, and the next thing you see in that trail is that snake, right?
And it's like, it's a pretty amazing sight.
Yeah, that is great. I mean, that's the last, like, you meet Sephiroth then in person from that point on. But that kind of bloody footprint trail kind of dries up quite quickly after that.
But yeah, you go through these mines, and then you get to a place called Junon, which is like a giant sort of gun in placement, basically. It's like a town built around a huge cannon.
That's fucking rad. I love that shit.
Yeah, that was really cool. There's a not very good minigame where you have to resuscitate a girl who's drowned.
Oh yeah, that's tough.
I didn't understand that. And that was a big GamesRadar SEO win for how to resuscitate a Final Fantasy 7 girl.
Actually, it wasn't GamesRadar, it was someone, it was one of those sites. And then you walk up and like, I guess this is kind of what you were saying, like, this is like the everything game. You know, you go to this town, you fight a mad boss, you then have to do a minigame to like breathe, give someone the kind of kiss of life.
They come back to life. You then head upstairs at the town and find out that there's a huge kind of military gathering for the now president of Shinra Rufus. And you get a soldier costume, you disguise yourself, but in order to sort of sneak in, you have to take part of a giant parade in in Rufus' honor, you know, which is like an, then becomes a kind of like a rhythm marching game, which the better you do, like it's viewed from the perspective of a TV camera crew, and they're like commentating on it.
Yeah.
And they're like, oh, look at this awful guy marching out if you're not very good at it. And people point out, you know, what bad job you're doing. And like, the whole television broadcast approval rating goes up or down based on how good just you are at marching, which is like very endearing and like just, you know, clearly huge amount of work has gone into this one mini game, which is maybe like 10 seconds long.
And as far as I can tell, you can't do it again. There isn't a mini game you can just endlessly rerun. It's just part of its story, you know?
That's really good. That culminates with you kind of like eavesdropping on Rufus and Highdigger, who's like another kind of Shinra high up who kind of follows Rufus around, kind of a real bootlicker, this big kind of round green man. And you sneak into his ship and stir away as, you know, they're heading to where Sephiroth has been sighted, I think is the gist of it.
Onboard that ship, Sephiroth turns up himself, and you kind of fight this sort of monster. Now I don't really understand the whole Sephiroth, like what he's up to, because every time he turns up, he kind of makes a monster happen.
You don't, I would say you don't know exactly all the context yet for what is happening with Sephiroth. I would say it's probably useful to say.
Okay, well, that's good, because I didn't understand it. But he turns up and like his role in Disc 1 is that you keep bumping into him and he leaves behind like a giant meat monster that you then fight. And they get like increasingly gribbly.
And, you know, where he can where he where he kind of carries these things, how he carries these things about, I don't know, but you know, I could do without that. After you fight on this thing, you are in like a huge swerve from like fighting a horrible meat monster in a kind of, you know, seemingly doomed airship. You turn up in Cossardale Sol, which is just like a really nice beach town.
There's not a lot going on in there in Disc 1, as far as I could tell.
There's definitely much going on there, but it's just like, I think it's just like, I think it's just a nice little, let's give you a little pause from like intense moments. Like, there's like a nice place you could just go and hang out if you want to. I think that's kind of like the vibe of Cossardale Sol, really.
That makes sense. Well, yeah, I mean, it does look nice. Like you suddenly have this completely different like colour palette.
It's all like beautiful oceans and like, it looks like, you know, Portugal or Spain. I mean, it's called Cossardale Sol, obviously.
You can buy a house there later on as well.
Oh, really? It's not a hell house, is it?
Yeah, just floating.
I'm very suspicious of property in this world.
That's weird. There's a house on this beach. That's very strange.
Like in the water. Like, what's the deal with that? Just open the door.
Oh, no, it's wet hell house.
That's so funny. Oh dear. Yeah.
Okay. I don't think it has a plot purpose, Cossardale Sol, strictly. I don't think so.
It's nice. Cossardale Sol has, like, big Final Fantasy 15 energy.
Yeah, I would say that's probably fair.
It's just, like, a nice hang, whatever. You can buy some stuff. You can talk to some characters.
There's probably some amazing material there that I missed. That seems to be the gist of most walkthroughs, Aerith, where they're like, don't leave this place without having picked this up in Disc 1. I'm like, oh, wow, so much for that.
I think it also exists to be like, oh, people who make good money from Shinra can go on holiday here. I mean, that's kind of like the weird contradiction. It's like a bit of commentary on the real world, I guess, where there's these bustling metropolises that are basically strangling the planet, and then at the same time, you can be rich enough to jet set off to this holiday while the world burns kind of thing.
I think there's a little bit of-
Maybe Cossardale's soul is bathed. It's like your escape from London.
Yeah, but we've got a river that sometimes smells of poo. It's not quite the same vibe as being by the sunny ocean. These are nice ducks, though.
Anyway, carry on.
Yes. Then you head to Mount Coral, which is the route to the Golden Saucer Arcade. On Mount Coral, you find out a little bit more about Barrett's backstory and about how he sort of started to become a freedom fighter.
Actually, it's one of the more effective bits of this whole continent is that you're constantly coming across these towns and villages that have been dicked over by Shinra in some way, or basically all bought into Shinra a few years ago, and it's all been their undoing. It feels like they all got sold into having a reactor nearby, and then the reactors inevitably blew up, and all the men in the village got killed in the explosion, or the reactor has so fucked up the land that you can't file on there and everyone's dead. So it really sells you on this sort of like, you know, ongoing ecological crisis, sort of like Shinra kind of fracking the shit out of everything.
And this, you get a big dose of that in this area where Barrett's whole backstory is about how he fell out with this guy called something. Dime? Yeah, who I think Dime was like the original kind of freedom fighter and they all kind of ignored him much to their mistake.
And yeah, so that sets up like this little arc which kind of plays out over the next hour or so. Another nice little trick it does, which I guess isn't wildly different for RPGs, the idea of finding out a side character's backstory.
It's like a Barrett loyalty mission kind of thing.
Yeah, exactly. And that's quite nicely done. In the middle of that, you go to Golden Saucer, which is like this mad...
It's basically like mini game city. You go there and there's like 20 different mini games you can play for this special golden currency. Quite annoying that you need to use the currency to save in the Golden Saucer.
It's so kind of up its own capitalist arse that you just can't do anything here without spending money, which means playing mini games that I was quite bad at.
I like the idea that you were like, I was all in on saving in Final Fantasy 7 after my troubled childhood, but now I'm not so sure.
I couldn't save. I had to play this very bad game about, you feed a moogle.
Oh, it's fucking shit that one.
Yeah, you have to keep feeding it till it is able to fly or something. It feels a bit like a Tanegotchi.
Yeah, there's some easier ways to get the currency, to farm the currency than that. I think the bike chase one is one of the easier ways, if I remember. I might be wrong about that, but I'm pretty sure it is.
Oh, I didn't play that one.
Yeah, probably because you played the first time, you're like, I've had enough of that, and you moved on.
I guess this is Final Fantasy 7's Yakuza section, where everything is very, it's like the bright neon lights of this sort of pleasure palace. There's loads of games to play. There's loads of, like, what I imagine are amazing material and prizes if you don't mind grinding for like 20 hours to earn this kind of extra currency.
It's got like, this is where the Yakuza Shogi heads are going to really like be in their element. Like, yeah, this extreme patience.
The Gold Saucer is one of the ways in which Danny Lucas, who used to work at The Future, tried to get me to play Final Fantasy 14 because it has a Gold Saucer and it has like a load of mini games in it, including like, Triple Dryad from Final Fantasy 8, for example. Yeah, so you can see why that would be quite appealing in an MMO with a bunch of other people in it. So, yeah, yeah, but interesting.
But by all means, keep taking us through The Gold Saucer, Matthew.
Yeah, you go through The Gold Saucer. It's got a rad hotel, which is like sort of a spooky haunted hotel.
I like that's the only accommodation there. There's nowhere else you can stay.
Yeah, it's like Luigi's Mansion. It's really gimmicky. You know, like everything is like, you know, all the staff are like ghosts and shit.
It looks very irritating. Could they go on your thing? I guess kids would love if you took them there.
One of the things I found very charming about The Gold Saucer is each area you go to links to all the other areas. So each area has to have like eight portals to the other areas. And each area has a different way of showing those portals.
So like in The Haunted Hotel, outside all the portal name, all the area names are written on like gravestones. And you have to go up to these gravestones and then like trap doors kind of swoop you to the next area where, you know, in other places they may look like, you know, Star Trek teleporters or whatever. It's just like...
There's like such an art lift in this section of the game. Like, this is just like half the art budget just on this one area. It's absolutely ludicrous.
And that place, like... This is definitely one of the locations where you think Rebirth is going to have to like really deliver on this. Because it's going to have to look truly like just HD 4K mind blowing.
Like, HD are out the wazoo because it looks pretty good, you know, in this like 1990s version.
Yeah, it's a 26 year old game. It's like looking sharp. I think in general, the pre-rendered backgrounds look great still.
I think even without like an up res. But I agree that the thing that Goldsorcer tries to capture is that feeling of going to like a Disneyland park for the first time. That like clubby round the head of holy shit, look at all this stuff kind of thing.
And so yeah, I think the expectations set that super high. Like, will it just be like, you know, six different rooms you go in in the all eight different rooms you go in in the in the rebirth version? I feel like it needs to be like more elaborate than that.
So yeah, yeah, I agree. I agree.
Yeah, yeah. But then knowing like how, you know, what a good job they did blowing out the kind of the mark, the city market, whatever it's called from Midgar in remake.
I find it quite small personally.
But more like as an event, you know, that they put that big battle arena and they made more of a story of it.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah. And like the mini games were well realized, like the dancing and all that kind of stuff. I can see that working here.
What they don't tell you in the lovely tourist pamphlets for Golden Saucer is that it's built above a really gnarly prison. And for the second time in this game, someone does the old drops you through a trap door into the last thing underneath, suckers. Like, I think they describe it as a naturally occurring prison.
It's a prison surrounded by so much quicksand that no one can escape without drowning in the quicksand. So there's just all these sort of like muscly, sort of hardened criminals just sitting around in this hot sun kind of too tired and exhausted. And dehydrated to sort of do anything.
And you sort of wander around this prison and this is where Dine Barrett's old pal lives. And you have a little fight against him. And then in, I think like a kind of quietly touching moment, he sort of throws himself off a cliff at the end of it.
Which must have been quite, you know, quite, I don't want to say shocking, but like quite something to have seen in 1997 as a sort of like, it's quite an adult story to have happened.
Yeah, isn't there a bit in Flashback as well where you see how Barrett got his gun hand, like basically because like he's holding on to Dine at like the, there's like a by train track and then like a bullet passes through both their hands and that's why he's also got a gun hand and that's like, that's part of the story they tell there, right? Or does that happen later?
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure that happens. I'm pretty sure you get the full Dine story because like you see, I'm pretty sure you see that scene. So I think I was watching it.
I was watching like a little recap video before this.
Did I rinse through that triple speed? I thought that was just about two guys shaking hands by a railway track.
Yeah, I might be misremembering that.
He definitely is responsible for why he's got a gun on. But now that you say it, I couldn't tell you why he has a gun on. But anyway, it was this guy and he just chucks himself off a cliff.
Yeah. There's also quite a cool bit. Don't you see like a load of dead bodies?
And like, don't people try and blame Barrett for it? They're like, oh, there's all these like dead guys. And like, it's a little bit sort of like Colonel Kurt's gone off the deep end.
You've got to go out and find him kind of flavor to.
Well, yeah, you go through the town where Barrett grew up and it's a big old mess and he's like, everyone here blames me. This is all my fault. And yeah, you then to get to die and you have to do this sort of strange walk through the desert, which I didn't really understand.
If that was a puzzle or not, I just kept walking around the desert doing random fights until I eventually found him like in a little kind of scrap yard in the middle of the desert.
Yeah, it just that's like it. The only other section of playing the game like it is in the original God of War. When you walk through that desert, you got to find like something on the other side.
Like that's a very strange idea. Notion for a puzzle is like wander randomly through this area until you might find something like that's really quite a weird bit of design. But you have not seen that.
I've not seen that anywhere else. Yeah, very strange.
It reminded me a bit of like the Lost Woods or something in a Zelda game.
Oh, yeah, a bit of that.
It's just like every direction you walk in takes you to like a seemingly unconnected screen and you're like, where the fuck am I anyway? For about a minute, it's a very convincing depiction of being lost in a desert.
Yeah, for a minute.
Well done. Add that to this game's many strengths. This guy goes off a cliff and for some reason you have to do a chocobo race.
Right, yeah.
Which was fine, you know, it's just a classic. It's a bit like the Epona race actually in Ocarina of Time. It's like a big stamina management thing, but I didn't really have a problem with it.
And then you get to one of my favorite locations, which is Cosmo Canyon, which is where you meet this like old scientist dude called Bugenhagen, Bugenhaven?
Yeah, Bugenhagen in the house. I mean, you must have been pretty excited to meet Bugenhagen.
This is it. I was like the Leonardo DiCaprio meme pointing at the TV. I was like, oh, Bugenhagen, I know this guy.
And he kind of does the Force Awakens hand solo, it's all true speech, you know? He kind of breaks down, like this is the kind of, this is like the spiritual energy at the heart of the world. And he does it with a very flashy planetarium, which, you know, is a good way, you know, in a game which doesn't tutorialise very well, like using a lot of like flashy graphics and light show to explain concepts to me is like big thumbs up.
He appreciated that Bugenhagen. And sets up the idea that there's this, you know, this everything's connected, everything dies and kind of goes back to the planet, becomes this energy and yes, the life stream. And that, you know, this life stream is, Sephiroth is interested in this in some way, you know, as this awesome source of power.
And so you're like, okay, this is, you know, there's a bit more going on here. This is also where Red 13's loyalty mission kind of plays out.
Yeah.
I, a bit of a few question marks over what this is, cause he calls Bugenhagen granddad. And he's obviously, Bugenhagen is like, well, I say he's a man, he's like half man, half bull. And Red 13 is all dog.
Did Bugenhagen's child marry a dog person? Is, is it just like?
It's adopted kind of relationship.
It's adopted. Or it might just be like, hey, Gramps, you know, like, you know that you have uncles who aren't really uncles. Like it's just a friend of a family.
Yeah. I think that's more of a like, yeah, that's more of a like adopted situation that he kind of raised him. Cause he's very wise, isn't he?
Red 13, so yeah.
Yeah. I mean, so I, like, I only ever played disc one or every moment I could have Barrett and Tifa. I only had Barrett and Tifa.
Yeah.
So I didn't spend a lot of time, and that's not like you learn anything about these characters by just being with them. Like there's no extra dialogue that I can tell of or anything like that. And so a lot of these characters are quite vague and mysterious until you get to their loyalty missions and then you get a big dose of them.
So this kind of sets up this story of like his father had run away and he's, this whole life, he's kind of understood his sort of dad to be a coward and in doing the little kind of dungeon in Cosmo Canyon, you realize that actually his dad had done something very kind of heroic and sort of saved everyone.
Quite beautiful moment, I think.
It's quite nice. The camera does this lovely pan up to this sort of stone wolf and there's this like cowl and yeah, that is good. Still didn't convince me to put Red 13 in my party.
It wasn't gonna like help me with Tifa, so not interested. Unless she looked like, I don't know if she's an animal person, but you then make your way to Nibelheim, which is obviously the town you saw in the flashback. Now everyone rocks up and this is where the game begins to go, oh, there's something going on here.
There's something a bit strange with like Cloud and Tifa because there's no like memory or evidence of this like massacre and this burning down that happened all these years ago. Everyone there seems, well I say seems relatively normal. There's always like weirdos and cloaks everywhere, which is a bit strange.
And you keep finding like letters and books and things which are like, got names like our secret document, like how we're gonna convince everyone this town is normal and things like that and like step one of like evil scheme, replace everyone with weird clone person. And so like that's this is where like the game begins to get like a little bit sillier and maybe does have a bit of like, just because the cloaks, you do think a little bit of like, oh, is this going kind of kingdom hearty here? Like the shape of the threat is familiar.
This is also, there's a very frustrating section set in, there's a mansion which I was told there was a man in the basement who could join my party.
Yeah.
Like Vincent. But to get to him, I had to solve a riddle which involved walking around this kind of, again, Luigi's Mansion-ish kind of mansion. But there's loads of random battles and it just took ages walking around this place, trying to find like clues and work out what was going on.
Any time when you're trying to work something out and you have to deal with random battles is always a bit of a bad hanging in this game.
Yeah, I think you can come back for Vincent later. I think you can, because he's an optional party member.
I got the safe combination. I opened the safe and then there was a fucking horrible boss inside the safe. This like, what did it even look like?
Was it a monster? Like, it killed me really quickly two times and then I was like, nah, no one's, like, it wasn't gonna be in my party anyway, so.
No, the enemy really got on my nose. There's a guy swinging on that like big sort of like pendulum thing, right?
Yeah, yeah.
He flops to the ground sometimes. I fucking hate that guy.
There's this boss. I think the boss is like, it's like a half and half monster and you kill half of it and then the other half gets really strong. And like the half you killed, it then defines what the other half's like.
So if you kill like the magic half, it's then this like horrible physical thing and it can kill you with really big physical attacks. Anyway, I was like, screw it. Let's move on.
I have to get to the end of Disc 1 because of the podcast. This is when I climbed Mount Nibble and had a really bad time because I couldn't find anything. I just found the path.
It's the only bit where I got like genuinely lost and there was like a big cave network and I was just... There's a lot of like navigational puzzles in this game where you'll see like a chest or a bit of material and then it will make you go all around the houses to get there. And the completeness bit in my brain is like, I really need to do this.
But all the time you're figuring out, you're also getting hammered with random encounters. So again, that and the mansion together, slightly bad hang. Whoever was in charge of this section of the game made you do too much while doing random encounters.
Can you not turn off random encounters in the Switch version so not have a feature that lets you do that?
Well, I discovered this later.
Right, okay, fine, fair enough.
Yes, yes, you can turn off the random encounters. And I wish I'd known because I would have done it. But that is followed by a section which absolutely rocks, which is Rocket Town, where you meet Sid.
Like just fighting about like Shinra's failed space program with these like little flashbacks, that's quite cool. And then you have a really funny boss fight against this, I don't know if he's like the mayor or something, he's like a Shinra lackey turns up called Palmer. You basically smash his face in very easily for a couple of rounds and then he legs it from battle and gets run over by a truck.
Yes, great stuff.
What a great gag, you know?
Yeah, really good.
I've not really seen anything like that before. You know, like a turn-based battle end like that. If that's not in Rebirth, that'll be a huge mistake.
Yeah, it will be, I promise you it will be. There are gifs of that truck running him over. So, yeah, we'll get...
I don't know how I'd never heard of that. Like how that hadn't been ruined for me in all these years.
Yeah, how do you feel about Cid as a character?
I talked to him and then I had to choose his name. So I said Cid. I kept everyone with their original names so I wouldn't get confused about who was who when we're talking about this.
Not having Drew, et cetera.
I didn't actually realize he'd joined my party because, I don't know why I didn't look at the party select screen for a while, but I didn't cotton on that that's what I was doing by naming him, was that he was joining me.
He told me a sad story about a space rocket and how he basically jeopardized his sort of astronaut career to save a scientist in the base and now he's at odds with Shinra. I couldn't really tell you much more about him.
Yeah, he's not very nice to her either.
Shara or something? Why was, I didn't even know he was a playable character.
Yeah.
People don't really talk about him much as a, like I know about, I knew about these extra characters like Yuffie and Vincent, but I'd never really heard about, are there loads of Sid Stans? I always thought Sid was just a supporting, like an NPC character.
That's interesting. I can see why you come into this thinking that, cause it's true that he's not often a member of your party. It's like he is a guy like Big's a wedge who you just meet.
Right, that's what I thought his deal was. So that's why I didn't even contemplate that he was there.
He's quite shouty. I don't think he's like anyone's favorite character cause he's quite shouty and obnoxious.
He swears a lot.
He does. He's got a bit of like old print media man energy. He's a bit tired by all of his mags closing.
Do you know what I mean? Like he's got that sort of like behind the scenes.
Does that mean he's gonna set up an awesome podcast?
The closer. No, he's got, I think he's worth sticking with cause he's got some cool abilities. Like he, later on, I think one of his limit breaks, he calls in like an airstrike from the skies, like a bunch of like basically missiles come down.
It's pretty cool. So I think he's got his moments, but he's not like, there are some bits in the story he features heavily into, figures heavily into. But I think one problem this game has in general actually is that you do have slightly too many cool party members that you don't necessarily end up giving everyone the time you want to give them because they're like jostling for space.
Whereas I think like in eight, for example, it becomes quite self-evident, like the three or four characters you end up using over and over again, or in 10, for example, no one fucking likes Kimahri, of course. So he gets left out. And then Riku gets left out.
I don't know here if it's quite as clean, but if you've got Barrett, Cloud and Tifa, you've already got a good party. And then they kind of keep adding more and more characters. And it becomes hard to tell what's in it between Barrett and Red 13 and Cid.
There's not loads in it, it would seem.
I think you almost spend too much formative time with Tifa and Barrett in Midgar. But they feel like the OG party and the correct party. And everyone else you meet, it's like, ah, you weren't really there.
Like, you know, you aren't in on any of the jokes. You weren't there. You didn't have to climb up all those stairs in the Shinra building.
Like, you didn't see Cloud in a dress, you know. It's fine. You can come along.
But don't expect to ever be involved. Which is very much how my games played out. It's the Cloud, Tifa and Barrett show.
And then occasionally other people force their backstories down my throat so I begrudgingly spend five minutes with them.
That's funny. Well, I suppose the other thing as well is that like the material system means that you don't really have class specialties in your party. So you're kind of building the class specialties with the material.
Therefore it is more about who do you like, you know?
Well, yeah. But that's that. That's another reason I really like the material system is anyone can be anything, you know.
Barrett is sort of my healer. I don't really know what Tifa's role is.
Oh, she's just like rad, like loads of damage. Her Limit Break is really good because it stacks different, those real things. She gets more and more of those, so she's unleashing like massive combos, basically.
Right, yeah. She's cool. And I've given her some good summons and stuff.
So Barrett keeps us all healthy and Cloud and her just like rain summons are down on everyone.
I never really thought of Barrett as like a healer, like a white mage, probably because he's got a gun on his arm. But you know, that's fine.
Yeah, just how it just like he happened to have the cure materia first and I just can't be bothered to unequip it.
I will not argue with your methods. We're nearing the end of this one here.
We are nearing the end of this one. You go back to Golden Saucer, there's a lot of MacGuffin nonsense about trying to get this key to a temple.
Black materia, right? Isn't that a thing you're seeking out?
Yeah, there's a temple which Sephiroth is interested in. I don't know if you know it's because it has black materia at this point, or if you find out when you get there, but that definitely is the big part of the Temple of the Ancients. Just before you go to the Temple of the Ancients, you spend a night at Golden Saucer, where you have this...
You end up going on a date, this is where you have a romance scene, you go on a date, you're forced to stay there for some reason, and you're in your hotel room and then someone comes to your room, and apparently, you know, that can be a number of different characters. This is who I was hoping would be Tifa. It wasn't.
Aerith came to the room, despite me not having spent a single second with her beyond what was compulsory. I guess I hadn't expressed icy thoughts towards her, because like I said, there isn't massive conversation trees or anything, but that really bummed me out. That was a real begrudging date.
We went and did this like weird little play in you're going to go to this big arena and you get pulled into playing roles in like a stage play. And then you go for a romantic ferris wheel ride, which would have been so great. It could have been so great.
But I guess the elephant in the room with Aerith and like this isn't her fault. But because I knew like what was going to happen to her, I just kind of treats her like like there's like no attachment at all. Like she was never in my party.
I didn't invest. You know, I didn't make her the center of any of my thinking because I'm like, well, this character is going to die. So you know, I don't want to give her anything good just in case she takes it with her.
And yeah, you know, like no one would have thought that when they played this originally. But that is a weird bit of baggage you can bring to it.
You're like, you know, yeah, I think the other thing is that like the they're pretty underwritten, like both Tifa and Aerith really, like, you know, so sort of sign of the times a little bit. But I feel like I think like Tifa's kind of background is tied up in Cloud's background. She's kind of like a feature of his his background basically.
And then she just happens to be there in the like modern day when he's doing this, you know, when he's on his adventure. Aerith is like, she's tied to the larger lore of the story. But I don't know if they give her loads of like inner life, you know, it's a it's like you meet her adopted mum, who, by the way, why does she have like the best property in Midgar?
Oh, that's absurd. She's got like, like that also presents a picture where the slums could all be like that, you know?
Yeah, like Shinra would have bulldozed that surely and put like a Mako factory there or something like that.
Yeah, that is weird. But you wonder if like Hell House is just seen off the property looking on jealousy at that house.
But I think that's like kind of like it's all just meant to indicate that Aerith is like one bright spark in the bright spot of this horrible world, this horrible place, like hence her selling flowers. It's like in the sun shines through the ceiling of the church. It's like she is the ray of light in this, you know, this horrible world.
But I don't know if they give you like loads to and I think like, well, if you think about the fact they go on, they go on the sort of like, they spend the most time they probably spend together is when they're trying to like find Cloud's costume, right, to sneak in sneak into the brothel. So that's like, at that point, I think you are supposed to become attached to Aerith, both from like, knowing that she is an important function of the story in terms of like the Turks are after her when you're in the church, or we know when you go on that date, and you're like, oh, there's like a, you know, there's a back and forth between her and Cloud like you're meant to maybe get invested at that point. So if you weren't from there, then it was never going to happen.
But then if you got the death thing hanging over it, then I don't know, maybe she never had a chance with you, Matthew. I don't know.
Yeah, there is that. And yeah, maybe that's the sort of cold and unfeeling of me, but I just couldn't, I couldn't really detach her from what I know about her and the kind of legacy of that character, which just brought a sort of weird perspective to it. I will say at this point in the game, like it gets like a lot trickier and a lot more unexplained things begin happening.
There's lots of sequences as you go to the Temple of the Ancients, where you have like visions of the future and Aerith kind of like runs off at times and then you're kind of, you can sort of see her and it's projected towards you. It's all very kind of dreamlike. There are some sequences where it's very explicitly a kind of vision where all the characters become like translucent and they're watching what's happened to other characters.
And, you know, not to race to the end of Disc 1, but I will say that the last kind of couple hours are so full of all this trippy bullshit. I was like, when Aerith's death finally came, I thought it would be a fair reading of that to go, oh, this is just more trippy bullshit.
Right.
Obviously, I knew that she is dead because she famously dies in this game. But like, I thought it was quite messy, that whole sequence and the run up to it, because there is all this like, oh, what the fuck's going on? And like, Cloud starts like duplicating and he becomes like a weird puppet of Sephiroth and he sort of hands him some weird stuff.
And it's, you know, I guess building on the kind of the weirdness which is hinted at in some of like that Nibelheim kind of conflicting sort of flashback stuff going on with Tifa. I wouldn't say it went as far as to like, it lost me, but I was like, oh, this is like surprisingly kind of weird and slippery, you know, given that the way people talk about this game in this kind of quite clear cut way, that just, it surprised me.
I think it's got like quite a big line in sort of like, we're going to like turn into some slightly mystical bullshit for a little while. And then it's like the and then it pulls you back into like, oh, we're in this kind of like semi real, realistic, like recognizable sort of setting. So I think it flicks between those modes and probably that the temple where you get the temple that's got the black material in it.
Yeah, and also and then like the worst is like the it's just like the temp, the setra city or whatever it's called, the ancient city of the ancient city of the ancient city of the ancient. Like that's the one that's got like the big weird fish in that little house, right? That's quite a famously strange little bit.
But the whole area has got like, what's going on here sort of vibes. It's like there's no one there. It's just very, yeah, very odd flavor to it, you know.
But yeah, I did like the temple at the Ancients before it. I didn't like the actual exploring the temple because it's like just a very confusing maze-like dungeon with quite a lot of vague pathways and doorways that you can't see because they're behind scenery. So you just have to kind of run everywhere and again, endure all the random encounters.
But at the heart of the temple of the Ancients is this kind of sort of trap puzzle mechanic thing, which is this is where you get this incredibly powerful black material that Sephiroth wants. But in order to kind of unlock it, you basically have to solve this puzzle at the heart of the temple, which will shrink the temple down into the black material and so kind of crush you to death inside. So the safety mechanism stopping people from getting the black material is that you are definitely guaranteed to die in the unlocking process, which is like a really fucked up evil thing.
And I imagine like was very powerfully evil to people when they first encountered that. And it's quite evil to me now. It's like it's almost like some weird like hell raiser bullshit.
Their solution to this handily is sending Cait Sith, who I didn't even mention, he turns up in. And this fits of all the characters who made like no impact on me, that fucking thing. I mean, I don't really know what it is.
Like the twist is, it's a robot being controlled by someone. It's Shinra. Is that right?
Yeah, that's right. A guy called Reeve, I believe. Yeah, I like you.
Well, I've not met him yet. I just know that he is being controlled.
He is. I think Reeve is in the building when you go to, you think he's in one of the meetings that you go to at the end. Yeah, you would have.
He's like he's just but he looks a bit he's dressed like a little bit like a Turk. I think he's got like a C1 or something. It's not like he's not massively distinctive.
I think you do encounter him again though at some point.
But it turns out, you know, he betrays you in the in the preceding hours, where it turns out he works for Shinra. And, you know, he's this robot who's been programmed to steal something for Shinra. But he comes to your rescue in the Temple of the Ancients and agrees to solve this puzzle and crush himself to death, which is kind of meaningless because he's a robot being controlled by a man elsewhere.
And it's meant to be this like, no, Cait Sith. But you're like, well, we can build another. And lo and behold, they do.
Like about 20 minutes later, Cait Sith Mk2 turns up.
I think it's quite a nicely done moment because it's like existential about is this dummy that has basically like joined you on your journey? Does it have any kind of like value or free will as it like, as its destruction sort of like is, is sort of like, but you know what, though, if you don't pay attention to the character at all, and you've never even used in your party, you probably like, get the fuck out of my party, you puppet. Then when another turn one turns up, you're like, oh, man.
Yeah. Why is there another one? Like, yeah, it's sort of it's a bit odd.
I agree. It's a moment, but it doesn't get the press that the Aerith death does.
It happens so close to it. Yeah. You know, it's the justice for that.
I mean, hilariously, when you're playing on PS4 now, when you get to the Aerith death sequence, it blocks the PlayStation filming. So you can't film, you cannot film the cut scene of Aerith dying, but it doesn't do it for Cait Sith. Big shrug for that guy.
Oh, that's amazing. That's the most square and extinct to like block that scene. That's ridiculous.
Well, the funny thing about it is when that notification pops up, it's really big and loud and you're like, oh, well, I guess this is this then.
Right.
Yeah. Not subtle. But yeah, the idea of a temple that turns into a black materia, like shrinks down and then you have to climb down into the hole where the temple originally sat and you pick up this black materia that's going to have some plot relevance later, I'm assuming.
Sephiroth turns up and kind of sort of puppet masters Cloud into handing it over and you're a bit like, is Cloud under his control? Are they mates? You know, is he?
Well, who knows? I don't know. I guess I will find out on later discs.
And yeah, this all takes you into the final bit, which is the Forgotten City of the Ancients, which is a pleasingly combat-free section. Huge weird temple with a, like you say, a room with like a giant fish that turns into a staircase. Don't really get that, but you know, Ancients, you do you.
That's fine. Whatever like, whatever floats your boat. And yeah, you go into a chamber and Sephiroth kills Aerith in this scene, which I can't ascribe to you because it was blocked.
And who am I to break, break that block? And then you fight another of Sephiroth's sort of meaty left behinds. He does a lot of things where he flies off and leaves a big piece of gristle for you to fight.
Yeah, like Jenova kind of like variant.
Yeah, this is another, another one of those. Um, and yeah, I fought that and I finished disc one.
Yeah, okay.
Well, I mean, that took, that took a long time. I thought that question was going to be like five minutes.
Me too. That was a one hour recap of Final Fantasy 7. I hope you enjoyed the podcast, everyone.
Backpage pod on Twitter. I'll see you later. Goodbye.
Okay. Where do we go from here? Okay.
So I think the good thing is...
Was that all right?
No, I enjoyed it because it was like one giant man reacts to Final Fantasy 7, this one. That's kind of like what has actually happened here. That's what's occurred.
And I enjoyed that immensely. Yeah. So I think we kind of got a good idea as well of like what you did and didn't like about the game from that.
So I don't need to really go into your... I suppose I would ask, what are your absolute highlights of that journey? Like what jumps out to you as like, oh, it's rad.
I can see why this landed. I can see what's cool about this. What are your absolute highlights to games so far?
Yeah, broadly just that variety and the number of different places I went to. I was constantly surprised that all these things kind of live together in the same game and were all so well realized. The thing I really loved, which is like the real basic bitch Final Fantasy 7 take, was I think the summons fucking rule.
Those animations are just hugely satisfying. I'd only ever seen a couple of them from the early material, but you start getting quite a bit of material in the section that I played. I really like Ramu on his little mountain, blasting down lighting, lightning.
I really like Titan because he looks like a pro wrestler. He's got like big Hulk Hogan or kind of Rick Flair energy. Just this like muscley guy with like platinum blonde hair.
He like flips the entire earth. That's good. There's one I'd never heard of before who was like...
Is that the elephant?
I thought it looked like a pig. I couldn't quite place it.
Kajata, is it? Yeah, that's right. It's more like a warthog actually.
Yeah. But he like makes the floor kind of ripple out and stuff. And just, you know, it still looks good.
Like when those things turn up, you know, they look like they're going to really fuck people up. I really liked Bahamut. That's cool.
Oh mate, wait till... There's like, that's one of three Bahamuts in the game as well.
Yeah. And I don't know if this is just having played Final Fantasy 16 where obviously these things are at the heart of it. But like, you know, it's left me with a bit more affinity for them.
But seeing their versions and like they still look pretty good. And thinking back to like what it must have been like to see these animations and models kind of appear in, in, you know, the late 90s.
Yeah.
Coming from like SNES era RPGs must have just like blown people's minds.
Yeah.
That is as blockbuster as it comes, those things.
Yeah, it looks nice in like, they do look cool when they turn up in like FF6 or whatever. But like, yeah, it's a different, a different world. And again, you've got that, like the 3D camera just sort of panning around them and just like really getting the most out of those animations.
And yeah, it's just cool, man. It's just cool. Yeah.
Really very good. Yeah. But yeah, everything else, Shinra, Cosmo Canyon, Bugen Hagen, Golden Saucer.
I mean, yeah, they were all highlights.
Yeah, it's quite interesting because I think that from the outside looking in, a lot of the most like basic touch points of Final Fantasy 7 just seem like to be like Midgar, and like Tifa and Aerith, and then the whole Sephiroth thing. And like, I don't know, I think there may be like FF7 Advent Children's responsible for a little bit of that. And FF7 Remake is obviously just that part of the game.
So you only get a limited perspective of it. But there really is so much to this game. Like just, you know, you have like loads more locations left to see, loads of stuff left to happen.
Like you're about to wander through some snowy mountains. Basically, that's what happens after Disc 1. So that's, I really like that section.
That's cool. And then, yeah, like more locations, more party members. Did you meet Yuffie at all when you were playing?
Yeah, I got her eventually. She kept, she kept sort of, yeah, fucking off. And then Catherine found a walkthrough for me.
Nice, good.
How anyone played this game pre-walkthroughs? I have no idea. Because there's a lot of like quite cryptic stuff in it.
I mean, this was like prime sort of, you know, rumour mill playground information network stuff of like, I could just picture people being like, how did you get Yuffie? How did you get Yuffie? What are you meant to say to her?
What are the answers to the questions that unlock her? Yeah, quite fun.
Yeah, it's funny because I think that when you get to even FF8 after this, the tone of it is a bit more concentrated and serious. There is no minigame where Squall's marching in a crowd or whatever. It doesn't necessarily have as many goofy as I.
It's got a few goofy characters, but the tone is a lot more consistent, I would say. So 7, it just feels like it's quite willing to just go off on a wild little excursion for two hours and bump you back to the main story kind of thing. So glad you like that.
So yeah, it's quite cool to hear you go on that little journey, Matthew. It was nice to hear you react in real time.
I apologise for people who have found Fantasy 7. This episode must have been total dogshit.
They've logged off. This one's got big Destiny episode energy for those people, Matthew.
Oh my god. Really? How mortifying.
Here's something I will ask you, actually. So I think the centrepiece of this stretch of the game, other than Aerith dying, is the Nibelheim flashback going back five years ago, the origins of Sephiroth. Does that make sense to you as an iconic bit of Japanese RPG storytelling?
Does that jump out as a clear highlight to you?
Yeah. I mean, in that... It's like your first proper dose of Sephiroth, and he's, you know, like Mr. JRPG as an iconic figure.
Yeah. Maybe coming to it later, you know, it was like less surprising. I'd seen enough of it, or I knew about that, so there were bigger surprises in store.
But yeah, I mean, like clearly Nibelheim and what is going on between young Cloud, young Tifa and young Sephiroth is like at the heart of, you know, a big mystery at the heart of the game. So yeah, certainly very memorable. I like the flashbacks in general.
I think this game is like really quick to just, you know, take you to a different time and place to sort of fill in the story and show you how things happened. It's, you know, regardless of what you think about the individual stories, it's a great game of storytelling, you know, that it tells you so much stuff and takes you to so many places. So many little things happen, little arcs everywhere.
It's, you know, in light of, you know, the more recent Final Fantasies, which have been like quite uneven and quite unsatisfying when it comes to the actual storytelling, this feels like just absolutely rammed with incident, which is very, very satisfying.
Yeah, I think it works well on that level. And I would say as well that I think, like, when you probably realise what happens in the Nibelheim flashback, you'll be like, oh, that makes sense with what I think I know about this game. Like, it will click.
But I think it's really nicely done, what they do. I think it clicks together really nicely as the mystery that they're building there. That's really good.
So that kind of is a good transition point, though. I was curious, do you think the writing is good in Final Fantasy 7? And I ask this because I think where this actually came up in the Discord is that there's a divide on, I think it's a snootiness towards Japanese RPGs from Western RPG fans who are like, look how fucking good the writing is in Baldur's Gate next to this poorly translated nonsense or like dialogue from Barrett being like basically, literally like Mr. T kind of like dialogue or whatever.
And it's just like, but I'm kind of curious what you make of the writing coming into it like relatively fresh. Like how successful do you think it is?
I think it's successful enough to like convey its characters. You have a really good sense of it. It feels like a world full of a lot of colourful people, like even tiny NPCs who you only meet in a shop or whatever, a lot of them do or say something quite characterful.
So it like really, really registers. I mean, yes, maybe like the technical writing on like a line to line basis, like it's, you know, a bit wooden or, you know, a bit old fashioned. But I wouldn't say like, you know, it's funny you say Baldur's Gate there, like it's not like that's that's also characterful.
You know, I wouldn't say it's like individually that I like the the lines in it. I find it quite like NAF and Saturday Morning Cartoonish, you know. It's just, you know, it wasn't as much of a developed art back then.
And, you know, it sort of fits the time. All of that aside, like the strength of it, you know, it isn't the dialogue, it's just the plotting, you know, like the set pieces and the adventure, like that Midgar section, you know, the actual raids and like the build up and then what happens in the reactors and then escaping the reactors and the aftermath and you get split up from a group and then that bumps into this character and all this stuff happens. Like it's got amazing momentum to it and it never draws anything out.
It's constantly, every 10 minutes, you're in a new place, meeting something new, doing something new. And, you know, that's, you know, that's writing too. So I'd say it's pretty sophisticated and successful.
I'd kill for a game with this much kind of character these days, you know, in a lot of ways. But yeah, and that stuff gets you through. Yeah, so what if they all, you know, I think it helps that they're not voiced maybe.
Yeah, like you can kind of imagine a slightly better version of them.
Yeah, I think the game is good for like letting you fill in the gaps generally with your imagination, like right down to how the characters look. You know, you can sort of...
Yeah, and their little animate, their little kind of wobbly, you know, when they sort of shake their fists or they do melodramatic poses or whatever. It's very endearing.
It may not seem like totally coherent, but it kind of like makes sense as a sort of like you go to another continent and the Costa del Sol is there or whatever. And like, you know, when you look at Midgar on the map, it is a giant object on that world map. Like it is like the all-consuming center of that continent.
And yeah, I think it just, it does a really good job of making that world feel like very exciting. When you go there, it doesn't feel like these locations just exist as pop-ups for you to like wander into as a JRPG character. They all have their own little thing kind of going on.
That's really good. And then I think that, yeah, like I think the writing probably isn't the strongest in terms of how it's localized to look at. And I know it's got a couple of mistakes in there, but I really do think that snootiness from people like just will not accept that a good story can be told with this genre.
And it definitely can. And I think this game is like evidence of that, because I think the plot is really easy to understand. And while some of the moving parts of it, like the hallucinatory nonsense you refer to, Matthew, might kind of like obscure that slightly, you're never really in any doubt of what's actually going on or what mistakes are.
I think it's good at establishing that. And yeah, I think that the characters, the side characters get, they each get their moment. I'm not sure like all of the characters, all of the supporting characters do, but certainly like Cid gets his moment.
Definitely, there's some like extended Yuffie stuff that happens later on. There's definitely some good Vincent stuff in the game for you to uncover as well when you're ready to go back into the mansion for that bullshit. Yeah, like and then we've seen Red 13 and Battle.
I think it does a good job of like giving you the wider picture of those characters. And by the end of the game, you're like, you do feel like you've gone on this epic journey. You feel like you're very invested in all the people who are along part of that journey with you.
And I think that I can see why some characters have their own sort of like cult status within that because so much time is put into that. Like the Turks, you know, like if I ask a Final Fantasy fan about the Turks, they'll have opinions on every single one of those characters. You know what I mean?
And like you only meet them, you probably meet them like about 10 times across the game. But they're all memorable and they've all got their own little, yeah, little thing, little personality going on. And like, I don't know, it's just, I think it works really well as a bit of storytelling.
So that's my take, Matthew. But you know, it's nice to hear it from someone who is fresher to this, I would say.
Yeah, it really holds up. Like, I fully expected to come into this and find it all a bit quaint, but I genuinely had a really, really good time playing it.
Oh, nice. Glad to hear it. Yeah, it's, yeah, exciting.
So I suppose that's the last question is, will you keep going, Matthew? Do you think you're going to persist with the rest of FM7?
Yeah, maybe I'll do it after I've played Rebirth, you know? Maybe I'll do it like that. I'll do it in sections and assuming Rebirth ends where, you know, people think it'll end.
Well, I'm a big coy. We just talked about this game in really explicit detail.
Yeah, because Square Enix doesn't want you to share that Aerith died 26 years ago, Matthew.
That is mad. But yeah, yeah, you know, I can't wait to see all these sites again in those like mega Rebirth graphics. That's going to be a treat.
And yeah, I'm going to continue it. You know, I won't leave it, you know, a year or something. I want to remember what I'm actually doing.
And, you know, I've got a little bit of investment in my builds and, you know, I still think Tifa can be won over. So, especially Aerith's gone.
Okay, amazing. You should do some reading on how that dating thing works, because you know you can end up dating Barrett, right? That's like a thing you can do.
Right, yeah.
I can't remember which one I ended up with actually in sort of retrospect. But like it's some of the ways that plays out are quite funny. I think the reason you ended up with Aerith is because she has a really high starting score.
So, the game wants you to get with Aerith, but you have to fight harder to get Tifa basically. So, the invisible score ticker just, it fucked you over I'm afraid, my friend. Yeah, okay.
So, actually, here's something I'm kind of curious about. Did you actually like The Gold Saucer? I couldn't totally grasp whether you thought it was good apart from like the art pass on it.
Did you think it was like, did you think it was a good location, a good hang, The Gold Saucer?
Yeah, recently, I'm, like I said, I'm not a big, you know, grind away and complete everything 100%. You know, it's designed to be this huge time sink.
Right.
Playing these, I'd say, only okay minigames.
I think that's fair, yeah.
But like, as a bit of visual design, I really like the wackiness of it and how it kind of veered, you know, veered between all these different art styles. I didn't like the fact that they charged you fucking 3 grand to go in every time. That blows.
It's like, do you want to pay 3 grand every time or do you want to pay like 30 grand for a lifetime pass? It's like, am I going to come here more than 10 times? Like, I don't know what the story is going to demand of me.
Well, there's like, to get Omni Slash the best Cloud Ultimate in the game, you have to do that Battle Arena thing, basically like a bunch of... You have to like, get to the highest level of that or something like that. So, you have a reason to come back.
And there is a time where 30 grand will not be as big a deal as it seems like it is now, where you are, you know. Yeah, you'll have a reason to come back.
30 grand, that's a whole lot of tense.
A lot of ethers, yeah, down the drain. Antidotes, yeah. Okay, good.
I think we kind of covered everything because you did like, the entire story of the thing in massive detail.
I hope that was a satisfying way of tackling it. I think we stopped along the way to talk about individual beats.
Yeah, I tried to jump in and add a bit of flavour, a bit of context.
One giant man struggles to remember something he only finished a day ago.
Yeah, it's a shame because I almost wish I could get you to do this with all the Final Fantasy games I like and then hear your reactions to them live and weigh in. For me, it was a very fun exercise. I hope the listeners enjoyed it as well.
I thought you would find this a lot harder to get through than you did actually. I'm pleased to hear that you did have a good time.
If this episode lands, I will happily do more Final Fantasy episodes.
Okay, cool. There's an episode chat bit of our Discord and you can tweet us and email us. If you like this episode and would like to hear Matthew do Disc 2, let us know and we will ponder it for the future.
If you hate it, don't let us know because I'm too thin skinned for that.
Okay, so this episode is done. After this, Matthew, we are going on a hiatus until late December. On the free feed, there will be a cup of treats to look forward to.
Otherwise, there's going to be a holiday special towards the end of the month and then also the Game of the Year episode, of course, coming at the very end of the month. That's happening in December. Otherwise, I'm going to Japan, have a little pause.
Matthew is going to do something, probably work his ass off and then have a little break, I hope, and have some eggnog or something. That would be good. So the podcast, you can follow us on Twitter at BackpagePod and also BlueSky at BackpagePod.
Matthew, where can people find you?
On Twitter, I'm MrBazzle underscore Pesto. On BlueSky, I'm MrBazzlePesto. No underscore.
Matthew, always on BlueSky, grinding his way up there.
I always forget it exists, to be honest. I feel weird posting a tweet on there. You know, because it feels like, oh, you guys might enjoy this content, which I did somewhere else.
It's like, the podcast is over. Goodbye. Bye-bye.
