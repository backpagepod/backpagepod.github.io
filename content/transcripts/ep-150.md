Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello, Matthew, we're joined by another special guest.
Rob, would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello, I'm Rob Pearson. I am a host on PlayStation Access, and a co-founder and company director of We Are Reach.
We haven't had many people who are actual hosts come on before, so you're gonna completely show up, me and Matthew, as we sort of amateur our way around this joint.
I doubt it, I highly doubt it. I'm gonna try my absolute best to not say um or like, which is my favorite filling word, and speak as clearly as possible.
Well, it never stops Matthew, and we cut them out diligently, so I think you'll be okay. How's it going, Rob, are you well?
I am very well, thank you, yes.
Okay, good stuff. So Matthew, got a whole epic plan here. You've been putting the plan together for this one, Matthew.
So we're gonna talk to Rob in the first half about him and his amazing career, and then in the second half, we're gonna get a bit more into the nitty gritty of how you make YouTube content, like compelling YouTube content. So I'm excited to discuss that.
I got upgraded from YouTube content to compelling YouTube content.
Just keeping the listeners engaged, Matthew, doing what I can. So yeah, Rob, excited to have you on, because I think you share a lot of our sensibilities in terms of the games you like. So I'm excited to dip into some of that stuff.
I've been chain watching your videos this week. So you're very much living in my head at the moment. So that's fun.
But I was curious, what's your personal history with video games? Do you remember the first video game or console you really clicked with?
I've always been obsessed with video games since before I even bought a console or had a console bought for me. I remember the first time, I remember begging my parents for a PlayStation, a games console. And the first thing they actually bought was a PC because they were like, well, you know, I know you want a games console, but this is going to help you with your schoolwork as well.
So I had to make do with a PC. But I did have some really good games on that PC. And those are the first video games I can remember owning and playing really obsessively.
So it was, you know, it was a rubbish PC. It was like a Pentium II processor. This is the kind of power we're talking about.
But the games I had on there were G Police, which I thought was absolutely amazing. I was rubbish at it and could never get past the second or third level. But that didn't really stop me just enjoying flying around this amazing cyberpunk world.
It was so huge and beautiful at the time, I remember, and just firing homing rockets at civilians. That was all I could do. I wasn't good enough to actually...
You were meant to be the G Police.
Yeah, I know. That isn't the role of the G Police. I was supposed to be shooting down criminals, but I was so bad at the game that I found a lot of enjoyment just flying around shooting other flying cars who were completely innocent.
But I absolutely loved that game. Another game I played was Jazz Jackrabbit. I don't know if any of you are aware of Jazz Jackrabbit, but it was like a platform game.
I think Cliff Blazinski was involved in it in some degree. I loved that game. And I used to play all these games cooperatively with my sister.
Not that they were actual co-op games. They were single player games, but we would share a keyboard. So in Jazz Jackrabbit, I would do the running around and the jumping and she would just hold down space bar to shoot, which was, you know, at the time, it was like the best thing ever.
But the game I really remember playing over and over again was The Oregon Trail and just absolutely loving that you could name everyone in your party, whatever you wanted to. So I named everyone after my school friends. I used to find it absolutely hilarious when like halfway through you get a message saying, Darren Escott has died of dysentery.
And it was just, I just found that hilarious. And I loved the way when you played it again, you would discover the grave markers of your previous playthroughs. And I remember having my mind absolutely blown by that.
So that was my first encounter of owning a machine that could play video games. But I was still absolutely desperate to own a games console. And it wasn't until I was, I think it was my 12th birthday where my dad finally bought me a PlayStation.
And it all sort of unraveled from there. But I remember being, I don't know why, like, cause no one in my family was like big into games. It wasn't like I had a culture at my school where loads of people were enjoying and playing games.
But for some reason, I just had a real longing in me to play video games. I don't really know where it came from. Just, I can't remember the spark that initially captured my imagination.
All I remember is being desperate to own a console, any kind of machine that could play video games.
Yeah, forged in the streets of the cyberpunk city of G-Police. Okay, so for many people, you're closely associated with Metal Gear and Final Fantasy, and obviously those are more of a console concern. They're not exclusively.
Can you talk about encountering those and why they mean so much? Where do you go after PC gaming, basically?
Well, so I got my PlayStation when I was 12, and that came with a bunch of games bundled with it. So I had Actua Soccer Club in Edition, Independence Day the game. It was terrible.
I had Overboard, which I think was actually pretty good. It was a game where you controlled a pirate ship just going through some obstacles and shooting other pirate ships. That was pretty cool.
But I was at secondary school by that time, and one of my friends brought in a copy of Official PlayStation Magazine. It was quite a famous issue. It was issue 42, which I think to this day holds the record for the best selling Official PlayStation Magazine issue ever.
I think that month it outsold FHM, like something ridiculous, like 450,000 copies sold that month. And the big review was Metal Gear Solid. And they had the opening warehouse section of Metal Gear Solid on the playable demo disc.
And this magazine was like a, it was like a holy grail in this classroom. Everyone wanted it. It did the rounds of the whole classroom.
Everyone borrowed it for a little bit of time and got to play the demo. And I remember getting obsessed with the magazine as well. So that was sort of like the birth of both my obsession with console games and also my obsession with video game media.
I remember, I must have read that magazine from cover to cover probably 20 times. It's no exaggeration to say 20 times because my parents would never buy me video game magazines myself. So I just had this one.
And I didn't even own a PlayStation at this point either. I was just obsessively reading this magazine, playing that opening area of Metal Gear Solid. And then when I finally did own a PlayStation, Metal Gear Solid was a game I bought with some of my birthday money.
And that's sort of where it started. And Metal Gear Solid was a game that completely changed what I thought was possible from video games. The way it told its story, how inventive it was, all of the mad stuff it did with the DualShock controller.
But even now, these are gaming moments that are still talked about and revered now, like Psycho Mantis moving the DualShock controller, having to figure out what Meryl's codec number was by finding it on the back of the CD case, like that cryptic clue that Baker gives you. And you're there looking around for ages in game, trying to find out where this CD case is. And then you realize there's an actual screenshot on the back of the box with the codec number on.
And I was so bowled over by all this. I just couldn't believe what I was playing. And it got my dad really into it as well.
Like he was quite a cynic in terms of this kind of form of entertainment that he assumed I would just grow out of very quickly. But it got to a stage where he would be watching me play Metal Gear Solid as if he was watching a movie. And he even said like towards the end, like, this is like watching a film.
This is incredible. And so Metal Gear Solid holds quite a special place in my heart because it was A, it was just a fantastic game. And it did things that had never been done before, but also it was just something I shared with my dad.
And I didn't really have that much in common with my dad. So the Metal Gear Solid has been special to me because of that. Final Fantasy, again, it was a game, I think, that I was introduced to by a friend who was, again, it was the PS1 demo disc.
They had like a trailer for Final Fantasy VIII on it. And they were like just amazed by the visuals in this trailer. And I remember thinking, you know, what is this game?
What is this game? And they were like, oh, it's Final Fantasy VIII. It's a sequel to this.
Oh, you should play Final Fantasy VII first though. Play that and then have a go on it. And so I did.
I got like a platinum edition of Final Fantasy VII. You know, I was big into fantasy literature at the time. And so I was devouring stuff like The Eye of the World, like, you know, derivative Tolkien fantasy fiction.
And Final Fantasy VII, it felt to me like I was playing a fantasy novel. Like I really enjoyed how all of the, you had to read all of the text and the sophistication of the story and the depth of the characters and just how long it was. Again, it was unlike anything I played.
And I remember just thinking, wow, like video games can tell stories that are this long, this complex, this rich in character and world building. That was where my love affair with both of those series started. Really nothing too deep about it other than I thought they were fantastic games that did things I'd never seen before and continued to do so.
You hadn't even seen any of those things in Independence Day, the video game.
No, I saw very little in Independence Day, the video game. I think I played it for about 20 minutes on my birthday.
Did you even get to the alien invasion?
Well, I think it started, you were just in one of those fighter planes fighting underneath one of the big, not the mothership, but the big city covering disks. And I remember just finding it incredibly frustrating and dying lots and then playing Act Your Soccer Club Edition. That was sort of like the game I played repeatedly.
But yeah, Independence Day, the game, can't recommend.
I remember that Metal Gear Solid Issue because it was a very iconic image, the Shinkawa on the front cover. And that demo, just working out how the mechanics in Metal Gear work bit by bit, like, oh, you can choke a guy and all this stuff. Basically treating that one opening hallway like an entire sandbox for you to figure out exactly how all these stealth systems work.
It was, yeah, even just that tiny bit of the game was...
There was so much in it. There was that little puddle. I remember being a mate, you stand in the puddle and the guards turn around and like, what the hell was that noise?
And to me, that was mind blowing. The guards could hear me standing in the puddle. And then you have like wet footprints that you leave behind.
Amazing, like it's so good. And the way the camera swiveled around when you pushed up against a bit of the scenery to give you a cinematic angle down the corridor. I liked doing that just because I felt like I was directing my own mini stealth movie.
So I had a set route. I'd go around that warehouse section where I would do it slowly and carefully and just try and make it look cool. I wasn't happy unless I'd done it really perfectly.
I hated just running around. I had to push up against the walls and shuffle along and get the cool camera angle. Amazing, like so much.
Like a dream is dream player.
Yeah, there was so much just in that one bit of the game. That's before you even get to the more iconic outside the base with the spotlights and the footprints in the snow.
Yeah.
It was so good.
Was the Final Fantasy VIII issue of OPM, the one that the playable demo, a big deal for you, Rob? Because that demo was a big deal for me. It's like the dollot beach section basically.
They have all of that including the big spider robot.
I think, I don't remember actually playing that. No, I think that might have been what my friends were playing. Because I remember it was my friend Darren, who died of dysentery in the Oregon Trail.
He was... My condolences.
He was playing it. And I remember I used to go around his house religiously because he used to get bought way more games than I did. So I was regularly around his house just watching him play stuff.
And he and his brothers were big into this Final Fantasy VIII thing on the demo disc. So I was asking. I'd never seen a game like it.
I didn't quite understand what I was looking at. They were just standing around taking it in turns to hit like a big plant. I was like, what's this?
But they were telling me how amazing it was and that I should play Final Fantasy VII first. So I didn't actually play that playable demo of Final Fantasy VIII. And by the time I'd finished VII, VIII was out fully.
So that was the next thing I went for. So I never experienced the thrill of that playable demo dropping, at least not myself. I watched other people being thrilled by it.
Speaking of Darren and his dysentery, were you a, when you did finally play Final Fantasy, were you original names only or did you rename people? We have a very famous friend of Sam's who is the hero of Final Fantasy VII called Andrew.
No.
He called his friend, he called Barrett Daniel in the game and it was very, it didn't quite feel right. You know what I mean?
No, I'm always original names only. Like, I feel like in Final Fantasy, I want to be told a story and I want to play as those characters. I don't want to, it's not like a Skyrim where you're crafting your character and you can name them what you want to name.
I want to be, I want to play as Cloud. I don't want to play as Rob. You know, I want to be Cloud Strife.
So no, I've always been original names.
The sort of implicit self-confidence of suggesting that Squal is called Samuel just wasn't something that washed with me. I was like, I know I'm not as cool as this guy. I know I wouldn't look as good in this jacket as this guy.
It's a no from me. Yeah. Okay, so we've just recorded an episode about gaming in 2001, Rob, that brought up some fun cultural memories.
Do you remember your gaming life in 2001?
I do very specifically because that was the year that Final Fantasy IX came out in the UK. You will soon learn about me that I have a very narrow library of games that I've actually enjoyed. And I listened to that episode and listened to you listing all of those games that you'd enjoyed in 2001 and thinking, man, I played very little in comparison.
Like if I was naming my top 10 in 2001, it would probably be the 10 games I played in 2001. But Final Fantasy IX came out in February of 2001 in the UK. And I remember that because it's honestly the most excited I've ever been for anything in my life.
Like so, so excited about it. I've just turned 14 at the time, so I didn't have my own spending power. I didn't have a job or anything at that stage.
So the only time I was getting games was on my birthday, which is in December. So I remember making a deal with my dad in December of 2000, saying, look, what if you don't buy me a birthday present this year? And instead in February in two months time, you buy me Final Fantasy IX when it comes out.
And he agreed to that.
That's a great bargain.
It was. I remember going down to Electronics Boutique with my dad on launch day and walking in and seeing this wall of white and gold where all the new copies of Final Fantasy IX were lined up. And it was like you could hear the angels choir singing.
I could hear that in my head. It's such a memory of seeing it. Amazingly exciting time.
And my dad sort of grabbed a copy and mockingly sort of held it aloft, like he'd just taken the sword out of the stone. So, so good. And it was half turn that week as well.
So I just had a solid week of being at home in my bedroom playing Final Fantasy IX. Probably one of the best weeks of my entire life that. So, so good.
I barely came out of my room. That was mainly my gaming life in 2001. Also, I remember in 2001, desperately, desperately wanting a PS2 because that was the year that PS2 came out as well.
And also, Final Fantasy IX and Metal Gear Solid 2 both came out in 2001. But I didn't play either of those games until 2002 because I didn't get a PS2 until then. So it was a year of repeatedly playing Final Fantasy IX and then going back and playing 8 and 7, which is probably, I played those three games basically on rotation, on repeat for years.
And wishing, wishing that I could have a PS2. Darren got one, obviously, so he was there playing Final Fantasy IX, playing Metal Gear Solid 2. So I discovered, I discovered all about Raiden and all of that just going around to his house and seeing him controlling this weird, blonde cartwheeling dude.
I was like, who's this? I was like, yeah, it's Raiden. You don't play a snake.
So that kind of shock was stolen from me. So yeah, that was my 2001. I did eventually get a PS2 for my 16th birthday in December of 2002.
And then I caught up on all of this stuff. But yeah, that's sort of all I remember. I certainly don't remember the many games you discussed in the previous episode.
Oh, there's a bit of bodging that goes on between stuff we played at the time and things we played since then that came out that year. So it's not a true representation of what I was doing in 2001, if I'm being honest. It's probably three games I played at the time.
And then, yeah, seven games that I've played since then. So yeah, it's a lie. The podcast is a lie.
I played Perfect Dark in Conker. That's all I did in 2001.
That's perfectly on brand for you, Matthew. So I think that works. I remember though, Rob, I was in the same boat.
Like every Final Fantasy being released here was a huge deal because you always had to wait for them to localize it for Europe. So it took like three months. And so I remember like, I remember 10-2 being a big deal when that launched in 2004.
And it came out in 03 in the US. So I remember the same happening with Final Fantasy XII in 07 as well, which launched a year earlier. Like it was kind of agony.
And I was very guilty of going deep into internet forums to find out what happens in the games because I just could not wait any longer. I'd exhausted the few material I had to learn about these things. So yeah, I remember that being a huge, huge deal as well.
Yeah, I remember just obsessively reading any preview in any magazine that had any info on Final Fantasy IX. And obviously they reviewed, I guess, they reviewed an import copy, quite a lot of these magazines. But it was almost physically painful knowing that there were people in the world playing Final Fantasy IX and I had to wait like, you know, six months for it.
So video coverage didn't really exist for most of our formative years, all around the same age. So you mentioned that OPM was a huge deal for you.
Yeah.
What else was important for you on the games media side growing up?
I was obsessed with any and all. Like, I just read so much. PSM2 was like my favorite magazine.
I distinctly remember issue one with the Metal Gear Solid 2 VHS on the front, which had that obscenely long trailer from E3. But wow, I think to this day, that's probably my favorite video game trailer of all time. I watched that VHS so many times, to the extent where, you know, it actually got damaged because I was just rewinding it so much.
I remember afterwards, after the Metal Gear Solid 2 trailer had finished on that VHS, it was like International Track and Field or something. And I remember the first few frames of that International Track and Field trailer vividly because that was the point at which I pressed rewind every time to go back and watch those nine glorious minutes of Metal Gear Solid 2. But that magazine kicked off my love affair with PSM2 magazine.
So yeah, your episode where you had Dan Dawkins come on, I found incredibly interesting listening to all of his stories from that time because for me on the outside, I absolutely loved what they built with that magazine. And he talked a lot about trying to foster this culture of, I think he called it club and community. And as a reader, you really felt that.
You really felt like you were part of this knowing group of people who were so into games. And I read that magazine like so obsessively and wanted, you know, it was my dream at the time. Like all I ever wanted to do was be a games writer on a video games magazine.
I remember writing into PSM2 when I was 18, just before I went to university, asking what's the best way about getting a job on PSM2 magazine. And they printed it in the magazine. I remember the thrill of seeing my letter published in PSM2 and like running downstairs to show my mum, look, it's in the magazine, there's my name.
Like I saw my name in print. And I still remember like the adrenaline spike that that caused. And it was around about that time, I think that Andy Kelly and Nathan Irvine joined the magazine as like fresh faced 17 and 18 year old.
So they were a similar age to me. I remember being so, so jealous and thinking like, oh, I've missed my chance. They've just hired like a 17 year old and an 18 year old.
And now I'm off to university to study film. It's never gonna happen for me. But I always had like a real sort of deep, deep longing to work on one of these magazines.
But yeah, PSM2, official PlayStation magazine, Games Master, mainly if it had like something, if it had a Final Fantasy game on the cover or a Metal Gear game or something that I was into, I would buy it. But I would try and buy as many PSM2s as I could. I used to get like one pound every couple of days from my mum.
It was supposed to be to buy some sweets on the way home from school. But I used to just save it up and use that money to buy like PSM2 every month. So yeah, like massively into games mags, desperately wanted to be a writer on one.
Not to jump too far ahead. What was it like when you eventually got to future and saw like the people you read growing up?
Amazing, I remember Dan talking about that as well. And I found it really interesting listening to his experience and pointing out all of the people he knew and admired, because it was exactly the same for me. I remember the first time I went into that office in future was when I did some work experience in 2010.
So I was there for two weeks and it was like Disneyland. And we always sort of joke about the office now as being like a bit rundown and the floor was filthy and there was stuff all over the place. But I thought it was absolutely amazing.
I was again, I was there like, oh my God, there's PSM 2, there's Doug Dawkins. Oh my God, that's Andy Kelly. And then on OPM, like, you know, seeing Ben Wilson and Leon Hurley and Rachel Weaver and everyone and thinking like, this is unbelievable.
It was like being in a dream. Like it was, it's the most starstruck I've ever been. You know.
It's the Mickey Mouse of future. Who's like, holy shit, it's Mickey Mouse.
I think, to be honest, I have to say Dan Dawkins. You know, it's embarrassing to say, I've never actually said this to his face, but he was always like my games media hero. Cause he was there from like issue one of PSM2.
Like his picture was in the mag. The amount of times I'd seen his picture in that magazine and seen his byline. And he obviously loved Metal Gear as well.
And reading anything that he'd written about Metal Gear was like amazing. So I remember seeing him there and you know, never, I was very shy. So I never had the courage to actually go up and say hello to any of these people unless I was actually introduced to them.
But I remember, you know, looking over at Edge as well and seeing people like Rich Stanton there. Like even to this day, Rich Stanton, I don't think I've ever really properly spoken to just because I'm too intimidated by his reputation and intelligence. But yeah, just all of these people whose work I'd loved and admired, seeing them all there actually doing the thing.
It was absolutely amazing. It was like, you know, it felt like I'd won a prize. Like it is incredible, the excitement of being there and getting to write little roundup reviews that then went in OPM and seeing my name in print under something I'd written after doing that work experience.
I think I've still got that copy of OPM from when I did work experience back home. So exciting.
So I suppose that probably is a good transition point to talk about how did you get your job at Future? What were you doing beforehand and what led you to work in in games media?
So I was working in TV at the time. I studied film and TV at uni, got a job soon after graduating as a runner in a post-production facility in London. This was in 2008.
I only lasted five months there because the credit crunch happened. And they just, I think they just invested about half a million pounds, like expanding their office and getting all these new edit suites and facilities in. And their sort of main contract was for an ITV show called 60 Minute Makeover.
And that got pulled back into ITV. They took it back in-house and so they just invested about half a million pounds, and all of a sudden they had no clients. So I was made redundant after five months working there, age 21, like a real sort of reality check.
And then about six to eight weeks after that, I got another job as an edit assistant at this channel called Wedding TV, which was not great. I did not enjoy my time there. Really great people, as is often the case, like great people, but the people who ran it, the less said about them, the better, really.
I really was not enjoying my time there. I was making like so little money that I was actually losing money every month, just living in London. Like my wage compared to the outgoings on rent and bills meant I was in negative money.
And spending all day watching people have very opulent weddings.
Yeah, yeah, exactly. There was like, I had to edit videos of people going on honeymoon to the Maldives. Yeah, I hated it.
And it got to a point where I decided like, well, in fact, it was when Final Fantasy XIII came out. That was like the catalyst for it, because I took a week off work when that came out. I was super excited about it.
I didn't enjoy the game and decided, right, I'm going to... Because I remember, I still remembered the advice that PSM2 had written as a reply to my letter, like back when I was 18. And their reply was, you know, you don't need to go to university to get a job in a games mag.
Just write some reviews, send them in to us. And if they're as funny as the reviews you read in the mag, then we'll give you a job. And I was like, okay, let's try it.
And so I'm going to try this. I wrote a review of Final Fantasy XIII. I wanted to make an effort with it because I figured loads of people are going to be sending in reviews to work on these mags.
Everyone wants to write about games for a living. So I decided to try and make mine a bit special. And I had my wife, then girlfriend, who was working as a graphic designer at the time, create a mini magazine for me.
And so we designed a front cover for it. I did a meet the editor page, which I had my wife copy the exact style of OPM. So I had a little picture of my face in a circle with just a bunch of stuff about me.
And I did a review of Final Fantasy XIII, Uncharted 2 and FIFA X, I think, and put them in this little magazine. And the cover mount was a Kit Kat. I put a Kit Kat on the front of each magazine, and the magazine was called Give Me A Break Magazine.
And I thought, this is, at the very least, they have to at least reply and say, thanks for the Kit Kat. I sent this in. I think I sent it in.
I sent a copy in to Dan Dawkins, who never replied, but also, which broke my heart. But Official PlayStation Magazine did reply. It was actually Nathan Deitem, who replied to me.
He was reviews editor on the magazine at the time. And he was like, yeah, you can write. Would you like to come in and do some work experience?
And so that's how I ended up getting my work experience. And I think because first player just died at that time as well, the fact that I could video edit, I had video editing experience was quite attractive as well. Someone who could write and video edit.
Let's see how they do. That's how I got my work experience. And after doing my work experience, it was just a case of me badgering and badgering and badgering anyone who would listen to me.
It ended up being Andy Hartup on PSN3 Magazine and Leon Hurley on official PlayStation. Just please, is there anything I can write for you, any freelancer tool? And eventually I think Andy Hartup got so sick and tired of me emailing him every day that he gave me Naughty Bear to review for PSN3, which I got paid 15 pounds for it.
It was like a 160 paid, 160 word review. But my God, I was so excited when I got that email, like an actual, not just work experience, like an actual piece of real work, like real video games work. And that was the first bit of video games media work I ever did.
I remember really excitedly telling my wife, like I'm actually getting paid to write this review. She's like, oh, how much are you getting paid for it? I was like, 15 pounds.
She sort of looked at me like that. Well, well, that's never gonna be a career then, is it? I was like, you never know, like everything's got to start somewhere.
She's like, you still owe me for that magazine I designed for you, you bastard.
Well, I had to borrow money from my dad to get it printed. It cost 70 pounds to get, I had five copies of it printed. I didn't have 70 quid.
I had to borrow that from my dad just to get the thing printed. But yeah, that's sort of where it started. And then it was just a case of me, you know, I made a promise to myself, like I'm going to be the most reliable, most hardworking freelancer ever.
Like I'm never going to miss a deadline. Anything they ask me to do, I'm going to say yes. But the majority of my freelance work in that first year was doing transcription work.
And that was horrible. I was saying, yes, yes, of course I'll do it. And I was regularly up until like six o'clock in the morning transcribing these hour-long interviews.
Because you had to just, you know, this was before the days of Otter.ai, where you could just shove a recording into a program and it could spit out exactly what you've said and who said it. Just literally writing down. And some of the audio quality on some of these was just abysmal.
God knows what they've been recording them on. But I remember just rewinding back and forth through these questions and answers, trying to discern what had been said and spending hours doing that transcription work. But, you know, I was happy to do it because, you know, the freelance I was getting given was getting bigger and bigger.
Instead of doing like 160 word reviews, I was doing like a page review. I remember doing my first double page spread, that being like a massive deal. And then eventually I was sent on my first ever press trip to Sweden to go and see the world first reveal of Battlefield 3.
And I got to write a four page feature in official PlayStation magazine for that. And I remember thinking in my Hilton hotel room at the time, oh yeah, I've made it, I've made it. I'm here in the Hilton going to DICE, seeing Battlefield 3 revealed to the world.
And I'm writing a four page feature in official PlayStation magazine about it. So it sort of just snowballed from that initial work experience. And then it was around about the time that first play ended and PlayStation Access rose from the ashes of first play.
But what I actually wanted was the staff writer job on official PlayStation magazine. But it was meant to be, because a few months later, the staff writer position at official PlayStation magazine came up. And that felt like, it felt to me like, this is the one, like this is right.
The stars are aligning here. Like I've been freelancing for them for nearly a year now. I know the magazine inside out.
I'm a massive PlayStation fan boy. That was the job I'd been waiting for. And so I applied for it.
I got the interview. And the weeks after the interview was, I remember it so vividly, like the emotional turmoil I went through. I wanted this so badly.
I felt like I was an X factor contestant at the judges houses waiting to be called in to find out whether or not I'd made the live shows or not. And I remember like daydreaming about getting the call from Ben Wilson, who was the editor at the time. And I played the scenario over in my head where he phoned me up and told me I got the job.
And the elation I felt just from that daydream, like, and then I think back to reality and realized that I hadn't had the phone call yet. And it was like, oh, please, please. And then I did get the phone call and I hadn't got the job.
And it was like, it felt like my world had come crashing down. The person who did get the job is also a former, a guest who's been on your podcast, Louise Blaine. And I remember thinking to myself, who is this Louise Blaine?
She's now my mortal enemy. Like, and as it turns out, Louise Blaine is like one of the most amazing, wonderful people I know, and a person I'm very fortunate to call my friend. So it's funny how these kinds of things happen.
But again, it wasn't meant to be. And like a couple of weeks after that, a script writer position on PlayStation Access opened. And I didn't even have to interview for that.
Like Nathan just phoned me up and offered me the job. So I'd, you know, I tried so hard three times before applying for positions. And this one is obviously just, you know, meant to be.
And that's how I got on Access. And I've been on Access ever since.
Wow, it's yeah, it's quite the thing. So you worked on First Play, which is what became Access. So I remember-
Is that right or did I get that wrong? I did some work experience on First Play. I did, I worked on the worst rated episode of First Play in its history.
Sorry, this is what happens when I plan an episode.
I depended on your research. I should have audited Rob's LinkedIn page more closely. Okay, so yeah, so something we always do with guests who have a bit of a media background, Rob, is to talk a bit about their press trip times.
You mentioned your fun excursion to the Hilton Hotel and how you'd made it. We all had that moment. I had that moment.
I think it was in a more upscale version of a travel lodge in Windsor when I went to review The Darkness on PS3. So that was my, I've made it moment, but what's the weirdest or wildest press trip you've been on?
Oh man, I don't think I've ever been on anything as weird and wild as Dan Dawkins mentioned, like being helicoptered up a glacier to go to a bar made of ice and then helicoptered back down to do a bungee jump all for ISS Pro Evolution or whatever it was. I think when I joined the industry, the days of like the really elaborate press trips were coming to an end, but I still got to go to some places where like I really sort of had to pinch myself. When Uncharted 3 came out, I went to Jordan and we got taken to the Wadi Rum desert, which is like an area, it's where Petra is and it's where all like Lawrence of Arabia, all of those stories are from.
And it was just amazing, we did like a treasure hunt. There were people from the UK, there were people from various different countries who'd all won like an Uncharted 3 multiplayer competition and their prize was to come to the desert in Jordan and do an actual treasure hunt. So I got driven around in a jeep around the desert for the day doing like, well filming this other guy do tasks, you know, I got to ride a camel in the desert.
And it was, you know, a ridiculous place, like one of the most incredible places I've ever been. And it was just, you know, I was there for a video game and I kept on having to sort of pinch myself because of that. You know, I've driven a Mercedes on a frozen lake, of power sliding a Mercedes around a frozen lake in the actual Arctic through like a sunset that lasted two hours because we were so far north that the sun sort of dipped below the horizon and it stayed at that level of light for about two hours for Project Cars 2.
And I was like, this is, I can't believe I'm here. Like, I don't deserve this. Like, none of us deserve this.
That was always my thing. Like, you go into these really opulent hotels and there'd just be a bunch of games journos going in in their hoodies and jeans, me included, thinking, you know, what are we doing here? All of this amazing stuff just for a video game.
But obviously, I loved it, it was an amazing privilege to get to do all that stuff. The craziest press trip, though, has to be going to Japan to see Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes. And I got to go to the Bond villain lair that Dan mentioned in his episode as well in Nassau.
But, and this should have been, like, the press trip of a lifetime for me, but I got food poisoning on that press trip and it kicked in, literally the second our coach left our hotel to battle the Tokyo rush hour traffic to get to Konami's HQ. That was a very long 45 minutes for me. It was, it was, it was bad.
It got, we got to the end of that coach ride and I thought, this is about to, this is about to go really, really wrong. Like, I don't know if I can hold this any longer. And Dave Jackson was sitting next to me.
I was like, Dave, I've got to find a toilet, like, now. Like, actually now. I remember just grabbing the PR.
As soon as we got off the coach, I just grabbed the PR. I was like, I need to find a bathroom now. And he was like, okay, well sure.
We'll just get everyone off the coach now. And I just grabbed it now, literally now. And he sort of like looked at me, like, okay.
And he sort of mentioned, he motioned to the other PR rep. Can you just, you just look after the guy. So I'm just going to take Rob to the, and I sort of like half jogged, half sprinted.
It was not how I am envisaged, arriving at Kojima Productions HQ in Konami, sort of sprinting across the foyer, diving into the bathroom at the back of the foyer. And yeah, and then it was all right after that for the day. And then after that, we went to the Bond Villain Lair in Nassau, and that's when the food poisoning kicked in proper.
I spent the majority of that trip. I was either on the toilet or I was in my bed, in one of those two things. I played a little bit of Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes.
In fact, I think Hideo Kojima tweeted a picture of all the journalists playing the game for the first time. And you can see me in the background sort of like slumped down, looking very pale and like I'm absolutely having the worst time ever. Which was obviously, if I hadn't had food poisoning, it would have been the greatest press trip of all time.
And to this day, I'm very sad that it was ruined for me like that. But I did an interview with Hideo Kojima and with Yoji Shinkawa on that trip and Dave had to sort of set the camera up. I was in the toilet and he messaged me when everything was ready.
So I dashed out, did the interview and then immediately went back into the bathroom. Which is not...
Kojima probably loves that. That's got like big Johnny Sasaki in it.
I wish I'd have actually, I do regret not telling him because he probably would have found it funny. It is very, it is very Johnny Sasaki. But yeah, it was like, thank you so much for your time Kojima-san, Shinkawa-san, bye.
I immediately ran back into the bathroom and that video, that video is still on PlayStation Access to this day. So if you go and look up that interview, you can see me with food poisoning, interviewing Hideo Kojima and Yohji Shinkawa. So for all the wrong reasons, that's probably the press trip that sticks in my mind the most.
Because it should have been incredible. And it was, apart from the fact that I was incredibly ill.
It's funny, the way you start describing that Project Cars 2 press trip had the sort of vibe of Rutger Auer, I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, and ended with you having food poisoning in front of Hideo Kojima. So I like the, we had the full arc there of like triumph down to like, you know, the worst of the worst.
That Project Cars press trip was mad. Like it wasn't just the ice driving. We then went and did like a survival camp in the snow, where we had to go and find things basically to survive.
Because they, Namco were showing like a bunch of games. It was like a Namco showcase. So they had a bunch of activities to do.
And another thing I remember is they, just every meal was reindeer. They just served reindeer. It was reindeer bolognese, just reindeer burgers.
That was all they ate out there. Reindeer. It was just reindeer for every meal.
And that was before I stopped eating meat. So I ate lots of reindeer. But anyone who was a vegetarian on that trip, I don't know what they ate.
Just some salad and potatoes, I think. But yeah, that was a crazy trip. But, you know, amazing.
Yeah, it's like if you want to get to the Naruto demo unit, you have to snowboard down this mountain. And it's like a bold press trip.
Have you ever been to any of the big first party Sony studios? Or I don't know if you ever get a chance to do that, really.
No, no, they're like top secret. So no, it would be still like a dream to visit like a Naughty Dog or an Insomniac or a Sony Santa Monica. But no, I've never been to any of those.
Typically, they'll hold their press events at like a venue. I would absolutely love to be able to go to one of those one day.
So what's E3 or Gamescom like as a video person who's part of an official PlayStation thing? Do you feel like you've seen the real E3 as a result?
The fact that E3 is no longer a thing does make me sad because it was always my favourite time of the year. Like I say, it's a really full on week. You have to work incredibly hard.
Everyone who has done an E3 will probably have their own horror stories from doing it. But I loved the buzz of feeling like I was on the cutting edge of video games. I was where it was happening.
All of these announcements were going on. I remember being in the audience for that PlayStation conference where they revealed God of War for the first time. They had a live orchestra playing the God of War music.
None of us knew it was the God of War theme tune at the time until they revealed the game. That was an incredible conference. I remember coming out of that and saying, I would have paid for a ticket to watch that.
It was like watching... It was theatre. It was incredible.
Yeah, so, so exciting being a part of those things. In 2018 as well, I got to host some live streams from the PlayStation stage, which was another sort of pinch-me moment. I got to present a section on Days Gone, so it was me on stage.
The dream.
Well, to me, it was. This was amazing. I was hosting that section, and I was like a guest on the sofa for the first Spider-Man game that they were showing, and Ghost of Tsushima as well.
I remember asking Nate Fox some questions about his movie inspirations, samurai movie inspirations for Ghost of Tsushima. They had like a wardrobe. I got to choose clothes from a wardrobe to go on the stage.
I had makeup done as well. It didn't take very long. But I had powder put on my face to stop me looking shiny on stage.
I had my eyebrows filled in. Really? It was amazing.
When you say the real E3, that kind of experience, I don't know if you would class that as the real E3 for someone who works in games media. Because I've done what I would consider to be the real E3, which is 12 to 16 hour days running around between appointments on the show floor, going back to our hotel afterwards to edit the videos together, sending them over to the UK, and then overnight someone else in the UK would prep the videos and get them ready to go live on the channel. By the end of it, we had it down to a fine art and we'd make 40 videos in three days, which seems like madness now.
But it was mega exciting. I used to love it. So, so tiring.
But I used to absolutely relish it. I used to love going to the conferences. That was the big event.
Nothing beats that, in my opinion. Sitting in an actual sports arena and having the Sony execs come on the stage. And these were big personalities.
Everyone, Andrew House coming on the stage, Shuhei Yoshida. The cheers when they used to come on. It was held in a sports memorial arena, I think.
In Los Angeles. And it felt like a sporting event. Like it had that sort of atmosphere, that crackle in the air.
The cheers when big stuff was revealed. I remember being there for, I think it was the same one as, or maybe it was the one before when Final Fantasy VII Remake was revealed for the first time. The cheer that went up in the auditorium after that got revealed.
It was like, you know, I've watched really important football matches live before when goals have gone in. It was that same kind of, that kind of rush of, and that release of excitement and emotion. And, you know, I'm sad.
I'm very grateful for the fact that I got to experience those things. And I'm sad that sort of they seem to have, you know, largely gone away now. But yeah, it was the highlight of my year for sure.
You've interviewed Shuhei, right?
Yeah, yeah.
What's that experience like? Because often you interview someone about like a specific game, but when you've got someone who's just like has that kind of all-encompassing role or such a long kind of history with Sony, you know, how do you kind of get into that?
Interviewing Shuhei Yoshida in particular was one of the easiest interviews I've ever done because he's so infectiously enthusiastic and passionate about what he does. All you have to do is point him in a certain direction and he will just talk and talk and talk. I absolutely loved interviewing him quite recently for the Access podcast.
He's amazing to interview. He's been there from the beginning, has all these amazing stories, worked on games that I've absolutely adored as a child. One of them, The Legend of Dragoon, is a game that I remember very fondly from my childhood and he was a producer on that.
I loved getting to speak to him about that and the fact that he remembers that game and remembers clearly working on it and was happy to speak to me about it as well. You always go into these interviews with these big names and there's a degree of nervousness when you go in. They come with big reputations, these people.
Obviously, you want to make a good impression, you want to ask intelligent questions, interesting questions because I imagine these people must get asked the same questions all the time. You want to be trying to make sure the things that you're asking are actually things that they are interested in talking about. But with Shuhei Yoshida, as soon as he came in the room, he was smiling, greeted me warmly as if he knew me, which was, you know...
Well, he'd been a big fan of the Friday Features.
No, he'd never met me before. He's like, when are you going to do Friday Features again? But no, he was just...
He immediately put you at ease and was a real sort of pleasure to speak to. I don't think I've interviewed any of the... I think I may have been present during an interview with Jim Ryan at an E3 before, but I wasn't actually asking the questions.
I think I was probably either doing the sound or behind the camera. It's always a nerve wracking interviewing people of that sort of caliber. And I guess you put Hideo Kojima in there as well.
I've been lucky enough to interview him on three separate occasions now. But always, you know, when you get through it, they're so knowledgeable and so passionate about the thing they're working on that you don't really have to do too much work. All you have to do is, you know, keep them going, feed them a little bit more, and they will do all the work for you.
So to jump forward a little bit, it would be cool to talk about Reach and how your job has changed over time, Rob. So how did Reach emerge? Because obviously PlayStation Access was a future concern at one point.
But how has your work changed within that over time?
So after the future, we joined the Yogscast, which is where the PlayStation Access contract was based from 2013 until early 2017. I remember joining the Yogscast and thinking it was like our ticket to subscriber land immediately. As soon as we get there, we're just going to get millions of subscribers.
I remember all of the Yogscast channels just had an obscene amount of subscribers. That wasn't the case. It was still just the three of us making PlayStation Access.
We were just making it at Yogscast instead of at future. I think it got to the stage where we realized that it's just us making this. We were so embedded in it then.
We were the faces of the channel by that stage as well. I think it gave us the impetus to think we could probably do this on our own. To be fair to Yogscast, they were really gracious about it when we told them that's what we wanted to do.
Then we set up Reach in 2016, but we started working properly in April of 2017. Initially, it was just a way for us to continue making PlayStation Access for as long as we possibly could. That's what we continue to do now.
We have various other things that we do and the company has expanded over the years. We have 25 staff now. We're working on various different projects.
PlayStation is still our big client and the thing that is the foundation of the company. That philosophy that we implemented on Access is something we try and make sure is present in all of the other work we do, regardless of who it's for. But my role hasn't massively changed.
I guess it's certainly become less of the day-to-day writing and hosting. We've got a new generation of hosts coming through now in Ash and Rosie and the idea is to, as much as possible, give them space for their voice to be heard more than mine and Dave's. Nath's obviously has stepped away from hosting duties now.
So my role has slightly changed in that sense that I'm not... I'm in more meetings now than writing scripts until ungodly hours. It's less exciting, but it's challenging in other ways.
I'm not naturally a businessman, so I'm definitely out of my comfort zone in various aspects of my role as it is now and look jealously sometimes upon the people who are still involved with what I would consider to be the fun bit, which is playing games and writing about games and making videos about games, which, to be fair, I still get to do a fair amount of. I'm still in the video and still doing live streams and I do as much writing as I can, especially if a Final Fantasy game comes in. I would, you know, like smug with this pile of gold when a Final Fantasy game comes in.
No, that's mine. I will be taking this.
Your best friends with Mr. Final Fantasy XVI?
Yeah, Ben Starr, my best friend, voice actor of Clive Rosfield from Final Fantasy XVI, yes. But no, he was genuinely a lovely man, who I would love to be my friend. And I am making a conscious effort to make him my friend.
He's obviously started very exciting things. But yeah, having him on the podcast was amazing. But yeah, my job, I don't think it's changed as much as you might think it would have done.
And I still love to be involved in Access as much as I can.
That makes sense. At least three people this year have told me they're trying to become Ben Starr's best friend. So that's like an ongoing project across the industry, I think.
I think he's a good actor, Ben Starr. And so I think he likes me. But it could just be a very one sided thing.
Like every time I message him like, Ben, have you seen this? Do you want to help us? He's always very receptive and very friendly.
But who knows?
He seems to be like a legitimate PlayStation Access fan.
I think he is. I don't think there's... To be clear, I don't think there is any falsity there at all.
I think he's genuinely... I think he genuinely loves games. He certainly has a lot of knowledge about Final Fantasy and he loves Final Fantasy.
So yeah, a big fan of Ben Starr.
Yeah, there is no ambiguity. He is my best friend, just to be clear. I was curious, actually, Rob, kind of along those lines, do you find that games are able to capture your imagination now as much as they have in the past?
I ask that because I've only had a few videos of... I was watching one of your videos where you were playing Final Fantasy XII instead of a pile of modern games you were supposed to be playing. This is when they did the Zodiac Age remaster.
Is that like a common reflection of your current games experience? Or do you still find things that get under your skin in the same way?
Why do we not get as excited by things as we used to when we were kids? But some things still do, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at the moment. I remember when the recent trailer dropped for that and they revealed that Vincent was in the game.
And all of the stuff they showed in that trailer was fantastic. And it did sort of spike that kind of excitement that I remember feeling when Final Fantasy IX was coming out. That sort of...
You know, all of the games media analytical sort of brain melts away and it's just pure childlike hype for this thing that I can't wait to play. And so, yeah, absolutely, I think it happens less often for sure, and I'm sure that's true for most of us. But it's absolutely, I think, that sort of excitement and that love for games still exists in my crusty, cynical adult heart.
But yeah, when a game like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth comes along, it is hard for me not to get massively excited about it.
It was very special being in the, I was in the room when that state of play with, I don't think it was a state of play actually, I think it was some sort of games fest maybe, and hearing you and some of the other people at Reach talking about, you know, just things that they recognized in Final Fantasy VII and everyone was really excited. That was the, I think on the podcast, I was joking about it afterwards, I came out where everyone was like, Bugenhagen, Bugenhagen, and I was just like, what the fuck is that?
It's like when, I can only liken it to when like a book you really, really love gets a film adaptation, and you get to see how they've realized the characters that you've loved from the book. And it's obviously a little bit different because Final Fantasy VII is its own game. But there are remakes and there are remakes.
And I think the difference, the gulf in quality between the visuals of Final Fantasy VII on PS1 and Rebirth on PS5 is so vast compared to what you usually get with remakes. You're usually getting like HD remasters or remakes of games that have been on PS3. And, you know, they're great when they come out, but, you know, really it's just a more beautiful version of the same thing.
Whereas with Final Fantasy VII, like this whole project, it's a complete, it's a complete reimagine, I don't think remakes the right word, to be honest. Like, it's a complete reimagining of that game and that story. And so there's, for fans of it, there's such a thrill in seeing characters like Bugenhagen, who I just know is like a floating orb with a face and a gray beard.
Seeing him fully fleshed out, seeing these locations fully fleshed out, and it feels like being starstruck when you see it. Like, it's so fantastic. And they nailed it with remakes so much.
And the way that game ended, the way it teased how the story could unfold. And I think it's genius what they've done, in that they've made it so that you don't know what's going to happen going on now. Like, they've opened the door to the possibility that things could change.
So, not only are you invested in terms of, oh, I can't wait to see all those iconic characters and scenes reimagined on a scale I've never seen before, but also you're invested in terms of, like, you know, I genuinely don't know what's going to happen in Rebirth. And that's unbelievably exciting. But yeah, I think what they're doing with that is so special.
Like, you know, I will shout and scream every time I see a new trailer for that.
Yeah, because it just holds you down with iconography. Yeah. And things that you remember.
So yeah, it's pretty powerful. Okay, great. Well, let's take a quick break then, Rob.
And we'll come back and talk a bit more about the nitty gritty of working on YouTube.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, to kick us off, Rob, this is a super broad question, but we're interested in the development of your video style and voice. It's very, very particular.
And yeah, it's, you know, over time you can tell you've really refined it and built up a persona, and it's, you know, it's a work of art in itself, really. Print journalists have had years of magazine writers to ape, but video didn't really have that history when you came into it. What was your sort of point of inspiration for developing your voice as a video presenter and where did you kind of like take inspiration from?
Well, I think to start with, I did take inspiration from the print media that I'd watched and it was certainly our intention to imbue PlayStation Access with that same kind of club and community feel as Dan Dawkins put it. You know, we wanted people to feel like they were part of this community of people who all shared this passion for this thing. But in terms of video, there were a couple of examples at the time when I started Access, or certainly when I started doing the Friday Features.
Initially, the inspirations were Charlie Brooker's screen wipe, that was the thing that everyone was watching, the sort of the camera angle, the irreverent tone, the way he would play around with whatever he'd been watching at the time, and then it would come back to him on the sofa and he'd, you know, make a wisecrack about it. It would always be perfect, it would always be really pithy and sharp and really on point. And I really liked the throwaway transitions between each section, it sounded like a remote buzz, it was like a buzz that would happen between each section on a screen wipe.
And I was like, oh, I can do that. I had seven frames of bars and tone, is my version of that in the Friday Feature. So after every section is to boop, and I really like the punctuation of that.
And I love sometimes just the shock and humor of feeling like you're halfway through a point, or like you haven't fully made your point, and all of a sudden, boop, that's that, that's over. Forget about that, we're on to the next thing now. And I love sort of using that as punctuation in gags and stuff.
And I found like writing for video gives you so many more opportunities to be funny. Like being like the people who are funny in print, honestly, I take my hat off to them because it's so hard. All I wanted was to be funny.
I want it so bad to be as funny as the writers who I'd read in gaming magazines growing up. And like to name a few names, like Steve Williams on PSM at the time. I was absolutely howling with laughter reading some of the stuff he used to write.
It's so, so funny. Jon Blyth was another one. And I mentioned Jon Blyth because one of the big inspirations for the Friday Features was his OXM Breakdown series, which was, it was him, I think it was Gav Murphy, obviously now of RKG fame.
They made only 12 episodes, I think. So to me, it has like this almost faulty towers-esque status as this thing that was, it was just really unbelievably funny, like so much funnier than anything else that was coming out of games media, particularly in terms of video at the time. And like you say, Sam, there wasn't a huge amount of video that was being made in games media at that time, but this was so sharp and the way he would phrase things, the way he would like just throw away and discard and like stamp down on things that were bad.
Obviously there was a certain tone that we couldn't do on PlayStation Access, but I really wanted to try and capture that essence. Like the way he would describe things, I can't even sort of like give you an example because he was so good at doing it, but he had that sort of almost like Frankie Boyle-esque ability to put a series of words together into a sequence that you would never think of doing. But when he did it, it was so well-observed and so much funnier than anything I was watching.
And I remember thinking, oh, I would love, I would just love to make anything that's even half as funny as this. So that was like a massive inspiration for me as well. Also, Harry Hill's TV burp weirdly.
Like I really enjoyed his persona that he had on that show. And I really enjoyed how he, whilst mocking the stuff, also quite clearly loved the stuff as well. And I really loved how Harry Hill in particular would playfully interact with the TV shows he was featuring on it.
So you'd have like a clip from EastEnders or Coronation Street or whatever it was. It'd be a character making a phone call and it would cut back to Harry Hill in the studio and he'd be on the other end of the phone. And you basically stitched together an entire new scene out of what had actually been on the TV show and create this really funny new scene out of it.
And I really loved that sort of playfulness with the source material. And so those initially were like my three touchstone inspirations. Like I wanted to make something that played with video games like Harry Hill played with the TV shows.
I wanted it to be as funny as what Jon Blyth was writing on OXM Breakdown. And I wanted it to have that sort of like sharpness of a Charlie Brooker's screen white. Obviously, three very big things to have as your inspirations, but that was what I wanted.
I had a real sort of desperation to make something that... If I could make someone laugh with what I was writing, that was like a massive bonus for me. And so my early sort of delivery as well was very heavily based on the way that Charlie Brooker would deliver his stuff.
Everything that I've done basically is a rip off of better things. And you just keep doing it again and again and again. The big difference, I think, is with the Friday Features, for example, I just did it for so long and made so many of them that by the end of it, I just almost by accident come out with like a way of speaking and a way of presenting them and a way of putting them together that I never really consciously decided upon or really had to work on that hard.
It was just, if you look at the first one compared to the last one, even the way I speak is so weirdly different. And it was never something that I made a conscious decision to do. It was just how it had happened.
But that essence of playing with the source material, in my case, video games, but the butt of the joke was always me. I never wanted the butt of the joke to be the video games. It was always intended to be a celebration of video games and video game culture.
I never wanted people laughing at video games. I wanted people laughing at me or whatever skit or ridiculous joke I tried to pull together. That was sort of like the goal for it.
But talking like, I think there's the phrase that the access community always enjoy and will quote back to me like the, hello, you've caught me. That wasn't even mine. I think Jon Blyth did that in a No Exem Breakdown episode.
And I quite liked the sound of it. I said, oh, that's quite nice. I'll try using that.
And for some reason, it just stuck. So like, I can't really take credit for anything that I've done. Because it's all just basically been a rip off of what other people have done before, better and funnier than what I did.
The only difference is I just did it for ages. Whereas, OXM Breakdown is this beautiful thing that exists only in 12 episodes. It's like, to me, it's like the holy grail.
Like, if anyone's listening to this and you've enjoyed Access over the years, I implore you to look up OXM Breakdown on YouTube. Because it's just so funny, so good. It's everything that I wanted to make.
I'm in one of them delivering a very good in line reading. Yeah.
What one was that?
I think it was one about E3 because the joke was I represented like the common Nintendo fan. It cut to me and I think my line was, what about Nintendo? But the delivery of it is just awful.
Like, I managed to overact that one statement. It's really embarrassing.
It's like Office UK versus Office US. One is like 12 episodes. The other one is hundreds.
One is way, way better than the other as well. But yeah, I loved that stuff so much. So funny.
Again, with all of the stuff I used to read in the magazines and that piece of advice, I always remember getting back in that letter that I sent into PSM2. If you can write something that's as funny as the reviews you see in the magazine will give you a job. So always in my head as I've been like, okay, I just wanted to be funny like that stuff was.
So that was always like my goal, be funny and celebrate games basically. That was the inspiration starting out.
That makes sense. I would like to tee up the Friday features a little bit more here. So this sounds dumb to explain something that literally tens of millions of people have watched, but what are the Friday features?
Where did the creation of that come from?
So initially, it was just list features. They started out quite list featurey. It would be seven best dogs in video games.
You just take a thing and you do the seven of those. I don't know where the number seven came from either. I just liked that number.
I thought odd numbers just sounded a bit more appealing. It was a little bit, it was more than five, less than 10. Seven, I'll do seven.
Initially, we'd do things like seven hardest bosses, seven hardest platinum and we'd go through titles like that. Initially, the plan was, okay, we need something, we need a regular pillar of content that goes live at the same time every week. The goal was to basically create a subscriber driving machine that would just have as broad an appeal as possible, include as many games as possible, so it would appeal to fans of all genres.
It was going on an official PlayStation channel as well, so you had to try and appeal to a very broad audience. That was the original goal was just to make something that the audience, they would know what time it went live, they would know to come back to the channel at four o'clock in the afternoon every Friday and they'd get one of these Friday features and the goal was eventually, there'd be so many of them and they'd all be in a playlist and they'd all link out to each other, that this would just grow and grow and grow and grow. To be fair, that's what happened.
We just kept doing it for so long that, I think the one with the most views has done like five million views or something crazy. The old ones all would link out to each other. After you'd finished watching one, YouTube would immediately recommend another one to you and so you try and get viewers into that loop of binging them, I guess.
I'd regularly get comments from people saying that, I really enjoy binging your Friday features. I'd watch like 10 in a row. That was the goal, was to create something that would be like the subscriber engine room of the channel whilst Nathan, Dave did all of the other stuff like the games coverage and the weekly updates and we had a podcast style show called Access Granted that went out on a Monday that they made.
My job essentially, all my job was, was to sit there and write Friday Features, edit Friday Features, come up with the next one. For maybe four or five years, that was all my job was. Apart from you'd have the break to go to E3 and to go to Gamescom and EGX and that kind of thing.
Occasionally, I would go on the odd press trip or two. But aside from that, I didn't have anything else to worry about. It was great in a way because I could be fully focused and just fully in, had my head completely in on this thing and yeah, I don't think it would be possible now with all the various things that I have to sort of look after.
But it was a very focused time where I could just get my head down and as soon as one was finished, it was just straight on to the next one.
I can see how the engine point is definitely relevant as someone who's probably had a similar experience of watching five or six in a row this week just dialing them up and then you go, go, go. I can see why that is a very effective content mechanism. So I suppose, do you remember the first one that properly exploded or did you remember a point where you realized it had become a big deal to your audience and that it was becoming this sort of trademark of the channel basically?
Yeah, I don't think there was, the popularity just seemed to just grow and grow and grow. And I remember, I got maybe unhealthily obsessed with tracking the numbers. I remember I had like a figure in my head, like a number of likes it needs to do in the first hour.
And if it doesn't hit that, then it's a failure of an episode. And that number just kept increasing. Like initially, I remember it was 400.
If it gets 400 likes in the first hour, then it's going to do well, it's going to be a good one. And that number just increased and increased and increased. And I think at the peak, it was like you'd be wanting 1500 likes in an hour.
And if it hadn't done that, then, you know, it's not going to do very well this episode. And I would, you know, I'd have a set number of views I'd wanted it to get before I woke up on Saturday morning as well. And that was the first thing I did when I woke up on a Saturday morning was immediately get my phone, see how many views the Friday feature had done overnight.
And if it hadn't done the figure that I had in my head, that was like my weekend ruined. Like I was just in a terrible mood. So I probably unhealthily obsessed with the numbers.
But I think people have that rug. Like I had exactly the same routine on Xbox on, which was like not a successful channel at all when I was running it. And it was just like a really sad version of that.
Because I remember our list features went up on Sundays, for some reason, Sunday evenings, just when everyone loves to watch a fucking video on YouTube. And it coincided with taking Catherine back to the train station because she'd come down at the weekends. And so I drop her off at the train station.
And then when I left the train station, that would have been like an hour has passed. And I'd sort of sort of gingerly bring up figures on my phone and be like, Oh, it's done 500 in an hour. That's good for us.
You know, like, maybe I won't get fired this week.
But yeah, I think, you know, looking back, I think, I think that obsession was a little bit unhealthy. Like when I think about how bad a mood it would put me in if I didn't, if the video hadn't got the numbers I wanted it to. And, you know, I don't like to use this word lightly, but it almost becomes like an addiction.
You get addicted to the endorphin rush that you get from not just views, but like comments saying, oh, I loved this bit, I loved that bit. And, you know, if I'd done like a complicated skit or something, I would be scanning the comments looking for someone who'd mentioned the skit. Like, has someone noticed the skit?
Did they like it? Do they think it was funny? And, you know, I lived off that.
It was, you know, all my sort of my work satisfaction, my sense of self was so... I took it so much from this video series that I was making that it would literally make or break my mood. But to answer your question, Sam, I do remember one particular one, and I think it's the one that to this day is the one that's done over five million hits.
It was seven bosses we didn't want to kill. And I remember that being like a turning point because I think it was the first one where we tried some kind of angle with the title that wasn't obvious. It wasn't seven hardest bosses, seven hardest platinum trophies.
It was like a little bit of an angle that wasn't just a list of things. It was a list of things that also encouraged discussion around an experience. And I think this is the turning point for the Friday Features where they went from being what I would consider just list features to what we then tried to make them, which was a reflection of the video game playing experience.
We wanted almost like observational comedy in a way. We wanted people to be able to watch them and recognise their own behaviour and have that resonate. And you'd see that in the comments.
People saying, oh, I remember feeling exactly like this when I got to that bit again. And yeah, video games do do that, don't they? And that's what the Friday Features then, what I tried to make them, was less about the games themselves and more about the shared experience of playing a game.
And if I could dig something out of video games that everyone sort of knew but didn't articulate, that was sort of like the golden ticket to a Friday Feature that would perform really well. So we had things like, you know, seven awkward social situations only gamers will understand. Then it would be like, you know, when you're playing a game and your in-laws are coming round and you're trying to save it and that kind of thing.
So it's less about listing things that are in games and more about then using those video games as a vehicle to talk about certain experiences. But yeah, that boss one, bosses we didn't want to kill, like the headline entry was the boss from Metal Gear Solid 3. Like that sticks in my mind as the first time I can remember being sad at having won a boss fight.
Like when you beat a boss in a video game, it's like you're supposed to feel like, yes, yes, I've done it, I've beaten the boss. But that was like harrowing that boss fight. So well constructed, the sort of emotions it prompted when you pull the trigger and finally end it.
And so, yeah, we did a list feature around that and it really seemed to resonate to a degree that the rest of them hadn't yet. And if I could pinpoint one that was like a turning point, it would be that one. Because that was like the transition from, okay, here's a list feature about dragons and dogs.
Here's a list feature about what it feels like to play a video game. And, you know, it sounds a bit, you know, grand, I guess. But I really enjoyed trying to dig into that experience, I guess.
And they became... I tried to make them more celebrations of video game culture rather than lists of things in games.
That's really spot on, like, as an outside observer and as someone who has tried to kind of break the list, you know, market, I guess, on YouTube when I was on Xbox One and less so on RPS. I'd sort of given up by then. It felt like by then the Internet had moved beyond it's enough to just list seven objects.
Yeah.
And it became about, like, emotional modifiers or the tweet. You know, there was always an and. It was always seven things, that.
It was the that. And that was the really interesting bit. And it's, like, much harder, but, you know, more fun as well, I think.
Well, we developed, well, I certainly did anyway, like an unspoken rivalry with Outside Xbox, who I think are absolute masters of those titles. I remember thinking, you know, regularly, we would look at the videos they were making, because we were channels of similar ages, similar subscriber accounts, where they sort of like rocketed off and won the race eventually. But we were always looking at what they were doing, looking at the sort of titles they were making, and they had, like, a really good knack for.
And I remember always, like, I'd feel like, damn, why didn't I think of that one? Like, it was right there. Like, they would come up with a title that you wouldn't necessarily think they were particularly SEO-friendly, but the views they were getting were, like, massive, absolutely massive, and still, to this day, they perform really, really well as well.
They're so, so good at doing it. I remember one specifically that was, like, seven times we could have helped in games, but, oh, no, glass. And what the heck is that title?
But immediately, as a game, you're like, oh, shit, yeah, I know, that exact thing where just a thing happens, but it happens behind glass, and you can't do anything about it. You just have to watch it happen, and you're completely helpless. Like, immediately, if you've played enough games, you know what they're talking about.
And it's that sort of... And again, it's that sort of club and community feel, that thing that only gamers would know. Only gamers would know what that title is referring to.
But it captures a thing so, so well. And they did this time after time after time after time. Like, so, so good at it.
And so they would, you know, talking about those initial inspirations when I started making the Friday features, it became, you know, it became like a Friday list feature arms race between us and outside Xbox. No idea if outside Xbox ever gave a hoot about what we were doing. And also, I want to make it clear, I absolutely love all of the people on outside Xbox.
I think they're great. Having met them at various events, they're all incredibly lovely people and deserve all of the success they've got. But I remember bitterly, jealously looking at some of the titles they thought up for their videos.
And I always got the sense that the titles were swimming above my head. I just had to grab them. And every time I saw a brilliant one that they'd done, I'd be like, damn, damn, they've got it.
I know specifically that thing. Why didn't I think about that thing? But distilling it into a snappy title and then trying to find seven entries that fit that criteria.
And thank God for the website TV Tropes, by the way. The amount of times that's helped me get through a Friday feature episode. It was so challenging to try and hook into, what's the thing?
We'd be there brainstorming titles for list features and none of them were quite there. None of them quite had the and bit, the emotional modifier, as you say, Matthew, the bit that really is going to tip it from being a fine list feature into something that people are really going to latch onto and resonate with and want to watch. So that was always like the thing I was obsessed with, trying to nail that title.
That was something I wanted to ask about as well, Rob. What is the secret to coming up with a good list subject or title? You've done so many at this point, but obviously you think very hard about this because you are paying close attention to what other channels are doing.
Do you have a thought process that got you there each week? What's your creative process there?
I'd like to say I had a formula that I could follow and I could do now, but the truth is that regularly it would be just me staring at a blank computer screen. Occasionally there would be something I would be playing or a discussion we'd have in the office that would just prompt a list feature title and it would just feel like it dropped out of the sky into our lap and like, ah, this is it, this is the one. But most of the time it was not like that.
I remember my morning commute used to be, before I owned a car and I used to have to cycle from my house to Chippenham train station which was about a six mile cycle and then get the train to Bristol and the amount of times I would come up with the Friday, the next Friday feature title whilst cycling from my house to Chippenham train station was like, you know, you don't want to know. That was the place I did the majority of my thinking and I'm sad to say there was no real process behind it. It was just like, you'd get to the day where you had to, it has to be written today, I have to have thought of the title before I finished this cycle ride and some days and some titles we'd nail, some weren't as good.
The ones that absolutely banged, maybe 20 of them, like I made I think 250 in the end, maybe 20 of them I'd be like, yes, that was a really, really good title. But I think what I was just talking about then in terms of trying to get a title that digs into that unique experience of what it's like to play a game and have something that people who play games would recognize about as a thing that is unique to games. That was always for me like the golden ticket to a good title.
Like something that speaks to people, but something that, you know, if my mum looked at it, she'd be like, well, I don't know what that is. I've never experienced being helpless behind a pane of glass while some horrific thing happens on the other side. That doesn't mean anything to someone who doesn't play video games, but there are things video games do that until you point them out, you don't realise, oh yeah, that's a thing.
So I'm not just talking about like regular cliches like I can't even think of any. But you know, those things that you don't usually articulate, but when you do, you realise, oh yeah, that is a thing. That's what we try to get in there every week.
So I think, you know, having like a good hook, but something that the audience can see themselves in. Like, really, we wanted the Friday Features to be a reflection. We wanted people to see their own behaviour and recognise themselves in these videos.
So, a title that would achieve that was always my goal. Most of the time, we didn't get it perfect. A few times, I think we really nailed it.
But after that, it was just, you know, make the video as entertaining as possible. If the title isn't going to be perfect, at least make sure the video is warm and inviting and inclusive and is full of sharp humour and something that people can feel good about themselves having watched it. That's another goal we had was, you know, after someone's watched The Friday Feature, we wanted them to feel good about themselves and also their choice to play video games.
We wanted to make them feel good about being a gamer. That was the thing. So, if we couldn't nail the title, we always tried to nail that.
So, as someone who's made a lot of list features and tried to push into YouTube myself, some stuff about The Friday Feature that particularly resonates, that I always wanted to pick your brains over. I think when people think of The Friday Feature, if they're familiar with them, they've got a very clear image of them. You know, the camera angle, the music, the way you kind of carried yourself in them.
I'm interested, you know, you talked about your inspirations, but how quickly that stuff emerged and did you feel like you nailed it straight away, or was it more of a gradual process?
I think so. I think in terms of the camera angle, that was, you know, that's just ripping off Charlie Brooker's screen wipe, basically. Okay, man sitting down in his lounge watching TV, we tried to make The Friday Feature look like man sitting down in his bedroom playing video games.
We would have regularly in The Friday Feature, I'd have a controller and, you know, secret, I was never actually playing any games, which you may be shocked to hear. But I was always just like looking off into space at an imaginary TV and pretending I was playing. But that's the kind of feel we wanted, that sort of broom cupboard, not too glitzy, not too produced.
We didn't want it to look like a studio. We wanted it to look like a gamer's bedroom. And that was all sort of part of it.
And I think probably that was the bit that we intended to do from the off. And I like to think that we got that bit right and tried to make it feel like this space that wasn't intimidating to come into. It was supposed to feel like a welcoming place to come into.
Like, welcome to my room. Here's what I've been playing and thinking about this week. So yeah, in terms of the music, we had like a few tracks, one track, a bit of licensed music called Whipped Butter 2, which ended up being like the Friday Feature theme tune, I guess, if you like.
It had sort of like an energetic, almost sort of like clownish tone to it. And it was important to make sure that the music reflected the tone of the video. And this is always a thing that I think is difficult when you're making, like, for example, if I'm talking about a horror game in one of these Friday features, there's probably the temptation to stick, like, a horror track underneath it.
But it was always important to me, like, no, you don't want the audience to be scared at this point in the video. Unless you did, of course, but most of the time I wanted the audience to laugh. So the music, I've always found, and really I found it very helpful in terms of punctuating jokes as well.
Like, there were particular tracks that ended on particular beats that I found really just funny. Whenever there was, like, an in-office skit, I used a track called Sneaky Fingers which had, like, a little dun, dun. And it had, like, a lovely, satisfying beat where it ended on a particular little bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
And letting a moment hang on that beat would always, if I had a joke that I wanted to put in the end, I would make sure it fit to that bit of music. Because, for some reason, stuff was just funnier after that little beat of music. It's almost a cheat.
Like, using specific bits of music to achieve a tone and to punctuate jokes. And this is what I think is the main difference when it comes to writing for print and being funny in print, where you have none of it. You're completely dependent on your skill with words.
Whereas when you write for video, you have all of these get out of jail free cards that you can use. You can use visual punctuation, like I said, the seven seconds of bars and tone that I would regularly use to just break up the stuff. There's certain musical tracks you can use.
Various other tricks. We had, obviously, the Friday feature that would alternate between an on sofa line and then they would go into gameplay covered by VO. Just that rhythmic back and forth between the camera and the VO would also give you sort of like a get out of jail free card.
If I was struggling to get from one section to the other, it was very easy for me to just write in a line where I'd be on the camera where you just look at the screen and say or not, or anything like a little bit of punctuation. Or just sometimes it was just a noise. Like I'd try and make some kind of profound point in the VO, for example.
And maybe I landed it, maybe I didn't. But if afterwards I could write a bit where I go back to the sofa and I've just taken the mick out of myself for trying to write a profound point, sometimes it was just like you just make, you know, just blowing a raspberry into the camera. Immediately, that's your get out of jail free card.
That's like, you know, if you didn't find that profound, it's fine, because neither did I. Ha! Look, I'm taking the mick out of myself.
And if you did find it profound, great! You've also got just a little enjoyable bit on the sofa as well. Like, there's loads of little things and cheats I used to do, basically.
But yeah, in terms of the music, there was, you know, like a suite of tracks. Like I had a folder called Friday Feature Music and, you know, the same tracks would get used week in, week out and you get into a rhythm and you'd know if one entry was of a particular energy that I'd need whipped butter five for that one because that's more a beat track. So yeah, that's sort of like what we try to achieve there with the music.
It made the videos funnier than the scripts were. Like if you saw a script for a Friday Feature, if it was printed in a magazine, it would be absolute dross, I expect. But with the delivery that I tried to do, with the music that you'd add, with the editing, hopefully, the idea was you'd get something that would be entertaining and funny.
Matthew, we need more music puncturing our jokes on this podcast, I think. That's what we're really missing, I think.
We just need to sign up whatever music library has whipped butter.
I think they changed the name. They changed the name in the end, which I was very sad about. I don't know what it's called now.
Somewhere out there is a guy who's written whipped butter who doesn't know that his track has had all this sort of...
Occasionally, I'll hear these tracks on YouTube videos that my daughter watches, which is very disconcerting. She'll be watching a video about some horse toys or Minecraft and you'll hear, wait a second, that's whipped butter too.
Going to a live concert here, whipped butters 1 through 5.
Last night at the proms, that's the whipped butter prom.
I also want to ask about in-jokes and lore. Friday Features are very famous for returning characters and weird alternate personas. The most famous one of all is Delson Rodin, who for people who don't know is a puppet of, wait, it's a badger puppet that wears...
It wears the outfit from the limited edition of Infamous Second Son, which just so happened to perfectly fit this badger puppet, and the main character is Delson Roe, hence the pun, Delson Rodin. Even though badgers aren't rodents, I know. The amount of YouTube comments that I've seen, like, actually, do you know badgers?
It doesn't make sense, this pun, anyway. I just wanted to get that off my chest.
Yes, thank you for the clarification. Delson Rodin, who as far as in-jokes go, is probably the fifth member of Access in terms of fame and how easily recognized he is. So that stuff really reminds me of how we used to do things in Mags with comedy personalities or the personas of the other writers or mascots.
NGamer had a couple of shit mascots never really took off. One was called Ninja Cat, it was terrible. Do you think you were drawing on some of that magazine energy?
Or was it particularly conscious of what you were doing with that? Or was it just organic?
It definitely was drawing on that magazine energy, I think. I remember PSM2 had like... I think it was the robot from Forbidden Planet that they had as like the Robo Mind or something.
And every month it would berate readers and call them weak meat sacks and other things that a robot might call a human. So I enjoyed all of that stuff. But I think again, it speaks to me watching other stuff, watching other people make stuff on video and thinking, oh, that's really good.
How can I do something like that? And I think we had a few recurring characters at the time, but I remember the thing that really made me sit up and take notice of, okay, you can do this with video games media, was when Video Gamer made The Miller Report. And I think that was again, almost like...
I can't remember how many episodes there were, but there weren't very many. They had this mad arc of videos that were almost like mockumentaries, where they would go inside the Video Gamer office, and they'd have... All of the members of the team would have these exaggerated personas, and it was almost like the office, in a way.
So you had Steve Burns, who was the asshole deputy editor, just shouting at people with the megaphone. It was just so, so funny. I remember just laughing so much at it.
I think Jim Trinker, another person whose work I greatly admire, and another person who I've never actually spoken to, I don't think, in real life, his stuff on that was just really, really good as well. And they did this mad thing where it was, like, combined with wrestling. All of a sudden, they'd just start doing wrestling moves on each other, and this is mad serious.
Loads of in-jokes, like video game industry in-jokes as well. So to really understand why it was so funny, you had to not only know the games and know wrestling, but also know about very specific UK games media journalists and beef. Like, you know, who hates each other amongst video games journalists and that kind of thing.
But they did this, they ended up doing this mad story where I think in the final episode, Steve Burns jumps out the window into a helicopter and flies away laughing maniacally, and they're all doing wrestling moves on each other. And it got so, it was so outlandish, but I remember thinking, my God, like, how mad, how mad to do something like this. This is, you know, video about video games, and they've got all of this sort of like character and personality.
And I think a lot of it would have been way too niche for PlayStation Access, which has to, you know, we don't want to be writing in jokes about video game journalists. But just...
As an official PlayStation channel.
But seeing what they were doing with like... We'd done skits before, but seeing what they did with just like those exaggerated office personalities, I really enjoyed. And so, as I'd done with like OXM Breakdown and Screenwipe and Harry Hill's TV burp, and as I was doing with outside Xbox's title formats, like I was constantly looking at what other people were doing and seeing what was doing well and thinking, you know, anytime I saw anyone else doing something brilliant, it just annoyed me because I had like that, like almost like a competitive edge where I was like, no, I want my thing to be the best and the funniest and have the best titles and do the most views.
And so I, you know, inspired by that Miller Report type stuff, quite a lot of those personas, you know, those weird personas. And sometimes they were exaggerated versions of ourselves, and sometimes they were actual characters, like, you know, my favorite one that I played was a guy called Jimmy Spoilo, who just goes around spoiling stuff for everybody. The first skit he appeared in was probably one of my favorite ones we ever did.
It's a very simple one. It's just me as Jimmy Spoilo and Dave sitting in a pub, and I ask him, oh, so, you know, you enjoying Red Dead Redemption then? And he's just like, yeah, but I haven't finished it yet, so make sure you don't, apps, don't say anything about the ending of the game, don't hear anything about it at all, blah, blah.
And, you know, I had a little sip of my cider that I had as my prop and then just blurted out what happened at the end. And then, you know, Dave does like a gasping reaction and it immediately cuts to a bit of music. And again, it was just, you know, something very simple, but with music, you know, I still think it's really funny.
One of the skits that actually made me laugh. And so we'd have like these personas come out of it. And then, yeah, Delsin was like in response to we were planning some content around, I think it was PlayStation's 25th anniversary.
And we were thinking of video ideas that could be cool to celebrate the 25th anniversary of PlayStation. And one idea we had was to do an unboxing of the original PlayStation, but to make it like a make it feel like a video from the 90s, almost like it was something that had been unearthed from 1994, this unboxing. So we wanted to have us dressed in 90s style clothes, put a filter on the video so it looked like something from the 90s.
And one of the things that we thought of when we thought 90s was, well, puppet sidekicks. Like we were thinking of, like, you know, Otis the Yardvark and that kind of thing.
Gordon the Gopher.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so that video never actually got made in the end, but that idea of having a puppet sidekick sort of stuck in our heads. And we were like, just one Friday feature, I was like, oh, let's just try the puppet sidekick.
And Nathan brought in his child's Badger puppet. We dressed him in the jacket from the infamous Second Son Collector's Edition. He became Delsin Rodin.
And immediately the comments were just like, oh, my God, I love the Badger. The Badger's got to be in every week. The Badger's got to be in every week.
And so started the journey of Delsin Rodin being in every single Friday feature from then on to the point where I got so sick of him, where we did like a whole, an incredibly convoluted skit, probably the most convoluted skit we've ever done, where we had all of the Friday feature side characters, many of which were played by, so like Dave played two characters in this scene and I played two characters in this scene and Nathan played Brian Cox. For some reason, we have Professor Brian Cox, which Nathan does a quite good impression of as one of the side characters. So we had five characters played by three people all in the same scene, called together into an emergency meeting because the badger had left the channel.
And this lasted like two minutes. And the fact that PlayStation are cool with us doing this kind of stuff, I think speaks to the relationship we have with them, like the stuff they're prepared to be like, okay, this isn't about any of our games, is it? But you know, okay.
And it's ridiculous when you watch it, but like, really, really fun to do. Those were always the days where I really enjoyed coming into the office and had thought up a skit and had written the script for it and was filming it. Like, you know, we'd have a lot of fun doing it.
But yeah, Delsin. Delsin was nominated for a Golden Joystick. In 2015, he was nominated for Gaming Personality of the Year alongside PewDiePie.
We've never been nominated for a Golden Joystick. So that badger really took on like a like a life of his own. Culminating, obviously, in the most ridiculous video we've ever made, which was a half an hour long Avengers Infinity War style siege of the Access office by Delsin and an army of puppets because he was so disgusted at being left off the channel.
The original cut of it was 20 minutes, was half an hour long. And it wasn't about games at all. And so eventually, I think the final compromise was it was down to about 20 minutes and we weaved like a traditional list feature into it.
So there was some game stuff in there. But, you know, mad. Like an absolutely mad video to think of putting on an official PlayStation channel.
But, you know, there was one scene that didn't make the cut that had Jimmy Spoiler in it. That I sort of like, you know, I'm sad about to this day because I really loved it. But looking back on it, like the exchanges of emails I was having, I was arguing like, no, the Jimmy Spoiler scene has to be in it because it's crucial, because then we can't get from there to there.
And like, you know, I got so impassioned about it, you know, mad stuff. Especially when you talk about it out loud, like how did we ever, you know, this is an official PlayStation channel. Why are we making a half hour video about badgers and like other puppets fighting us?
Is that the most work you've ever done for a dumb video gag?
Oh, yeah, for sure. Like, I remember one scene was like a Mission Impossible style scene where the puppets had to hack Rosie's computer. Like they had a password to get upstairs and they had to get it off Rosie's computer.
And to do that, they tied up one of them and had him coming down from the ceiling like Tom Cruise style. And I remember literally for two hours, I was there with a camera with a string, with a puppet on the end of it, just moving this puppet up and down and up and down. And it would come into shot and it would be like rotating the wrong way.
And it wasn't at quite the right angle. And I remember thinking like, what the heck am I doing? Just for two solid hours, just recording, pulling this string up, slowly lowering this puppet into the shot.
Yeah, like in the matter of time, we're just on our hands and knees with our with the ridiculous things we had to do, like standing puppets in the background of a shot. They couldn't stand by themselves, so we had to put like coke bottles underneath them all to like stand them up in the background of these shots. You know, ridiculous, ridiculous.
But, you know, a lot of fun to make when I look back on it now, the ridiculous things we were doing. But yeah, I love that video. I love that video.
But it's definitely not something we would make now.
Yeah, that's great. I love, I love demented stuff like that. You know, you said you, you know, you did these for like, you know, four or five years.
Once you actually like settled into that list feature format, what was your actual working routine like then? Was every week like exactly the same?
Pretty much, yeah. Like I had a writing day, which was Tuesday, and I worked from home on the Tuesday, and the goal was the script just has to be written on the Tuesday. And sometimes I would finish it within like good time.
Mostly, I would not because I'm a terrible procrastinator, and either inspiration wouldn't strike, or I'd just be sitting in front of the computer screen not writing. So regularly, I would just finish quite late at night. But every Tuesday was writing day, then Wednesday was the recording day, where we'd do the sofa bits and any sort of additional skits that needed doing.
And then Thursday and Friday was editing day. Friday would go across. We'd try and make them a week in advance, so that we were never going really close to the wire and giving us a little bit of a buffer on the following Monday as well.
And then typically Monday would be like, brainstorm day to try and think of the next one. But it was pretty much my job, and that was all I had to worry about was the Friday feature. So Monday would be thinking of one, Tuesday would be writing it, Wednesday filming it, Thursday, Friday editing it.
And that was pretty much the routine for four or five years. Sounds great, to be honest. I mean, it sort of was, yeah.
Like, I remember at the time thinking, man, like, how long am I going to be doing this for? But now, I mean, there are other parts of my job now that I enjoy, and I enjoy the challenge of some of the stuff I have to do now, and my job is certainly more varied. But a part of me definitely misses that concentrated.
And just the fact that I could be head down, headphones on, don't have to worry about being interrupted, don't have to worry about answering emails or anyone asking me questions about anything. Just, you know, you sit there, write it, then you sit there and edit it. And that's sort of what I did for about four or five years.
I'm trying to think of the best way of asking this question without it making me sound sort of sad and tragic. But I'm kind of curious what it's like having the thing that everyone wants, in terms of having a really successful video series. That's why it sounds a bit tragic.
What's it like to be successful, Rob? That's the energy of this question. When you're in the depths of that and you've got videos that are doing a million views, say, did you find that purely positive and motivating?
Or was there stress baked into that, the fear of having to keep that momentum going?
I think a little bit of the fear and the stress of having to keep it going, yeah. But I think almost overwhelmingly it was a positive thing and something that, you know, it's easy to be motivated when the thing you're working on is doing really well. And like, you know, in my wildest dreams, I could not have imagined the amount of people that would watch these Friday Features.
And yeah, it's an amazingly flattering feeling when you put it live on a Friday and you see comments of people being like, oh, yes, this is the highlight of my week. I love this time on a Friday. This is great.
Yeah. And, you know, it's as I mentioned before, like so much of my sense of self-worth became attached to this video. By the end of them, like I was pouring so much of myself into them as well in terms of like they almost by the end of it have become a journal of my own video game life, really.
And the tone of them shifted towards the end from... I still always try to make them as funny as possible, but there were quite a few episodes that I did towards the end of it that were not intended to be funny at all and were actually... I wanted them to be quite heartfelt and honest and vulnerable and...
Everyone's like, bring back the badger.
But it was, you know, it sounds cheesy to say, but it was almost like a form of therapy in a way for me because I've never been particularly good about... I've never been particularly good at communicating about myself or expressing my own feelings. I'm not a particularly good talker or communicator like that.
And all of a sudden I had this platform where hundreds of thousands of people were listening and watching every week. And I didn't really have anyone telling me what to do or what not to do. It was like an amazingly liberating feeling where I could just pretty much.
And now that I'm not doing it, it is a thing that I sort of miss quite a lot. I don't have that outlet now to do that. And I think those four or five years, I think they're over now.
It's sort of like a lightning in a bottle moment. Like an amazing thing that happened. Yeah, it did make me feel amazing, I guess, as it would.
You go to EGX and people come up to you and say that your work meant a lot to them. It's never anything less than an incredibly humbling thing to have someone come and say to you. And I think if the me that wrote that letter into PSM2 when I was 18 could have seen that, I would have been bowled over by it.
So, yeah, looking back on it, it was, you know... There were stresses, obviously, when I was doing it. I obviously worried about, you know, how long can I keep doing this for?
And the comments weren't 100% positive. Like, you know, I get some criticism in there about using the same games, not using a massive variety of games, repeating formulas, like, you know, really the comment would be, sounds like you're running out of ideas a little bit.
We get out on this podcast, too.
Well, my opinion is that every time you have an idea, you've, by definition, just run out of ideas, right? Like, I've just had my idea. That means I've run out of ideas until I have another idea next week.
So no one ever runs out of ideas. But there was sort of that sense that, you know, how long can this go on for? And I think if I'm being really honest, I probably should have stopped making them about two years before I actually did.
Because by the end, they were probably getting a bit self-indulgent. And I think I'd lost that sort of spark that they had in that period where we were trying to really resonate with people watching them and hold up a mirror to their own experiences. They were about 10 to 12 minutes every week.
And by the end, they were about 15 to 18 minutes. They were getting a bit long and waffly. They outstayed their welcome, I think, towards the end.
But it's something I do miss doing. And certainly I miss that thrill of waking up on a Saturday morning and seeing the amount of views they'd done. It's impossible not to get a little bit hooked on that feeling, I think.
But yeah, there are certainly, I guess, drawbacks to it after it's finished.
Yeah, that's really interesting. That's what Sam sometimes says after questions.
I say that after every single fucking question. I have to cut it out in the edit afterwards. It's so embarrassing.
I'm like, oh, I'm no fucking parkie. That's for damn sure.
Well, my thing is always, oh, awesome. Awesome. It doesn't matter who I'm speaking to.
They could have made the point that's really, really like, you know, harrowing. Oh, awesome.
You know, you mentioned there are people coming up to you at EGX and things. The list definitely made you YouTube famous in terms of like the size of audience you had. I am interested, like, does that translate into sort of quote unquote real life fame?
Or is it kind of quite contained to the platform?
It's mostly almost overwhelmingly very contained to the platform, I think. Like you go to E3 or EGX and you get recognized and people come up to talk to you. And that's, you know, that's it's never been anything other than a novelty for me.
And I always love when that happens. Very, very occasionally I'll get recognized in the real world. Randomly, there always seems to be like a it's never just in the street.
It's always somewhere really weird, like the I was recognized on a on a dolphin watching trip in Croatia by a German tourist right at the start of the trip. The tour guide was speaking to everyone in German and then asked, does anyone need me to speak in English? And me and my family were like, yeah, sorry, sorry.
Yeah, we're English speakers. And I saw this guy sort of look at me and like do a double take and I was like, oh, no. He came over and he was like, are you Rob from PlayStation Access?
Yes, yes, I am. And then I was just trapped on this boat with this man for two hours as we went around watching dolphins together. And then the weirdest one, though, was my wife and I were in the car park of KFC in Trowbridge, having just got our Philip burger meals, and we went back to eat them in the car, as you do.
And all of a sudden we were in the car, the doors were closed, and this kid just opened the car door. And I was just there like with a face full of chicken burger. And he was like, are you Rob from PlayStation Access?
And I was sort of like, I couldn't believe what had happened. I couldn't believe someone had just come up and opened my car door. And I had, you know, a whole wedge of chicken burger in my mouth.
So I sort of was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I didn't really say too much else to him. And he was just like, oh, cool.
I really like your videos. Then he shut the car door and walked away. And then my wife told me off for being rude to him.
Which I thought was like, you know. I didn't think it was rude. It's like, why do you say, why were you so short with that man?
I had a mouthful of chicken burger and I was in my car.
I'm in the private space of my car.
I would love it.
I'd have said, here's seven reasons you should fuck off.
I would love it if I was recognised in the street. That would be fine and great. But yeah, someone coming up to my car and doing that was a little bit weird.
But no, to answer your question, it almost overwhelmingly doesn't spill over into real life and I'm free to go about the big shop in Morrisons every week and do all that kind of stuff. The majority of people will only recognise me at a video game convention and stuff. So it's definitely very contained.
And I guess, do you still enjoy list feature or are you just sick of them? Are you just sick of the format?
I like good videos. I like good stuff. And I think there are list features and then there are list features.
There are some list features that, there's nothing wrong with that, but their goal is definitely, let's get the best title. It's an SEO exercise. And then there are list features.
And I guess I'll sort of shift the question to, do I still enjoy videos about video games? And the answer is absolutely yes, really good ones. I think a recent example of someone who I was bitterly jealous of how good their videos were was Brian David Gilbert on Polygon.
So good, so funny. Just what he was doing with that. And by that time it was too late for me to...
The Friday features were already coming to an end. So unlike outside Xbox and Video Gamer and OXM Breakdown, it was too late for me to start assimilating stuff from that. And I don't think I'd have been able to, to be honest, because what he was making was so, so good and funny.
Like he made a video about... He made a video called the Hideo Kojima Name Generator, where he crafted like a D&D style dice rolling system complete with a set of questions that you had to go to and some roles that you had to do to determine what your Hideo Kojima name would be. And it was an amazing format, whilst also being a brilliant commentary on the mad names that Kojima gives his characters in games.
Like it's so, so funny, so well observed. And you could download the actual PDF of this thing that he'd made and roll your own Kojima name. And the comments was just full of like that level of...
That's what you're looking for, is that amazing level of engagement. We've done something really well observed, brilliantly written. So funny, like his delivery spot on.
And he made this thing that was so engaging. Obviously, when you watch that, the first thing you want to do is download the thing, roll the dice yourself and comment with what your Hideo Kojima name is. Like I was so bewildered by how good that was.
I just sort of like, I remember watching that just with like... I can't really do anything other than just really enjoy this, to be honest. Because it's so, so good.
I'm too jealous. I can't enjoy this stuff. Like when I was struggling on RPS to get anyone to watch anything and have people go, oh, this guy's good.
As if that was like a useful guidance at all. Yeah, he's also like an incredibly singular talent. So like, unless you want to fucking hire him.
But again, I think he stopped that series after 20, 25 episodes or so. Again, to me, I love, you know, again, I think the Friday Features should have stopped way sooner than they did. Maybe then they could be seen as this, you know, this connective stuff that has like real sort of value and quality, like I think of the OXM breakdown and Brian David Gilbert stuff.
But yeah, I still, you know, obviously video game magazines aren't the thing they used to be. I still enjoy really good, really funny, really creative games media coverage. Sort of those days of like obsessively reading games mags over and over again, cover to cover in my bedroom at night there, you know, there.
Those days are gone. I do really enjoy like a really well crafted video. Yes, absolutely.
Oh, that's good.
Have you heard Games Court, Rob? Have you been sort of like tainted with this as Matthew discussed?
I've heard about it a little bit, yes.
Yeah, I think that's the future of games content, honestly. It's like, I think we're secondhand game purchasers, fictional judge.
Well, that's the kind of thing that you would get in a mag, right? I love that kind of... I remember there was like a review scale, and I think it was OPM.
I think it was Nick Ellis. I remember him wearing some ridiculous judge's costume and consigning video games to execution by like ridiculous methods, like being smashed to bits with a baseball bat or being run over by a bicycle and that kind of thing. But yeah, I love stuff like that, like reviewing games or analyzing games, but framing it in like a really fun way that isn't just, here are my opinions on this game.
I've always loved that kind of stuff.
I've been through the cycle of struggling to enjoy list features, actually. So it's nice to hear that you're not completely burned out on them. There were two lists recently of the 100 best TV shows of all time, and I didn't even read them.
And there were people who tweeted the top 10s. I was like, yeah, whatever. I just can't even engage with them anymore.
I think the sheer repetition does change your perspective on them a little bit. But yeah, maybe that's just me.
I really wanted to wrap this episode up with a short little exercise and a fun nod to your beloved number seven. I wanted to ask what were the seven best games to make lists about or draw lists from? You mentioned people would complain that you pull from like too small a pool or not this game again.
What were your... Maybe there aren't seven, but what were your absolute gold standard? You can always relearn these for a good list.
Yeah, well, I think the first one is a quite obvious one to anyone who's watched any of the videos, and that's Metal Gear Solid or the wider Metal Gear series. We had a running in joke where Dave had like a... He kept a tally of how many times I'd mentioned it in a Friday feature, and we had to re-film him filling in that tally multiple times because we'd reach the end.
We'd film him going from like one to 40, for instance, and then we realized, oh, we've run out of tally. We have to film you again going from like 40 to 100, and then we ran out of that. So Metal Gear, I mean, this could easily just descend into what are your seven favorite games, but I think the Metal Gear series was so good for these list features because when we were trying to make lists that were talking about video games in interesting ways or trying to dig into that experience of playing video games, there's so much that Metal Gear does that is interesting and unique and, you know, when you're talking, you know, you make a list feature, you could do, you know, seven times video games have broken the fourth wall, for instance, immediately Metal Gear is going to be the series you look to in that.
Or like I mentioned earlier, like a boss fights randomly was like a topic we kept on coming back to again and again with the Friday features because for some reason people just really like watching list feature videos about bosses. So we did loads of list features about bosses. Metal Gear, again, famous for having really memorable and iconic boss encounters.
So in addition to the fact that I just love the games, it was just ripe for, you know, you could easily put a Metal Gear game into anything. And by the end of it, I had to make a conscious effort to not just stick Metal Gear into things because of those comments that were like, have you played any other games? If you only played Metal Gear and Final Fantasy, you know, perhaps quite right to have that kind of criticism because it was very easy to fall back on those with the game.
That's the game I knew very, very well. Another one that I overused was Skyrim. Again, the same as Metal Gear, and I think this is going to be a common theme through all of these games.
Just so much is in that game that you can talk about so many different aspects of it when you're talking about an open world or you're talking about NPC behavior. I did a list feature all about ways that you can annoy NPCs, and Skyrim's NPCs are so deliciously annoyable. They're so funny to kill.
There are certain games with NPCs that I just think they're built in such a way that the game wants you to kill them. Killing NPCs in Skyrim is just funny. It's so, so funny.
Skyrim is just ripe for that kind of stuff. It's a beautiful game. It's a massive game.
It's obviously a game that resonates with millions of people. We're now on the third generation of it being still, when you think of seminal open world fantasy role playing games, Skyrim is still always going to be up there. It is one of my all time favorites, yes, but also a game that proved great inspiration for many a list feature.
Final Fantasy VII is a game I've included, but you could substitute any Final Fantasy in here, any list feature where I wanted to talk about story or character or again, boss fights or amazing visuals. When the Friday features became a vehicle for me to talk about the experience of playing games, I felt like the actual games that were being included were less important than the subject matter. That's why I would regularly go back to the same pool of games that resonated with me.
The idea was always that people would watch these videos and not necessarily be able to resonate with those particular games, but resonate with the experience I had had with the games and maybe replace a Final Fantasy or Metal Gear or Skyrim with something they had played. As long as they sort of got that experience and got that thing I was trying to communicate. For instance, like the outside Xbox, witnessing a horrendous death behind a pane of glass.
I could talk about that in Bioshock, for instance. I remember distinctly that scene where you first meet a big daddy in it, like, maulsome, or in Dead Space, where you see the necromorphs for the first time behind glass and there's nothing you can do about it. Loads of other examples of that happening in games that I probably have never played.
The idea was that other people could see those bits and not necessarily feel excluded from the list if they hadn't played that game. As long as they experienced that thing in another game, that was fine. Final Fantasy, again, a game and a series, a wider series that's just ripe for that kind of stuff.
The Witcher 3 was another one that we used loads. Just another very obvious, beautiful open world video game full of mini games and story choices. So any video about choices, which is also another popular topic, choices or heroes or love interests, it was so easy to dip into The Witcher for that kind of thing.
Dark Souls, I think, probably one of their. Dark Souls. And again, you can insert any of the From Software or Soulsborne titles into this slot.
Probably, I would argue, the most influential video game of the last, I don't know, the last 10 to 15 years. The impact that Dark Souls has had on video games is just so enormous. It's up there with, I think, Resident Evil 4 in terms of how...
You can see it. You can see Dark Souls DNA in so many games, even games that aren't Souls-like games now. The fact that Souls-like is even a word.
You've got a Metroidvania, you've got a Roguelike and a Roguelike, you've got a Souls-like. It's a whole genre now. And it's so...
the DNA of it is baked so much into so many games now. But all of the things that Dark Souls did, we make a video about seven nonsense things you try before playing the game for real, for example. And these would be things like trying to figure out whether fire will burn you, trying to figure out if you take fall damage from falling off a big height.
Dark Souls is just absolute gold for all of that kind of stuff, because it's very easy to put Dark Souls in there and be like, oh, yeah, you did die. Or, oh, yeah, of course, you got lit on fire by walking into a bonfire. Of course you did.
And besides that also, bosses being a big thing for us. The amount of times we made videos about bosses. So bosses we didn't want to kill.
Secret bosses that should have been left well alone. Seven most WTF bosses in video games. The amount of Dark Souls or Bloodborne bosses that I could easily put in there.
And it was almost inexhaustible, like the list of bosses. I tried never to repeat a boss in any of these videos. In fact, in that video that did, you know, the seven bosses we didn't want to kill, I talked about the boss from Metal Gear Solid 3, but another massive entry in that one was Sif, the great wolf from Dark Souls, like, you know, a famously harrowing boss fight where you learn the backstory of this wolf who's, you know, trying to protect its master.
And, you know, it makes you feel terrible for killing him. So, yeah, like the amount of Friday features that would have Dark Souls or a Souls like game in them were huge. Towards the end as well, when I talked about making lists that felt a little bit more personal to me and had a lot of myself and my own experience in them, you know, I would tend to fall back on games like What Remains of Edith Finch, which is one of my favorite games of all time.
Yeah. Really short game, only two hours long, but like the journey that game takes you on. And you were asking earlier, Sam, about, you know, games that still surprise you.
And I remember this as being a game that surprisingly surprised me, because I felt like I was in a time of my life where, you know, I felt like I'd played it all. I've seen it all. Like there's nothing video games can do that I haven't seen before now.
And then What Remains of Edith Finch came along and for the entire two hour run time, constantly did things I'd never seen in a game before. So that was like, you know, golden as well. Fantastic, fantastic game full of incredible storytelling and wonderful emotional moments that you could, you know, I could fill in all these very sort of like self indulgent list features with and use games like What Remains of Edith Finch to really sort of dial down on that experience.
If I had to pick a seventh one, I think I would probably go for Journey for similar reasons. Journey, I think. Journey is my favorite game of the PS3 generation.
What Remains of Edith Finch is my favorite game of the PS4 generation for quite similar reasons. Very short, beautiful, incredibly memorable. I've only played it once, but that playthrough is so burnt into my memory.
It left such a lasting impression on me that I just couldn't help but use it and talk about it regularly in these videos. So yeah, that would be my seven, which apart from Dark Souls pretty closely resembles games that would all be in my personal top ten. I wouldn't put Dark Souls in there, not because I don't think it's an amazing game, just because I'm utterly hopeless at it and I have absolutely no hope of ever finishing that ever.
The only Souls-like game I've finished is Bloodborne, and I only finished that because other members of the Access team dragged me through it cooperatively.
Yeah, very relatable from software experience there. Sorry, Matthew.
I would also say don't ever go back and listen to earlier episodes of this podcast, because I'm pretty sure I dismissively described Journey as a bit diddly-dee, which is...
Well, no, it is. It definitely is. You can definitely see it as that, but I remember the impact it had on me when I first played it and I thought, oh, wow, what a marriage of visuals and music.
Yeah, I thought it was fantastic. But absolutely, I could see why someone would describe it as a bit diddly-dee.
Amazing. Well, thanks so much for that list, Rob. It gives us a good snapshot of how you worked over the years, really by including the entire Final Fantasy series.
You've chucked in like 30-odd games there. Yeah, that's plenty.
This has been great. I really enjoy talking about this stuff. As someone who is still making their way in video land, awesome to hear your thoughts.
Yeah, it's nice hearing your points of inspiration and the things that drove you there are quite trad. Like, say, print media and Charlie Brooker and stuff like that. These are all basically the same influences that I had working in games media, but your path is completely different and fascinating to hear about.
So thanks so much for your time, Rob.
Thank you so much for having me on. I've really enjoyed reminiscing and digging into all this stuff. So, yeah, thank you.
Awesome. So where can people get your social media, Rob?
So I'm on Twitter or X, I guess we should call it. Rob underscore Pearson 86. And I think my Instagram is the same as that as well.
And those are the two places I mainly hang out on social media.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
At MrBazzle underscore pesto on X.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on X and also Blue Sky and the podcast Backpage Pod on X and also, stop saying X Matthew, and also Blue Sky. And yeah, we'll be back next week with a new episode.
Thanks so much, Rob. And yeah, catch you later.
