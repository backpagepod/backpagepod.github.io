Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, some pod admin up top. Oh wait, not pod admin. Yeah, in fact, I will start with that.
So the podcast will not be going live next Friday as usual because we're having a week off. You may have noticed that we've done a few chunky episodes in a row. And so we thought we would take off the gas just a little bit to recover psychologically from the All-Star Japanese Game Developer Draft.
So for the free feed, you will be getting Two Giant Men Play Bully, which is one of our Patreon episodes, next Friday. It's a great episode. There's a lot of cursed school memories shared by myself and Matthew in that one, all about Rockstar's game from about 20 years ago, a fun one.
And if you are missing us and want an original episode, there will still be on the following Monday, Two Giant Men Play Atari 50. We're playing a bunch of old Atari games for an upcoming episode. So that's the pod admin out of the way, Matthew, patreon.com, Back Page pod if you'd like to support us.
But I wanted to ask you about the 007 first state of play, which I just watched all of the first gameplay bit and a bit of the developer commentary thing that followed. But it feels like this is going to be one of our big games next year. I mean, it's one of the big games, but James Bond is sort of one of our things on this podcast, and Hitman is also one of our things, obviously.
So the two things converging seem significant. How are you feeling about it?
Yeah, I'm feeling good. I was excited to see the game because I'd had a few excited messages from friends who'd, I think, either seen the game at Gamescom. I get the impression a big batch of people went over to IO and saw it as well.
An early word was, don't worry about the James Bond game, it's looking pretty good. And so that kind of got me excited to see it. Yeah, and I get the feeling we just got shown what everyone was showing at Gamescom, really.
That big chunky demo showing off some driving action, some sort of hitman social stealth, and some more out and out, over the top action. Very unchartedy set piece involving a plane. I thought it looked fun.
I thought it maybe looked a little rough around the edges in places. Definitely very ambitious pushing their hitman engine. Is it Glacier?
Is that what it's called?
They all got icy names after they got by Glacier.
Yes. Pushing that quite hard. It looks pretty good.
I like the tone of it. That was really my big thing was what is Young Bond like, and what's he going to sound like, and sort of hearing him because I think some people dinged the launch, the reveal trailer for being this sort of generic looking young chap who kind of turns up. But I kind of liked it.
I like the tone of it. I like the kind of sort of the cockiness, but also the kind of confidence in his action seemed quite well judged to me. I liked how much variety of action there was in that demo.
Obviously, they cut out a big chunk, which could have been like an hour of really slow stealth for all we know. But it looked quite exciting and fast moving. Less sort of dragging people into bathrooms and putting on their clothes.
And the stealth has a bit more kind of momentum to it. And that's what I got from the second half of the state of play, where they sort of showed off some more of the kind of routes that are open to you in stealth. And he can kind of just like confidently blag his way into places by sort of telling people that he's meant to be there.
Which I guess is kind of like his Hitman disguise. Where he goes in and just goes, Johnson sent me, I've got to go in that place. And then they're like, oh yeah, sure, okay.
I quite like that as a mechanic. But then also having like the enforcer type characters from Hitman who see through your bullshit so you need to sort of scare them off before you can sort of bellow at the kind of weaker minded fools to get into places. There was a lot in it.
I'm still kind of digesting it. What did you make of it?
Yeah, I like that they've waited so long now that the first proper gameplay reveal of it can be so substantial.
Yeah.
Because it seemed like they were very firmly breaking it down. It was like, here's your Hitman style social stealth element to this mission. Here's your driving element to the mission, and here's your uncharted element to the mission.
It's interesting because I think the very easy thing to do would be to say, well, IO Interactive has never been good at the sort of action part of these games. It's always been the stealth part they thrive at, and then when they move outside of that with something like Kane and Lynch, it's a bit more of a mixed bag and Hitman Absolution. But so many years ago that that happened.
I want to give it the benefit of the doubt on those things for now. I think it was bold that it started with a very, very long driving section before the actual social stealth bit began. I guess they were just setting up context because there's a lot of just talking while driving.
But I was like, wow, that's a notably long stretch in a car. That's about, I think about maybe two minutes or three minutes, something like that. But then when they got to the main mission space and it was very Hitman-y and it was like, oh, you need your press pass to get in here.
And, oh, I don't have a press pass. Oh, you just need an ID then. Then he sets fire to something in a wheelbarrow and then distracts a guard.
I was like, oh, there's a lot of Hitman in this, which is reassuring. I couldn't really picture, you know, like sort of Roger Moore James Bond setting fire to something in a wheelbarrow, but that's okay because it's video games, isn't it? And then the driving bit, I was sort of like, it looks like your classic sort of, when a PS2 Bond game would have a driving bit, right?
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
You know what I mean?
PS2 or 360 era. It had, yeah, powerful. It's the driving bit of an EA license game.
Yeah, which is to say, they would sometimes be of quite a high standard, those driving bits. But I was watching it thinking, oh, maybe it's really hard to design these to make them incredibly exciting. It made me think about what are the car chases I've played in games where they've really got the blood pumping.
And I can only think of your mega scripted ones, like the Shaggo Hot Chase, we're not even driving an MGS3, where there's a use of different camera angles and things popping out of nowhere and a fucking giant mech chasing after you to make that exciting.
What about chasing OG Locke in a little go-kart?
Well obviously that's up there, going along that PS2-hour Santa Monica Pier. It's equally exciting for sure. I suppose there's been plenty of this in GTAs, they've made it interesting sometimes by having bits where, obviously with the armies coming after you, the stakes feel really high.
In this particular chase, it's on the first bit of the game, I wouldn't say it got the pulse racing massively, the driving bits.
Weirdly, it reminded me of Mafia The Old Country, which we've obviously both just been playing, but in that it was countryside driving, quite linear, but had very scripted elements where it was suddenly like, you have to drive through this field to overtake them, and there's a person in the car with you who's doing quite a lot of heavy lifting to kind of keep the momentum and excitement up of like, I can see him, he's just over there, even though you can't see him at all. There was a lot of that.
Yeah, for sure. And so I was, I wasn't, but I would say that I had no negative response to it at all. I was just a bit like, okay, interesting.
I'm, you know, we're so early on in like, in this game's deal, and it's, this is going to be probably your first instance of driving in the game at all, so it's functionally a tutorial in some ways.
What about the weird bit where he hacked the plane, and then controlled the spin of it to knock everyone over? That was weird.
That was weird. I was going to say that, so then you get to the third and final bit with the, you know, and like it's, it's where the cover shooting begins, and there's some fun kind of like contextual melee stuff in there, like pushing a guy or whatever, and just, you know, and him quipping as he shoots guys, which is, you know, appropriately bond. And then, yeah, you see the plane, and you're like, oh, wow, we're doing this, are we?
We're doing Uncharted 3, we're fucking going. And then, yeah, guests on the plane, and yeah, there's wild mechanic where all that stuff spins around. Then you see like, what I assume is like, you know, PS5 dev kit being brought to its knees by all this debris moving around this airplane.
As the frame rate goes down. And I think that's what you're talking about with rough around the edges.
Yeah, that was the little bit where I was like, oh, is this butting off more than it can chew? I mean, fair play to them for showing it like that, because you're like, this feels like quite an honest depiction of how this game's currently running. Yeah, not that we get too hung up on that stuff, but it was quite noticeable.
It was throwing around so much. We're just so used to seeing that stuff kind of purely in Naughty Dog games, where they're so pristine. You know, I just wonder if people will always compare it to those games in their heads, and it just becomes like an impossible bar to meet.
The thing is that regardless of, you know, whether it looks as polished as those things at this stage, it's clear that they've spent an absolute ton of money on it. It looks so lavish. And I really appreciate that.
I mean, it's nice to have, to see like a blockbuster game where, you know, the sensibilities of this podcast are well represented, I guess. And I truly, in the honest sense, wish them well, I want this game to absolutely bang. So I'm not hugely critical of any part of it.
I'm not really critical at all. I'm really open minded about it. So that's where I landed with it, Matthew.
How about you?
I definitely think the little bit at the end of the state of play where they showed off sort of a deeper dive into some of the stealth systems and combat system showed that there was a bit of meat on the bones. Some of the combat actually reminded me a bit of first Sleeping Dogs. Like it looked like there was a lot of environmental sort of shoving people into doors and they'd crack and using little contextual things in the environment, which I'm always a fan of.
Anything where you've had to spend loads of money on like one lavish animation that only ever triggers if you do this very specific thing. I mean, I know it's wasteful, I fucking love all that stuff. It gets my blood pumping.
Me too. Never quite enough games that do that contextual third-person thing. It's always fun when it happens.
It was Sleeping Dogs USP that you could slam a guy's head in a shutter or whatever.
Yeah, just lots of props and I like that they seem to be honouring Daniel Craig's slightly more kind of sledgehammer bond with your ability to sort of charge into people and sort of shunt them over edges or punch them through doors or whatever. It had a bit of that kind of weight to it. Yeah, it looks like they're trying to do it all and, you know, it's interesting that game seems, from that demo at least, that you are going to have to engage with every bit of it.
It's not like there's a stealth-only version of this. You know, it wants you to enjoy a very actiony bond, a very stealthy bond and a drivey bond. And I'm actually, I'm involved with that, you know.
If it justifies making all those things feel exciting and polishing them all to a bit of a shine, it's always a bummer when you work on all this stuff and everyone avoids it because they just want to play the stealth version or whatever. So yeah, it's got some good music as well. I mean, it's just the bond music, but it's cool.
Yeah. It's funny because it's got, I suppose the mix of it is not hugely dissimilar to something like Everything or Nothing, which tried to be the everything bond game of its day, you know?
It really does, yeah, look like that. It reminded me a lot of, you know, between the action and the driving stuff. Was it the 361, was it Bloodstone?
Yeah, Bloodstone.
That did both those modes. You know, it just can't help but feel a bit like all of those slightly 6 out of 10 bond games. But maybe that made by this particular team with this amount of money, you know, you have to assume that it may actually work out all right this time.
And it gets the tone right, you know? And it gets the storytelling right. That's the thing.
You're the biggest Dexter head I know, Matthew. And what's your take on Patrick Gibson, the Irish actor playing Bond?
I'm interested to see what he does because, yes, he plays young Dexter in Dexter... Is it called Dexter First Blood or Dexter Original Sin?
Original Sin.
Original Sin. They've all got names like that. He's obviously doing an impression of Michael C.
Hall in that, and quite a good impression, you know, trying to kind of rewind the kind of clock on him by 20 years. So he's doing the American accent and everything. And he's quite a dweeb in that and sort of lacking in social graces, if you know the Dexter character at all, that'll make sense.
So seeing him play a bit more kind of cocky. But I think that's probably closer to who, like just in the little interview bit you saw with him where he sort of said, hi, I'm going to be James Bond or whatever. You're like, oh yeah, that guy could probably do this perfectly well.
Yeah, I'm into it.
Yeah, absolutely. I want it to be good so much. And I think there's early signs there are super positive.
And I like how confident the unveiling is, how much of it they showed. So yeah, can't wait to see more. And yes, did they reveal a release date?
I did get to the end of the video.
I think it's March the 27th.
Oh, shit! Well, I just learned that live in this podcast.
Yeah, that's like a couple of days before my birthday. That's going to be great.
Oh, nice. That'll be here in no time. Well, OK, well, that's a nice, healthy little preamble, Matthew.
We've got other pod admin to kind of get through at some point. We've got to talk about the results of the Metacritic games. Spoiler alert, two of the judges didn't even bother replying, so that was good.
Maybe they're busy. So yeah, I mean, they're very busy people, but we'll have to call it on seven out of nine, I think. So yeah, Matthew did win four, three.
I will go through the comments we got from the judges, because they were very funny, but I'll do that in the mailbag episode in a couple of weeks, because I think that I can wait till then.
Maybe the others will have got bad Cheap Boy then.
I guess I can chase them, but I don't want to start being like fucking a PR, but like in my spare time in my own email for my own podcast. I do that all day. I don't want to be doing that at home.
Yeah, I get that.
Yeah, and then the draft is ongoing. Matthew is ahead by about five votes. I think Matthew is going to win the All-Star Japanese Game Developer Draft.
So, but I'm very close behind. I think it's something like 54 to 49 at a last look to Matthew.
Yeah, and Dave's not even in the conversation.
Yeah, it's sort of Dave and Ash. Ash has done all right better than Dave has. But yeah, it's definitely, it's become a two-horse race again.
How do you think the, what do you think the narrative has been shaking out of that? Because the response to the episode has been unbelievable. Like it's a huge amount of comments, people really engaging with it.
It's gone down well, I think.
Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad people enjoyed it. It was quite an undertaking.
It was a stressful evening. We had a lot of technical issues that were edited out of the episode, you know, and it was and it ran almost four hours to begin with. That was that was the crazy thing.
It was crazy.
So by the end, we were so tired. That's why the thing that most pained me listening back to it was the absolutely shit job I did of making any kind of case for Chrono Trigger. I think the only thing I technically say about Chrono Trigger is that involves time travel.
That's it. There's no other details because I just had my eyes on the prize, by which I mean stopping the recording and going to bed. So there was that element to it.
So apologies if the ending is a little underpowered because of that. Narrative-wise, I think people probably took a bit of pity on me, or I think people came away feeling that I'd been bundled on a little bit. Obviously, that's a narrative I lent into in the episode.
I've seen some people who think I was genuinely winded and, you know, that's acting, baby.
He did you. He played you like a damn fiddle.
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was making you think he was on the back foot in the Japanese All-Star Draft.
I was thinking, the whole thing's got the vibe of Spacey Limping at the end of the usual sucks makes, and it turning into a jog.
It turning into a jog, camera pans up, and I'm holding 10 slightly average Japanese games.
Yeah, just looking at the bottom of a mug that says Chrono Trigger, I just thought...
Yeah, there was a bit of that. You've got to use everything, right?
It's one of those things where I thought, because there were even people saying, I voted for Matthew because I took pity on him. And I was like, I sort of, I may be wonder if the kill and steal were like a failure, because the way people engaged with it was, oh, well, they suffered at the hands of the rules that made this more entertaining, therefore I will vote for them, which is, I mean, that's classic annoying listener behavior. You know, it's just, it is what it is.
You got to go with it though. You got to lean into it.
But I would say that was only really a few people. I think most people just liked your game choices. I think your 10 was strong if you didn't have that context.
The categories where you got stolen from, it's not like there was a shortage of games in each one. So if you had the Astrobot stolen or killed, that would have been a really hairy category for you. But there are plenty of Konami games, you know.
Unfortunately there are so many From Software games that you still managed to make that work. Even though you did message me the day the draft went live going, oh, it was the 2009 Demon's Souls they ended up with. This is bullshit.
Yeah, but I honestly wouldn't have stolen it. I thought I was getting the shiny PS5 one. I have no interest in that original one at all, so yeah, that was annoying.
I'd say the only slight downside, and maybe this is to inside baseball, was that because there was that extra level of the kill in the steel to think about, as well as the usual game picking shenanigans, I was maybe in my head a little bit and wasn't as robust a shit lord as I could have been, or other people could have been, because I think we were all just trying to make sense of it all.
Yeah, that's probably true. It's just funny because when I listen back to it, think about you, I don't think you have much ego really, and yet that podcast, because you got attacked early on, the orbit of the entire episode just starts to move around you. Like you just become the main character in this very specific way, like with all your different monologues as you're picking, and like that is just, it just becomes this kind of like, yeah, it becomes you and then everyone else in this way that very rarely happens on these podcasts.
Oh, it's odd. Yeah, I just thought it was really, it was entertaining. The other thing we thought was we just got to do fewer picks with four people, because we thought that the second hour lacked a bit of momentum, and so we think if we do six to eight picks each instead, it will A, make it not take four hours to record, which would be good, and B, it would just keep the momentum to the end.
If you got six to eight picks, but you have kill and steal as well, that's podcasted, baby.
Yeah, I think so. I think so. You can do more damage.
Like, you know, one of eight games, it feels more precious than one of ten.
Absolutely, yeah.
That's math.
That's math, baby. OK, well, with that in mind, then, we come to this week's episode, which is what we've been playing. Actually, been quite a long time since we did one of these.
So, nice to come back to it. Just to catch up on what's been going on. I think we both played loads of stuff, actually, Matthew.
Like, we've got, you know, I didn't even fit in or hear all the things that I've been playing, and I don't think you have either. So, we've got, like, a bit of Mafia The Old Country to talk through first, which is the latest game from Hangar 13, worked on Mafia 3, and then made Mafia, the Mafia remaster that came out in 2020 that I enjoyed a great deal. And then there's remas that there was some kind of, like, bizarre rhythm act, like The Saboteur, but with rhythm action game that got canned in between somehow.
And now, several years hence, five years since the last Mafia, since Mafia Remastered. There's this game which is set earlier in the timeline than any other Mafia games. It is part of the same continuity.
It's got a few references to different bits and pieces, like Empire Bay and certain characters from previous games. But it is set in Sicily, notably, not in the US. So it's the first time they've done that.
And you play a guy called Enzo, who escapes from working in this mine for a gangster, kind of gets into a ruckus, and then sort of falls in with a rival group of gangsters, mafioso, and goes from being a guy basically shoveling shit in the sort of like dirtlands around this big mansion to joining the mob, rising up in the mob, falling in love with the capo's daughter. Lots of like, mafia. Well, is that the right term?
Or is it Don, isn't it? It's not the capo, it's Don, fucking Don. Don Turizzi, as they say a million times in this, as long as I'm Figgy Butana, which they also say a lot in this game.
I thought every time they say that, I think of Figgy Pudding.
Yeah, I think specifically of a cat I follow on Instagram called Figgy Pudding, and I was like, oh, that's really distracting. It's a very cute little cat, by the way, lives in Bristol. Anyway, Figgy Butana, yeah, every time I heard that, it was like, oh, because it's in this game about 25 times.
It's almost like a running joke. So it's a game built on lots of old kind of like Mafia fiction tropes. So I'll get Matthew to talk about some of this in a minute, but it has this different setting.
It's sold for about 40 quid, which obviously I'd prove of. It's very shiny looking. However, I think me and Matthew are actually sort of aligned on how we feel about this, Matthew.
So what do you pick it up from there?
Yeah, a lot of talk around this was where it fits on the sort of sliding scale of open world games. And a lot of the talk in the run up to it was that, it wasn't so much a sort of free roaming GTA like as a more linear story that's set in an open world. So it has this big backdrop and obviously miles of road.
So if it wants to do car chases and long driving missions and races and whatnot in between, you know, it can do all that. And that's not like entirely sort of untrue to the Mafia 1 and Mafia 2, which again are not like quite GTA. I'd say those games maybe give you an opportunity to be free in their world a little bit more.
This game commits quite a bit to like you're locked into the mission path. It's actually very few moments you feel like I could just go off for a drive right here. Like there's always someone telling you something to do.
Like actually, I don't know if you found this, but quite early on in the game introduces you to some old geezer who runs like an equipment shop, which is basically upgrades for the character and you earn currency in the missions. But I found that I never actually had any freedom to go to his house and spend any of that money unless I left the game, went into free roam mode, which is like separate to your campaign, and spent the money in there and then what you buy in free roam mode transfers over to wherever you are in the story.
Well, I found two instances of like we had to drive to a certain place where I could go to that guy's house and buy things.
It's odd because there are certain things that go, you know, like, oh there's 50 of this to collect or you can go here and do that or there's icons on the map, but actually finding an opportunity to do those is quite rare. But that's okay because I think the story it locks you into, you know, has quite a lot of momentum. It does take you all over the map as well, sort of makes the most of it.
I guess, you know, I'll say upfront, I thought this was merely fine. I don't think it's quite charming enough to be, like, one of those seven out of tens for me. Probably, like, prettiness of the world aside, I didn't think it really did anything sort of well enough to, like, truly impress.
I thought the driving was, like, fine. I thought the shooting was about as bare-bones a cover shooter as you can possibly be. And the stealth, and there's a big stealth element to this, because, you know, you've got, like, you're armed with a knife, and a lot of your missions are about, like, infiltrating places to rob them or assassinating people.
The stealth is about as, about as basic as I think I've ever played. Like, the AI is just miserable in the sense of just completely easy to run circles around, and if you've got any experience playing stealth games, I think you can comfortably make it through every stealth section in this no-sweat-without-ever worrying about, you know, it goes ooooh, you're getting a treatment for making it through the section without having raised the alarm and you think, well that's because it wasn't really stealth by my standards, I would say. So like, mechanically I found it quite bland.
Story-wise like, I thought the actual content of the individual missions was, like, interesting enough and it kind of groups them into little arcs, like, this is the mission which is all about stealing a car and then doing it up and then having a race, and I quite like the little mini arcs, but I found the overall story just so cliched and just completely obvious where everything was going and everything played out exactly the way you think it would. The first time you meet these characters, you're like, I wouldn't be surprised if this happened with this guy. And any thought like that you have, they definitely do play out like that.
There's just no surprises in it. So while it is a game that I played all the way through, like I did it in pretty much two sittings, like it was a good bank holiday weekend play for me, for sure. I just came out the other end being like, well, the story kind of had no impact on me.
And what I actually played, I didn't think there was much to it. It was frictionless. And I'll kind of give it that.
But very pretty. Just, I don't know, just left me cold.
I'd largely agree. I think that the one thing I would say about this game is that it's doing a lot of the things that everyone talks about that they want from games, but don't get anymore. It is, I think the production values are amazing in it.
It's a beautiful looking game. Cutscenes look fantastic. It's got some great craggy old men, which I know you tend to enjoy in the video game, Matthew.
Best craggy old men outside of video games again.
Yeah, exactly. And it's, yeah, just incredibly shiny thing. And like you say, the presentation, like the cutscenes, voice acting, all really, just really strong.
The cutscenes, they're able to convey things in an expression because they're that good. And the scope of it is mission to mission. Like Matthew says, it's very nicely divided up by, basically takes you an hour per chapter.
And you could feasibly play one chapter an evening for a few weeks and have, you know, and that be something that slots into your life quite well. However, it never really leaves first gear this game. I think, I agree with you, it doesn't, at least, so I'm 11 chapters into it, which is nearish to the end.
I think there's 14 in total. And I certainly have not encountered any moments that subvert Mafia tropes or have something truly shocking in them. And I will say that Mafia as a series historically does have those things.
Like the first Mafia game very famously ends with your character elderly and witness protection being killed on his lawn. In the second game, you turn out to be the assassin of the main character in that game, drive to his house and kill him. And which is an unbelievably great moment.
And these were very, there's a very talked about moments in the game, but also it's the fact that it does some interesting things with, there's like a time skip in Mafia 2, like your character goes to prison. I believe it's the 40s and then it becomes the 50s, I think that's right. And, you know, there's like a famous bit at the very start where you're doing like manual labor, and then you eventually just put the box down and walk away.
Like the game is like, you know, this boring manual life is not for you, you have a different calling. All these things really stick in your head, I think. And, you know, Mafia 3, you know, you are, you know, it's like kind of post-Mafia in some ways.
It's like, you know, it's a black character, you know, forming like a new organized crime group and a setting that you don't commonly see in video games and, you know, a New Orleans style location. So they've all done something a bit different, which is, you know, I guess you could say that the choice of Sicily in the 1900s is that, but story-wise, it doesn't do anything like that. It's like you say, it's all very obvious beats.
And even though the execution of those beats is like, in terms of the storytelling is of a high quality, you're just dying for it to do something unexpected, and it doesn't do it. And I found that just means that the whole time I've been playing it, I've been like, ah, and I agree with you saying about the gameplay mechanics. I don't think any one of them is exceptional.
No, they're not like outright bad.
No they're not. It's like, this game is a seven out of ten, but not one of those sevens basically, I think is possibly a six, but it's more of a six for me. I just think it needs to get the blood pumping more than it does.
And it has an especially slow first few chapters, like the first like three or four chapters where you're just on horseback being ferried between locations and not really doing anything. It takes so long for the shooting and the knife based melee combat to become more of a thing. And I just, yeah, I find that odd in a game that's already quite short.
I mean, the fact that it has definitely more than five knife based boss fights where you sort of locked an arena. And it's really no more complicated than the sword fighting at the end of Uncharted 4, which was kind of rubbish in itself, a bit of a rubbish enter. Every time that happened, it would be like, oh, here we go.
And so contrived as well to get you an arena with one person. Like, there's so many characters you could just shoot them in the head who, you know, throw away their gun. And it's like, if you can see a knife on their belt, you're like, well, I'm definitely having a fucking knife fight, boss fight with this guy.
You know, just the evidence is all there. That I found just kind of like limp throughout. It's interesting with talking about the story and how slow the start is.
Because I actually quite like the the introduction of all the characters and the family. Like, you know, it takes up till about the halfway point that you actually get like inducted into the Mafia. And until then you're just kind of around the outsides.
And because of that, it feels like it's quite a careful portrait of this family, as tropey as they are. You know, you feel like you know, you know, seven or eight people. And that's that's more than you get in most, you know, video games, in terms of memorable faces.
And not to spoil what happens with the story, but I will say after that very slow build up, like literally the way it accelerates into what happens goes on in the last mission, is so out of keeping with the pacing of the rest of the game. It's like, it's just like the whole thing switches, not in a like, oh, there's some interesting kind of like perspective twist or anything like that. I don't think it has necessarily one of those moments you're hoping for.
Just in terms of like, characters who have been really slow burn suddenly become like total infernos for like 20 minutes. And I'm like, I wish there were another like three or four chapters to kind of get us to this place.
It's like a glacial, glacial ocean. Like so, so, so slow, I almost gave up on it. Like I got to the end of chapter, it's either chapter four or chapter three.
There's a prologue as well. And I was like, this is, I think I just don't like this enough to even see it through. But I kept going and it does get slightly better.
Like you told me when it does go up a notch slightly, when you actually join the Mafia, when that becomes the game. And it does, but yeah, only slightly. And yeah, it sounds like they wait for any, quite a long time for any further escalation.
Yeah.
Yeah. It just, it's only a slight bummer because I think that, like we say, there are so few people making games that resemble this. This kind of like, you know, Xbox 360-ish type experience.
I mean, you would plausibly see on that console that when someone is doing it with very high production values, I do, my instinct is to celebrate it. But yeah, even though I think I like the knife combat slightly more than you, it is contrived every single time it comes up. But it is at least a tiny bit different as a thing that the game does, because every other part of it, like the driving or the shooting or the stealth, is just something you've played before but not as good.
Yeah, I think that because it does have quite big over-the-top gunfights where you kill like 50 people in a go, for it then to suddenly be like, no guns, this bit's just knives. It just smacks of someone who like researched the era, learned that everyone had knives and went, oh, let's make that a thing. And it just doesn't naturally fit, you know, like make it only knives or...
Yeah, I just found it a little jarring, particularly as it went on and the action became slightly bigger in scale when it suddenly then switches back to like knife made again. I was like, yeah, I'm not entirely sure about this.
Well, I will say that when the game has to do some driving sections or a race section, they're not very good either, unfortunately. They're like, have I done the one thing the game wants me to do to finish this first? Yeah, it's sort of like, it's like a fake tension.
Doesn't really feel like you can fail things in a meaningful way. I don't hold it against the game massively, but I guess in putting those sections in there, they're trying to reference the fact that the original Mafia had a famous, infamous driving section in it. But it just doesn't, again, it's sort of like, it just falls a bit flat.
Everything I'm looking at is incredibly beautiful and well put together, but it's just, I don't know. The thing I thought was, could they have not done, could they have not smashed through his Mafia origin story a little bit faster? It's almost like this game has hung up on the idea that in every Mafia game, they need to give you that rise through the ranks classic Mafia experience.
Whereas the baggage I bring to it from watching a lot of fiction that features the Mafia or the games in the series, which I've all played, is I kind of want to speed through that bit and have some other tension going on.
You want some good fellas editing. You want like half a man's life in half an hour.
I just want his relationship to go a bit Debbie Mazar in that film. It all goes a bit to pot. Yeah, so I've really wanted to like it more than I did.
But I've had to force myself to get through it, unfortunately, which is not how you want to feel about a game.
I think a year down the line or whatever, if you can pick this up for like 15 quid or 20 quid, or it's on Game Pass or PS Plus. It's like the ultimate, if it is on Game Pass or PS Plus, like definitely play it. It would be the crown jewel of one of those sort of, like, free, in quotes, free seven out of tens.
Yeah, it'd be like, it's a great humble month because it's the main game. Is that damning it with fake praise?
It's like, oh, this is a great humble game.
What a ball a month, is this a Warhammer game? That's good. Yeah, it's, yeah, yeah, damn it.
It's just, it could have been so much more. And the thing is, it has done well. Like, I think I saw a story saying it sold, like, close to a million copies in its first few days or something like that.
And that is good because I want them to have another go at it. I really think they're like, they're just, surely they know enough now about the story telling of these games and enough about how to do sort of like combat and driving that they can really push things to the next one, but do a largely similar thing of the same price range, same scope, same length. Because we do want more games like that, but this just isn't quite the one dog, unfortunately.
Yeah. Okay. Well, there you go.
Interesting.
And although you can refuse.
I saw so many fucking strap lines like that.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
We're still doing this. We're still doing this.
Put a bullet in all of them.
Okay. What should we discuss next, Matthew? Choose your own adventure.
Choose your own podcast. Should we do Kirby DLC or Shinobi? What do you reckon?
Tell me about Shinobi, because this has been an interesting arc to view from afar, because I think I saw some review code from this from Sega. Thank you to Sega for sending us some code, because I was intrigued in playing it, to play it. I think you sort of stumbled into it and found yourself not way more into it.
You've played more of it than I have, I think.
Yeah, while you were playing Mafia and having not a very good time, I was playing this on that bank holiday at the end of August and having a great time. So yeah, you sent me a key and I didn't even touch the key for like a week or something. Then I was like, well, I'll go through my WhatsApp messages, make sure I redeem this and give this a go, because it's very, very nice to be sent reviews by publishers.
So when they do, I'm like, well, I'm going to take this seriously. So I sat down and played it, and I just couldn't believe how good the Combat was. So it is a return to a Mega Drive series I don't know loads about.
I've played on numerous Mega Drive collection type things, and I know it's a side-scrolling game where there is a Shinobi lad, and like a platforming in Combat. But I think I just because there are so many retro revival type things that have happened in the last five or so years, I was ready to not really care about this one. And this was Hot on the Heels of the Ninja Gaiden Ragebound game that came out a few months ago.
So I was a bit like, well, I'll give it a try. But no, it's like Red Hot as a Combat game. It's incredibly responsive.
It's like just really, really smart at layering in different systems and has this really satisfying mechanic where it's like a marked-for-death mechanic where you can basically get a bunch of enemies to the point where they're in a place where they can be finished. Tap like the R1 and L1 together, and then your character will just sip across the screen and kill three of them instantly. And you start to figure out different ways to do that.
So you're sort of like, OK, I'll hit a guy a few times, and I'll hit him once with one of my throwing knives. And then the mark comes up, and then you get better at dispatching, kind of mass-dispatching groups of enemies. And then it just kind of, yeah, just layers it more and more as it goes.
More ways to get around the environment, more ways to fight different enemies. And those include these basically sets of powers you can unlock. So, you know, like a thing will charge up, and then you can do like a quick fire attack, or you can chuck a spinning blade at a bunch of enemies.
And then things come into play, like some enemies have shields, and shields can only be broken by doing a certain kind of attack or a certain kind of ability. And so you start to optimize around that. But at the core of it, it's just this very, very sharp, exciting, zippy, side-scrolling combat system, which is like playing something like Bayonetta in, you know, in like 2D form.
And while I thought that... I guess I went into this thinking, oh, the ceiling for how exciting this can be is quite low to me. And then having my expectations completely just sort of blown up.
And so really, really good. The only thing I would say about it, I thought this was a nine pretty much the entire time I played it. And then I got towards the end and it just becomes...
It overplays its hand with platforming. Right. It brings in...
Yeah, fucking since Zelda, everyone's got like a little glider thing in it. This game also has one. It's got a few different platforming mechanics, but brings in a glider and like a wind mechanic, where you're like navigating through very perilous, spiky caves using your little glider thing, and having to like deactivate it and reactivate it.
Where I would say it's a bit too... It's way too fiddly in those bits. There's only a few instances like that where I was like, oh, but there are like a few of those platforming bits, right?
I think it took me like 20 attempts to get through one cave, like more than it took me to kill any boss in the game. I thought it's overplayed its hand as a platformer, despite being an excellent combat game. But I would say that still doesn't really take away from what is wonderful about this game.
It looks fantastic. The 2D art is great. It takes you to some really nice levels.
It's got a very Sega-ass, kind of like Neo, sort of like Cyberpunk City, that I think that Sega sickos will very much enjoy. It's got this beautiful looking fish market level, which again, sounds ridiculous, but it's just so colorful and vivid. They're just really gone to town with most of the levels having a huge identity to them.
Then this wonderful Metroidvania-ish structure where you can, if there's something you've missed, you can jump into any level at any time, do one little bit of the objective, jump out of the mission again, and then you've done that part of that mission, the percentage goes up. So you can completely optimize. You can just find the nearest checkpoint to the thing you need to do, go there, do it, bounce out again and progress with the game.
Just really smartly done stuff.
Great for the dads.
Very much so. And even as you go, it's layering in new sort of like combos you can unlock that just make the combat feel more complex and make your character feel deadlier. And I know it's ridiculous to praise something, Matthew, for something it doesn't have, right?
But I was just there thinking, I mean, I just love how generously structured this game is. If this was like a Souls-like game, if you lost your shit and had to go back in and get it, you lost your like currency, all your shit, you had to go back in and get it, it would be so much worse.
Yeah.
It just made me think about what a fucking prison that is for like game design, that there are so many games that do that. And this game is so, just take such a different tack, it's confident enough in like the difficulty of the bosses and the levels themselves being enough that it doesn't need to have arbitrary difficulty elements to it.
That's definitely from, you know, I've only played sort of five or six levels of this, but I like that the sort of central through line of the level feels, you know, reasonably doable. Maybe you'll die a couple of times on a fight here or there, but then it actually uses that light Metroidvania structure to put the really gnarly stuff like slightly off the beaten path. So there's like a very obvious way that, you know, a decent enough player can get through this whole game.
I would imagine, apart from this sounds nightmarish, this gliding at the end. Would you agree with that assessment? Because I definitely found some like, so elite, some elite squads hidden away that suddenly it felt like, oh, I really have to understand the combat to do this.
Yeah, definitely. You get to the point where I think you feel more confident taking them on during a mission in the second half of the game. But certainly the first time you encounter one of those, they're shockingly difficult.
And yeah, definitely a bit of a wake up call. But also made me realize just how high the skill ceiling goes in this game. And I think even though occasionally, very occasionally gets overcrowded or too busy, the combat is very sharp throughout.
And though some of those elite squads are really well thought out in terms of the different mechanics they lean on or the different things you have to think about. Like, oh, there's tons of enemies with these projectile attacks at once. There's all these enemies stacked up.
So I have to get rid of all of them as quickly and efficiently as possible. Just really like, yeah, just there's so much going on for the side-scrolling game that it is. It's got like a crouch mechanic in it that is absolutely essential to keeping you alive against certain types of enemies.
And yeah, it's just really well judged, really good.
It was definitely great to see, you know, that first message come in of like, oh, this might be all right, you know? You know, and then it becomes like, oh yeah, I've just played it for like six straight hours or whatever. And then it was like, oh yeah, this is obviously got its claws into you because it's quite rare that you just sort of like mainline something for 10 hours these days.
It's very, very rare. I know you're much better at getting through games than I am, as documented on this podcast many times. But yeah, it really just clicked.
And according to the timer, I played something like 16 hours in a weekend. Wow. So maybe it was more than that.
But yeah, it's really clicked with me. The only kind of caveat I have is that it's apparently on Switch, it does not look very sharp. It's very grainy.
I played on PS5. I think it looks absolutely phenomenal on PS5. I don't think there's a native Switch 2 version yet, but I hope there is at some point because it deserves to look as sharp as possible.
But yeah, man, this is so good. You play five or six levels. I wonder if you...
I wonder just how... You probably got like... You probably went through the same bits that I did in terms of like that same journey of, oh, you know, I think this game...
You played the same bits that made me feel that way about it. Where did you sort of land on it after the bits that you did play?
Yeah, I'll absolutely play more of it. I want to play more of it. I think I played a couple of levels and then took a beat, and I played a bit of Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, and I don't think I could hold those two quite different ninja games in my head.
So when I came back to this, it was like starting it from the beginning again. Like a little bit of me almost thinks, do I need to just go back to level one with Shinobi to get my head around it? Because it has that platinum thing, it's quite a dense combat system.
You know, there's a lot going on on different buttons. I don't mean that in a bad way, but you need to develop the muscle memory through playing it to actually kind of get your head around it. And yeah, I was struggling a little bit and then it was like, oh, well, I've forgotten that this move and that move exists, you know, even in this limited time, I've been away from it.
So that's more of a me and like hack and slash combat games. Like I just I need to kind of commit or I'm doomed. But I definitely agree with everything you say.
I thought it looked amazing. I loved the pacing of the levels, like a little bit of platforming, a little bit of combat. Here's like a section where you're stuck on a moving platform, fighting off things.
You know, here's a bit platforming, but it's, you know, hanging off, you know, floating balloons in this floating parade. And now there's a deranged parade carnival float chasing after you and you're running away from it. You know, it does that, you know, again, platinum thing of, you know, every five minutes, it kind of trades up the action a little bit.
And I've never really seen platinum do that themselves in a 2D game. You know, they've done 2D sections in their games. And yeah, it's just like, well, it really makes sense to lift that template and hard agree that it would be massively diminished if it was about extreme difficulty and currency lost, ala souls.
You know, probably the thing that reminds me most of it in a platinum game is like when you lose a fight, you don't feel annoyed by it because you think, well, I just get to try this flexible combat system and see if I can do it a different way and see if that way works this time. Like maybe I didn't lock in to the right way to solve that particular combination of enemies. And then you chuck yourself in.
If when you die, you're looking forward to your next attempt, I mean, it doesn't get better than that as an action system.
Yeah, that's very well put, I think. The platinum thing, I didn't want to sort of overdo it by making that comparison, but it is really sharp. It does everything a combat system needs to do.
And like you said, it's got so many different ideas that it uses. It's sort of, yeah, like the platform being part of it is definitely the weakest, but it's also the thing you're asked to do the least percentage-wise throughout the game. And combat does remain the focus.
It's funny when I saw a few of the, because I think some reviewers love this, and then a few were just like, nah, not really. And I think it's, the combat is of such a high standard. I think it, I would really struggle to get, I don't think I could justify giving this below an eight for how good the combat is.
But I do wonder if just going up those drafty, spiky corridors in the glider, just, there's just, I just frustrated reviewers out of, they really challenge your love of it, I would say, which is a bummer.
Well, I'm sorry that the ultimate enemies of the game made their base, you know, formidable.
Yeah. So, yeah, I really love this way more than I thought it would. And, you know, I think this is really the first of the Sega's, like, attempts to bring back a little of this old series.
And it feels like it's gone under the radar, which is a bummer, because I don't think... This should appeal to way more people than just the people who remember Shinobi, those games, you know, the big Sega heads. Like, why don't people give a shit about this, but their entire personalities are built around Silksong?
Like, what's that all about? It's sort of like, doesn't this do a lot of the things that a game like that does? I mean, honestly, this is just a really satisfying game to fire through, so definitely a candidate for my top 10 of the year, Matthew.
That's all with Silksong Chat this episode.
Okay, Matthew, so let's move on to the DLC missions from the latest Kirby game, shall we?
Yes, this is Kirby and the Star-Crossed World, which is the Switch 2 expansion pack. I don't know what the formal term is that they're using. It's the thing which upgrades it from a Switch 1 game to a Switch 2 game and adds a chunk of new stages or remixed stages.
If you were following the Switch 1, there were lots of games which were ported from Wii U, and when they got ported from Wii U to Switch 1, they tended to add something along with the general kind of tech polish, whether it's some extra multiplayer maps or an extra multiplayer mode in like Mario Kart or Bowser's Fury in Super Mario 3D World. I think this Switch 2 addition thing they've got going on is basically like an extension of that. This Kirby feels to me like one of those Wii U ports where they've taken the core game, they've made it slightly sharper looking, they've bumped the framerate to 60, it was 30 on the Switch 1, not that that was a huge problem.
So it looks better than it ever has and then it has these new worlds to explore. It has 12 worlds, so two levels per the six worlds in the base game, which took me about, I don't know, four hours to get through, all told, which I think is pretty decent. It felt like another third of the original game, I guess, in terms of sort of size, which isn't too bad, because I saw some people ding the Mario Party Jamboree expansion for being a little thin, but this I got a decent...
I certainly might have been paying for it the first place, Matthew.
This is the only podcast in the world that can see the truth of Mario Party Jamboree.
It's rubbish, who cares?
It was rubbish, yeah, I know. But yeah, this isn't rubbish. I should say, you can go back and listen to our...
We did a few Kirby Conversations, we did a big Kirby episode that I was really pleased with when we did it, so that's got some bigger Kirby thoughts. But I really liked Forgotten Land, I thought it translated all the good work they'd been doing in the 2D Kirby's on 3DS and Wii into the 3D space. Very much like a sort of my first action platform, it's quite gentle going as Kirby games are, but I thought it felt quite kind of premium, like all the transformations were very well realised, their movesets were interesting, just the sound effects and like hit stop on hitting enemies and all that kind of stuff.
Like it felt like if you want your kid to one day really like Platinum games and Devil May Cry and things like that, weirdly Kirby's what I'd get them on, because I think it'll give them an appetite for like experimenting with weird weapon sets and also the thrill of like thrashing a boss and going into arena and decking everything and then doing a little bit of puzzle platforming. It's an idea we explore in a bit more detail in that Kirby episode, but that's the kind of base thought on Forgotten Land for me. And I guess where this DLC expansion comes in, it feels like it's designed to be played after the main game, I'd say, like difficulty wise.
It's not like super difficult still, but it definitely kind of picks up where the last few levels left off. It takes all the ideas of the game and kind of mashes them together. So the big gimmick in this particular game is that as well as the copy abilities Kirby normally has, where he takes an enemy's skills, he can stretch himself around domestic sort of objects and take on a new form.
So he can become like a Kirby car or a Kirby vending machine. And I'd say the DLC does quite a nice job of bringing together a lot of those things, exploring a lot of those transformations as well as having three new transformations. So he can turn into like a big gear cog that climbs up walls.
What else is new in this? Is the traffic cone new? No, that's not new.
That was in the last one. That was in the original game.
Yeah. Why were the other new ones in this? It's not the fan.
That's old. It's definitely the gear. There's a bit where he turns into a sign and slides down a slope.
But is that old?
I don't remember.
Well, what I will say, shockingly, because I can't remember what the two other new transformations are, is that they're mixed in so much with the old transformations that it doesn't just feel like, oh, we're showcasing three new things here. It feels like we've just taken all the stuff that we mastered making the core game and have a bit of fun with them here. So everything's used quite well.
There's quite a good level where you take over a set of stairs which aren't used in a particularly interesting way in the base game but the whole level becomes can you get this set of stairs through this obstacle course which I quite liked in this one. So it does for me what good expansions and DLC does in that it takes everything you've learned and just lets you play around with it a bit more, show it off a bit more. Twelve confident new levels of a very pleasant Kirby game is the take, I guess.
Yeah, I mean, it's funny because you were cooler on this game than me. You didn't put it in your top ten for 2022 and I did.
Oh, well, I mean, that's maybe I'm just an idiot.
Yeah, but I always found that surprising because I thought, despite being very gentle, like you say, I thought, like you say, it's a very premium thing and it was, I was very impressed by it. It was sort of like, yeah, I really love the world and the world and art design of this game where it's like post-apocalyptic fiction, but with loads of colourful Kirby stuff layered on top. So it's sort of like plausibly could be like near-autometer, but like Kirby's here.
And I just really like that, but that contrast is still really striking when you play it now. Hard to be mad at. I played half these levels, Matthew, and it took me about an hour and a half, but it was a very pleasant hour and a half.
There is this mechanic that sort of, the kind of star element of it, where you interact with a bit of the environment, and then a new chunk of level will emerge on this kind of starry path. And that can mean there are different things to find if you activate those and don't miss those as you're exploring and leading you to secret areas and things like that. And it's quite visually spectacular, because the contrast of a lot of the kind of concrete or everyday things with this more Mario Galaxy sci-fi starry stuff.
The music is very personary as well for new music. It's got this quite warbling, choral, female voice. Sort of singing, I guess, like nonsense Kirby language over the top of tunes.
Yeah, it's good music actually.
Yeah, I looked it up. The other mouthful transformations are you turn into a spring, which I like, because it's got some good, very sort of vertiginous platforming. And the-
He's got a funny mouth with the spring as well. It's good.
And the cafe sort of sandwich board sign, which turns you into like a sled. So it has lots of sections where you slide down slopes. That's new.
I thought that was in the main game, but I think I'm confusing that with bits where you like, rolled down slopes as a pipe, which I think is what I'm thinking of.
Oh yeah, I remember that. Yeah, yeah.
I think maybe this either reminded me or just gave me a bit of a jolt of like, oh, this is just a really good game, really well made. I hadn't played it in a while. So going back to it and rediscovering all the copy abilities, which one of the quite cool things in Forgotten Land is that you level up the copy abilities so that whenever you get them, you know, they're always, they're kind of maxed out version and they become more and more extreme.
So there's like a little whirlwindy one, which lets you kind of float over gaps. But if you level it up a couple of times, like you're a full blown tornado and you just like, suck in everything in the arena and going back into the DLC with all my maxed out copy abilities was just fun of like, I'd forgotten all the hectic shit they let you do in this game and how overblown everything is. I would imagine those levels would actually be quite a bit harder if you play them as they appear.
Like if you played it through adjacent to the single player, you know, without coming to it later, I think the levels would have a bit more bite to them. Like some of the boss fights throw a bit more at you and the challenge is a little stiffer. It's just that I happen to have like ten sort of weapons of mass destruction that I've sort of developed over the course of the campaign.
There's a few things it does well, like in the missions that they choose to remix, they're all very good choices. And there are some really nice optional challenges for each one that force you to get the most out of the level or the different combinations of abilities or like just show smart game design at work. So even though the difficulty is very gentle, it's like it feels like game designers coming back to something they built and being like, I understand completely how this works.
Watch me build a beautiful sort of like pocket watch in real time with all this knowledge that I have. It's like that in game design form, you know? So yeah, I like it.
It's one of those things where I think it's very hard to be offended by. I got it in shop too for like 13 quid or something. And I have no real sort of qualms about playing more of this game.
It's nice to be reminded of how good it was, how pretty it was even for the Switch at the time, and how it's actually like... It's sort of... It's in that...
It's actually pretty close to being in the highest tier of Switch games. It's not quite there, but it's close. But for you, Matthew, in 2022, it was no Drainus or Marvel Snap, which both made you a top 10.
Oh my God, I'm the fucking worst in those Game of the Year episodes. Fucking Drainus. This is because I want to impress Ash Day.
You want to impress Will Freeman. Oh, that's funny. Or Martin, Martin Robinson, that's funny.
Yeah, I sort of... The rest of the top 10 is fine, but Marvel Snap is like, what was he smoking then? But Marvel Snap in there.
I did like Marvel Snap. I did play a lot of it. Yeah.
I haven't touched it since.
Yeah.
I have enjoyed this. Yeah. I'm just a dummy.
By actually playing this, I thought... I think Astro Bot is a lot closer to this, not ignoring quality wise in terms of like the kind of game it is, like the feel of it and Astro Bot's sort of transformations and everything. I think there's a closer parallel between Kirby and that than there is maybe Astro Bot and Mario.
I haven't really developed that take into anything interesting as an observation.
Yeah. I think I can sort of see that. The thing with Astro Bot's transformations, they're never...
there's not really a problem-solving aspect to them most of the time. It's like, this is the level where you stop time or this is the level where you become tiny. And so it's sort of like the level is completely tailored around that one thing.
Whereas Kirby is a little bit more like the things you need to finish the level are in it and you have all these transformations as well to deal with the combat as you see fit. So I definitely see some parallels. I mean, maybe that's where Astro Bot does go next, where the levels are more open and they're more about how you solve them.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I don't know.
I had a lot of affection for this game going back to it. I was like, well, it's just a great little time this was back in just after COVID days. I mean, I couldn't believe it was more than three years ago, to be honest.
That blew my mind a bit. But yeah, a lot of affection for this. It's sort of like, it just never quite gets the pulse racing in the way that a Mario game at its peak will for sure.
Or like have, but it's kind of like the ideation at work is in the same ballpark. It's just not quite, it's just not quite as complex. So yeah.
Okay, Matthew. Well, good. I'm glad we both both lightly enjoyed that.
The other thing is, well, I felt better having paid for this in 2022 and then buying this cheap upgrade pack. I would feel more conflicted if I had to buy like a 60 quid version of this game that had both in it, I would say. That's one thing.
I feel like I'm reheating an old dinner that I enjoyed here. Whereas it might feel differently about it if I was buying it off the bat.
I'm curious if you can find the Switch One base game. Because the cheaper you can get that, the better a deal the whole thing becomes. So like whether you buy like a pre-owned copy somewhere, if anyone hasn't put that, I don't know if it's too precious to give to CX, I don't know.
Well, most people have it for about, you can get someone selling on eBay for like 30 quid. Loads of people are selling on eBay for about 30 quid. And so, you know, you probably are better off doing that than getting the, Smiles has this for 63 pounds.
I think that's too much personally. But, you know, I do think, but I don't mind having paid 40 at the time or maybe slightly, a tiny bit less and then 13 now. That's okay, I think over three years.
I think Nintendo are gonna, are depending on a lot of people feeling that way about a lot of games over the next couple of years, that you'll be like, well, I paid that money, but it was a long time ago. So.
The thing is that there's only really a handful of games where I would bother doing this though, like a really truly great Switch games to justify it. This just happens to be a game I had a lot of affection for. So I don't know.
Jamboree, I was like, absolutely not, obviously.
Would you do it for Pitman 4?
No, I think I got enough out of that. I've spent enough time with Ochi and Evil Ochi and the gang.
What if they're like, there's another Ochi?
Neutral Ochi. Or they add like nine more unbearable NPC astronaut lads to talk to in that little area. No one wants that, do they?
What if it's like, by the way, guys, Fire Emblem, three houses, we found a fourth house.
Yeah, and the characters have never been boobier. It's the most fan service-y, people would pay that for sure. We'll see how that pans out.
But I certainly didn't mind it too much here. If it was like 20 quid plus, no way. But 13 quid, yeah, that's all right.
That's, they could have that money. Okay, my final game, Matthew, is Metal Gear Solid Delta, Metal Gear Solid, wait, Delta, Snake Eater. That's right.
That's right.
The remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, that, yes, came out recently from Konami, and I cannot remember the name, this is Devirtuous. It's a complete visual overhaul of Metal Gear Solid 3 with a slight gameplay overhaul that reuses the audio from the original game. But, yes, like I say, it's a complete facelift visually from the original.
I've only played about an hour of this.
So that's all cutscene, I'm guessing.
I mean, a lot of it was. A lot of being reminded, oh yeah, there's a lot of LBJ in this game. There's a lot of Khrushchev in this game.
There's a lot of LBJ. There's a sticker on the back, a warning sticker.
That's the funniest thing, actually, is it really reminds you of how specifically Kishima on PS2 or Kishima more generally the pacing is, because you get very little done in that first hour. But I played a little bit of it, and I would admit to being like, wow, that looks incredible on my monitor. Just visually stunning.
And then you get to the gameplay. I have a 47 TTI Super. It was not a cheap graphics card.
And I would say the visuals noticeably drop down. There's a slightly smudgy, artifact-y quality to bits of it. But in general, every individual asset in the game looks extraordinary.
It looks almost next-gen. And when you're so used to seeing what the PS2 original looks like, and the different HD'd up versions of that PS2 original, it's a proper like, wow, that is stunning. You have spent some money on this.
But I would not want to play this on console versus what I've played on PC. Because if on PC it's already struggling, on console it's definitely going to struggle. So that was how I sort of felt about the decision-setting.
That makes me feel good about ordering it on PS5 physical copy.
Well, it's a weird thing as well where I think the game was holding on to being about 60 quid. Then I think this week I've finally seen it for around 50 on PS5. So that was like another thing that's been going on.
It's a very, it's very expensive. It's like, I think it's 60 quid outright on PC. I got it for, again, about 40.
It sounds like I'm being sponsored by Shopped too. They just had it the cheapest, but.
It's 70 quid on the PS5 itself. Like the only digital version is 70. That's a lot.
That's that. They didn't charge that for Silent Hill 2. And I would say that's probably a bigger upgrade, right?
I agree. I think fundamentally, this is too expensive for a game you've played before with a facelift. And if it was a complete overhaul and it was, you know, there was that price progression from Silent Hill 2 Remake, I'd be like, well, at least they remade the game.
I agree.
Also, like, you think there'd be a little bit of a goodwill mission with this one, because there's so much weird bad blood about Konami and Metal Gear and, you know, whether they're allowed to make more Metal Gears, of course they're allowed to, but blah blah blah, you know what I'm talking about. And as a result, you'd think, why not make this extra attractive and, like, you know, attainable by everyone so we can all try and see how good a game it is, because by all accounts, it plays very nicely. I don't know if you've dug too much into the new controls and everything.
Yeah, it just, it plays like, you know, a mix between subsistence and a third person shooter from the modern day, basically. So, you know, it's everything you would expect that entails. It makes the game a touch easier because, you know, well, actually you can sort of change whether you like have the classic MGS experience or something resembling, you know, modern sort of like aim, move, shoot kind of controls.
So, it sort of puts that power in your hands. But yes, it does everything you want from a, you know, from a modern version of this game in terms of, you know, like sort of keeping the original essence of it, but also refreshing it. It's, yeah, I think I agree with you.
I think 50 quid would have been spot on for it. I don't think people would have, I don't feel like many people are playing this. I don't think it's, I think it's kind of like disappeared a bit.
Sun Hill 2 Remake felt like a big moment to me. Like they properly capture people's attention. They properly convince people that they've made something great.
And it was a, yeah, it was a real moment. But this, I think it just prices too many people out of it, being a 70 quid. And, you know, I've bought this game four times in the past, like maybe five times, it's, you know, I don't get a discount for that, but everyone's pretty familiar with what this looks like.
You can go play the original version on any platform, you know. Go on, sorry.
Did you see the thing about the models' posters in this?
Was it like they went and found the original source file or something and added it?
No, so apparently, I don't know if this is just, I haven't verified this, so this is just going off tweets, so God knows if it's true or not. But apparently they, like, approached the models who are in the pictures in the original game for, like, updated images or new images and, as a result, some of the exotic, you know, poses in bikinis or whatever have been replaced of, like, pictures of them with their kids.
That's really funny.
Because the models have been like, well, this is what, this is what my life is now.
Yeah.
And if that's true, that's almost like a Kojima level bit of genius, you know?
Yeah, that's good. I love the idea of reversing into a Kojima style touch. I mean, I'll let you know if I find that.
I'll let you know what games magazines have made it in, in lieu of PSM and Play no longer being in there. I wonder what's, if anything's made the cut now. Like, I don't think I'll like go...
You've just dropped a podcast for someone to listen to instead.
Yeah. Yeah. So it's, I think there's another factor to this, though, which is, I wonder if they have one eye on like, we can sell this forever and it will always be like an amazing catalog thing for us, because I honestly think it's so pretty that it's borderline next gen in terms of...
Because the character models look so good. They're so phenomenal. If there are bits in the cut scenes, if someone was like, this is a PS6 tech demo, I'd be like, I kind of get that.
That looks like a very, very... Well, it does. It's just, it's so beautiful.
And when like the wildlife and stuff are moving around you, this is so crisp that it's a bit like, it's a slight shock to the system to see them looking so vivid when you are used to that very specific PS2 color palette, sort of like, you know, soft look of them. And everything just suddenly seems a lot more vivid. And yeah, I wonder if playing this on a PS6 in a few years or, you know, any kind of mid-range PC in about 10 years, you'll be like, wow, what a beautiful thing that was.
They took the best metal gear, they upgraded it for the modern age. And even though maybe on a base PS5, it was not at its absolute greatest. Like it's really stood the test of time.
I could see that being the, you know, the long tail take on this. But it definitely, it definitely, it's definitely handsome on my PC, but it's, you can see there being compromises and you can't work out how much of it is like performance issues that they've not addressed. Or if it's just that it's simply too good looking to run on today's hardware.
Yeah, a weird, a weird old thing, you know.
Where do you stand on that level of prettiness? Because I've seen there's been like a bit of discourse, surprise, surprise, about, you know, just throwing like raw graphics at this thing, like diminishes artistic intent, like actually the limitations of the PS2 and the specific look at the PS2 is kind of integral to what the game was trying to achieve. Now this might just be, you know, sort of holy Kojima, you know, only he may touch this sacred text, or there might be something in it.
I'm just kind of curious if when you look at it, you think like, oh, that's too far removed, or that misunderstands Metal Gear Solid 3 in some way.
Well, I think it's, I'm, you know, one of the biggest Metal Gear Solid 3 fans there is, and I don't feel that way for the simple reason that it's so widely available, the original. It's not like Konami's keeping it from you. It's not like they put this out and delisted MGS3.
Like they didn't, you know, that sort of thing can happen, but they've preserved the original and made this. And I think that it's quite exciting to see, you know, a team that's very talented in its own right take a run at reinterpreting it. And so, and there are so many instances where it just takes your breath away.
Like the, it does look very nice in game, but the cutscenes are staggeringly beautiful. It's sort of like, you never ever really thought you would see the Major Zero looking that sort of vivid. It's sort of, it's really strange because it's got such a PS2 ass head, the original Major Zero.
It's sort of like, there's a thing where, I think it's because he's one of the lesser, you know, lesser scene supporting characters. So he doesn't need to move as, you know, sort of like in that very, in so realistically as the boss or Snake do. And so he just looks a bit more basic by comparison.
And then they're just like, everyone looks incredible. It's just so, so amazing. So-
Is there any particular character or moment, now that you know the standard that they've hit, that you're excited to sort of see just how good they look? It's got to be the bulging eyes of the end.
Yeah, that is exciting. They've made like, I would say they've maybe made the boss a bit more, well, how best to put this, like stereotypically beautiful. Or sort of like, there was just something very well judged about the original character design for the boss, but where, for whatever reason, she just looks a bit more conventionally attractive in this.
And I'm sort of like, ah, I wonder if that's like quite right. But it's interesting that that was a choice they made. And so, yeah.
Yeah, really interesting. I would say the end is definitely like, you know, Major Zero has already, like, got some good old man crag going on. But I want to see how deep the crags go on the end.
That could be an all-time, like, crusty face with, like... That's going to really put the 47ETI to the test, I think. So, yeah, I'm excited to see that.
It's honestly, I think it's genuinely exciting. It's one of those things where you're like, I mean, wow, I get to see the whole game and it looks like this. I mean, I think there's a fundamental appeal to that.
Like, I think it's a bit too... But I felt this way when the Bluepoint Shadow of the Colossus came along and that was controversial. I'm like, yeah, but you can have both.
They can both coexist, it's fine. Is that how you feel about this sort of thing as well?
That's the correct answer, Sam. That's what I was looking for.
Well, those are all my games, Matthew. So you've got a couple more to talk about.
Yeah, so I played Hollow Knight all the way through.
Wow, the whole thing? Isn't it quite a long game?
I've been umming and ahhing about how truthful to be about my Hollow Knight experience. I reached the end credits of the bad ending. I would say I completed it on what I'm calling Catherine Mode.
Which is where whenever I hit a boss that I did five or six times or enough times that I thought I'm never going to get past this and I'm so cross that I'm just going to give up. Which instantly has happened to me with Hollow Knight before. The reason I've never finished it is because I always get to quite early bosses and then go fuck that and then walk away from it.
This time I said I'll ask Catherine if she can do them because she has finished it. So I got her to do some of the, I say some of the, she did like five bosses for me. I did, I don't know, 20 bosses probably?
Like there's some optional bosses where I'm like fuck that. When I say I completed it, I didn't actually beat the Hollow Knight at the end. Catherine did.
So I don't know. I watched it though. And it, I mean, listen, it worked for me.
You're the Elon Musk of Hollow Knight. Yeah.
The thing is, I know frustration like that is what kills games for me. And I just walk away from them. And I thought, well, actually, you know, I kind of want to see this game.
Like I felt like I'd never even played enough Hollow Knight to see what it was that everyone loved about it. Because I don't think it's particularly strong for the first few hours. You're limited to quite a few areas.
I'd say the first major block that I hit. And maybe some people will sort of scoff at this. The third boss I think you can fight is Hornet, the character you play as in Silksong.
And I could just never do it. It's a huge pain in the ass. But just past that, I feel like you suddenly start upgrading, like, the movement of your character.
And with that, the map properly opens up and you get actually get a taste of the Metroidvania magic that everyone really loves in that game, which is that it is quite freeform. You can kind of go in four major directions. There are like 10 or 12 regions you can feasibly reach with that power.
And you can spend a good 10 hours pushing out wherever you want and getting to know the map and learning all the little secrets and finding hidden upgrades and charms. And you get these charms which change your moveset. You begin to like build out little movesets that work for you.
And, you know, so I'd actually never really got into the meat of what makes that game special before. And that's really what I wanted to see is like, if I can actually get to that stuff, is this this 10 out of 10 game that I've just been, you know, too stubborn to kind of stick with? Not well, or not stubborn enough to to temperamental to stick with.
And I did have a pretty good time with it, you know, playing it in this very specific way of getting Catherine to come and apply the sort of life paddles whenever I felt like I'm about to walk, I'm about to walk. Quick, press the Catherine button. For people who are very familiar with the game, I pressed the Catherine button on Hornet, on the Mantis Lords, fuck them, three motherfuckers, two of them at once, nasty bastards.
Hornet, the second fight with Hornet, see the first fight with Hornet, absolute shit, Lord. The Watcher Knights and Hollow Knight at the end, which when I actually looked it up, I think those are the only mandatory bosses. So Catherine actually did all the stuff I had to do to finish the game.
And then I did everything around the edges. But I did like the Soul Master in his Frankenstein lab. That was quite hard.
I was quite pleased myself. I thought there's a guy who's like obsessed with Dung. He's like the Dung Lord or something.
He's like Mr. Dung Beetle or something like that. I was quite pleased that I did him. So, you know, I feel like I did enough that I felt kind of pleased with myself for getting through as much as I did this time.
I feel like I've finally given it a go and I can finally have an opinion on it, which is that it's a pretty amazing map when it does open up in that, I don't know, second act, I guess. I think it is a shame that it's like deepest challenges. Like what lies at the end of any exploration is like another fucking evil boss.
That it always comes down to really hard combat is a bit of a bummer for someone like me who is quite impatient with that kind of stuff. I'm much more interested in like difficult platforming challenges. I think it's why I fundamentally really love the two Ori games probably over Hollow Knight it's because they are you know I'd say more platformers at their core and when they get really hard it's it's through platforming where I just feel like the main event in Hollow Knight is the combat and I was never that interested in it or that interested in mastering it I am pleased they stuck through with it I you know I suddenly understand all this shit Twitter avatars and memes and things I've seen I'm like oh I get it this character was quite cool like I can see why people were fond of this thing or that thing so that's that's been quite nice it's left me with like no appetite to try Silksong because you burned yourself out both because I burned myself out on it also and maybe this is just me being churlish but the fact that you know the boss I got stuck on the most was the character you players in Silksong I fucking hate that thing like right I associate it with being an asshole it made me feel bad about myself I have no desire to spend more time with that thing also it makes this really irritating noise it sort of goes sure sure whenever it attacks and if it makes that noise in Silksong then that game is death that's an edge six right there you know it's yeah I just yeah I got no appetite but I thought you know what I should give Hollow Knight a proper go and I'm pleased that I quote unquote finished it days before the next one comes out that feels like The Back Page was as disinterested in this game up to the last possible moment you know yeah that's I think it's really good that we can set those expectations for our listeners that we could just ignore the biggest thing going on in video games because we're not interested that's that that's the beauty of having your own podcast and not having to run a website you don't have to pander to what people on Google want you can be like fuck this popular thing into the bin I don't want to do it but these new Kirby levels are lovely you know what I mean that's so much more my speed saying that I died a depressing number of times on the last boss in that Kirby DLC you've got me stopping and thinking about how many really difficult games have I known you to complete because it's odd to me almost is it dawningly that I'm shit games well now I just wait a second but I never really I'm piecing it all together, Kaiser Soze he only referenced Chrono Trigger which was on my mug and he doesn't like difficult games well I mean I know how you feel about from games but then we feel so similarly on from games that I'm a bit like ah yeah but then I suppose the Sekiro thing happened to me but didn't happen to you so but I don't consider myself to be greater games I'm I think I'm pretty good it's where I sort of land with it but what's like the most difficult combat game you finish do you think like what because you've done a lot you've done a lot of Platinum games which is why I think in my head I thought difficult games don't face him the thing about Platinum games is that they're not that hard to finish they're hard to finish well definitely right that's the difference that's what I really like about Platinum games is that the skill ceiling is is absolutely huge and it's like if you want to get a Platinum then yes it becomes a much harder game if you want to get the pure Platinum or whatever it is but I I'm not as you know if I occasionally get a gold trophy at the end of a level I'm like oh nice that was good and I'm pleased with myself but I mean I don't I mean have I finished anything truly difficult damn now you say it I'm here thinking oh how did I never notice this aside from like from games which I've walked away from all of them you know I finish all the games I talk about pretty much on their like normal difficulty that is you know so you beat that bird fucker in Metroid Prime you know that guy's yeah and some of the Metroid stuff's a little tricky yeah Metroid Dreads definitely got tricky I remember thinking Castlevania Lord of Shadow is a bit stiff back in the day but I got through all that in the end but I don't know if there's many like super super hard games Hotline Night probably is one of the like harder games I have got through with Catherine's help harder harder combat based Metroidvanias I guess it would be wouldn't it yeah I think that's yeah I think that's it but then I think I've done some like quite hard platforming like some of those nightmare you know Mario levels that unlock right at the end where you have to pull off like an impossible feat of platforming and you think oh yeah I can I'm alright at that stuff I get I've done the Blasphemous games they were pretty difficult oh yeah that's sort of like a good suggestion I don't want to make you audit your entire sort of like library of games that you've played but it's just interesting it doesn't take much it's always bosses like I'll chip away at difficult platforming or the or the action between them I just hate the spikes you know I hate it when I hate it when a boss is that much harder than anything else you do in the game so I think like there should be a better ramp into that you know I feel like if everything getting to the boss is trivial and then there's this motherfucker I'm like well why not make that journey a bit more interesting and then just lower this a little bit you know like let's bounce out a bit can I ask you a really basic question yes it's hollowed like good Matthew is it and is it as good as people say is no I think it's good it wasn't as good as as people have said it is for me like I like crucially the stuff I really like in Metroidvanias are like interesting moves and things that kind of twist up a bit nothing Hollow Knight's actually pretty conservative in terms of the actual abilities you get a bit like wall dump double dump dash and then like a super dash.
There's nothing you get you go think oh wow I suddenly this this map is going to transform in front of my eyes or this is going to completely re-contextualize something. If you are into like difficult combat and feel that sort of swell of pride when you overcome a huge obstacle, it's absolutely a brutal obstacle course, sort of quite impeccably made. Like the bosses, what they ask of you are all quite different.
Like I would say that all the ones I had to get Catherine to do were very fast moving things. That's where I come apart. I like panic under speed, but like endurance bosses or timing based attack bosses, all that stuff I'm fine with, I just I freak out when stuff happens.
I also think it's a little bit drab because it's all set in this quite sort of monochrome dark sort of nest. And you occasionally get to an area which is like a garden or like a mine full of pink crystals. And all of a sudden you're like, oh, some fucking color.
Brilliant. It's not a very jolly place to be in. You know, it's quite it's quite lonely.
Though that's true of lots of Metroid games too. So it'd be hypocritical of me to say that that was like a huge deal breaker. But I liked it.
I think if I was reviewing it, I'd give it an 8.
Yeah. Okay. Interesting.
But that's because, you know, I don't have that combat interest, crucially.
I feel like the relationship players have with this is not just down to mechanics, right? Isn't there a kind of lore element to this, like YouTube deep dive culture behind it? Isn't that kind of like the, yeah, the long tail is associated with that, right?
That, that, yeah, that just isn't a side of gaming culture I connect with. You know, maybe I'm just dumb or like slightly more superficial games. You know, I'm kind of quite happy with things being on the surface narratively.
You know, I don't want obscure shards of lore that I have to stitch together. Like I actually got to the end of Hollow Knight, Catherine actually got to the end of Hollow Knight, without really knowing what was going on, like what the stakes were, what I was trying to achieve. I don't really know why I did 70% of what I did in that game.
Even if there's this one character who pops up at the start and says, hey, you're this… it's you, the little knight. I don't even know what it's called.
Are you here to fight the infection? And I'd be like, oh great, I'm here to fight the infection. Thank you.
I don't want to have to watch a two hour video to find out that I'm here to fight the infection. Or like, I spent the whole game thinking the Hollow Knight was good. And it was the last boss, so I was like, what?
I didn't even understand that.
Oh, interesting.
Why are there statues of this guy? Why is everyone in love with this guy? But then they're like, oh, he was evil and we had to lock him away in this box, which we're going to very slowly unlock over 20 hours.
Well, I guess, but I imagine you, like me, appreciate that there is this side to, this side to a game is possible, that that level of devotion and interest is possible.
I am envious of it, yeah.
It's cool. I think it's cool that people have that relationship with it. But I like hearing your, you know, this was my first contact kind of experience with it.
That's, yeah, interesting.
The reason I'm a Nintendo, guys, it's very surface level. It's like, here's everything, you know, we're not going to hide anything from you. We're going to be completely straight about what this game is, whether you can do it.
We want you to get through it. That's just more my speed.
Yeah. I don't want there to be like Kirby and the Forgotten Land lore, where it turns out like...
There is lore. That's the one game where I'd say it actually does have lore, if you go on Reddit and see people arguing about Kirby lore.
What? I mean, I don't want to find out like...
Based on just like in Dark Souls and what not, like based on the trophy descriptions.
What the hell? I'm really appalled to hear that genuinely.
Yeah, I think the guy, whatever his name is, Kunazeki heads it up, is like... The guy who like directs the Kirby series now, I think he's actually quite into that stuff and has woven quite a deep Kirby lore, which he's drip feeding through trophy descriptions that you get from capsule toys.
What? This is where I find out that the fucking duck thing that you fight, like her kids were killed in like, were run over by Kirby, like in some kind of road traffic accident and like that happened out in the streets of this city.
Haven't you watched the 15-hour video essay, Is Kirby the Real Villain of Kirby the Forgotten Land?
I will say for that game, all those transformations, they're just delightful aren't they, the transformations. Like his silly little face just wrapped around all these things. So good.
I mean, man, what a delightful game. So yes, I mean, here was me thinking, Hollow Knight and Kirby the Forgotten Land couldn't be any more different from each other. I'm appalled to hear that's not the case.
Yeah, yeah. Well, okay. Well, that lost for me to think about there.
We have one final game to discuss here, don't we, Matthew, that you've tagged in here?
Yes. I wanted to briefly mention Shoot and Order, which is the new adventure game from 2Q Games, who are the people who made Rain Code. It's the Danganronpa guide basically.
It's his new studio. He made Rain Code. He made the...
Oh, what the fuck? What's that 100-hour visual novel I've been playing this year?
What's the game's name? 100 Academy or something?
Defense, Last Defense Line. The 100 Academy? Yeah, that one.
They made that one. Some other games. It's like him and...
100 Line, that was it, wasn't it?
100 Line, that's it. Yeah, it's like a studio that he heads up, and he also works with the chap who wrote Zero Escape, and the composer who did all the music for No More Heroes, Suda51's games. Quite a cool little bunch of people.
They make loads of games. I feel like the 100 Line is like their big project that they all worked on together, and that Shoot and Order feels a little bit work for hire, would be my guess, in that I think another studio made the meat of it, and that he just came up with the concept of it. The gimmick of this is you play a character who lives in this religious order, this kingdom, called Shooten, which is all part of the Shooten Order, which is this religious cult, and you're killed right at the start of the game– happens in the opening cutscene, not a spoiler– and you're resurrected the next day by some angels and they tell you you have a couple of days to basically find out who killed you.
There are five main suspects, and you basically have the choice to spend time with one of the five suspects, and then it will loop back round and you'll spend time with the different suspects. So by the end of the game, you'll have done each of these sort of suspects, sort of arcs, I guess. But the gimmick is each suspect's game, it kind of appears as a different game type.
In one of them, it's like a kind of detective game a la Danganronpa. You're collecting evidence and presenting it, very kind of Ace Attorney. But then another character's arc is like a survival horror game, and you play it running away from this sort of monster in a maze.
This game is so you, man. I mean, that's… Oh my god.
That's unbelievable.
Another character's arc is a, like, dating sim, and one is like a riff on Zero Escape, so it's like an escape ring game. And the last one is… I'd actually say it feels a little bit like Shibuya Scramble.
It's like a straight visual novel, but with a time-hopping element. On paper, this should have been an absolute, like, my favourite game of the year. It's basically a studio serving up everything they've ever done, all at the same time in one game.
The problem I actually have with it is each of these arcs is about four to five hours long, and I think a lot of these game types and story types don't really benefit from being crushed into that amount of time. Like, they feel very, very hurried, and their individual strengths as genres aren't well served by it. You know, like, a visual novel with 20 characters, who you're introduced to them, and then it all plays out in the course of four hours.
It can't help but feel, like, rushed and busy and not making a huge amount of sense. I'd say that's true for all the game types here that are adventure games or visual novel adjacent. You just think, I would have liked one game of this where you actually took the time to kind of get it right rather than hurrying it through.
The dating sim is absolute trash. Like, a worthless chunk of game. I wish you could skip it entirely.
And the survival horror game is like running away from a monster in the maze, but the AI on the thing is so basic, and the puzzles you have to solve are so basic. It's almost like they knew they were making a game for visual novel nerds, so they didn't want to make anything too mechanically complicated to hold everyone's progress up. And as a result, I thought it was a big old mess, rather than being a celebration of all the things these various people have done at this studio.
You know these genres inside out. You know that these aren't good examples of these things. These stories, they're not interesting enough, they're not well told enough, they're hurried.
The way they stitch together is moderately interesting. Like the fact that you can play them in any order means that it has this like wider visual novel structure to it, where you have to do five strands to get clues and then bring them together in like a conclusion, which is just like its own thing as well. As each one went by, my heart was sinking more and more.
You know, when I first saw that menu with the five genres on there, I thought, oh, this is going to be absolutely banging. Like I saved some of them to Alask, so I thought, oh, I'll save the Detective game to Alask. I know that that'll be my favorite one.
And actually that one was okay compared to the others. But with each one, I was just like, oh, this was a bad idea, you know? And I'm not saying I want to play a game where each of those games is 20 hours long, because that is the 100 line.
That's what that game is. It's a 160-hour visual novel game, which all the different arcs feel like different games. Does this one is like a more mechanical realization of that idea?
You know, like they are literally different games until we join up at the end. And I just thought it was a bit of a bust.
Isn't it nuts to release a game like this in a year where you've already released the 100 line? Isn't that a bit strange to have both these games close together?
That's why I raised the thing about, you know, I'm not sure how much of this they… How much they made, or whether they just came up with the idea and gave the characters their blessing and then gave it to another team. I was trying to decipher it from the credits at the end, and definitely Kodaka, who's like the head of Tukio, his name is all over this one.
He wrote the storyline. There's a lot of story by this person, script by that person going on. Given how dense and successful the 100 line was, you know, you don't want to speculate about these things, but I feel like that really was their big swing and their big successful swing to boot.
It would have been amazing if this was good, but I don't think it is. I don't think this is on many people's radars, but you know, I spent, well, 30 hours playing it, so I figured I should at least not warm people off it, but deliver the verdict.
There's a collective, I think like collectively something like 100 hours went into this one episode of this podcast. That's just like crazy, but I think it might be true.
I mean, yeah, that's like we burned through a lot of games.
We need a week off, man. We definitely need a week off.
Like there are entire standalone podcast, like, you know, not episodes, but whole podcasts about just Hollow Knight.
Yeah. Are we doing this wrong? Are we making podcasts wrong?
Is this right for us? Or should we be doing more what we've been playing? I do enjoy them, but I mean...
I do like doing them. It is mad to like play a game for 25 hours and then burn it in 10 minutes.
Yeah, it is a bit. At least the one thing you can say for Mafia is that it was good value podding for the length of the game. You know what I mean?
That's a very like, that's not helpful to a consumer, but it's helpful to a podcaster to know that, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, the thing is, but, you know, you also weren't obliged to play through shooting order. You know, like I...
Well, I did it for freelance, so I should say. I'll come to you.
Oh, there you go.
I've got a review. I've got, let's just say, I've got an anonymous review we'll be appearing to.
I'll try and, yeah, I'll try and guess where that might be. Yeah, so I think it just, the lesson is, we'll just always make sure there's one of these in the calendar so we can talk about what we're playing. I've got, I haven't played it yet, but this weekend I'm playing the new Helldivers update where they've added a load of new bug creatures and you have to go into some tunnels, which sounds like it will negate the airstrikes that make Helldivers fun, so we'll see how that goes.
I'm sure you'll find a way to team kill nonetheless.
No, I try and be on my best behaviour around Phil and Tom Hatfield because they're very like-
Oh, new people you're playing with.
Yeah, I always say Phil Savage on PC Gamer and Tom Hatfield. They're my multiplayer group people and then Jay Bayliss. We've played Held and Ring Night Rain together.
We're going to play a bit more of that, but it's mostly been Phil and Tom for the last year and a half, I would say. I would say with Helldivers, I've bought that. I'm afraid I was a mark for that Halo ODST DLC Matthew, so I bought that and I'm looking forward to taking Marks and Chiefs Assault Rifle for a go.
So you've got all that to look forward to in the future, what we've been playing. But for now, we both get a week off of the regular podcast, Matthew. Hopefully, listeners agree.
We've earned a small break. I think we have 11 days now till we record an episode.
Yeah, which will be filled full of Atari 50.
So you don't have to play everything for like 80 hours. Just play everything for 10 minutes and we'll make one fun pod out of it.
Trust me, I'm playing. If they get 10, the amazing games get 10 minutes.
Yeah, it's like UFO 50, but on like 10 times speed basically, it's that kind of experience. Okay, Matthew, well, I very much enjoyed this, doing this pod with you. It was good.
And yeah, it was some fun games to dig into there. So where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W Roberts on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. The podcast is at Back Page Pod. I've already plugged the Patreon, so I don't need to do it again, but you do get two extra podcasts a month if you support us.
The Excel tier on there. And the next podcast from us in two weeks will be a Mailbag, the next original podcast. Like I say, free feed.
You get to listen to our takes on Bully from the start of the year. That'll be a fun one. And yeah, but this was fun, Matthew.
Enjoy your time off and catch you later. Bye-bye.
See you soon. Bye-bye.
