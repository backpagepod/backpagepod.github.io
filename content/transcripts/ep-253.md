Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. We're newly out of the Mario mines, and we have a podcast special guest this week. So, Matt, would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello, yeah, I'm Matt Leone. I guess doing the name thing didn't matter before, since I'm introducing myself. But I worked at OneUp for about 10 years and Polygon for about 13 years, and now I'm doing a new site called Design Room, and yeah, happy to be here.
Yeah. Thanks for taking the time to speak to us, Matt. Matt Leone.
There you go. I said it out loud, just so it wasn't a waste of time having that conversation before we start recording. So yeah, Matt, you have a really, really interesting history and I think I'm always, we're always curious to hear more about the sort of like one up strain of games media in the US just because it produced so many notable journalists over the years.
But to go right back to the start, tell us a bit about your background and what did you play growing up?
Yeah. So I mean, I played a lot of arcade games and I guess Super Nintendo was probably the first system that I had at home. Well, my brother had a Nintendo.
I guess I don't know exactly how to describe my tastes. Kind of anything. I liked anything fighting games.
I liked any kind of action game. I guess that's still true. But yeah, then so like around junior high age, I started making like print fanzines, which were kind of a thing at the time.
There was a couple of magazines like in the US that did like these columns kind of promoting print fanzines that people did. And there was a little bit of community around that. So I did that for a little while and that turned into some fan sites and that turned into, I did a part-time job with gamers.com and I did an internship with official Xbox magazine in the US.
And eventually I got all that kind of led to a job at 1UP. So yeah, it was a fun kind of way in, which was probably pretty different than it would be these days.
Yeah. Do any of your fanzines still exist? Are they documented anywhere on the Internet?
I hope not. I don't think so. I have a couple of copies.
I don't even think I have all the copies. I know Chris Kohler like threatened me with posting them at one point. It's like a joke.
But yeah, because like a few people do have them, because like we would send them around for, you know, like the 10 people who actually bought copies or that kind of thing. So I'm sure there are a few out there somewhere, but yeah, I wouldn't really recommend it. Like it's fun to look back at like the covers, but I don't really want to open them.
Yeah, that's fair enough. I think everyone feels that way about their early work.
Well, yeah, because like this is 30 years ago.
Yeah, you know, you are a veteran, like you say, like what were your first bits of work before you got hired and went up there? You mentioned Official Xbox Magazine there. Like what, how did you kind of graduate from, you know, sort of fan scenes to a more professional sort of path?
What was kind of jumping on point there?
When I started doing websites, like fan sites essentially at the time, it weren't exclusively based around arcades, but I very much focused in on like, I should try to cover new arcade games coming out because I felt like that was one of the areas that no one else was covering. So it was kind of a little space I could have to myself. And that's what I like to play a lot.
So I would do a lot of like stuff based on location tests and like reviews of new arcade games and stuff like that. And there was, it was for a website called eventgaming.com, which definitely does not exist at this point. There's probably some archive.org versions of it out there.
So that led me to getting a job with gamers.com, which is not a full-time job. I was doing it while I was in college. And that, basically working on their arcade section.
And then that kind of led me, I mean, I don't know if it directly led me, but that kind of rolled into the official Xbox magazine internship, which I think was the following summer. These are both basically like when I was in college. And then that essentially ended up with the one-up thing.
So yeah, I guess it was probably one of the few cases where like arcade games got people into more mainstream stuff like console coverage.
We don't talk a huge amount about arcade stuff on the podcast. You know, we both have quite a casual relationship with it, I think. But like what were like the big hitters from that period that you remember?
Like what were a couple of faves just to give people a sense of the era?
Well, so that's kind of the what was interesting about it was this was when the arcades were like dying off and you could argue that they've kind of been like a suspended state of death for like the last 20 or 30 years. Like they're not completely dead, but they're a whole different thing now. But it was very much like companies were still trying to hang on.
So this was like the late 90s, I would say, probably. Yeah, early 2000s. And so you were getting things like DDR and like some of the leftover like fighting game stuff like Capcom vs.
SNK was coming around. I remember there was an E3 where Capcom brought like a cabinet of Capcom vs. SNK to the show.
But they didn't really like promote the game. They just like they didn't have like official screenshots and videos and stuff like that. So I just like took out my digital camera.
I was like taking pictures of the screen. And that I think that was like the first pictures of that, that ever got online. Wow.
So there were little like little like scoops like that based on like location tests and stuff like that. Mostly just because companies weren't properly promoting arcade games online at the time. And so yeah, that was that was kind of that era.
Derby Owners Club, when they brought that over to the US, the horse racing game, that was something we covered a lot. Yeah, it was just kind of fun. Like I started getting like some connections with, you know, manufacturing departments and distributors and things like that.
And I don't know, it's a whole different kind of business, but it was fun for the time.
Yeah. What I find really interesting about you, Matt, is you've been around, you know, you'd say 30 years you've been doing this. And I just like couldn't imagine being writing about games for 30 years.
I just find, you know, the idea that you're still doing it is really something. Like, I guess like what's the kind of core of your passion? What made you want to write about games in the first place?
I mean, when I was a kid, it was game magazines. I would like look at, you know, EGM and Game Fan and all these magazines like that and be like, that seems like a fun job. And I want to do that's kind of what led to making like the fanzines.
And it was all kind of directed towards like, hey, eventually I want to do that. By the time I got to like doing it full time, magazines are already kind of on their way out and websites were kind of more popular. So it just kind of naturally transitioned to that.
But yeah, I mean, like I think every every few years, the reason I like doing it changes. Like initially, it was very much about kind of going after that. I don't know, just the appeal of working on a magazine seemed very interesting creatively and as like a fun job as time went on, it became more about like, okay, let's, I'm a marketing student talking to like the people who make games or the business behind games.
And then kind of as time went on, it was like, oh, I can't trust all these people. I need to talk to other people who worked with them. And so like that kind of eventually led to what I'm doing now.
It's like I try to talk to as many people as possible rather than just like one person at a time. And so, yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of different motivations over the years. I think as time went on, I definitely got more cynical.
But also, I think that made me better at the job in a way. So yeah, I don't know. There's good and bad with all of it, I guess.
Yeah. I did want to ask about writing for a website in the early 2000s. 1UP and EGM produced a lot of great writers and editors.
What did you learn from being in that environment?
Yeah, that's a big question. So I was there about, I guess, about 10 years. And it changed a lot over that 10 years too.
So like in the early days, it was very much like we were kind of the outsiders in the office, so it was the same building, or essentially two floors that had, so it was Electronic Gaming Monthly, it was Computer Gaming World. There were different magazines at different times. There was like GMR, there was Game Now, there was Xbox Nation, and Official PlayStation Magazine.
And we were kind of just like, we were actually on the very beginning, we were on the next, like we were on the ninth floor and everybody else was on the eighth floor, so we were very much like the outsiders. But then over that course of that 10 years, like that relationship kind of like switched, where like 1-Up became more important and the magazines became less important. So it was very interesting kind of watching that change.
And like it used to be like people would come in to show games to the magazines, they're like, we weren't even let into those rooms to see the games and they came. And then by the end it was like, oh, we, you know, we're coming to see 1-Up first. And some of this other stuff is just kind of the peripheral.
So yeah, I think that was that was interesting. I think the style and pace and speed of the writing was all very different. Like, you know, they had very involved processes on the, some of the print mags at least, where like, you know, they would have like multiple rounds of edits and copy edits and stuff like that.
And like, we were always like fighting against that. Like we don't want to take the time to do this because that's just going to slow us down and like we need to get stuff up on the site. So you know, we, I think in the end we tried to kind of find a middle ground there, but it was, it was very much like you would expect, you know, the internet needs.
Content, always. So you got to kind of do it as quick as you can and you know, we didn't always have as big a team as some of the others as well, so it was hard to kind of go at that speed. But yeah, I think everyone is essentially kind of met in the middle towards the end of that run, but at the beginning it was very like siloed, like the magazines are this and the website is this other thing.
Yeah, I definitely felt like a sort of the end of a certain age of the internet when one up went away. It felt like that anyway, just that it felt like magazine journalism on the internet. And I mean, that's a compliment.
So yeah, I'm not surprised to hear that was the flip. I think that pretty much happened in the future as well, the growing importance of websites. The GameCube was your beat, right?
What was that like on one up?
So that was at the very beginning. I don't know how recently I updated my LinkedIn, so I'm not sure what it says exactly. But yeah, for the first, I don't know, maybe year or two, I basically was happy to take any job I can get.
So I had gotten a recommendation from the people who I worked for on Official Xbox Magazine and that got me in the door. And then I was young, I was happy to take any job available. So the last job they had left essentially on the one up staff at that point was the, it was a hybrid job of GameCube and Cheats because they just needed somebody to cover both.
So I was thrilled to take it, but I didn't have any particular affinity or knowledge of GameCube anymore. So than anything else, I liked it, but I didn't, I played a little bit of everything. So yeah, I mean, it was very much just trying to figure out how to cover it.
And GameCube was kind of a hard thing to cover because Nintendo is very much about established relationships and people they've worked with for a long time. And so even though our company had a lot of relationships with Nintendo, like our website did not. So I was kind of just picking at the edges and seeing what I could get.
And I remember anytime a new game would come out, so we had access to what the print magazines would publish. And so like a new Mario Kart would come out and I would be like, okay, one day I'm going to publish the 1-up review, but then another day I'm going to publish the EGM review. Another day I'm going to publish the Game Now review or whatever, just to kind of like stretch it out and create like more content out of one thing.
So there's a lot of kind of things like that. And not even specific to the GameCube stuff, but just that job in general. A lot of it, my job specifically was kind of making bridges between the magazines and the website and trying to kind of like, oh, if you read this article here, you can get some bonus videos related to it here and kind of like tying all those things together.
It was a lot of that. So yeah, I think the GameCube specifically didn't last too long before we restructured and it became less like console specific. We had like, you know, previews editor was, I think, my next job instead of like section editors at that point, or platform, I should say.
So yeah, it changed a lot, but it was very much kind of, I don't know, experimenting and seeing what we could get out of it.
Yeah, that makes sense. So you wrote Polygon from launch. It made a splash when it arrived and tackled the kinds of projects other sites did not.
You know, the kind of long reads you saw on there was definitely, you know, against the grain of where websites were at at that time in 2012. How different was it from OneUp?
So I should clarify, I was there from when this site officially launched as like polygon.com, but there was a period before that where it was run, like they were publishing on The Verge, and there was a group of, I think, eight people originally who started it that I was not involved with, so I was not there for like the very earliest days of like figuring out what the site was and that kind of thing. I kind of joined once that stuff had already been taken care of. But yeah, it was, it was interesting.
I think, I don't know, over time I feel like there's always been different sites popping up that try to do longer stuff in terms of, you know, like reported features and that kind of thing, and sometimes you get more of them and sometimes you get less of them and sometimes they'll be on bigger sites and sometimes they'll be on more obscure sites. But that was definitely a nice place to be because those first couple of years, they were happy to not only run those things, but like fund a lot of them. So like, I think our features team for the first, I don't know how long, maybe two years, year and a half or two years, something like that, was three people, plus we had like a full-time designer and a very, very significant freelance budget.
So we were able to kind of do a lot of interesting things with that without a lot of pressure from above on trying to figure out how it all made sense financially and that kind of thing. And there was a lot of crossover of the video, like we had a video team that did really cool documentary style videos. And yeah, so that was, I think it was just a nice place to be because people wanted to kind of establish it in this way and we didn't have a lot of people telling us how to do that.
It was just kind of like, here's the money, go figure it out.
Oh, an incredibly exciting opportunity, I'm sure. So what is the journey of Polygon from there then? Like when you joined in 2012 and you start with this big team and this huge budget, what are the kind of like various ups and downs that occur between then and the time that you leave?
Yeah, I don't think I'm even going to remember all of them because it was very much like little bumps along the way. And I might not even be aware of all of them because there was a lot of different people involved in those decisions too. But I'd say the biggest shifts over that period that I was there was...
So initially, after those first couple years, the features section got taken apart, essentially, and I was left with the features section, but the rest of that team, the other two people and designer, were gone off doing other things. But the thing is I still had a decent freelance budget at that point. It was very small compared to what it had been, but compared to your average website, it was still pretty decent.
And I think because it had shrunk down in that way, there was zero pressure on me to do anything, so I had a lot of freedom to do stuff for the next, I don't know, five or six years, somewhere in there. So that was a fun way to do it too, because we weren't able to do as much stuff, and we weren't able to do as many high-end things, especially on the video side. But I also didn't really have to get a lot of stuff approved, and had a lot of freedom still.
So it was still a decent, pretty nice place to be. The site as a whole definitely went through a lot of changes too. It was initially very news-focused, and doing everything is like the paper of record kind of idea.
And then that changed, and it became more opinionated. Over time also, it became much more focused on a younger audience. There was a lot of talk, I don't know exactly when it started, maybe like four or five years towards the end, maybe about halfway, I'm not sure exactly, about focusing on more of a Gen Z audience, which would change the editorial focus, but also would change what kind of sponsorships we would get and that kind of thing.
And it worked very well from an advertising perspective. So yeah, my specific role didn't change that much this whole time because I was kind of off in my corner doing my own thing for the majority of that time. But the site itself made quite significant changes, I think, from being like a more like targeting more of like an older demographic with, you know, the features you're talking about and like the more like dry, straightforward news coverage of like everything that's out there and then becoming more of like a opinionated site that was targeting younger audiences towards the end.
Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I admire every iteration of Polygon. You folks did a great job.
And even as it changed, it changed from being maybe what it was initially pitched as to, you know, like the best version of a consumer site that covers, you know, games, books, TV shows, movies. So, yeah, I think whatever form it took, it was still, it always had like the DNA of what it was. And then it was really, really good at everything it also tried to do that maybe felt like more familiar sort of pop culture media.
So, I guess I just wanted to say that, you know, I thought it was a cool site basically, Matt, but yes.
I would throw out one other thing too. I don't know, people don't have to agree necessarily, but I would say that since the site has been bought by Valnet, it has actually been better than I expected it would be. I think it's actually still a pretty decent site.
If people go there now, I think a lot of people wrote it off. But I think if you actually just go look at the content they're producing, it's actually not that bad. So I would recommend it for people.
Yeah, some great writers and editors there for sure. I wanted to know how Oral Histories ended up becoming your beat. I know it's not the only thing you've done, but it's what you've built.
Design Room around, they are the opposite of the kind of thing that web writing is really based on. They're slow and difficult to make. You're not writing them to hit Google News Boxes, for example.
So how did that become your thing?
Yeah, it's especially noticeable because now that I'm doing this as an independent site, it's very much not about me either, which is kind of the thing that tends to fund independent subscription-based things. People want to subscribe to the people. I've always kind of been someone who's not put myself out there as much as the work.
So yeah, I think the background of that is towards the end of my time at OneUp, I was doing more features based around people who worked on games, just interview-based stories, because I liked them. I thought that was like the human interest angle was interesting at the time. And that's essentially what got me into the Polygon job too, because I was doing a lot of the same kind of stuff there.
And then yeah, I think early on at Polygon, I had read a, it was very specific, but there was a Vanity Fair Oral History of the Sopranos that I had read at one point, and that kind of put the idea in my head, like, oh, I haven't really seen this format much for games, so that's, I kind of wanted to try it. And the first one I did was Street Fighter II, which is an ambitious thing, because like a lot of those people speak Japanese, and it's not the easiest thing to kind of, you know, go track them down one by one. But, you know, we were in that phase where we had a decent budget, and we're able to do that kind of thing.
So I just kind of started trying to piece it together. And what I liked about it, the format, was you could kind of tell stories that people already knew to a degree, but in like a much more like rounded kind of way that got a lot of context in there and got a lot of like anecdotes that you wouldn't have heard otherwise. So like that first Street Fighter story, like people knew, although there was a lot of inaccurate information.
Like if you go back to that era, like what is it, 10, 15 years ago, like there was so much wrong about like people would get the names of people who worked on games wrong and stuff like that. Like there are books written that like completely miscredit the people who develop that game. But anyway, so yeah, it was very much kind of like, okay, let's try to get more context in there, let's try to get some interesting anecdotes in here and let's like piece it together in a way that's like, you know, kind of fun to read and kind of accomplishes a lot of the goals that I wanted to accomplish.
But not really worrying too much about, like you say, the finances or the time it took to make and that kind of thing. And I think we're in a fortunate position where we could, you know, it wasn't the only thing I was working on at the time, but I could spend some time on it where I might not have been able to in some other jobs.
That makes sense. And, you know, they're hugely impressive projects and, you know, I definitely extend that to your work on Design Room right now. They, you know, it's still just something you don't really find elsewhere that frequently in games journalism.
I was curious about your Final Fantasy VII ones specifically, because when I first worked in games media in the late 2000s, it didn't feel like Square Enix ever did interviews, really. And they've become more active in recent years. But, you know, it was like once in a blue moon, maybe like a major launch, you might see one interview doing the rounds with, you know, a figurehead from Square Enix.
But generally speaking, they didn't tend to blow open the doors for access, or share many stories about the behind the scenes of their games. So what was the process like building that one?
So it's interesting. I don't really feel that way. I kind of feel like of the big Japanese companies, the, you know, Capcom, Square Enix, Namco, people like that, Konami, I feel like Square Enix has been one of the more open ones.
I don't know. Maybe it differs based on territory, and just like they were more comfortable with certain US outlets or things. Yeah, I mean, I think again, the one-up EGM connection probably helped too, because they had certain relationships there.
But yeah, so I feel like they, you know, it wasn't that hard getting people to agree on that one. I think it was more just the number of people I wanted to reach out to. So like the goal with that was not just to talk to, you know, Sakaguchi and the two or three people at the top, but to talk to like as many people as we could.
So I forget the total number of people. It was probably like 30-something people that we talked to. And that was, it was more just, you know, an endurance challenge, like okay, how long are we going to stick with this?
How many people are we going to try to track down before we call it? And again, that was, so that was kind of in that phase after that first couple years of Polygon where we had like tons of budget, but still where I had like a bunch of, a decent budget but no one really was paying attention to it. So it was easy enough to kind of pull that kind of stuff together without people worrying too much.
Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of it too is that when you're talking about interviews from games in the 90s, like even if there are interviews out there on these games, like a lot of times they're not very good because the people interview, like it were just like they had different expectations. The translations weren't very good. The questions were very kind of surface level and that kind of thing.
So like nowadays, a new game comes out and you'll see like a hundred different podcast interviews that go like super depth and super deep into every little detail of what they have to say and what they're thinking about and stuff like that. But if you go back in the 90s, like a lot of that is not the case. Like there are interviews with people from that time, but not that many in a lot of cases and the ones that are out there are not that in depth.
So I think that's a big opportunity that I've kind of tried to seize on over the years is like, okay, let's talk to these people who worked on very important games, but maybe not haven't had as much chance to speak about them.
I've got a question about process on putting one of these things together. Do you have like a dream order, say with the Final Fantasy VII, like the order you'd like the interviews to happen? Because sometimes it feels like maybe the way you've structured it is that the lesser known people, you're maybe using them to interrogate some of like the lead accounts, and maybe that's just like a happy accident, or just a coincidence that's how it works.
But I would imagine you have to start somewhere and have the spine of it, and then you're sort of building it out from there. Could you just talk a little bit about how that works?
Yeah, so I mean it really differs based on the story. Like I remember the Final Fantasy one specifically. I wasn't even really sure I was going to do it.
I think I was going on a Japan trip for something else, and I was like, well, let's put out some feelers and see what could happen. And then on that trip I got like two or three of the kind of the more like known name people. And then after that I was like, okay, now I can kind of turn this into something.
And then I start reaching out to everybody else. But it's gone the other way too, where sometimes I start with some small little interview or some anecdote from someone else who I just kind of stumble into or notice or think about. And then like, then I go from there and try to get kind of the more well-known people to participate.
I think it really depends. And it, the challenging thing too is like sometimes I'll start in on these stories and I just, I'll get some of the people who I want to talk to. Like if I have a list of, you know, 10 or 20 people that I want to talk to, if I only get three or four of those, it's going to be a different kind of story.
And I'm, you know, I'm not necessarily going to throw it out and never use it, but it wouldn't be necessarily like a big oral history like I like to do. So it's kind of just feeling it out. I don't really have a firm process on it.
I think the best case scenario would be to probably talk to like the best known people first, then go talk to everybody else, then go back to the kind of big bigger names and kind of get them to respond to what everybody else has said. I mean, really in the best case scenario, it's to like go back to everybody three or four times. And that is not real realistic in most cases.
But yeah, I mean, there are a lot of cases where I have to, you know, go back and see like, hey, you know, so and so said this, like, how did you feel about that? And I think that's where it gets to be interesting because you get those kind of back and forth discussions.
No, that's really strong in the Final Fantasy VII where I actually reread it at lunchtime today. And it just really made me laugh that, you know, you've got like Sakaguchi's version of events is quite different often to everyone else's. And you've got Nomura and Katase who I assume were interviewed together because they seem to be like bantering with each other.
And, you know, they're kind of questioning each other and also Sakaguchi a little bit. And, yeah, it was just, I don't know, it was really fun to have that like cross interrogation element in the mix too.
Yeah, I appreciate that. I think it's interesting too, because like you say, like when people are in the same room or in that case, there was, there might have been multiple interviews, but there was one interview where I did interview them together and it was in person. That gets you a lot of, like you say, banter and like kind of fun interactions, like especially when they start talking to each other instead of just to me.
So I like that a lot. But I think there's also a lot of value in getting people to respond to things when they don't necessarily have the pressure of somebody else in the same room. Like in that case, they were very friendly and working together, and they were on the same page.
But like you say, with like Sakaguchi and some of the other people in the story, like I feel like if they were on the same call or in the same room, their answers probably would have differed a little. But by like having them spaced out and having some time to think about things and then kind of being able to go back to other people, I feel like in some ways you get less of a filter there because people don't have to kind of worry about like, you know, disappointing someone who might have had some power over them. So yeah, I think it's great to have both of those wherever you can get them.
But it's definitely something to think about because there's like, there's ethical questions there too, like you don't want to pressure somebody into saying something by having them on the same call with somebody else. And so yeah, it's tricky balance.
I was curious with Final Fantasy specifically, whether there was any one sort of insight or anecdote that you uncovered in that story that you were particularly proud of, or that's really stuck with you over the years, just because it was a game that the creation of it, which was not even vaguely really well known, how they made that thing. The materials on how they created the game were pretty scant until you published that piece. But was there anything that kind of sticks in your mind as I'm really glad I got that into the story?
I'm probably going to blow the specific details of this because it's been a little while, but I remember there was a nickname that people had given Sakaguchi, which was like Champagne King.
Oh yeah.
Or I guess it was... Okay, so there was levels to it. I think people were like, we referred to him as King, and then he said something about like, oh yeah, it was like Champagne King, because we would always go out to clubs and celebrate and stuff like that.
Then I remember, I think if I'm not mistaken, there was something towards the end of the story where I had a call back to that, when they were talking about a king or something like that. I forget the details, but I remember that detail making me very happy at the time, because I was like, okay, this brings it all together. So yeah, it's often a lot of little details like that, more so than any huge thing.
If I'm not mistaken, so like we did a book version of Final Fantasy as well, and we had, so the first run of that had like a little decoder thing in it, that you could find this like hidden message, and if you did that, you could like take it to the website and type it in, and you would get like an original song that was like a tribute to Final Fantasy VII song that we had commissioned, and I guess it's a spoiler, but I'm pretty sure if I'm not mistaken, I might be getting this wrong, but if I'm getting this right, at least one of the ideas that came up was the secret code that you'd unlock was Champagne King. So, a little connection.
That's awesome. So how long did it take to figure out that Design Room would be your next project after what happened at Polygon?
I don't remember. Probably a couple of months. It was very much like an idea I had maybe a week or so after Polygon.
It wasn't something I had been planning a long time. It probably should have been. I probably should have had something in my back pocket all along because media is so unstable and eventually stuff is going to happen no matter what situation you're in.
But I hadn't really planned anything like that. It was very much just comfortable with where I was. So yeah, I think the idea came up probably within about a week.
Then I thought about it for a month or two before I really committed to it. What I eventually decided was whether it works or not, it's something I want to do. So I might as well just try doing it and see how it goes.
But yeah, I think the idea was essentially, let's try to A, continue what I've been doing that I think I'm not too bad at, but also like maybe what people would recognize and have some familiarity with. And then yeah, there was like a kind of a couple month period of like, okay, well, what are the first stories for this going to be? Because these things can sometimes take months to put together.
And I probably had a list of like four or five, and Shadow of the Colossus was the first of those that kind of came together. So then once that happened, it was like, okay, well, let's try to time this for the anniversary of it. So that I think that whole process probably took about four or five months.
Yeah, I mean, they, you know, when you read them, they feel like projects that took a lot of time and effort. Designroom.site is the website, by the way, for our listeners. If you want to go check this out, I will link this in the post that I put on Patreon and also in the episode description as well.
But yes, Shadow of the Colossus, like you say, your first major project. And I think it's really cool that you offer the basic content freely. You can read the core Shadow of the Colossus piece.
Then you have a lot of cool extra articles if readers pay to support it. So I really like the piece that you did on The Last Guardian and why it didn't end up on PS3 and move to PS4 because that's another story that's just never been told before. So it was really cool to see that.
I was curious how you came up with building the business model in this way. How much time did you spend thinking about that?
Yeah, I should definitely say I'm not sure I've found a great business model. I'm trying it and we'll see it. I may experiment with some other ideas too.
But yeah, I think the main idea was just if you're going to do an independent thing and you're trying to make it something people might like, you want to not make it too difficult to people actually see it and enjoy it, and hopefully like it. So yeah, I didn't want to charge for the big stories, if at all possible, both because of like, it just seems like that stuff should be out there and I like the idea of it being out there for free. But at the same time, just from like a kind of a marketing perspective too, like no one's going to share these things if they are paywalled.
So I think that is kind of the idea is hopefully people will spread those. And then once people read them, they might be interested in some of the bonus stuff. But we'll see.
I mean, I think it's a decent start, but it's going to be hard to say exactly how successful it is until we kind of spend a little more time doing it. And yeah, I don't know if it's going to be a hugely successful business model because like you say, these stories take a while to make and I'm constantly like, having worked on daily websites for the last 20 plus years, it's like I very much have this itch in my brain of like, we have to always have new stuff going up on the site. But if we're only posting one of these big stories, like every, I don't even know how often, maybe every month, give or take, is that really going to bring in enough of an audience?
And is that going to bring in enough subscribers and that kind of thing? Like I think my logic is, well, these big stories hopefully will bring in more subscribers on average than a smaller story would. But I don't necessarily think of it really in like a strong business sense of like, this is a great idea so much as it's more just design is like, this is what I want to do and hopefully I can get some support to keep doing it.
And you know, the business side of it is kind of secondary in some ways to me trying to do what I want to do.
Did you ever contemplate going down the kind of physical media, kind of, you know, the Kickstarter sort of journal slash art book only because there is a design streak, you know, more of a design streak to your work than you would expect from most websites. And you know, you commission original artwork to go with the pieces. Like, I feel like you have, you know, a bit of a print media eye is definitely looking over this stuff and it's very artfully presented.
And just given like the rise of things like Profound Waste of Time, you know, or The Om Journal, which is a thing here in the UK, you know, I wondered if there would ever be anything in that because it feels quite closely aligned with what's happening in that scene.
Yeah, I definitely thought about it. I think, first of all, I love those. I love Profound Waste of Time.
It's probably my favorite magazine out there right now. And On, I'm a big fan of. And Lock-On and all the other similar ones like that are...
It's very nice to see. I was tempted to. I think ultimately there is a kind of connection there between people who are willing to spend money on something and like the kinds of stories that I do.
I see that as maybe an easier way to get people to pay money than like a subscription service. Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to say.
Ultimately, I think the bigger issue is I would need more help. It wouldn't be necessarily as much something I could do on my own. Like what I'm doing now, I have a bunch of freelancers helping me out with, which is going to help a lot, especially in the coming months, because I'm trying to have them do some bigger stories and I can leapfrog so I can do some stuff and then they can do some stuff and that will help keep it more regular pace.
But if I was to do a print magazines, like it does appeal to me for sure. And in some ways, it's a safer bet if you do it through Kickstarter or something like that, whereas you don't necessarily have to commit to everything before you see whether it's successful. But I don't know, I mean, I think it would be very hard to compete with some of those magazines on the design side without hiring someone to help.
And then, yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's not out of the question. I could also see potentially, I don't know, there might be something we could do where, you know, after doing a year of the website, we say, okay, let's round up like the best stories from this year and put them into some printed something like that. So it's definitely not out of the question.
Yeah. But it seemed a little harder to get off the ground, at least initially.
I get that. I also like the idea that you just want this information out there, that it's a public service to dig into these games and bring these stories to light and locking them off to a couple of thousand of Kickstarter supporters or whatever. Maybe it's in the spirit of that.
So I respect that too.
I think that is a big part of it too, yeah, because I think making a magazine like that is in some ways, not entirely, but a little bit more of like something I would be doing for myself rather than what I'd be doing for people to read it. And I think the idea of having something for, that's out there for everyone. Like if you look at the numbers of the Shadow of the Colossus story, that was approaching a lot of the same kind of readership numbers we would see on a Polygon story.
So to have that kind of reach, now to be fair, some of the other smaller things I've posted, no where near that, but having that as a possible outlet to get out to people, I think it is nice. I like that, so.
I do have more questions on Design Room, but I did also want to ask a bit more about the process of building an oral history. So do you have rules on participation for developers in an oral history project? Do they always have to at least agree to be on a video call to be part of it, or do you ever take email Q&As if it's a particularly elusive interviewee?
I don't have any like broad rules across every story. Maybe within a certain story, I might like give myself certain guidelines of like, you know, you have to get this person to talk in this way in order to make it work and that kind of thing. I generally hate email interviews and will avoid them as much as possible.
But yeah, there are cases, especially if it's just like you just need one quote from someone to fill in a gap, or like you need one person to respond to something or something like that, like where email is not out of the question. But I wouldn't do an entire story based on email interviews, I don't think. And I wouldn't probably even try to make that one of the main people talking in a story.
But it is kind of feeling it out and just seeing what the story needs. Like, you know, if it's like, say you were doing like a GTA 3 oral history and you got like 99% of those people to speak, but like Sam Houser was like, oh, I'll only talk to you over email. I think you're not going to just like not do that interview.
You just, you know, you have to use it in a certain way.
That makes sense. How do you decide what to keep and what to cut? You mentioned that with Final Fantasy VII, you had more than 30 interviewees.
So a lot of content ends up on the cutting room floor. How do you sort of make those edits? I guess it's a lengthy process, right?
It definitely surprised me how long it would take to edit these things. When I first started doing them, the Street Fighter one was the first one, and Final Fantasy and all that. I was expecting, once I had everything, I'd be like, great, I don't have to write anything.
I could just kind of let them do it for me and just edit this stuff together and put it out. It actually took quite a lot longer to edit those quotes together than it would have if I had just written the story, because it's this constant balance of, you need stuff that flows well, you need stuff that tells an accurate story, you need stuff that's informative and entertaining and all this stuff, and then you need stuff that flows from section to section to kind of tell this larger story. So it's never gonna be quite as precise and organized as a typical written story would be, but the closer you can get to that, usually the better it feels.
So yeah, it definitely takes a long time putting it all together, but that is a big part of the kind of the Design Room idea too, is just having these bonus stories attached to like the bigger oral histories, where we can use a lot of that leftover stuff, and you know, if someone tells a good anecdote, but it really doesn't affect the main story, or it just kind of feels like a tangent or something like that, then we can just kind of throw it into one of these bonus things. So that's kind of, that's a big part of kind of where the business model you're talking about came from.
But do you ever get an answer which you can't use just because it's like, someone's clearly got a horrible grudge and it's like incredibly bad vibes, or on the whole have people been like pretty nice when you've talked to them?
So I'm curious if you mean bad vibes towards me or towards like another person in the story.
No, towards the thing, like just you get someone who is like sour about their work experience or someone who just tells it very differently or is very frank about someone else who is also involved in the oral history process. I'm just kind of curious if you've ever like chatted to a disgruntled ex-employee.
Yeah, I mean I like showing when people disagree with each other. I think that's where some of the most interesting stuff comes from because I think a lot of the interviews that you see about games is very much usually like the producer or director talking most of the time and they usually tell one version of the story which is not necessarily how a lot of people on the team saw it. So, I like showing the different perspectives wherever I can.
But yeah, I mean I think that's also a tricky thing with like the oral history structure whereas like if you want it to flow then it works much better if people agree with each other.
Right.
Because it's like it's much more natural kind of like this person says this and this person says this and it's like there's kind of like a rhythm to it if they're agreeing with each other. Whereas when they're not it's very much like more like herky-jerky kind of stop and go. So it's always trying to find that balance and like the context and like the ethical part of it of like trying to present this stuff accurately as like the most important thing definitely makes some of those other questions kind of tricky sometimes because you want it to be everything all at once but it can't always be so like I'm more than aware that like sometimes there will be an awkward flow here or there but sometimes that's just the best way to do it.
So you kicked off the site with your Shadow of the Colossus piece and Fumito Ueda doesn't do that many interviews so when you're setting up a new outlet like you have I was curious what the process of landing an interview like that is just in the sense of you know I see me have a lot of these contacts built up from your years in media but how much explanation do you have to do of well here's what we're doing in order to get someone like that who doesn't do many interviews on board?
Yeah I mean I think it's basically because we've you know I didn't do that interview myself actually I worked with a freelancer who did it but it's a lot of that is just people that I've known over the years and not necessarily the people you're interviewing but like their right hand man or their like an interpreter who's familiar with them and that kind of thing so like it's I don't know I mean there's certainly a level of explanation when you're doing something new and you have to go in and say like hey this is you know similar to this thing I used to do here but it's actually this thing here like there was this other story that we're working on now that we had like pitched to somebody to participate in and they were like mistaken and they like they didn't understand they didn't read the the first message that clearly so they thought it was going to be a Polygon story and we had to like correct them and be like oh no this is actually for this new thing and that interview didn't actually work out I don't think it's because it wasn't for Polygon anymore but there's a little part of me that wonders That's so rude if that's true. It wouldn't surprise me especially when you're dealing with like PR companies who just have to kind of work by the numbers and get things settled that way. I would not blame them at all if they didn't want to participate in something for the new site versus a more established site but I think the times are changing in that regard too like I think 10 years ago if you were doing like an independent thing whether on YouTube or you know written or whatever else I think in some ways it might have been hard to get some of like the more established names to participate whereas now I think that kind of stuff is more common so I don't think this is as big a hurdle as maybe it used to be but I don't know I could be wrong.
Yeah that makes sense. I think the other thing I was curious about actually was whether you've ever had to abandon an oral history because you couldn't get enough people to speak on the record about something is that is that something you've ever encountered in pulling these together?
Oh yeah, all the time. Probably happened five times since I started the new site already. Sometimes that can mean it turns into a smaller story and it's just something based on one or two interviews or something like that.
Sometimes it just means it goes away altogether. There are stories that I haven't necessarily given up on because some of these things you just have to wait out people. Sometimes you have to wait till someone changes jobs before they can talk to you.
There are all kinds of weird politics and rules for why people may or may not want to speak for a story. There are stories that I want to do that I might just have to wait five or ten years until people are in a different situation before they can talk. Even from games that are from like 20 years ago.
It's weird sometimes how that stuff all works out. All the time. I don't necessarily want to do a story where it's just two or three people.
Sometimes it makes sense and that's great. But if I'm aiming for one of the bigger stories and I can't get as many people as I want, I will absolutely have to put that on the back burner and hopefully come back to it at some point. But maybe not.
You never know. I don't know how frequently that happens, but there are three games in my head right now that I probably shouldn't mention because they may happen at some point. But it's exactly what you're talking about.
I've gotten some people to talk, but not enough to make it what I want to make it yet.
Yeah. In my head, I always think when a couple of decades pass, what's the big deal with talking about these things? But something really recent that came to mind actually was Simon Parkin on his podcast asked Alexander O.
Smith about the behind the scenes of Final Fantasy XII. And no one will talk on the record about the drama that occurred behind the scenes there, for example. I just find it really interesting what they will or won't guard.
So I imagine you hit these cul-de-sacs quite a lot, by the sounds of it. So, yes. So I did want to ask a bit more about Ueda.
So, you know, you say that you didn't conduct the interview necessarily. But like, I suppose in planning the oral history, what were your kind of like focus areas? What did you what brief did you give the freelancer to focus on?
Yeah, so in that specific case, I basically wrote 90% of the questions he ended up asking because I needed it to fit with what everybody else was talking about. So I needed to like make sure that he comment on the same things that I was going to be asking the other people I was interviewing for that story about. And so like that kind of thing, it has to be much more rigid.
Like, there's different styles of interviewing people. And like, I think they're all valid. But like a typical thing that you might see on YouTube, it doesn't really have a structure.
It's just kind of like, let's start talking and see where it goes. And I think that can be it can lead to some very interesting moments. But for the kind of story that I was doing where it's like, I need to talk to them about like this specific time in the game's development and this specific aspect of like, you know, marketing it or bringing it to a different territory, that kind of thing.
Like, you have to be very specific with getting them to talk to the same points as everybody else. So yeah, in that case, I've interviewed Ueda before. I don't think I probably wouldn't have been able to if I had tried.
But it just kind of worked out easier to have a feeling to do it in this case. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think it's...
I think the structure of doing these oral histories makes it more rigid and more kind of organized, which in some cases is not always great because you don't necessarily get as many off topic things. But I mean, in the best case scenario, you'd do both. You'd have time to kind of make it more rigid and have time to kind of take these wild tangents.
But it just kind of depends on the situation.
Do you sort of saying, oh, you know, we went to Ada with these questions because we had the sort of shape of the piece. I was just curious, like, what was the start of the piece? You know, what was your big in?
I mean, because you know probably the standard beats of how a lot of these games have been developed. Like the general narrative is out there. Do you take that and go, well, let's drill deeper into this?
Or do you need someone to sort of, you know, give you the skinny first so that you can actually, you know, start building out that proper narrative? You know, I mean, it's a bit chicken and egg, I guess. But like, specifically with the Ueda piece there, you know, what can you talk about that process?
Yeah, so it's always one of those things where, like, I don't want to waste too much time covering territory that's always been covered. But at the same time, like, I don't necessarily know if I can trust what's out there on something. So, like, I have to kind of re-report that to make sure I kind of get it accurate.
So it's that balance, and that's what takes time. I think in this case, I wanted it, especially as like the first one of these for a new site, I wanted to be fairly traditional, so I wanted it to cover kind of like the history of how the game came about, and kind of like some of the more kind of well-known things. Like people know about the music for that game, but I still want to do a section on that and things like that.
I think it, yeah, so a little bit of that was probably influenced by it being the first stories for the site, and wanting it to feel kind of comprehensive in that way, where it would cover like a little bit of everything. And I don't necessarily think I'm gonna stick to that with every story, it'll depend. But yeah, I think there is a lot of value to re-reporting things that have been reported for, especially from games from 20 or 30 or 40 years ago, just because a lot of the stuff that's out there is not necessarily always based on like bad interviews, but just based on like limited interviews.
So you may see like an interview with like a one-sentence response to a question, and then people will assume that means something when actually it means something slightly different. And then that just becomes like what the game is known for, because like that's what people have said about it over the years. And so yeah, there's all these like stories of people getting things slightly wrong because they're based on old or translated or whatever else kind of interviews.
And so a lot of it is kind of trying to get the most accurate versions of that story just as a starting point and then kind of seeing where it can go from there. But it really depends on the story. Like it's not always going to be like, here is the story of the game.
It sometimes is going to be like, okay, here's, you know, this game is interesting for this other reason. So let's focus more on that. You know, I don't like the idea of everything being comprehensive because that usually means it's going to be kind of boring.
And so it's just kind of finding the middle ground between making it kind of cover a lot of ground, but also keeping it interesting.
So the thing I was going to ask about Ueda actually was when it comes to an interview like that, there's a lot of ground you can cover in terms of game specifics. Or you can talk about the general arc of the game or both at the same time. And I was wondering how you balance the things you're personally interested in about the game's development versus the needs of the article.
Do you ever kind of miss out on asking about something that you might really want to know about because it's not relevant to the piece?
Yeah, I mean, I think it really just comes down to how much time you have. I think in most of the interviews that I'm doing these days, fortunately, they're not part of like PR cycles. So you don't necessarily have the same like, oh, you have to fit everything in in this 15 minute window because it's part of like this junket that we're doing or whatever else.
Every now and then that kind of stuff will come up. But I think the more I've done like older games or games that are not currently being promoted, the less you have to worry about that because usually people have a little more time to talk. So, but yeah, I mean, it is always a balance.
I think it's just a question of finding kind of what's interesting and what feels like it needs to be reported. It's rare that I'll have something that like I really wanted to ask that I couldn't because usually I'll figure out a way to get that stuff up front just in case we don't have time for the rest. But it does happen.
Like there are times when like you're interviewing someone and they'll just ramble on for like half an hour about something. And like it's not necessarily bad, but it's like it's not really the story you're going to tell and you just you don't want to be rude and interrupt. So it kind of depends on the situation.
I thought like a really interesting narrative that or like the narrative that emerged for me from the Shadow of the Colossus piece was the way Ueda works and the way that Sony interacted with Ueda throughout that game's development and the way Ueda was protected by his own producer throughout that development. That kind of felt like the the narrative that emerged there. I was wondering just based on I guess like I just want to ask you a bit about about that and does it make sense to you why Ueda's games take so long to make?
To a degree I wouldn't pretend to know you know the majority of what happens behind the scenes there. I think Ueda in particular is not the most open person in terms of how he does interviews too. He's happy to talk a lot of time but he doesn't always like go into like super in-depth detail about kind of his thought process and stuff like that.
So I think that it's partially kind of what you see in the games to that kind of minimalism idea. I'm guessing there's a connection there. But yeah, I mean, I think there was a quote in there.
He was talking about how he would like try to like fool Sony by you know, showing them that things were further along than they actually were. Like that felt like the best quote in the story to me because like, you know, that's what people kind of assume they were when they would show things to the public and they see trailers and stuff like that. That was, you know, like Last Guardian's debut trailer.
They just looked like beautiful and gorgeous and just, you know, turned out it was not something that was really practical for many, many years. I feel like any game that takes 10 years to make that has dozens, if not probably hundreds of people on it with some of the more recent stuff, I can't pretend to really know even like interviewing everybody exactly what happened because there's just so many little decisions made along the way, like so many hundreds of things that happen every day that I'm not sure I can really say because that's why things take 10 years. But it wouldn't surprise me if there's some connection between what you're talking about.
I thought it was quite interesting both in the Final Fantasy VII piece and the Oeda piece that you talk a lot about the... Or you get people to talk a lot about the actual kind of creative process and what the people who really made the game are up to. But at the same time, you do take the time to talk to people about the machinery around games, like marketing and the release and the kind of complete story.
And I wonder, is that driven by a desire to be comprehensive or are you personally, are you equally interested in every part of that process? That brings a game to our hands.
Yeah, that's very much like the kind of the structure of the oral history format that I like to do. It's like having people who have different perspectives, who can all kind of speak to something. I think there's value too to showing that like not everything is not made by one person and you should be able to see these different perspectives.
But like just on a pure like editing level, like having people who disagree or having people who are in different offices or have different kind of memories of something makes it much more interesting to show like the back and forth of like, oh, this person thought it was this way. This person thought it was that way. Like a lot of times that'll play into like how I choose stories too.
Like if there's a game that was developed by two companies at the same time, showing the how one company's kind of general ideas about a game were versus like another company's, like that's going to make a more interesting back and forth in a lot of cases. So like sometimes, yeah, I'll have stories where I talk to like the people in the US marketing side, a US like sales team or something like that, and kind of contrast that with the development team's perspectives. I think that's where a lot of the most interesting stories come from in terms of this format and you know what I'm trying to do.
Do you have any like Oral Histories of White Whales or things that you just think might just never happen? I'm thinking probably like, you know, Nintendo are just so locked down and their staff there are largely lifers. You know, they never leave.
So they never, you know, they're never free of all the NDAs they must be under. I mean, I'm personally a huge Nintendo head, so that's where my mind would go. But yeah, I'm kind of curious for you what I like the, if you could just crack something wide open, what would it be?
Yeah, I have had that thought about, like, especially like the original Super Mario Brothers, it seems like it would be a perfect game for this. But like Nintendo, I think when Nintendo does choose to talk, they like, like Miyamoto does an interview with like some mainstream or something like that. Like, those are really good interviews and like, you know, very thoughtful and, you know, get into like a lot of details.
But like, yeah, like you say, they never really get the whole team to talk. You wouldn't, like, I mean, even short of like a like an Iwata Asks.
Oh, we love a What Are Us sort of thing. I'm fucking obsessed with a What Are Us. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, for sure. And I would love to see as much of that as possible. But I think even on those, they don't necessarily get into like everyone who was on a team that, you know, you might get three or four people in like the best case scenario.
And so, yeah, I think Nintendo is very hard to crack, like you say, in that way. Do I have one? Not really.
There's like three or four that I'm still trying to pull together now, like I was saying earlier, that have, I've gotten part of the way there that I haven't really been able to kind of like crack and be sure they're gonna happen. And I don't really want to jinx them by naming them. But like, yeah, like I think, you know, Super Mario Bros.
would be a good one. I think, yeah, like one of the GTAs would probably make sense in that look. Fortnite would probably be interesting too, like Epic has done, like, I'm pretty sure Epic made a decision once Fortnite got popular to like, to shut down most of the interviews that was doing that because it was probably worried about being sued or something like that.
I'm just guessing. But yeah, I think there's a lot of kind of obvious stuff like that. I like the obscure stuff too, like a couple of things I'm working on now are very obscure.
Like there's one that's like a canceled game from 30 years ago, and there's one that's a really bad game, most people would say from about 30 years ago. And I think those to me are in many ways just as interesting. I have to kind of balance not trying to do all of that, because I still want people to actually click these things and look at the website.
But I am very much trying to do what interests me. So some of it is going to be more obscure like that, and some of it's going to be more kind of mainstream.
Damn, Oral History of Bubsy 3D, I never thought it would happen, but here we are.
Hey, they re-released that, I mean.
Yeah, absolutely. So I would love to hear what you've got coming up on Design Room, because you published a piece on ResInfinite recently, and I think that's part of a larger series. So can you talk about what the near future of the site looks like?
Yeah, it's funny. So I'm wanting to establish this site as a place that hosts these big oral histories, but it just worked out that the second thing we're doing is a series of smaller stories instead of a big one, just because it worked out that way. But yeah, so this is a series on music games and that's kind of loosely defined, just because a few of the stories I was looking at happened to be music games, and it just made sense to kind of connect them together.
So yeah, the Resident Infinite one is up. That's basically a story about the Area X level that they did, and how it basically has, like how they've been positioning it as like a quote unquote prologue, and like a game that's getting ready for its full version, that they've never kind of gotten around to making it after nine years. So it's kind of just talking to them about that.
And then, yeah, so the second one, which I don't know exactly when this is going up, and when the article is going up, it may be up by now, it may not, is a story on Toshio Owai, who was the guy who created the game Electroplankton, and there was another game he worked on called Sound Fantasy. It's more of like a profile. It's not even really like a traditional oral history structure, which is partly why I wanted to kind of put it in this package of things.
But it's, yeah, it's kind of, it has a fun story there because like he, so I'm in San Francisco, and he had actually, like I think about 30 years ago, he had done like an installation at this science and technology museum nearby that they kind of like brought him back for somewhat recently to talk about or to do like a newer version of or something like that. So anyway, that kind of caught my eye, and then we reached out to the Exploratorium people, and they were able to kind of get us in touch. So that's a good, interesting story, just because like he had a pretty rough relationship with Nintendo because they canceled the first game that he worked on with them.
Electropankton was kind of like where he came around and was like, yeah, but we're friends again now. So yeah, it's a good story there.
I don't think he ever got in a Watta Asks, that guy.
So I think it might have been before they were doing the Watta Asks. There was like a press event that they had done with, I think it was with Iwata and maybe Miyamoto and him at Harajuku, I believe, many years ago, where they kind of had a similar kind of discussion, but only like bits and pieces of that have gotten online. I don't think it's like the whole transcript of it.
But anyway, so yeah, that's the second story in the series. And then third story is going to be on Sayonara Wild Hearts. There's one song in that game that I love, that I'm just kind of doing the whole story around kind of the making of one particular song.
Because this is very much like trying to experiment with different formats. Like the Resident Infinite story was like a smaller version of a big oral history. And then the Hawaii story is more like a profile that is more of a traditionally written feature.
And then the Sayonara Wild Hearts thing is like, well, what if we did a story that is like on a very specific angle rather than kind of a broader look at a game. And there may be another story in the music package, but I'm not actually sure if that's happening or not. So we will see on that one.
But yeah. That's really cool. I can't wait to read all those stats.
That's awesome. I guess this is a complete left turn really, but we do ask people with long backgrounds in journalism if they have any kind of like interesting anecdotes to share from their years covering games, whether it's a strange or interesting press trip or a particularly memorable developer interview. I don't know if you have anything like that to share, Matt, but I did want to ask the question just in case.
Man, I've probably got a lot of these, but it's hard on the spot. Let's see. Okay, so this is actually a story I told recently, but I can tell it again.
They're doing an EGM book that I just came up in an interview for that. So if I'm repeating it, actually it's not a problem because you guys will have this posted well before they work.
Nice.
So there was a game, remember there was an Afterburner PSP game that Planet Moon had done, the team based in San Francisco?
Isabel, yeah.
Which is unusual because yeah, they had become known as a PSP developer at the time, they were doing some other games there. So I guess that's probably how they got connected to it. Anyway, I had done a bunch of Planet Moon coverage because I liked that team, I like some of the other games they had done and they were local.
So I had gone over to their office a couple of times, I think maybe once, I don't remember. Anyway, I had done a bunch of coverage. So I was their main point of contact within our company for that game.
So then when the reviews came out, the EGMs, EGM would do I think three or four reviews at a time, and one of the reviews was a three. So the way reviews would leak out back then, they would show up on a forum or something like that before the actual magazine we get out there. So the reviews leaked out, and the head of the company noticed this and was like, I think he was like, he didn't believe it.
He was like, this can't be real. So he called me one day just to like, basically just to find out if it was real, which was totally fine. But the fun part about this was like, so I used to live in the East Bay.
So we would take this train that would literally go underwater before it would come up into San Francisco to where our office was. And he called me when I'm on the train, and I probably shouldn't have picked up because I knew that I was going to go underwater in about 15 seconds or 20 seconds or something like that. So then he's asking me about this and I'm like, it's like, you know, I want to take it very seriously and be kind of like sympathetic to it.
And I'm kind of like, oh, yeah, that is real. And I was starting to explain it. But then as soon as I started trying to explain it, the phone cut out.
And I had no way of calling him back for the next 15 or 20 minutes or something like that. So, yeah, I always felt kind of bad about that. When I got back to the, like, back above ground, I tried calling him back and he didn't pick up.
And, yeah, we've never really talked about it since. So I've always felt bad about that one. But, yeah, you know, sometimes that's how it goes with reviews and just how they play out.
I thought you were going to say that he started, like, bollocking you over the phone just as he went underwater. And he was still doing it when he came out the other side. Just the 20 minutes screed.
We have had those before. Like, there was one instance where someone was... They were, like, calling to complain about...
I don't remember the specifics of what they were complaining about. But then, like, as they were on the phone having that conversation, they were, like, typing. And you could see in, like, your instant messenger, like, I'm sorry, my boss is making me do this.
They need to hear me saying these things. So it's all kind of politics sometimes.
That's interesting. I mean, hey, after Burn a Black Falcon still got 7.9 from IGN. So, you know, it wasn't all bad for those guys at that time.
But I remember liking it. Although I do think they went out of business shortly thereafter, if I'm not mistaken.
That's tough. I don't think we can attribute that entirely to the review. So, yeah.
No, no, no.
You could do an oral history and find out.
Yeah, I'd be into that.
Thanks so much for your time, Matt. Where can people get you on social media? And just remind people again where they can find the site in your work.
Yeah, thank you. Yeah, it's designroom.site is the website. There's also a Blue Sky account, designroom.bsky.social that covers most of the highlights.
I am on there as well. If you look me up, I think it is mattleone.bsky.social, if I'm not mistaken. But yeah, the website is designroom, and there's a newsletter that is free or there's paid subscription options.
And any and all of that is super helpful if you want to check it out. So, yeah.
Awesome. Yeah, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky, and what was the other one? Letterboxd. Yes.
I wonder if we should briefly mention that you're in the next Profound Waste of Time issue that's kick-starting now. Is that worth pointing out on this podcast?
Yeah. It was funny actually talking to them about all this work you've done, building these massive stories and writing the profile pieces. And I've actually not done a huge amount of that like in my own journalistic career.
You know, I was mostly a trad sort of news previews, reviews kind of guy. But I have written a couple of longer profile pieces for a Profound Waste of Time. I did one for Shootakumi about Ace Attorney.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I read it. I loved it.
Oh, thanks. A couple of years ago. Yeah, and I've just done one about Kadaka, the creator of Danganronpa and the 100 line.
And yeah, that's going to be in the next issue, Volume 6. But yeah, it was just that interesting, that idea of like, you know, when we were talking about kind of going in with what you want to know versus, you know, what's going to maybe make like a more well-rounded piece or kind of how to frame some of these stories. And, you know, because it's quite a niche concern really.
And, you know, I'm super into his work and I've played, you know, all his games, know them very well. But the kind of slight tug of war between wanting to delve in to all the things I might want to know versus telling a story like everyone can enjoy and like maybe introducing people to his work through the piece if they're not familiar with him. And yeah, it's just a big help having the stuff you've done to read and, you know, it's definitely borrowed some tricks from that.
So, yeah, there you go. That was all very neat. What a neat bow to tie on the episode.
That is very nice. Yeah, I mean, it always it always bugs me when I see people interviewed and like they're asked like the exact same questions in like 50 different places. So, yeah, yeah, I appreciate when people get past that kind of threshold.
I did do a bit of that. There were, I was absolutely mortified at one point where I asked him something sort of fishing for something which I sort of already knew. And he did kind of call me out on it a bit in terms of saying like, oh, I think I think you you probably want this right.
And I was like, you know, I don't normally do that. But yeah, that was that was the only really embarrassing bit of that. Of this, this where you just saw through my bullshit.
So I won't be doing that again.
Sometimes playing dumb can get you good answers too.
Yeah.
And you know, I just think there are, I don't know if you read an anecdote that someone told, you've read once in an interview 20 years ago, and it was kind of, you know, passed over quite quickly and you think, oh, well, maybe there's more to be said about that or we can go into that. And yeah, I just think sometimes you don't realize what's, what is interesting or super boring to some of these people. And yeah, I think I was just unlucky and managed to hit one of the danger words or something.
So yeah, it was good.
Yeah. I mean, for me too, it's very valuable to not present myself as knowing everything because I want them to kind of like tell the story in their words. If they skip the first half because they assume I know that, then I'm not going to be able to print that as like the full story for people too.
Yeah. Well, I'm glad that even with all your interviewing experience, you still run into this because yeah, it's terrible. They're like, oh, but you already know this.
And I'm like, oh man, I screwed up. I didn't. I should have dumbed down.
Yeah. Let's just pretend I'm an idiot. That's how I should open up every interview.
Yeah. That piece will be out. I mean, I guess when A Profound Waste of Time, Volume 6 is out, so end of next year.
So, yeah, people have a long time to anticipate it, I guess.
Yeah.
All the oral histories you have done in that time. I can't wait to see them.
Awesome. Samuel W. Roberts and social media, the podcast is at Back Page Pod, patreon.com/backpagepod, if you'd like to support us and get additional podcasts every month.
I'll thank Matt again for his time. And yeah, thanks so much and see you soon. Bye bye.
Goodbye.
