Hello and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, because I had to go and get a haircut before this episode recording, I'm wearing trousers. That's my trick to you for this week. So we did it, gang.
Maybe that should be next Patreon stretch goal, three grand. I'll wear trousers to every episode instead of it being horribly ambiguous for the listeners.
I mean, there's no proof of this, of course, so you could be wearing anything right now, just saying this.
No, I could provide like photographic evidence in each sort of Patreon post, you know, just a picture of me recording the episode with today's newspaper and going like, there I am, wearing trousers, you know.
Like you've kidnapped yourself.
And I keep photoshopping the newspaper in so it gets less and less convincing each time. But yes, they're wearing trousers, so a little treat for you there. So yes, good.
How are things going with you? How has your week been? You're having a busy time at the moment, aren't you?
We don't talk quite as much at the moment.
Yeah, yeah, it's very busy. Lots of games coming out, lots of stuff going on. As we all know, all the games now come out in February and March instead of like October when it used to happen.
So you come back. I mean, it's great. It's really exciting.
You get all this like big sort of buzzy stuff to play. But yeah, they're also like mammoth. It's like everything's a big RPG or JRPG or life service game.
And just keeping on top of it is it's hard work. But I am I'm at least I'm out the freelance zone like a big cloud is lifted.
That'll be welcome news, I'm sure, for the commissioning editor listening to this episode back. So yeah. Yeah.
You're big hell divers too, guys. Is that is that taken off you?
Yeah, I don't mind.
Actually, it's good.
It's quite a funny arc that gamers had, you know, the first one, this arcade quite throwaway thing that they've obviously like pumped up into something slightly more substantial, bring their team to do that. This is hell divers for people who don't know it. The first game was like a top down co-op, not quite twin stick shooter, kind of that energy, but had had some some quite strange systems to it, kind of Starship Troopers style bug blasting with that kind of satirical edge where you can kind of kill yourself very easily by mistake.
Like, friendly fires always on things like that and now they've turned it into this third person over the shoulder, you know, 3D, quite glossy shooter. Not a 70 quid PS5 game, I think it's like 40 quid, but yeah, the little kind of arcade-y thing that could has had a shot at like the big time.
Yeah, it's interesting because I was led to believe by the discourse that people didn't like live service games. That was about nine days ago, but people really like this one, but it doesn't cool.
This service thing, it's become quite an unhelpful label. At the heart of this game, it's a throwaway arcade shooter. It has live service elements in that there are updates coming to it over time and the battles you take part in, there's like a communal flow to the universe or the galaxy in it in that, you know, every fight you win, you're kind of taking over planets and they can kind of shape a bigger narrative around that.
But if you didn't know that, you'd just go in and go, oh, it's a game where I'll just drop in and shoot some bugs for half an hour every once in a while and I think that's absolutely fine.
Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, it's been, it does look cool, actually, sort of like, I thought the trailer they rolled out, that state of play looked really, really impressive. I was sort of weighing up getting it on PC or PS5, so I've gotten PS5, I have to restart PS Plus, which I've not had for about three years, and I'm not sort of like, not dying to do that because I don't have anything else multiplayer on there, but yeah, I don't know, it is tempting because it does seem like it's captured everyone's attention for the moment.
So yeah, it's a much bigger deal than I think people thought it would be. So yeah, another surprise to kick off the year.
Absolutely.
Okay, so Matthew, we're doing another Mailbag episode. So as promised slash threatened at the start of this year, we're going to try and like balance out our pod schedule with shorter episodes to accommodate the sort of like demands of making the podcast basically just sort of long term. This is how we can do it and sort of stay sane.
So we're actually recording this and our Excel episode for the Patreon folks on the same morning. So we're working on what we recorded first. So that'll be that'll be fun for the listeners.
Yeah, it's very intense for us.
To do that. Hey, that's insane. They just did a 20th anniversary thing for that at the BFI.
I kind of wish I'd gone to that. But it's not like I'm short of opportunity to see David Mitchell doing stuff, is it though, on British TV. So yeah, but are you a big Peepshow guy, Matthew?
I've only really seen series one, which I loved and rewatched endlessly and then for some reason never watched the rest of it.
But you're in Peepshow, you're one of the main characters, as am I. How could you have avoided it? I don't understand.
Yeah, it was just too real. One of those things where you're watching and you're like, why do I like this so much? And then you're like, oh, you're just seeing yourself reflected in the TV.
It's like one of those quite nice posts where people are like, I love to see myself in pop culture. It's like nice to be finally represented on TV.
Yeah, it's funny as well because I think I knew about 18 people who, when Kirby enthusiasm got popular in the UK in the mid-naughties, were like, oh, I'm just like Larry David. And people would say that to me as well. Like, oh, you're just like Larry David.
I'm like, that's too complimentary. He's sort of like a genius screenwriter and probably a billionaire living in Los Angeles and occasionally has like, you know, a sort of, well, occasionally a strangle elbow, which was actually quite funny, I thought.
But they're probably referring to the fact that, surely they're referring to the fact that he's often a massive shit.
Yeah, well, that's it. But then you watch Peep Show and you're like, oh, no, that's actually me. And then like, and then you feel too perceived and you just have to stop watching it.
In fact, that's the thing. I think I stopped watching Peep Show after a certain point because I didn't like looking in the mirror. That was kind of like what happened with that show for me.
So I mean, the boring answer is it was on at the same time that I was working at Homebase.
So yes, more Homebase lore there. So that's the wiki, everyone. That's important information.
And so as I was saying anyway, the mailbag, we're doing a few more of these this year. So unlike the last one, which had big early January pure chaos energy and was like, I thought I think I even said to you, this is the worst episode we've ever done. The listeners quite liked it.
And so, you know, on we go with another one. But this one, we've actually prepared a bit more for, is that fair, Matthew?
A little bit more.
Yeah. And there are more video game questions in here as well. So yeah, it will stimulate us in some slightly different ways.
Although I did add a question that I was just, I spent 20 minutes trying to come up with an answer for and realise I just failed to do that because it was so fucking hard. So that was good. I don't know why I put that in the plan, really.
That was on me. But all these fun things lie ahead. So Matthew, do you want to read this first one?
Yes. Dear lads, what are some game console purchases that held a hidden cost for you to find out later once you'd bought them? Much like Samuel was influenced by Ashley into buying some Sega consoles, I've been influenced to purchase a Quest 2, rationalising that it was the cheaper option, less risk, only to find out that the Oculus Link cable is $80, which I need since my router is on the other side of the house.
On top of the elite strap, $50, which I knew about, this is minimising any savings I stupidly convinced myself I was getting, all to play a probably flawed version of Half-Life Alex and Lone Echo. Hope others can learn from my example. Keep up the good potwork on the podcast.
That's from Mouse Eats Cat. Hmm, that's a different name, I've not heard that one before.
Yeah, that's a bit different, isn't it, unless it's just like, you know, Balladeer, but he changed his name or whatever, but yeah, can't rule it out, can you? So yeah, so the Oculus Link cable, you don't actually have to pay for that one, you just need any, I think it's USB 3.0 or something like that, you just need a cable like that. So I bought a much cheaper one than that.
So could have saved yourself a bit of money there, but the funny actually, because when it comes to the VR headset, I actually haven't bought any extra bits and pieces for it. I actually think it is quite, maybe it's because the strap is slightly better with the Quest 3, but I just haven't bothered buying the additional accessories for it. So yeah, I don't feel like it's that bad, but I do see the point, because a lot of people talk about buying an additional battery pack and make it run a little bit longer and that sort of stuff.
But yeah, so got a few answers to this. Let me tell you about buying retro hardware in 2024. So as people know, I bought a Dreamcast and I bought a Sega Saturn.
I've not tried the Saturn yet because I'm still waiting for a cable that plugs into my TV. That's about a month away, unfortunately. But the Dreamcast does work, so I've been playing that.
And I've realized that there's a lot of hidden costs to buying these. So for the Saturn, the seller was like, oh yeah, you're going to need a step-down transformer to run it because it's a Japanese Saturn. I was like, right, okay, I'll buy one of those.
They're fucking gigantic, so the price you pay is not just the 20 quid or so to get one. It's the actual space they take up. So I got that now to carry with me for the rest of my life, so that's good.
I had to buy a bespoke cable to make it run sort of HDMI because it wasn't built into it. So I could just plug it in via an older cable, but I know it will look ass on a 4K TV. So I bought a fancy cable, which is about 60 quid.
So that's like almost 100 quid extra there, gone down the drain, good stuff. And then for the Dreamcast, I booted my second game and the VMU I bought, it was like, I think there's something like 200 blocks on a VMU, right? And so I turned on GTA 2 and it was like, you need 94 blocks to play this game.
And I was like, right, okay, so you have to buy like fucking 80 VMUs to like just save your games on basically, because I heard as well that Shenmue takes up 80 blocks, the original. So, those two games alone take up just a massive amount of space and I was like, okay, I feel like I'm being had here by big Dreamcast, you know, the Dreamcast heads have swindled me.
The Dreamcast heads don't talk about that when they're bollocking on about, you know, whatever.
Bass fishing, Sega bass fishing, yeah. I am enjoying the console generally, like it looks quite nice with the HDMI mod and the TV, although it's having a couple of issues to, I don't know if it's like looking as nice as it can look, but it looks pretty good. So it's decent, but then yeah, that's so I'm getting, I bought like a four times VMU kind of memory card thing, and that was like another 40 quid down the drain.
So we're talking about hidden costs, old Sega hardware, Jesus Christ.
So I've not really been able to get a proper read on how you're feeling about the Dreamcast. You know, I know that you've boosted up and played a little bit of it compared to like what you imagined the experience was going to be like when you were buying it and the experience you're now having. How are those things kind of working out?
So I actually really like it because I don't have to buy games for it because it's basically like it's called GDMU, it's built into the thing and it came with an SD card that an older boy downloaded a load of games presumably and put them on there. So I'm just the man in the middle. I've done none of that business.
So the cops want its details, give me a shout, obviously I bought it off eBay. So do you think Sega are going to Gary Bowser that guy? I assume it would be Gary Big the Cat they'd send around instead, Matthew.
Gary Big the Cat. Oh, imagine if you had to give all our Patreon earnings to Sega to pay off your pirated Dreamcast.
But I didn't pirate anything. There's some other guy did. Yeah, so I'm innocent.
But yeah, so you've got basically all the games you would probably want out of the box. So that's good. The HDMI cable thing means that it's easy to plug into modern hardware.
That's good. Memory card thing did really annoy me. I'm slightly mixed on it so far.
What it reminds me of actually is having a GameCube in the modern age as well because I got that. Tim Clark came on the pod previously. I took his GameCube when he left the UK a few years ago.
Well, 10 years ago now, I guess. I took that and I have a component cable for it so it looks not amazing on my TV but it looks okay on my TV so I can play. I was playing Rogue Leader ahead of that whatever episode we did where that came up, 2002.
It's a bit like that, I think, where I'm going to probably get it out of the cupboard every two to three months, have a little spin on it, put it away again probably. The thing I really wanted to do, and you're going to really hate this, I want to have an authentic playing the original Shenmue experience, so that's what I'm going to do.
I don't hate that. In fact, that's one of the few things where I think, oh yeah, that would be good.
Yeah, exactly. I think as well, there was something a bit off about the HD version of Shenmue. It was a little bit too crisped up and the parts looked old as hell, and I think it kind of makes sense when you got the original hardware.
Maybe that'll prove to be wrong, but I don't think so. So that's kind of how it's going so far. I played a bit of Virtua Tennis, that was very good.
I played a bit of Metropolis 3, so that was excellent. I started that horror game D2, which I do want to talk about at some point, because that's like a proper cult classic that people talk about. But it is like a parallel timeline where I never got a PS2, and I was probably quite sad about it, but I was really stubborn about these games being good, which is what I imagine most of the Dreamcast heads are.
They're people who didn't play GTA 3 and were like, but guess what, having Sega Bass Fishing is just as good.
I think Ash Day is just too good an advocate for it. Listening to that episode when we were recording it, he was really selling that thing hard and selling the Dream hard, and it seemed really exciting. So I can understand why lots of people would want to have these experiences after that episode.
He was selling the Dreamcast like Peter Moore was in 1999. It was the same sort of energy really.
I was looking forward to our end of year Game of Year episode, where one of your 10 best games of 2024 is Blue Stinger, because you haven't had time to play any new games playing Dreamcast.
Don't worry, I'm not going to do that because I know it will be incredibly irritating. I did watch the opening crawl to Blue Stinger, and it was about four paragraphs of text, then it went dot, dot, dot on Dinosaur Island. This is definitely a late 90s game, so that's good.
But yeah, I will definitely play 10 games this year, don't worry. I mean, so far, I did make the proclamation that I was going to try and play some more older games this year, but so far, I've honestly just been playing Midnight Suns and Prince of Persia this year. That's taken up plenty of my time.
Midnight Suns is an old game.
Yeah, that is true. What, 14 months old? Wow, that's ancient, basically retro game, isn't it?
Back to the question anyway, those are some parts. What do you make of the Me buying a Sega thing? Do you feel like you're watching it in a Louis Theroux sort of, how is it going to go wrong kind of way?
No, I was hoping that it was going to be this explosion of like, holy shit, this is the best thing I've ever got. I was nowhere near as close to getting one as you are, clearly. But after that episode, it was kind of teetering where like, I was sort of saying to myself, if Samuel gets this and it really like knocks his socks off, maybe I'll look into a similar thing.
You know, I'll let you kind of test the waters. And so far, I'm not really feeling it. Because it's basically you putting up a very blurry picture of crazy taxi and then going, and I have to buy all these fucking peripherals.
And I was like, well, dodged a bullet there, goes back to playing incredible AAA 2024 game.
Yeah, that's the thing. It's sort of like crazy taxi does look a little bit blurry, I guess. But yeah, it's sort of like it's the jagged edges that do me in, actually.
I'm sort of like, I can't work out if it's the way I'm outputting the software. That's just what it looks like because it's old. It's yeah, it's a real.
But I have this with the stuff I already own. Occasionally, I'll get this hankering of like, oh, yeah, let's plug in the Wii and let's play a bit of Mario Galaxy or Mario Galaxy 2, that would be good. And then finding the Wii, finding all the parts, plugging it into the TV, finding a spare plug socket for it.
All of that stuff is like sapping my interest in that initial idea. And then I get to it and it looks fucking horrible on my TV. And you're like, yeah, I hate this.
And then back from the atekit goes, I just know it would be like that, except there are hundreds of pounds involved.
Yeah, that is true. And the other thing is, though, that I just, the thing I just can't get seem to get working is the progressive scan mode on it just seems to make my TV go blank. And I just can't work out how to, that's meant to be like the, the thing they put in it to sort of make it do something amazing.
But I just won't, it does not seem to work. So I'm stuck in 480i mode, which is the cursed resolution for old games. So it does look a bit nicer than the GameCube does actually, like the display, I think just being plugged in via HDMI makes it look nicer.
So yeah, anyway, go on.
My equivalent of this is when I bought a modded Blu-ray player so that I could play Japanese Blu-ray, so I could watch adaptations of Higashino books that I was importing. And they all looked terrible.
Amazing.
That was literally my version of this.
I had four specific things I wanted to watch and spent many, many monies on that.
Yeah. There's a few others here as well. So the original Xbox DVD remote was an all-timer for this.
So you couldn't play DVDs out of the box. You needed to buy the remote separately to make it work, which is a bold decision after the PS2 launched with a DVD player built in that didn't need to do that. I don't know why they did that.
That seemed like a bad idea. So they did that. There was also the 360, needed the Wi-Fi dongle, which I kind of got because they were...
It's 2005. There's a little bit before Wi-Fi sort of everywhere, but buying that was quite annoying. My dad even went to the trouble of getting it.
I was like, that's quite cursed. You have to have this thing stuck on the back of your 360 to make it connect to your router. Such as it is.
Any other examples, Matthew?
This is a super obvious one, but when you work on games magazines and you have access to everything in the office, you forget that your own version isn't necessarily going to have it. So going from the office where we had a Wii and four remotes and four nunchucks to being at home getting Wii on launch weekend and then being like, hey, everyone, let's have all these experiences that I've been having in the office. And you're like, oh, no.
You know, I bought a second remote. I didn't have a second nunchuck. You know, all this kind of stuff.
So there are a lot of hidden costs with the with the Wii with regards to that. I mean, just general, the thing you're saying about the 360 there, like every console came with some bullshit. The one that really got me and to this day, I still think was incredibly cheap was when they didn't put in HDMI cables with the HD generation consoles.
Like PlayStation 3 didn't come with an HDMI. You had to go and buy one. So I got one for Christmas.
Didn't have any means of connecting it into the TV and actually seeing what Uncharted 2 looked like. So then had to wait a day and go and, you know, go and face fucking Winchester on Boxing Day sales, go to Curry's or Dixon's or whatever to get an HDMI cable. Like that's, I'd say that's like a key part of what you're selling that machine on.
It's absolutely ridiculous to just give it a component cable.
Oh, fun times.
Things are so much better now. Like you just get everything and you're like, that's it. No more bullshit needed.
Yeah, that is the thing. It's sort of like, it is very appealing to get retro hardware, but you realize so much of that community is built around how can I make this not look like ass? And then the answer will be something like, something absurdly intricate like the, like the retro tink sort of setup you get where you spend, like, I think 300 quid to get some board that you plug it all into and then it goes into your TV and you're like, it's cool that people have come up with solutions for this stuff, but yeah, it's much better to just have plug-in any, literally any modern device to your TV and it just works straight away.
So, damn. Oh, well, the pre-HD times, man, much more cursed. So, yeah.
Okay, next question from Graham S. Which place and time period would you get Ryugu Gakutaku, sorry, I can't never fucking say this, they're like a dragon studio to recreate in detail so you can walk around and look at things and have feelings about them. Matthew, I came up with Soho in the Jack the Ripper times, which I realize was kind of done in Assassin's Creed, but a bit sort of like, a bit gentler in Assassin's Creed.
I kind of want that, like, Whitechapel, or sort of Soho to kind of like Whitechapel sort of area of London, do you know what I mean? Where you get a big chunk of, sort of like the getaway sort of like, bit of London basically. I guess that's a bit bigger than they tend to do, isn't it?
But it's not that large an area. Now that I work in London, I realize that there's not that much London, really, in like central London. So you can sort of like walk across it in about an hour and a half, you know what I mean?
It's not that massive, so yeah, yeah.
Oh, right. What feelings would you have? What feelings do you want to have exploring Jack the Ripper era?
So, what I just thought it could be like a detective game, you know? You know, I don't know.
I wondered if he was going for like, you know, the nostalgia element, which seems to be quite key to the Yakuza games. I picked, less exotically, Basingstoke circa 1997.
For fuck's sake.
Well, this is... I was thinking more in terms of exploring a city in a particular time as you do in, in like Yakuza 0, for example, just to be able to wander around Basingstoke as it was in my childhood and see like shops that don't just don't exist anymore. I want to go into a Woolworths.
I want to go into an hour price. I want to take a trip to the newly opened Blockbuster on the outskirts of town. And actually like a Yakuza game, you'd be able to like rent Mega Drive games there and play them back at your house.
So it would still have that retro game. It would actually fit the model they've created quite nicely.
Yeah, I like that. I mean, would you have to accommodate for all the games they sold in that shop at that time? It's like, oh, this is arduous.
I'm going to play Microsoft Flight Simulator sort of 98 on this thing.
Blockbuster definitely rented, like, you know, PlayStation games, Mega Drive games, SNES games. So you'd have, I mean, this wouldn't be a Sega game, I'm assuming. This is going to have a lot of games on it.
I mean, the Blockbuster, that's just a little part of it. I really want to walk around the centre of Basingstoke. I want to maybe go to, I don't know what it is now, but it used to be like a Warner cinema on the outskirts of town.
I think it got turned into something else, maybe something.
Warner Village, did it become a view? That's what happened.
Yeah, maybe that's it, yeah. But like go back there and just imagine the smell of that popcorn and the excitement of going to see rescuers down under as a wee lad.
God, this is such a myopic answer to this question.
This is what the question was.
It said, it said, where would you like to walk around and have feelings? I would have feelings about that.
You would get the studio that made Lost Judgment and Like A Dragon to make Basingstoke in 1997 of all the places you could do. You wouldn't do even like Gangs of New York era New York. I guess New York's very tired.
But that's, yeah, but there, I don't know. I have no connection to that. That's too far back.
I want to, I want to see like a vaguely contemporary version of, of, of England that I've lived in.
That's interesting.
I don't know. I just don't like, I, it just shows how, how we differ as people. Like I want to see an hour price.
You want to see the hacked up remains of a sex worker in SoHo. That's just how it goes.
I don't want to see that to be clear. I don't want to, I don't, that's not something I'm hankering for. I'm just saying the vibes would be appropriate.
But I would say the risk of seeing that is very high in that place at that time.
I suppose so, yeah, yeah. But I don't know, I feel like the sort of like closest I've seen something like this happen is LA. Noire, right, where it's a setting that I was genuinely curious about.
Oh, I see, I get that.
They did that sort of forensic, well, literally forensic, but just really sort of like detailed recreation of the time and place and capture the atmosphere. And that's the sort of thing you want. You want that sort of like transported feeling.
But then I kind of get what you mean. Like, tempted to do chunks of Portsmouth, now you've mentioned it. Gunwolf Keys.
Come on. You want to see it, right?
Yeah. But I'm trying to think as well, what would the fights be in Jack the Ripper times? It'd be like, bobbies.
And then like just loads of police officers turn up and you just start slapping them around. I don't know. But Gunwolf Keys, it would be like, you have to be up lots of like 15 year olds sort of like spotty boys who would just like put down their sort of powerade and then just try and deck you basically.
If you do like 2002 era Gunwolf Keys, yeah, just pop into the into the sort of like Cadbury's sort of like Cadbury's shop for some misshapes. All that stuff. Go and get an overpriced sausage roll.
Great times. I don't think I'd be doing any combat because I guess in my imagined game, I am, you know, 12 or whatever and I'm going around this place probably with my dad. So if anything, the game is more like my dad's trying to steer us away from people that he's identified as maybe being trouble.
Okay, good stuff. So I think we've answered that one in our own deranged way.
I can't believe you dunked on my basic stoke idea.
Well, I don't know, is basic stoke, is it objectively interesting? I was trying to think of settings that might be interesting to other people as well as me. You know what I mean?
I'm a much more selfish person.
That's fine. But I enjoyed your answer nevertheless. Yeah, I mean, the 90s thing was interesting because I thought, would it be interesting to do London, sort of Piccadilly, sort of like Soho area?
And it's like the late 90s and it's like, Blair's just won the election. Oh, the Spice Girls are the charts. Would that be good?
You know what I mean? Like that 90s London might actually have its own vibe. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Austin Powers just been defrosted. There's a lot going on then.
Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
I like that your three references for 90s were Blair, Spice Girls and the defrosting of Austin Powers.
Oh, it's funny actually because those are like, well, not the Austin Powers one, but I just I sort of like sat next to somebody who's reading a book about 90s culture the other day and I said, oh, Blair and the Spice Girls in there. And she went, no, it's about it's written by about American cultures. It's like Bill Clinton and stuff.
And I was like, oh, I was like, that is embarrassing that those are my two frames of reference. But what can you do? And David Beckham.
But keep going.
Well, excellent. Right. Here's the next question.
Thanks for the great pod, which has been a real joy from its inception till now. And in its totality, that's a bold claim.
And not true.
Yes. This must have already been asked. But if not, you're in a booth with Hideo Kojima and it's your turn on the karaoke mic.
We're in a karaoke booth, I'm assuming. What song, assuming the sum of all human effort is available, are you calling up? And are you aiming to impress or just survive?
And if there's one button in the booth that will trigger a Yakuza Zero style epic karaoke routine with costumes and pyrotechnics, would you press it? This was inspired by Tim Clark's story in episode 78, in which Tim Clark sang Nobody Does It Better?
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
To Hideo Kojima and misjudged how high and difficult it was to sing and sort of biffed it while Kojima laughed.
Yeah, I think Kojima's probably got quite a good sense of humour, so he wouldn't be upset at anything I had an attempt at, necessarily. I mean, I could go the instrumental route and just put on a song by This Will Destroy You, you know what I mean? Like, The Mighty Rio Grande.
What, just dance for him?
No, just sit there in silence with my hand on my chin, just looking at him, you know what I mean? Just like, the powerful connection between us would... Actually, I actually do have an answer to this anyway, so...
I know he likes to have an essence, because I saw him posting. Yeah, the 20th anniversary album of Fallen, the 20th anniversary version of that. A, I was horrified to learn that's 20 years old.
That's, like, horrible to learn that. Makes sense, but still, because one of those songs is in the Daredevil movie that Ben Affleck was in. But I would probably have a go at My Immortal, which is, like, a very, sort of, like, mournful, sort of, like, rock ballad that turns into, like, this instrumental thing at the end.
I think he would respect that I had a go at it, even if I can't reach the high notes of Amy Lee from Evanescence. So that I can't do, but I'd try. The one I can do, because we have the same vocal range, is Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley.
Like, that's not, because the way he sings is a little bit, sort of, like, not really like other singers. That's kind of a nice way of putting it. He is good.
He is talented. I did like his Smiths thing he did at Glastonbury last year. He seems like a cool dude.
But I can do Never Gonna Give You Up. I've done it before at Bournemouth Karaoke Club. I've got a dance floor of, admittedly, a very drunk hen-do going with that one.
So those are my two songs, Matthew. How about you? Don't say fucking Randy Newman.
Why not? That's all I got.
Ben Folds Five?
No, probably, in terms of something I could probably actually sing, it would have to be a Divine Comedy song. Would it baffle him to sing National Express?
I think that's the sort of thing he might be tuned into, you know?
Yeah, maybe, but I would definitely go with, can I sing this thing and not humiliate myself, rather than, shall I try and do something I think he'd like, which I can't sing? I'm really bad at karaoke. I'm not very good at public singing.
I kind of freeze up a little bit. This is kind of a nightmare scenario for me. When I was reading this one through, I was like, I'm glad this actually hasn't happened to me.
Because it would be an opportunity to really leave a big, sort of positive impact, you know? For him to go like, wow, that was a really charismatic journalist. I'll remember that person.
But actually, I would probably be wracked with nerves. So yeah, let's say National Express. Would I press the button to fire off the costumes of pyrotechnics?
You're familiar with the karaoke cutaways, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yakuza Zero has them.
It's not just costumes of pyrotechnics. Often it's what the song's actually about. It's kind of like a dream sequence.
So like in National Express, I press the button and then I guess Kojima would see me on a bus, singing about being on a bus. And he'd be like, I wonder what's going on with that.
Wait, is that song literally about the National Express coach service?
Yes, yeah.
Okay. Is it like, are they sort of like, oh, down and dirty British life kind of band? Is that the whole thing?
No, not really. It's like a whimsical, well, all human life is here, as he sings in the song. It's kind of an observation on all the interesting characters on the National Express.
If that song has deeper meaning and is a clever metaphor for something else, it has passed me by.
If there's, I mean, my memory of the National Express, of getting it to save money in the journey from Bournemouth to Gosport, in the early to mid-noughties, was that it was destitute old people who couldn't afford the train, and like teenagers who were like feeling each other up at the back of the bus, and then like, well, a bottle of lemonade, just sort of like what goes along sort of like the middle aisle. Does that come up in the song, Matthew, or not?
I'm not those exact references, but it has a bit of that energy. It sings about the person trying to push the concessions, stand down a bus, can't get by because their ass is the size of a small country, as the lyrics go.
Yeah, I guess they're going to give you up, would just have me in a warehouse with ginger hair, just sort of like, there's a cheerful bartender dancing on the bus.
I don't know which is less baffling for him. They're like, please pick a song that when you press the button, Mr. Kojima will be transported somewhere wonderful.
Or it turns out that the button's broken and you are transported there, but he's just seeing you hallucinate this entire situation, and he's just very, very upset by it. Lots to think about there. Yeah, okay, good.
All right, this next one, then. Hi, Samuel and Matthew. This is from Angry Kurt, this one.
Our good friend, Angry Kurt. Hi, Samuel and Matthew. What's the toughest challenge you've completed in a game, whether it was a boss battle or otherwise?
You might have been asked this before, but such as it is, we've been going for almost four years. The one that always comes to mind for me is a mission in DRIV3A called Chase Catalita, which took me and my friend a year of weekends to do, where we would allocate one hour every Saturday afternoon and try to attempt this mission. It was only a simple car chase, but it went on for a very long time.
It was extremely difficult as you drove through lots of narrow streets in Istanbul and faced many indestructible lampposts. It's almost like they didn't finish that game before they released it, isn't it?
Imagine going, it's the weekend. Oh no, I've got an hour of DRIV3A guaranteed.
Yeah, I think me and my friend Donald, we played DRIV3A, I think, for about two months, we would sort of mess around in the open world a bit, because you could do this GTA thing, but it wasn't as good, obviously. We did that and then we gave up on it forever. Because reflections and difficulty was kind of a weird relationship, wasn't it?
And that game was not quite ready for prime time. So yeah, kind of a weird one. Although don't let Jeremy Peel catch me saying that.
That would be unfortunate. Matthew, what's your answer to this one?
To be honest, anything truly difficult I run into, if it's so difficult that overcoming it would be something worth shouting about, I probably give up on it in games. Like, that's too difficult. I don't take pleasure in just chipping away at the same thing over and over again.
That's why I've not finished any Soulsborne game. Because there's just a point where I'm like, nah, not interested in overcoming it. A time in my life where I did have time and the inclination to keep chipping away at these things.
Probably unlocking, like, cheats in Goldeneye, trying to get those times on the levels in different difficulty modes. Like, chipping away at the one facility and statue. I remember those being just nightmarish and weeks, if not months, of just repeatedly running them.
I pull out those two because they both had a semi-randomised element to them. One hinged on where Dr. Doak appeared in facility and statue hinges on where the black box from the helicopter appears, so that you could be having the best run ever. But if that thing wasn't in the one optimal run, you were sort of fucked every time.
But, like, you know, I think if that game came out now, I just wouldn't bother with any of that stuff. I just do not have the appetite. And I'm lucky to have access to enough games that I don't have to chip away at one thing, if it frustrates me.
Yeah, fair enough. I think that's the thing. It's like now you're up against it time-wise, so the idea of spending that much time invested in just mastering one game, that's kind of eluded me a little bit, honestly, in recent years.
But also, like, games are largely designed to be finished now, you know?
Yeah, they are. They are. And, you know, there are still obviously, you know, you mentioned the From Software games, there are games where this does still, you know, this is still part of the mix.
So I've got a few examples here, Matthew. So I think that as a kid, like, as a comparable example to this, Espresso to Go in GTA 3 was the one that I was stuck on for ages and eventually did, and that was really hard because you couldn't even use cheats to, like, get ahead on it, which I did on so many of the other levels in GTA 3. But you just had to, like, drive across all three islands in nine minutes and destroy nine different coffee stands, basically, and it was...
and you would be shot at while it was happening as well. So it was at each stand, and there was one that I think was, like, really near the airport on the third island that was really hard to get to. You had to devise...
I think you could start from wherever you wanted to in terms of, like, where the mission began. So it was... You just had to pick what the optimal order was, and it was so fucking difficult to do.
And this is the days before online walkthroughs, and I just... I think it took me, like, probably three or four weeks of trying this till I eventually got it. And I was so frustrated, I was stuck in it because I was desperate to see the end of GTA III.
It felt like a great odyssey I had to see to completion. So that was one. In recent years, so completing Mirror's Edge without firing a bullet, did that.
Completing Mirror's Edge on hard, did that. Completed God Hand, did that on easy, but still did it, which is actually quite... This is a notoriously difficult game, God Hand, so quite proud of that one.
Getting sort of like S... I think I got like the top ranking in all of the Resi 5 Merceries maps, as you might expect. That's a very kind of like me thing to do.
In terms of Soulsborne stuff, obviously I finished Sekiro. Probably the big one from that, though, is beating the Demon of Hatred, which is the shittiest boss in that game. It's kind of like just a big AOE, Chucks Fireballs that you boss across this massive battlefield, and you have to scoot around doing these very precise maneuvers.
And I don't know why I put the time in. I was just so determined to master the game generally that I did it, I did it, and I did it again on New Game Plus, and when I did it again on New Game Plus, I beat it first time because it was so ingrained, exactly what I had to do. And that's what I realized, I was probably going through some kind of manic episode.
I'd have seen that thing once and just gone and watched another season of Cheers instead.
Yeah, Northern Exposure, you know, get some good vibes going.
There is no Demon of Hatred in the Cheers bar.
Is that not like a season nine episode, you know, the Demon of Hatred is... They're like, the Demon of Hatred!
Oh yeah, that's right. Cliff falls in love with the Demon of Hatred and proposes to it. That happens a lot in Cheers.
People meet someone and propose to them in the episode. Come on.
Yeah. And they're like, oh, that's weird. There's a lantern hanging on this bar.
What's all that about? Anyway, let's not go back into that. So I guess we covered that one, Matthew.
I think we have some good answers there. Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
Thanks for the pods. Question, we all roll our eyes when any of the tired discourse crops up, but what discussions do you love seeing? I read that weirdly.
I'm sorry. What game chats?
We all roll our eyes when any of the tired discourse crops up, but what discussions do you love seeing? What game chats, slash games, slash topics, or subjects are always welcome?
Do you love seeing? Do you love to see?
There was nothing wrong with how you read it, but now you've pointed it out, I just find it funny.
As opposed to this, what do you actually like? Anyway, that's not how you read a question. That's from Gieldea44.
I guess we were asked about tired topics of discourse that we roll our eyes out of, like, is Die Hard a Christmas movie? Snore. What discourses excite us when we're like, yes, always got time for this?
Yeah, I think that, sort of like, when Metal Gear Solid or Final Fantasy come up, I always find that quite enjoyable on social media. Like, recently, the Fortnite, as they added Metal Gear characters to Fortnite, there was a meme doing the rounds of like, Fortnite Her, that's far more effective than live exercises, bits of MGS2 that people were adjusting around that, which I thought was quite funny. Yeah, so anytime Metal Gear comes up, generally that results in some, like, generally good takes, because I think people have a lot of affection for those games, so no one's out there going, do you know what, I think Metal Gear Solid 4 is shit, actually.
Most of the time, it's people saying the opposite, going, these maligned elements of Metal Gear are quite good. And with Final Fantasy as well, each kind of, like, game is sort of its own universe of memes and, you know, have their own fan bases, so I think those are generally good as well. A lot of those get shared in the RPGs channel in Discord.
Recently, someone did, like, a Simpsons sort of, like, a still to go along with every single Final Fantasy game on Facebook, and they all got posted in the RPGs Discord, and they were just... Some of them weren't very good, but some of them were excellent, and it was very, very amusing, so... Yeah, I always enjoy those.
What's the still for Final Fantasy VII?
Gosh, it's... Oh, I think it's Mod Flanders dying. I think that's what they did.
The funniest one, I thought, was... They did... Do you remember the episode where Ned Flanders' house gets destroyed and they rebuild it, and then...
When they rebuild it, he goes down that corridor that becomes really tiny, you know, that one. They did that. That was the Final Fantasy XIII one, was that tiny corridor?
So, yeah, it's pretty good. I'll find a way to link that for the...
Excellent.
Yeah, and what about you, Matthew?
Hitman level rankings, always. I will listen to anyone, no matter how much I hate them, if they've got Hitman level rankings, tell me. Zelda rankings, whether it's the games in general, or if you want to get specific into dungeons, weapons, bosses, things like that.
I guess quite similar to what you're saying with Final Fantasy. There's just a series you know so well, I'm just always interested to hear the takes. There are just so many of those games as well, but Hitman level rankings was the one that jumped out first.
I always like Ace Attorney discussion from any corner of the internet. It's quite exciting when the Apollo Justice trilogy came out recently, because you know, a fresh batch of reviews on it, and I was interested to see what people were saying about Apollo Justice, Duel Destinies and Spirit of Justice, because I obviously really rate Spirit of Justice, which is the sixth. But I saw some people parroting the quite tired line that like, well Apollo Justice, you know, it's not as good as the original trilogy, but it's the only good one in there, because it's the only one Shuu Takumi wrote, and so the other two can't be good because of that, which is like a horseshit.
I am a dumbass, don't know what I'm talking about take, and I saw that in so many reviews, and it was just great to be like, nope, not this person, don't have to listen to this person. Who's a good person, because they agree with me.
And we get to the heart of the matter with Matthew Castle there. Incredible king shit to kick off this weekend, amazing. Okay, good stuff Matthew, that's, there's no topping that, so let's move on.
I was going to ask have you played any more of Street Fighter VI, but mine is still sealed after I bought it two months ago. Anyway, on to actual questions. Do either of you support any Patreon accounts currently?
If so, who? For a laugh, would you ever do a draft for gaming magazines or are we getting too meta? Maybe for the 200th episode.
I guess I want to see would Matthew pick Catherine or Rich Stanton first, plus you Samuel picking Tim Weaver just for the mind games. That's from Blinky. We concluded we can't do that Matthew, because we're too thin skinned.
Is that right?
Well, we're too thin skinned and also our friends are.
Yeah, exactly. And it's just weird. It gets a bit too strange past a certain point.
It's too inside baseball. The idea of bartering with our colleagues.
Yeah, this podcast is already inside baseball to begin with. And then it becomes inside, inside, inside baseball. And you're like, we must stop.
So for the Patreon thing, I support a few. I support Archipel, the video outfit, and I support John Denton as well, who obviously does reactions to music and was one of the first people to support our Patreon as well. So solidarity there.
And I obviously want John to do well too. So I keep meaning to support Jeremy, but I have like, I'm having some problems with PayPal and Patreon at the moment. So it sounds like an excuse, but I promise it's not.
So he probably thinks I'm holding out on him. What about you, Matthew?
Poor old Jeremy. I support Jeremy because I'm a good person and a good friend. I support My Perfect Console, Simon Parkins' podcast, because I thoroughly enjoy that and like listening to it without adverts.
And I support The Computer Games Show as well.
Oh, that's nice.
They were very supportive of us when we launched in the early days. And it's not just because of that. You know, I'd like to support them, you know, just for making the podcast.
But, you know...
Because Dave Turner's trying to beat you up, Matthew.
No, but they've always been very generous towards us when I say that. The only references we ever get now are like, they're dunking on you because you said this or you said that. So I don't know if that relationship has changed.
I don't think it has.
No, it's all good. Don't start a podcast civil war.
No, I'm only joking. I'm only joking. They'll love that.
They feed anything to feed the bullshit.
I flaked on being on their pod late last year as well, and I felt really bad about that. We should do that.
We should definitely do that at some point.
Yeah, I'm just trying not to... You know me with sort of like the old career stuff. I'm just trying not to put myself in a position where I'd like to do any sort of massive goofs basically.
I'm just very goof conscious these days. Yeah. But yeah.
Okay, good. So that's pretty solid selection. I also pay for subscription to Vulture as well, because I like reading Vulture when I'm on the train and just want to read a bunch of pop culture takes and they got some good writers and it's harder to get that for pop culture these days, so got to support it when you find it.
I'm not saying what journalism I support because everyone will roll their eyes.
Matthew is a big telegraph guy obviously, so yeah, and the Daily Mail. But if you had to pick one, it would obviously be the Mail. Okay, this is a good one Matthew.
Quick question for you. Whatever happened to the boys across the river? Feel free to ignore this question if the answer is too dark.
That's from Adam.
What are you imagining Adam? What is this dark, dark present day that you are picturing? Does it involve the river?
It's the word the river because it suggests something bad happened with the river, right?
Definitely. That was the joke I made is that like, you know, one of them drowned or something like that. It's not really a funny joke to be honest.
No, I mean that would have been tragic. No, luckily they both live. The boys across the river.
They live!
In Final Fantasy XII style. Yeah, they're both doing well. They no longer live across the river.
Neither do their parents. My dad still lives by the river. I don't know who lives there now, across the river.
And what headlines have I got? The younger of the boys across the river, Andy, he got married last year, I think. So there you go.
Life is good for the boys.
Wow, isn't that inspiring? Beautiful stuff there. So yeah, no dark information there to share with the listeners.
Okay, good. Well, yeah, we've all learned a lot there then.
I don't know what you were hoping for.
All right. Hi dudes, the Bumster would like to know...
The Bumster!
I had to block Bumster on Twitter because I thought he was being too familiar with me. So I had to put him in his place a little bit. So sorry about that, Bumster.
We've heard lots about you getting games for Christmas. But are there any young people you buy games for? Have you had any luck curating good taste in them?
Or is it just Robux for days? So I've basically... My brother is 11 years younger than me and I have completely transferred my game taste onto him.
He likes slightly more anime nonsense than I do. But he likes all the same things. So Final Fantasy, he got 16, he's all over that.
Star Wars games, he's all over that. And Kingdom Hearts, I got him into, I bought him Kingdom Hearts three or a few years ago for Christmas or birthday or something like that. But the big thing I got him into in recent years is Persona 5, so he became like the world's biggest Persona person because he loves anime and manga.
And then suddenly there's this game that is like the intersection of all of his interests. And now I think that Persona has overwritten all other things for him. So he pre-ordered Persona 3 Reload.
But I don't know if that counts as young because he's 25, so we're talking younger than that. I don't know anyone younger than that. So no, everyone's like, yeah, my kid plays Fortnite or Roblox or Honkai Star Rail or whatever.
And I'm like, okay, well, I don't understand any of those things, but I wish them well. How about you, Matthew?
So I'm still chuckling about you blocking someone called The Bumster for being too familiar.
A rich life I live, Matthew.
That's amazing. My youngest brother, Will, is, I want to say 21. If that's wrong, my family will tell me off for that.
But he's absolutely your classic like FIFA, COD, teenage boy. So yeah, buying those every year, always good for a birthday, presents. You know, one of us can get a FIFA, one of us can get the inevitable COD.
When my other brother, Alex, who's only a couple of years younger than me, was still living at home, my younger brother, Will, they used to play a lot of Smash Brothers. Like the Smash Brothers game got like much improved from when it used to be me and Alex playing when we were younger. So whenever I'd come home, there'd always be like a hunger to play Smash Brothers and they'd absolutely kick my ass.
But they were playing it on, which one were they playing? Did they play on Wii U a lot? Maybe they were playing Wii U Smash, but yeah, always random characters, which is a bit chaotic for my liking.
Yeah, okay, that makes sense.
So yeah, some taste, I would say.
I play a bit of Fortnite and I play it with Bayliss and he plays, he's just got a snake skin, not snake skin as in snake the character, solid snake. I joked, because he's good at the game and I'm bad, I should have the riding skin and we should go around together. I think that's quite a good thing there, but I'm not prepared to spend actual money on bringing that gag to life.
So that's really something for me to think about. Okay, do you want to read this next one Matthew?
Afternoon gents. With the upcoming release of Tekken 8, I wondered if there are any games or series that you haven't played or played little of, but know a surprising amount about the storyline. Tekken and Five Nights at Freddy's are series that I've hardly played, but I've picked up most of their story beats and central characters from other places somehow.
If there are, has this impacted your willingness to go and play those games either positively or negatively? Loving the pod as always, that's from Superboy. It's not quite the same thing, but I remember years ago when Tom Francis was still living in the UK, I remember him telling lots of stories about things that had happened in EVE Online, sweeping dramatic narratives that the community had made happen.
I always thought those were fascinating, but then I took one look at the game and it's quite abstract. You know, these things may have happened, but it doesn't play out as excitingly as they did when Tom was telling me about them. So that's a game I was quite happy to just absorb as narratives from journalists who'd seen this stuff happened.
For example, I always remember him telling about this... apparently there was this huge assassination of this other player who was this sort of CEO of this huge in-game corporation and this other guild or whatever the terminology is spent 10 months like infiltrating it. You know, all these players kind of joined this corporation.
They all worked in different parts of it. Another guy worked his way up within it to become like secondhand man to this CEO and then kind of led them into a trap, which they then activated. Apparently they had like a kill phrase that was to sent out across the universe and then everyone kind of launched into action.
Everyone who had all the sleeper agents activated took all the resources out of this corporation, like robbed it blind and the secondhand man turned his gunship on this CEO, blew them up. But apparently what was at the heart of it was they didn't just want them dead. They wanted their frozen body delivered.
So they blew up this person's shit. Then they blew up this person's escape cop pod and collected the frozen body from the depths of space to deliver it to someone. But it was just this whole thing.
When someone tells you about it, I think there's an article on PC Gamer you can read actually, you're like, that sounds like the raddest shit ever. But when you actually look at a screenshot of it, you're like, oh, yeah, it's not quite like, if it doesn't really look like, you know, you're imagining it like it's fucking uncharted or something, and it isn't that.
Or Battlestar Galactica.
And that isn't the game's fault, you know. I'm sure in the moment it felt every bit as exciting as those things, but there are some games which are better told than experienced.
So, dear Samuel and Matthew, a live action Legend of Zelda movie has been announced, but we don't have any cast news yet. Aseemee Adam Driver is already eschewing for Tingle. Who would you like to see in the main roles?
I don't think Nintendo slash Hollywood are brave or mad enough for this, but I'd like to see a male Link character portrayed by an actress. The dweeb web commenters would go bananas. That's from Dominic.
This is a really hard one because I don't think anyone really looks like those characters. I think people have pointed out that the actress Hunter Shafo is in euphoria, kind of looks like both Link and Zelda, which I can sort of see, but generally speaking, they're quite ethereal-looking characters, so I don't really see a Timothy Chalamet Link or whatever. You know what I mean?
In my head, that just makes me cringe a little bit. So I don't actually know how they'll do this. I'll just have to find a very, very pretty boy to play Link or a girl, like you say.
Weirdly, we were watching that comedy film Bottoms on Amazon.
Oh, yeah.
And it's got this side character, this very Elfin-looking actress. I'm trying to find her name. Ruby Cruz, apparently.
But anyway, how they were made up in this particular film, I thought, oh, they look very Elfin. You know, whether that's like a Link character or another child of the forest or whatever.
I can see that.
Yeah. Yeah. What I would say about this is, I think whoever you put in those things, it's going to be incredibly cringe.
They're not going to do it. I imagine they will just do a straight, like obviously the lead character is going to be Link. But I really think there's a thing that could work if you set it in that world adjacent to those characters and have it as a sort of a legend, have it as quite an abstract idea.
Like, I don't want to hear Link talking in a game. I don't think in a film, I don't think he should be the protagonist of it somehow. But I don't really know how that would work.
You know, you almost want it to be. I can't think of another thing quite like that.
Yeah, it's a tricky one. I'll probably end up getting someone like Christoph Waltz playing Ganondorf, because that's the sort of decision they'll end up making. You know what I mean?
And then you'll be like...
Mark Strong.
Yeah, that's quite good, actually. You can see the nose there a little bit.
But the thing is, they're going to put it out, and it's going to be, oh, that's someone cosplaying as these characters. It's just going to look like that and instantly be weird. And like, Jack Black's the voice of a Goron, you know?
So it's a tricky one. I think I agree with people saying that it should be like a ghibli-looking 2D animated film, really. That would be the ideal scenario, wouldn't it?
But alas. Another one from me. What are some of your most controversial positive gaming takes?
Takes where you genuinely like aspects other people regularly or usually malign. That's from Balladeer. My one, Matthew.
Eat lead. The return of Matt Hazard was worth a punt. It deserved every one of it.
Six out of ten that I gave it, basically. I think probably my most obvious ones are Resi 5 is good and more controversially, Resi 6 is good.
I'd written down Resi 6 as one. The other one, and I've said this loads of times, but you know, Metroid, Other M, cut scenes aside, is absolutely fine, if not quite good.
I learned some amazing trivia about that, about the actress who plays Samus in that recently from Jay Bayliss. There's like a woman who walks into that room where Oppenheimer is being prosecuted in Oppenheimer, and she's like a receptionist or something, and she is the actress who plays Samus Aran in Metroid, Other M. And like when I saw it, maybe it seemed better at the time when Jay explained it to me, but I was like, whoa, I kind of broke my brain open a little bit.
I was like, she's still out there doing stuff. Good for her. Okay, last question for this episode then.
It's our friend Angry Kurt again, AKA Black Hazard Donut. Hi, Samuel and Matthew, having listened to the excellent Fincher ranked episode over Christmas. That's on Patreon there for folks who are curious.
It got me thinking. I have a question for you both. For Matthew, if you get Fincher to direct an adaptation of a Japanese crime novel, which would you choose?
And then for Samuel, what adaptation of a comic such as graphic novel would you like to see him direct in a dream case scenario? Cheers. What have you got Matthew?
I mean, the obvious one is Murder in the Crooked House because it's a one location film. It's quite a strange building. Fincher is very good at filming buildings, as we know from Panic Room.
I could see him framing it quite nicely and the production design and the idea of all these slightly outlandish characters getting together. I would think it would be a bit too lightweight for him. I actually think you'd want something with a bit more deeper psychology to it, so maybe less locked room mystery.
There's a Higashino book called Journey Under the Midnight Sun, which is like this sort of crime epic that unfolds over the course of 20, 30 years and follows kind of a pair of murderers who are sort of dancing around each other. The actual nature of their relationship is kind of the mystery at the heart of the novel, but I could see that working in a sort of Gone Girl kind of vein. Lots of big character actors and people getting murdered in quite grisly set pieces.
I think that could be cool.
Yeah, I like that. I think any sort of crime thing you can think of, you would want to plug Fincher into it and see what you can make of it, right? Well, The Killer is an adaptation of a French graphic novel, which I think they did reprint in time for the film coming out.
But after seeing the film, I don't feel like I need to see the graphic novel because the film was quite graphic novel-y, I think, in how it was presented, even right down to the endless monologues of the main character. Slightly preposterous dialogue. I've got a few for this one on the graphic novel side.
For years, Fincher was attached to direct an adaptation of Torso, which is a graphic novel by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Andrako, some quite prominent early noughties comic creators about Elliot Ness hunting down this Cleveland torso killer or something like that. Kind of like it's a manhunt slash murder mystery thing. That sounded perfect.
I'd still love to have seen that, because I went and interviewed Bendis when I was on Syfy Now. He talked about meeting Fincher for lunch and stuff and talking about it, so it kind of went fairly far down the line. Sort of like Ed Brubaker's comics would be perfect for Fincher as well.
I think they're kind of a good fit, so probably not criminal because it's too much of it. There's loads and loads of criminal, but like the fade out that I got you to read, Matthew, like I'd be...
Yeah, I mean, that could be like a good mank.
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, no, just sort of black and white kind of like, or maybe even just sort of like, you know, a bit more sort of stylized, technicolor sort of element to it, you know, make it look like Chinatown basically. Yeah, sort of like Batman Year One by Frank Miller and David Masichelli.
Like if you were going to... Any sort of Batman story would be a good fit for Fincher. It would be that one because it's very sort of like dark shadowy drawings of Batman and internal monologue.
You can sort of see the Fincher in it a little bit, even though it's pre-Fincher, but it suits his sensibilities quite well. So there's some answers there, Matthew. I think that...
But Ed Brubaker in general, his stuff is all crime noir. You can totally see how that makes sense for Fincher. So, yeah, good.
That's a good little burst of questions there, Matthew, wasn't it? Yeah, good.
And a lot more nourishing game content. Did talk about confusing Kojima with divine comedy karaoke, but so it goes.
Yep. I talked about my experiences being on the actual National Express in the late noughties, so everyone involved had a great time, so good stuff. So, yes, a slightly shorter episode, but we'll be back next week with a PS1 draft, so that will no doubt go on forever, and I'm excited to see which answers Matthew has sourced from his office where he works with people who know the PlayStation 1 better than he does.
Has that come up yet, Matthew? Have you gone through that process?
Not yet. I've had bigger fish to fry.
Did you like the categories I sent over?
Yeah, they're good. I think I can work with those. I know I'm going to be pretty basic bitch, but I'm hoping you can bring spice.
Maybe, we'll see. I'll tease people with a category. That'll be a nice teaser for next week, won't it?
We've got category one, fighting game, two, shooter, three, survival horror, four, racing or sports, five, license game, six, platformer, seven, RPG, eight, 90 plus on Metacritic, nine, wild card and ten, free pick. Look forward to that. We'll let you vote as ever and it'll be fun.
Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
On Twitter, I'm MrBazzle UnderscorePesto and on Blue Sky, I'm MrBazzlePestoNoUnderscore.
Drink, drink, drink. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both as well.
And the podcast is BackpagePod and then backpagegames.gmail.com if you'd like to email us as well. So that's all the stuff, I think. patreon.com backpagepod if you would like to listen to best and worst gaming hangs, which is this month's Excel episode.
And in March, we're going to do an XXL episode of the two Dune movies. That'll be exciting. So Matthew, let's go out of here.
