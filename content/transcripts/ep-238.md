Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Here we are, the big one of the month. I feel like everything's been building up to this episode.
We've hyped it for a while. The long-awaited two giant men played Donkey Kong Bonanza, colon, is it better than Astro Bot? Brackets, it has to be better than Astro Bot.
Dash, does it have the juice, sauce, or the gravy? Here we are, finally. I've got a Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate thing that I'll eat at some point during this episode as a little treat.
This is like... That's not free advertising, by the way. That's just my bad eating habits.
That's all that is.
Subtle ad read there.
Yeah. We have no sponsored content on these podcasts, obviously, but that's just me being a terrible greedy bastard after dinner. So, here we go, Matthew.
Donkey Kong Bonanza, it's here. Let's start by describing what this game is, because I think you did a good job of this in your review for The Guardian, like contextualizing what it is. And I imagine you spent a lot of time thinking about how to explain what Donkey Kong Bonanza is in terms of genre, types of gameplay, etc.
Oh, man. That's put me on the spot. Well, it's put the pressure on to...
Oh, yeah. It's in the episode plan. I don't know.
As in to... Thank you for saying kind words about the review, but how I so concisely summarized this game. Now I'm trying to think, what the fuck did I say in that review?
Well, do you know what the word that stuck in my head was? Was mushiness.
Mushiness.
I'm pretty sure that was the words you used to describe the sort of like the lack of precision to the feel of this 3D platformer that's got a load of terrain defamation, it's got Super Mario Odyssey style, all these, you know, like, different forms that Donkey Kong can take, bonanza forms that give him different abilities to interact with the environment in different ways. And I think you were just using mushiness to describe that core. You smash things up and it's not a game of mega precision in the way that a 3D platformer from this team might normally be.
Yes, that is true. I was using it as a slight criticism there, which we can get into when we talk about our early hours with the game. But yeah, this is the next game from the studio that has traditionally made the 3D Mario games.
There is a lot of Odyssey DNA in this game. There is a lot of the kind of collectathon design, which was also in Odyssey. There are hundreds of things to collect.
In this case, golden bananas, banandium gems. I never really thought of them as gemstones, because it is deranged that a monkey would eat rocks. I just thought of them as like sparkly bananas, but obviously they're not.
They are gems. And also lots of fossils to unlock costumes, which I guess sort of take on the role of the purple currencies that you collected from the levels in Mario Odyssey. It's quite a different game to Odyssey.
As much as it is a succession of 3D worlds for you to explore, it's more an action game than a platformer, I'd say. And again, we can get into that distinction when we talk about it. Lots of people see this as being in the vein more of like the N64 era, 3D platforming exploration games.
A lot of people kind of connecting this back, maybe more to like the Rare line of games, Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, rather than necessarily Mario 64. And I get that. I mean, obviously the Donkey Kong connection kind of puts Rare in your brain.
I think there's way more expressiveness to this game than was ever in those games.
Try telling that guy who painted his game card yellow that Dave Turner's cut together so expertly. I mean, a great bit of content. Dave Turner's TCGS.
Yeah.
You probably saw us doing the rounds on Blue Sky, but someone who is clearly a bit too into the old Rare Games, started to paint his game card yellow like the color of the cartridge for Donkey Kong 64, and paid the price in comical fashion, I will say.
Yes.
I'm sure you had a lot of sympathy for that man. Didn't have a laugh at his expense at all. I'm sure you were very charitable.
It was fantastic. It was just so fucked in that slot. When he was trying to pull out with plies and in like bits, the cartridge was just snapping off.
It didn't even look good, the yellow paint job.
It looks shite. It's so funny that. I think the only joy you can get left in the modern day is just schadenfreude.
It's just laughing at people's bad things happening to people where they've done something buffoonish or genuinely evil. That's all we've got left is humanity. That's on the lighter scale of that really, but it was still pretty funny.
Well, I'd say we've got two things left. We've got schadenfreude and we've got the joy of smashing deformable terrain in Donkey Kong Bonanza to bring us into the episode. But yeah, it's definitely an interesting one.
It's not as neat a game to sum up as Mario Odyssey, but with a destructive Donkey Kong instead of Mario. It has different stuff going on under the hood. As I was saying, lots of people have tied it back to the 90s.
I think for me, it maybe has more of the modern, weird Nintendo. The strangeness of it feels more akin to what was happening in Splatoon, or maybe Arms. The slight odd NPCs I don't necessarily think are just a direct throwback to the rare character designs.
There's definitely some DNA in there.
We know how you feel about the rare freaks, Matthew. You're on the record about that in this podcast. It has been acknowledged by Rare itself on social media as well.
That's how far this went.
No, I think it just ignores the fact that there has been some stranger stuff going on at Nintendo in the last ten years, and that a younger generation are coming up. I think Donkey Kong is definitely one of that generation of games. It feels, yes, younger and odder in some particular ways, but yes, it's a great big, colourful, really inventive, really polished game.
I said it much more succinctly in my Guardian review because I thought very, very hard about those 700 words, and I'm very sweaty from walking home.
I hear you have about 70,000 words you can use, so that's good. I was curious how you think it compared to what you thought the game was going to be from the Switch 2 hands-on event, because you and I think a few other critics are a bit cool on it after that. I do think that this is a game where you need to actually play, have the full sweep of it to understand what the vision of it is.
I can actually see why one isolated chunk of it might not give you the most confidence in it. What was that journey like?
What maybe didn't work for me at the preview stage was that you came in and someone told you all these instructions for these controls. He can do quite a lot in this game other than just punching through the dirt. When someone throws all of it at you, you maybe press the buttons and make it happen so he can turf surf when he pulls up a lump of dirt and then rides it.
The way he holds dirt and pulls things up, whether he then rides it, throws it or uses it for a double jump, that is probably more at the heart of his controls scheme than just the pure punching. But that wasn't made very clear by the people on the demo station, so you maybe don't just get a sense of what the movement is going to be. I mean, I thought it was maybe going to be way more experimental when it is.
I think I described it as like he was almost swimming through the dirt, and I couldn't quite get my head around it. I thought it was going to be more of a splatoon, like a radical new control scheme that maybe just hadn't quite clicked. I don't know that it is that.
I think it's kind of easier to get your head around it when it's presented to you like in the full tutorial of the game. I definitely didn't come out of it going like, well, that was crazy. I can't comprehend what's going on.
I feel like I fully understood this game after about an hour. Maybe it's the difference of like an hour of tutorials and 20 minutes of a bloke telling you what the buttons do in a very busy warehouse in London. It turns out that hour on boarding is important.
Yeah, exactly. I feel like we've got an idea of what you think of the game there already, Matthew, just from asking you what it is and you talking about your journey with it there. Anything else you want to add as like the top line of here's my stance on Bonanza?
I think it's a pretty amazing game. I think it like the two things that really, really work for me is that I think it works on like one level just as a piece of technical execution. Like the act of destruction is fun.
The way Donkey Kong feels, the way it feels to kind of manipulate the environment. That is almost fun enough for me that I am just happy doing that. That is a good little sandbox experience for me.
Put him in a level. There is a base level of fun, you know, and maybe I was getting like a sense of that from when I played it at that preview event. Oh yeah, I can see that that could really get its hooks into someone.
That's going to work. But what you need to really see in the whole game and what emerges is that it has this great spirit of invention and the way it uses different materials to take those moves and turn them into quite different things or make you think very differently about environments. That's really well done.
I think it has this compelling forward momentum to it. Minute to minute, I think you always want to see what's inside the world around you. But on a larger scale, you have this, oh, I want to see what world it serves up next.
I want to see what materials are, what mechanics are, what transformations are going to happen. What are the layers of this world that I'm working through? Because you're basically mining towards the centre of the earth.
It definitely works on like a sort of micro and macro scale for me. I will say like up top, I don't know if it's quite a 10 out of 10 Odyssey tier kind of game for me. There's an absolutely amazing journey you take through this game.
I think tearing through the core campaign is this game at its best. Like seeing all those new ideas, probably more fun than I had with the Mario Odyssey core campaign. I just think that when that kind of forward momentum stops and you maybe get into like the mopping up territory or some of the like late sort of post credits content, I don't know if it's quite got like the legs of Mario Odyssey for me.
And that's what stops it from maybe being that very, very top tier. Am I going to like replay this every couple of years? I'm not sure.
Maybe you will. You know, you've got to let time unfold, haven't you?
Yeah, absolutely.
So we haven't talked about this. I mean, you know, I've been praying and hoping that you've liked this game. I think it'll be a bit of a heartbreaker if you're not into it.
So Samuel Roberts, Donkey Kong Bonanza. What is the verdict?
It's two thumbs up from your boy.
Oh, I think it's what a relief.
I guess really, really good. It's a definite top five game of the year contender for me. Nice.
I think it's I think I agree with what you say. If there is jumping on one of my questions here, but if there are tier listings of Nintendo games and you have things like Mario Galaxy in that S-tier, and you have, let's say, Kirby in The Forgotten Land, a game I like a lot, and did put in my game of the year list for 2022 in the B-tier, then this is the A-tier kind of game that goes in there. Not like the neatest thing in the world, because like you say, it's not, it's somewhere between an action game and a platformer.
It's just really bold in how much the terrain defamation pays off the promise. It's sort of, I think you think at first it's going to be superficial, because you'll come to some locations, you'll smash it for a while and you'll eventually hit the metal wall and you'll be like, oh, there's the restriction, I can't really do anything with this. And then I think there were some early parts of the game where I would just smash through a wall to reach an objective and I thought, oh, that's fun that I can do that.
But I don't know if there's that much in terms of legs to it. But then the more time you spend with it and the way you start to process each environment as, I'm just going to go to the side of this wall and I'm just going to mash through this cliff for about five minutes. I'm going to hulk out into the big kong bonanza, whichever one that base one is called.
And I'm going to smash up loads of treasure chests in here and I'm going to leave lots of comedy sort of like cartoonish holes in the side of this cliff. And I'll probably find like a sort of like ambiguously edible or not sort of banana in the center of there somewhere. It's a great game of like rewarding curiosity in terms of it's got lots of secrets in it, but they're not really bullshitty to find.
They are easy to find and you'll find just so many of them naturally. And I think I can actually feel already what you're saying about how it's maybe not the most satisfying game to mop up because I've sort of been trying to be as comprehensive as I can in each environment before I move on because I'm sort of like I've seen like the one idea that drives this level and now it's time to move on to the next one and I don't have a huge desire to come back. I like feeling like I've been comprehensive enough for my liking in a level before I move on.
And so I think this is just wonderful in so many ways, quite un-Nintendo in some ways. It's sort of like for Donkey Kong what Breath of the Wild was for Zelda in terms of A, they both have like very physics-y, quite experimental physics-y elements to them, you know, which I don't think you'd necessarily think of as being traditionally Nintendo in terms of, you know, I think with Breath of the Wild people are always obviously banging on about trying to make that immersive sim comparison. That's not why this is a very different type of game.
It probably is close to something like Red Faction Gorilla, which everyone made those jokes about, but you know, it is a game of the kind of like the the joy of smashing things up really, and then using your 3D navigation smarts in between that to to sort of like get around the different worlds, but I think there's just a bunch of moments in this where I was like, oh wow, I can't believe that Nintendo have done this. I don't see any other big publishers making a game that has this kind of physics puzzle where I mess with the environment in order to solve it, or oh wow, there's all these different things you can do when you pick up a rock, like rip a rock from the ground, and oh, I'm playing a section where I can use this to basically functionally turn Donkey Kong into a train that's moving along these different tracks, I can jump between the different tracks. There's so many different ways that they take that base, sort of satisfying interaction, smashing into things, that feels fundamentally good, but then go, what is every single thing we can do with this idea, in that classic Mario Galaxy idea after idea, kind of like blow your mind sort of way.
I think it's the meaning of a slightly different type of 3D platform than you've maybe played before, married to that genius, the sort of Mario designer's genius of, here are some ways you would never think of, that you can play this game and we're going to delight you continually. So that's my top line, Matthew.
It's kind of interesting because Odyssey obviously achieves its volume of ideas through possessions, and Mario becomes 50 different characters. People are sometimes a little sniffy about that system now going, oh yeah, great, he's a Zip and I got to unzip something. And you're like, well, yes, but he also turned into like 20 distinct enemies with like very precise control schemes and feelings.
So let's not do that. Here, I feel like there's still that desire to like innovate, but try and spin it all out of this central character. Like there are some moments where you literally transform into another giant animal and that has a different move set.
And there, you're like, oh, I can see a bit more of the Odyssey DNA here. Like he's behaving very differently and it can introduce a flight challenge or it can introduce a platforming challenge that maybe you can't with the core Donkey Kong. But it is pretty amazing what they do spin out of.
Basically, a punch and the fact that you can hold materials and the nature of those materials and how they interact with other materials, those kind of become the different interactions. They kind of become the verbs, I guess, which Mario would have by becoming other creatures. It's kind of the nature of the rock in your hands is almost as important as the fact that you can pick up a rock in the first place.
And that's maybe what I wasn't expecting, but probably should have expected from this team.
Yeah, but I like in some ways that if you didn't, pay forensic attention to the Nintendo Direct they did on the game, then a lot of this stuff is a delightful surprise when you do come across it. And I have not finished the game you have, but I think I'm about probably two-thirds into it, close to that Matthew.
Yeah.
And it is still showing me loads of new ideas all the time. And yeah, just hugely impressive. So the terrain defamation, right?
They've made a 3D platformer where that's the heart of it. And that, I think, the physicality of the main character is much more brutish than Mario is, obviously. Do you think those are the things that set it apart from other Nintendo games?
And what do you think the challenges were for implementing what they've done here from a mechanical standpoint? But I guess, yeah, I'd just be curious to hear what you think of that approach generally, because it is so rarely seen in games, terrain defamation. And when it's in games, it's normally very scripted.
But here it is a proper like, the thing you punched is gone now. And yeah, there are hard surfaces you cannot interact with in that way. But there are many different types of surfaces in this, and it's a very reactive game in that fashion.
And that is where I felt like it was showing me something I hadn't seen before from Nintendo.
It's interesting because it's almost like they've come up with something that's going to be incredibly complicated to execute. And if you read any of the developer interviews with them, they're like, you know, we had to put a lot of thought into this to make this work. But with that, I think they've got one eye on the wouldn't it be cool if this, but also they never lose sight of and what does that mean for Donkey Kong and the player?
What does that actually result in? And what would actually be fun with this? Like, it's not just enough.
It's not impressive by itself. It needs something to really like exploit it. And for me, things like the emphasis on explosives in this game, they're exploding boulders everywhere.
But also throughout the world, there are these giant gold bananas growing up, these sort of veins of gold that are coming from the core of the planet. And one of the characteristics of gold in this game for some reason is that it basically explodes on contact. So every time you hit those, it will kind of pockmark the environment a little bit.
Then you've got enemies, and the general design of enemies is that there is a gold, thus explosive, enemy at the heart surrounded by rocks. You get the satisfaction of smashing the kind of skin off an enemy, and then the reward is you get to punch the core, it will go flying and cause an explosion. And that really is one of the biggest pleasures for me in this game, is having a fight or throwing around a load of rocks, and then being able to look at an environment changed afterwards and go, oh yeah, I can see like the scars of what we did here, and that's something I've not really seen in the game, and it's a very obvious consequence of everything being deformable, but I think that to me is like the quintessential Nintendo tuck.
It's not just that it can deform, how do you kind of use that to capture the imagination, and yes, if in the minute to minute of going about Donkey Kong's daily life, he is scarring and ruining these landscapes in this quite kind of comical way, then it's all worth it, that makes perfect sense, and the deeper you get into the game, the more the game destroys terrain alongside you. There are other enemies that begin to like eat the terrain, or can, you know, smash through it or stomp through it, and that for me is, I think, where it really, really paid off, because you're like, yes, everything, you know, I'm not just the engine of destruction here, and actually now, I might be having to protect this environment, you know, all of a sudden these things are destroying or eating my safe harbour, and that's fucking rad, that's why I was like, oh yeah, this game really, really has the juice. Took a couple of levels to kind of get me into that mindset.
What I boiled that down to, like, definitely in the review was this sense that when they put a few more limitations on him and made you think a little bit more about his moves or about terrain defamation, whether that's like a puzzle where you carve out a route for something to roll down a mountain, or carve out the landscape so that a obstacle no longer affects you, the more kind of purpose there was to the destruction, or the more purpose there was to me avoiding destruction in some cases, that's where it became quite electric, if that makes sense. And I think that's the big mechanical challenge to get back to your question, is having created this, how do you build a platforming level when you can basically tunnel around any piece of design that you've put in the game? And I think they do find ways.
I think as the game goes on, it becomes not prescriptive, but a little bit more restricted in terms of where you can go, where is safe, where is dangerous. And that to me is where they begin to express themselves a little bit more. I think they do give you a couple of levels where they just smash the shit out of these, and for me they are the weaker levels.
They talked in this Nintendo developer interview about how do you like guide the eye or guide the player or tempt people towards points of interest when a point of interest could be inside anything. There's a lot of like subtle tricks you begin to see them repeating throughout this, like you know an enemy will be placed so when you punch them it's quite likely that they will hit a wall, destroy the wall and reveal a cave behind it, you know something like that or they have some I don't know if you've ever found any of like the gold or glass like veins that run through the environment that if you follow them they will like likely take you to something important buried deep inside the ground so it's it's basically a blueprint for a tunnel to follow.
I feel like I probably have.
You know I've played this thing for about 45 hours and at this point I feel like I've found all the answers that they had. I mean sometimes it's as obvious as this wall is a slightly different colour. You know it is literally the how do you know which wall is bomber ball in Zelda.
It's that but kind of times a million. Just sometimes the landscape just like leads the eye. It feels like if I go there there'll be something and there often is and you know that's just some like mad Nintendo shit that I can't get my head around of what is it about that corner that's pulling me there.
It's funny because I think that one of the ones where you do you are like meant to smash it up and that's kind of the point of it sort of being there is one of the is the Canyon layer which is I think the third or fourth level of the game and that is a sort of like I don't know vaguely Monument Valley, Westony kind of locale and that was where I had the most fun in the game just mashing through cliffs to see what was in there. Because I think that's where I think I stopped because the level before that I think is the one where it's like It's a field.
It's a big field.
Oh yeah, it's a field. That one I wasn't like massively bothered by. It looked nice but didn't think was terribly interesting but I did really like the first proper level Lagoon layer which is I would say closer to that 3D platformer, what you expect kind of experience.
I guess it's their version of World 1.1 or Green Hill Zone where it's like, this is the welcome, it's bright, it's colorful, you're going to have a fun time and then destruction is kind of a part of it, but it's not really the main point. That's probably the most it's ever really like a triad 3D platformer at that level. Then from there, I think it starts to become a bit more like, because obviously the Bonanzas are not actually part of that first bit.
So it's completely dependent on Donkey Kong's space abilities. As you get deeper into the game, the different Bonanzas you get unlock more and more of what the level designers can actually do, what they can challenge you with, what they can place in certain places, how they can get you thinking about the game. And so I think you have that first hit of like, oh, I'm in a beautiful looking Nintendo platformer that might superficially remind me of a Nintendo platformer from years ago.
But then it sort of becomes stranger and more experimental as it goes. And like you say, a lot of the joy of this game is the pock marks that you leave, but also the sense of, I don't know exactly how it does it, but I think while you're in an environment, every bit of damage you've done to it remains there. Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, which is really satisfying because you can forget about an area where you've done a bunch of stuff, come back and go, oh yeah, I did all this.
It's quite funny sometimes when you come into a room, especially one of the later power-ups, I won't spoil it in case you haven't got that far. One of the later Bonanza transformations is incredibly overpowered at basically breaking levels down. Because of it, you can regularly return to rooms where you're like, oh, I stripped this back to its metal skeleton.
It's quite funny walking from an art designed level into this abstract void that you've just absolutely wrecked. That is one of its best tricks.
Yeah, for sure. I think that what they smartly do is when you enter a level, you can normally identify that there is a layer of the level that upon first arriving, you cannot interact with fully or you don't totally understand how you're going to deal with it. And then the Bonanzas will normally unlock the way in which you do deal with it.
And then at that point, the full vision of what the level is starts to come into focus. And that's very, very impressive.
Did you ever think there's a bit of like, trad Zelda DNA in that? Like the idea that there's like a puzzle mechanic or a material mechanic, that at least the central quest line of a level will ask you to master in quite a Zelda dungeon-y way? I don't know.
I was surprised by how puzzly this game was at times.
Yeah, I think that the level in which I first really identified that was the template of the game, to some extent, was the forest one, where you basically avenge... I guess this is a mild spoiler, but it was in the marketing materials. You can turn Donkey Kong into the most cursed ostrich-looking hybrid you've ever fucking seen.
Proper, sort of like, you know, island... what's it? Dr. Muroan shit.
Dr. Muroan, yeah.
Bit of that vibe to it. Or like Sid's room in Toy Story. Bit of that energy as well.
And then, like, you can... at that point, you can fly. And that was the first time I stopped and looked up, was like, oh, there's like an island up there I can reach.
But if I glide from this bit onto this bit, and I think it really obviously telegraphs to you the way in which that level is multi-tiered, but that you don't understand it when you first run through exactly what it is you're looking at. And then the power just gives you a new perspective. And then that is a trick that they use repeatedly throughout the game.
And I think it's very, very effective. But I think it is, I did read that in a bit of something that parallels, I guess, like, this doesn't really answer your Zelda question, but the more general sort of, like, relationship between it and other Nintendo games. I believe I read that Miyamoto just played that, just played one level over and over again to get to, like, test the game feel.
And it comes back to that Mario 64 story I really like, about how I think they just had Mario jumping through, like, a blank set of blocks in a room for Mario 64, just to make sure that the movement felt good in that base way. And I like that as they do something with, you know, this character and this genre that they've never done before, I like that Miyamoto is taking the same approach of everything that this character does has to feel good. And I think it does for the most part, and he does a lot.
It's actually quite a complicated game in terms of controls I found to grasp at first, because there are some things he can do that don't quite make sense in your head straight away. So, for example, he can do a double jump, but he needs to pick up, like he needs to pull a rock out of the ground, and then jump with the rock to do a double jump, as opposed to just double tap jump to do a double jump, things like that. And yeah, because he's doing all these things that maybe you're not used to from 3D platformers, I found that took a bit of like getting used to.
It's like ammo for double jumps.
But to yourself to point, yeah, I suppose they're not really dungeons in quite the same way. They are like wide open spaces for the most part. So in my head, it doesn't feel the same, but I get what you're alluding to.
I'd be interested to come back to that question once you have finished it, because I think it's definitely something I felt more and more as it went on. And particularly in the levels which introduce the transformations, there is never a better showcase for those transformations than the levels they're introduced in. It's not that they forget about them after that.
Every level has a little bit the bird can fly in, you know, or a bit where the fast creature can run around and help you. But there's loads of it in their natural home, and because of that, it had that element of going to a place, let's get the tool which unlocks the place, ala Zelda, and then have some fun with it, and then maybe don't think about it again for a bit. And there is a...
Yeah, you won't have got to it yet, but there's like a very puzzly... A very like, you know, it's literally sort of been in a Zelda game before, mechanic, tied to the fifth transformation. And yeah, you really have to think about it.
I mean, there's genuinely some challenge rooms quite late in the game where you are having to sort of sit back a little bit and think, right, what order do I need to do this for this to make sense? I need to take this thing here and do this here and do that there. And yeah, it's a surprisingly puzzly third act.
That's interesting. But I'm glad to hear that because like you say, it's that thing of like the canvas feels super wide when you start the game. In some ways, it's like an open world game, right?
In these levels, they are like, they have objectives, but they are pretty wide open to explore. And then you can feel that focus narrowing down as it goes, you know? So that's just a really interesting way to sort of like inverse how a game might normally work, where games kind of tend to open up.
This, I guess, seems to start wider. And then, like you say, narrows down the things that you should be doing or the ways you should be thinking about the game. I guess I'd better comment on that more definitively when I get deeper into Matthew.
Yeah, I mean, you might think that's a dogshit observation.
Well, okay. So I will be honest with you and say that I didn't think that the opening of the game really made me feel like this is going to be a masterpiece. You're in some kind of mine, you've got a little purple rock pal.
We haven't even mentioned Pauline yet, actually, who turns into a little girl called Pauline. Last seen being, and who I think in the Mario Kart World game was an adult character. And here is a child, is that right?
Did you identify as a…
Yeah, well, she's the mayor of New Donk City in Mario Odyssey. She's the one who sings the song.
Right, right, right. So a known quantity to modern Mario fans. And I would say like the dad's fave in Mario Kart World.
So it's a bit weird having her as like the… Having her as this like little cheerful child platformer sort of pal in this. So you have that and I think that it just…
I just didn't feel the gameplay really coalescing. I was going through that mine and thinking, oh, it's a game of just doing this, is it? Smash, smash, smash.
And it did take, I think, getting about halfway through that first proper level for it to start clicking. And then, like I say, maybe it was for whatever reason, I'm just quite fond of that Canyon level that you don't like too much. But I think I just…
I think I just learned to get into the headspace of like… It's almost like chewing a piece of gum for like ages and ages when you're smashing through sort of surfaces and this, and you go deep into this like, the fully smashable chunk of landmass, and you're just properly going at it, and you sort of phase out, and then it feels so cathartic to watch all this like, matter be destroyed. It's like to get it under my skin in this very specific way, you know?
Are you a tunneler or are you like a cave maker? Are you like about distance or volume?
Is this like a new thing that you're making happen? Is that what this is on this podcast?
No, no, I'm just interested because, like, I find myself trying to make a bigger space. I guess it's like a base of operations, because like, the more space there is around you, like the better behave the camera is. So like, you might do that just to get like a footing, you know, where some people are just like, I'm just going to keep hitting buttons and see where I come out on the other end.
I'd love to know what the shade of red is, that is like the, when the 3D camera goes through land, but shows you Donkey Kong inside a kind of hole that he's made. It's a very specific cursed dark red that they show you when the camera has hovered into a location it shouldn't be, but has to be for you to practically get through the level. I want to know what that red is.
It's got big giallo, sort of like cursed energy to it. Yeah, so I'm not a neat tunneller by any means, in fact. At the times where there are physics based puzzles that you have to make something go from A to B by neatly sort of punching the tunnels out in a very specific fashion, I found those genuinely very hard because I had just been like, well, I just have to destroy all of this land, frankly.
I just have to... It all has to go. It's all here.
It's all made to be destroyed. Let's fucking smash it up. And I'll just do that for five minutes before I carry on with the objective.
And that's how I treated the tunneling slash cave making, Matthew. I did neither, really. Just pure chaos from start to finish.
I do get what you mean about that opening level, though. I think maybe like an initial problem with that you can break anything is that you think, oh, well, I better break everything then. And actually, it's quite time consuming.
And so you can waste a lot of time digging around in dirt where, in that opening stretch, there isn't much there. You know, there's like three bananas on like the mission critical bananas and nothing else. Also I think it takes a little while for it to bed in that, like, how important gold is.
The fact that gold is basically infinite and just randomly spawns. I think people think I've got to get all the gold and you'll go mad if you do that because it will just keep making more gold as long as there's dirt. Same with treasure chests.
People are like, oh, I've got to get that treasure chest. It's like, they're being randomly spawned in the dirt as you dig. And so the more you dig, the more they'll be.
And I think you can end up just not playing anything they've actually designed for you to play in that opening area because you are going, well, I better chase this stuff because it's probably one of a kind. And you almost have to learn to chill out a little bit and just kind of interact with the bits you want to interact with before it makes perfect sense.
I think that's absolutely true. Yeah. So I've seen a few people just have a bit of a, I'm not sure I'm feeling this straight away, response to it.
And I do think in general, the quality of the levels varies depending on which bonanza is built around. And I think some are just more interesting gameplay wise than others. I would say none of them are truly boring or anything, but there's definitely one that I thought, I'm not sure this adds that much really.
And that is the bonanza that is tied to the snow level, Matthew. I thought that was a shrug for me.
That's the only one that's got a song I can tolerate.
I mean, the music we should debate at some point as well, because I'm also a bit mixed on the music in those particular tracks, definitely. But yeah, I can say it's that thing where they're trying to, I guess they're trying to educate you in with something new. So you're almost getting that out of your system before you're dropped into a proper world.
Sort of makes sense, but it just means that there isn't that minute one, there isn't that breath of the wild, kind of like the first 10 minutes of this will be one of the best things that ever happened to you in a game. That's just not the case here. It's just, it's a slightly dull tutorial, I would say.
It's very telling that the first screen shot most people post in this game is the lagoon layer, and it's like the shot from the top of the lagoon layer looking down, and they're just like fuck yes, this is obviously going to be a fun place. Like no one is taking a picture of like mud mountain covered in monkeys and going like yes, fucking woohoo, I get to dig through a load of fucking dirt, you know.
Yeah, the Switch could never handle that many monkeys, Matthew, but what an upgrade for Switch 2.
It is a bit of an odd opening. I don't know, my relationship, because I felt like I'd already played it, because that was what the preview was when we played it, that Switch event. So I kind of knew it was coming, and I just wanted to kind of get through it, and I did get through it pretty fast to get to the lagoon layer.
And that's where, I think the second it gives me the exploding boulders, that's where I'm in my happy place in that game.
So yeah, this game is divided into layers. You are trying to get to this planet core, and it basically is a fancy way to separate the levels, I guess is also a reference to the fact that Donkey Kong always kind of goes up those different layers in the original arcade game.
I hadn't thought that until you said that, and that makes perfect sense.
That's got to be it, right? It's because his whole thing is like...
He's the famous climbing Nintendo character, and here he is descending to Earth's core. Yeah.
Yeah. I think that kind of makes sense. So, yeah, which is a nice way of doing it, and it does mean you get these impressive moments of, you know, it does...
There are no loading screens in this game, and it just basically... After the first time they load you in, maybe?
I don't even really know if they do that. There are short loading screens between levels.
Yeah, okay, and it does actually have to load when you like die and come back, so that's not totally true, but it does do this thing between... When you get to a world, it normally has multiple layers to it, and it will seamlessly move from one to another, and that's very impressive. It, again, will show you something that the Switch couldn't do.
But with these... Yeah, like I say, with these levels, I think personally for me that the mechanics fit some better than others, or that the bonanza, like I say, just makes you think about them in more interesting ways, or unlocks a greater level of creative potential. And I was curious if you think, A, that's true, and I guess, B, what are some highlights from you of how they execute on there?
I definitely saw different layers as homes to mechanics that I liked more or less, which I guess is what you're saying there. Some of them are like, this is like a playground designed to teach you this bonanza. Do I like this bonanza transformation?
That will probably decide how much I like the level. A lot of them were defined by particular materials, where like, this material is largely only here. A lot of them are kind of brought together in some of the late game challenges, but for the most part, they kind of ration out a lot of the good stuff I think in this game.
Yeah, I really liked, not an interesting layer, but there's this layer called the Divide, where you can go in like one of two directions, but within that very small level, there's this like teleporting jelly, which I really, really like. That's a fucking incredible mechanic. Like you have sort of two panels of jelly, and when you punch it in one panel, it is destroyed, and then it appears in the other panel, if that makes sense.
So it's kind of a kind of jelly riff on the classic 3D Mario levels that this team has often made, where there are platforms that can change as you're moving. You know, like there was the flip switch galaxy and galaxy, where every time you did a spin jump, the level realigned, you know, or the beat, the beat block galaxy, I think it was, where on the beat, the level would switch between two states. This is kind of like their destructible terrain version of that.
It's like when you destroy terrain here, it becomes terrain there. And you know, it's the old cliché, like that's a mechanic you could build a whole game out of if you wanted to. And it's kind of like here and not many other places.
Yeah.
Like, I was quite kind of sad to leave it behind.
It reappears every now and then, and you're like, oh, yes, this is so good.
And every time it does, I'm like, yeah, it's my guy. It's my guy, the jelly. I mean, it was in the direct, so I figure we can talk about it.
I really love the rainbow, is it lift off rock or something? Lift up rock? Which is, yeah, this kind of rainbow coloured rock that, when you hold it, it levitates.
So you basically like fly up into the air and you can use it to fly up to platforms. You can't reach or just go up really high and have a good look around, which is a perfectly understandable thing to do. They happen to give it to you in quite simple, but quite a massive level that you will just want to look at because it's pretty.
So having this cool levitating rock, it's like a photo mode set tree, isn't it? You can kind of get yourself somewhere interesting for a good snap. So yeah, I guess that's really how I think of the layers in the game is like, which ones really gave me the stuff?
I'm not going to spoil it because you haven't got there yet, but I'd say the last main world in the game has something that is so back page coded, you're going to laugh your ass off when you see it.
All right, interesting.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, one layer I really love in this, and I will not spoil it because I think it's a nice thing to discover for yourself, is what I would describe as a respite layer from the other layers. It's very much coded as, take a break, enjoy yourself. And I would say, I think I am, no, I won't spoil what my analogy was.
I might save the analogy for a very brief spoiler section we'll have at the end of this episode, because I think it will give too much away. But that too has a brilliant one-off mechanic in it, that you said to me, have you done this thing in it? Yeah, and I was like, no.
And then I went and did it, and I was just like, filled with absolute delight. And so, yeah, I think it's, yeah, it just, it's smartly layers in these different ideas. I think it does result in a game that is not inconsistent, but not always firing on all cylinders.
Sometimes a level might just be good as opposed to great. That's personally how I felt playing through the game so far. But then, yeah, but within every level, you will often find some ideas that really kind of blow you away.
And how those are delivered is something I want to talk about, Matthew, but you've got a comedy question to ask here. So I'm going to let you do that before I move on in the episode plan.
If you've got to live on one of these layers for the rest of your life, which one are you picking that you've played so far?
Well, it would probably be the level I just mentioned. Although I think I'd get bored of that after like a week or so. Do you know what's got the most functioning society out of all these?
Are you a big like hanging with the Fractones guy?
I don't know how I feel about the Fractones. I'm currently on one of the sidequests types in this game. You got to find the four little dudes who are hitting the environment.
They get so comically hard that you're properly like smacked. I feel like I've turned, you know like when you see it in a film, like the FBI turns over a flat to find some drug dealer or something. That's me in these levels and I got to find these little blue dudes.
Are you currently in the level with the fourth Bonanza?
Yeah, that's right.
And yeah, that one is an absolute pain in the ass. The find four things in that level. I remember that specifically, like literally took me half an hour to do.
Oh yeah.
I just had to like strip the room to its bones and I still couldn't find this little motherfucker. He was hidden in such a weird place.
The annoying thing about that objective is, that objective type is there'll be one little blue dude who says to you, find my friends and then the camera will pull out suggesting that's the space in which you find him. And at first it's like one little mound or embedded in this one little cliff. And then it's like the camera pulls back until you've got a landmass the size of Hampshire and then they go, go find our four little dudes.
One might be hidden in fucking Salsea, one might be hidden in fucking Southampton, one might be on the Isle of Wight. And yet, yes, you're there for ten hours tearing the place up.
I'll tell you what, Donkey Kong Bonanza level set in the coloured cliffs of Isle of Wight.
Yeah, absolutely, beating the shit out of that sand. That would actually work really well.
That would be an incredible level where, as you just mine through it, all the coloured sand. The Isle of Wight Tourist Board should get on that DLC right away because that is gold.
Absolutely. Also, you know, like it could have been a great bit of marketing to have like Donkey Kong beating the shit out of the cliffs of Dover. Do you know what I mean?
In the UK, Mr. Beat not doing that. Like if you did that, you'd win like the Cannes Lion advertising awards.
That's it. You could even have like sort of Kenneth Branagh doing a riff on his character from Dunkirk and just sort of like watching from the beaches of France to seas in the distance, like an ape beating the shit out of it. And it's just, then the camera pulls this Donkey Kong and Dover's got a fucking hole ripped in it.
And he just says, Kong.
Exactly. Perfect. Send that to press.
It's a winner. So to answer your question, I live in the forest, Matthew, for a simple reason, they've got a hotel there.
Yeah.
And it's got like a bunch of facilities. And once you get the, I don't even know what the enemies are, but once you get those and like the big red bramble out of the way, it's a pretty hospitable place. So I don't live in that hotel.
I mean, a lot of the environment you have to access, you know, by being an ostrich, which is tough. But I think I could ask for a lift every now and then if I really need it. There are some barrels to get around.
What's your answer to this?
The problem with the hotel is that some of its facilities are just permanently fucked because there's two robotic caterpillars that infinitely respawn and eat the room when you're in it. And that is so stressful because I think the room they're in is like the restaurant. So you could never have dinner in that place without those things eating all the furniture until they, I don't know, if they reset when you sleep or something.
Yeah, it's like the shining up in there. It's not ideal. It's also like a hotel with about three rooms in it.
They're not really going to be making bank from that. You don't even have to pay to stay there.
So, yeah, it's so the giant egg shell that is the outer wall of that hotel. That is so good to punch through because your initial hit like cracks it. And you can just tell they've they must have boiled like a million eggs and looked at them to get that texture right.
Like it's it's absolutely perfect. There's nothing. Well, there are a few things more satisfying than like cracking a soft boiled egg, I think.
And so like having that sensation like on tap in this game, like that's that's a back of the box feature for me.
I think in general, they're very good at picking things that are fun to punch through fruit. They do giant fruit and that's fun to punch through.
It sounds really like wet when you're in it. Like it feels like gooey. Like there's a watermelon, when you're in a bit of watermelon, you're like, I know what the sensation of eating watermelon is like.
I know what it feels like with my teeth mined through watermelon. And they have captured the essence of that in a monkey.
Yeah, Kojima emoji. The disc gonna get that one Matthew. That's from you describing the melon there.
What? No, it's true. It's very satisfying.
There's also some fruit has like a button on top when you press it and then the fruit explodes for no reason.
And you're like, yeah, I mean, that's that needs to exist in real life because peeling fruit like now, when I'm trying to be a healthy eater, like peeling oranges, that's that sucks. If there was a little button that exploded the peel, I'd pay like five quid for that feature.
Yeah. But then like you get given the wrong thing and you actually get given a very tiny Donkey Kong. He just punches the shit out of your orange.
Just like just goes inside it.
That isn't what I want.
No, that's not. You have to return it and go, excuse me, sir. I thought I was buying a small tool.
You've sold me a tiny video game monkey and I'm not happy about it. Anyway. So this is where I really want to ask about the structure of the game in more detail, Matthew, because Donkey Kong Bonanza makes extensive use of optional challenge areas.
There are so many bits you find where there's a bit of purple shit on it. So Pauline's does a little bit saying, whoa, whoa. You hear about fucking 9 million times.
Now you've heard me do it. So apologies for that. That was good.
And then you get a little bit. And then the purple stuff disappears. And then you go in there, you might have a combat challenge.
We have to beat a certain type of enemy in a certain period of time. You might have to just get from one side of the environment to another while collecting these ambiguous non-edible glass bananas, which are your sort of like main currency in this game that you use to upgrade your abilities. Again, something I don't think I've seen in a Nintendo platform before, Matthew, that kind of upgrade approach.
That's quite new as well. So one of the other ways in which this feels like maybe a newer or younger team is working on it, because that's a quite contemporary approach to game mechanics. So what's interesting is the optional challenges, I would say, are usually the most stimulating stuff in the game.
And I think it's deliberately designed to have you play them, because you know that the bananas are important to you, and they very clearly message that you need to get those bananas. But I think that it means that it turns what could be, what feels like a kind of strange knockabout exploration game with a bit of combat and a lot of environmental smashing into something much more stimulating, because here they get to much more directly go, here's a physics puzzle, or like here's a sort of platforming challenge. And I would say there's some sublime game design in there.
So what do you make of that structure? Because it reminded me of Breath of the Wild and how it uses shrines.
Definitely reminded me of Breath of the Wild. Often the challenge rooms, they have like a secret tutorial element to them, you know, in that, you know, it will kind of make you really think about one material or one particular move, you know, for like five minutes. And then it's often like near those materials in the game, so that you can come out and go, oh, well, I just mastered turf surfing in that challenge room, and now I could maybe use that turf surfing here, and that's, you know, Breath of the Wild did that quite subtly as well, just things being near things you could learn about, which made sense.
Also reminds me a little bit of Splatoon, like the single player campaigns in Splatoon, which were quite like self-contained levels, little kind of gauntlets, which recognized that in this very freeform, expressive navigation tool that the Splatoon characters have, you could actually like really zoom in on it and make it into something quite difficult as well. And that's, that's what I enjoy the most about the Challenge Rooms here is I feel like they can strip away, you know, a lot of the kind of like noise around the rest of the game and make you appreciate like the beauty of a particular mechanic or the depth of a particular mechanic. And yeah, it is where some of the hardest stuff in the game is, you know, without spoiling it, like some of the post credit stuff is like more Challenge Roomy in flavor than open world.
And yeah, it just feels like the space that they're fully in control of. And, you know, you aren't like, you can't just like dig your way to victory or like find some kind of cheap way round. And, you know, but I felt similar about the, there were the rooms, the sort of top hat doors in Odyssey, which had a very similar structure, often with like a hidden moon or two in them, so that you were like, well, this is the core idea, but if I can sort of fuck with this space a little bit, if I really think about it, I can find something else.
Yeah, in my ideal world, they'll just like release like another hundred of these as DLC. That would be amazing. I'd love that.
If I could grow any bit of the game, it would be like make more of these challenge rooms. Because I think you just, you realize things that you probably wouldn't ever realize in the course of the game because you have so many options and you can just walk around so many things and ignore them. But here, it's like deal with my brilliance.
You have no choice but to appreciate what we've made here. It is really satisfying.
You get to see how high the ceiling goes, the game's potential, and in a way that the main game never quite shows you. Because like you say, it's almost feels like it's layered so that if you're a kid, you can smash through this game and never be challenged by those things and still reach the end. And that feels maybe deliberate because of the different types of audience we play in this.
But yeah, I think it's where they show the real smarts. It's funny because I personally feel like what I've played so far, it's got the exact right amount of them. And I don't know how I would feel about playing loads them back to back without an open world that breaks them up a little bit.
So I personally think they're just very, they just like they just go together so well in terms of how they break each other up, you know. But I definitely agree that it's a designer showing you, look how fucking smart we are.
Yeah, I just think if they gave me like another layer to explore as DLC, I mean, they're not going to do it. They didn't grow Odyssey like this. But for example, I feel like I've done every kind of digging I want to do in my 45 hours of this game.
I can't really picture what that layer could be that would like to reignite my interest in that. Whereas I know that there's like combinations of the weirder materials that emerge as the game goes on that they could do a lot more with. And I personally think they only hint at the full potential in the end game.
I actually think Odyssey is one of the areas Odyssey is stronger, is the way it basically goes back in, like, layers, some sort of extra hard stuff, or harder stuff, in every level you've been in once you've completed it. Yeah, this doesn't quite do that without getting into it too much, but it, and you can't help but compare it to that Odyssey and feel like, ah, I would have liked a little bit more, you know? It's maybe why I came out of it, not with that, like, 10 out of 10 in my mind, just because I'd sort of, there's a little bit of disappointment right at the end once you've, like, run out of stuff to do, and you're like, ah, I'm just kind of collecting fossils now, I'm not sure if this is, like, the dream.
Yeah, I understand that. You know, you are obviously neglecting your Isle of Wight level there, Matthew, if they added that to the game.
I mean, if they had that, this is the fucking Edge 10, dare I say, the first Edge 11.
Exactly, and they've got, but they've spread 900 little challenge rooms across the Isle of Wight. And so you're like, I'm just going to punch my way through Black Gang China. Oh, guess what?
I just found another challenge. You're delighted, you know. You just fuck up a P&O ferry and find another one inside there.
You know what I mean? Like, it's...
To see the words popping up on screen, the hidden banana in cows.
Perfect. And so, yeah, I take your point though. I mean, I'm definitely going to get to that point with a smashing as well where I've seen everything it could offer.
Let's talk about Bonanza Transformation Smash. How do you feel about these from the perspective of game design, but also what the fuck is this to look at?
Game design, I think they're solid. They've just come out of a game. Where they let you turn into 20 different really interesting things.
And there were some really weird control schemes in Odyssey. Those little birds that stick their beaks into the walls and then ping themselves up. Or those concertina caterpillars that wheeze like a squeeze box when you stretch out.
For my money, I don't think any of the Bonanzas are as fun or interesting as those to just mess around with very briefly. Like, when they've built a specific challenge for them, you know, like an obstacle course, often in like, you get those challenge rooms that you can only access as a Bonanza transformation. Like, that's where they feel at their best, as with many of the mechanics in this game.
I think when you're just left to mess around with them, on your own devices, and again, I'm speaking as someone who is like, very much in the end game of this, they become... they're just too powerful as tools, and going back to earlier levels with later Bonanzas, if you're not... if you don't restrict your usage, you know, if you don't have that self-control, you can just absolutely rinse these levels, and you can look at a bit of level design and go, oh, I can see that there's a puzzle there, but I'm just going to like fucking jump over it or whatever, because I can now.
And that didn't feel very satisfying to me. So I'd say my relationship with the Bonanzas has slightly curdled in that. Mechanically, I just see them as like quite blunt instruments now, which I didn't really feel like in the course of the game, I enjoyed getting to like getting to know their powers.
I did not enjoy getting to know like their looks and their general vibes, which I found incredibly off-putting.
Yeah.
There is something. Yeah, I just can't put my finger on what it is that makes me feel very uneasy about them. It's like sort of Donkey Kong furry content.
And if you're into that, that's fine. There's no judgment here, but it's...
I'm judging. I'm out here judging.
Oh, you are judging.
You shouldn't be into that. Not this particular game. Not these particular creatures.
We've got to draw the line somewhere, Matthew.
I'm not really into animals becoming other animals. I felt similar about the werehog when Sonic went through that period of his life.
Oh, brutal. The original Bonanza, the werehog. What a dunk.
Yeah, it's just too... I can get away with the one level of embarrassment that is playing as a giant animal in a game to begin with, but when it becomes another, yeah, slightly... Yeah, I can't...
I almost say they're not sexy, but there's something about them.
Well, they're just... They're cursed. That's what the word curse was made for, really.
And so, yeah, I mean, I think they... I think I agree with you that I never really like, oh, this is the one that really unlocks this game, the game for me in this particular way.
Yeah.
They're all kind of like these quite blunt tools, you know, they are like solutions to problems. But I think that they embody that sort of mushiness we were describing, the lack of precision to the navigation of the different worlds in this game, you know, and so, and occasionally allow you to sort of bend or break the game just to make a section a little bit easier. So, for example, in the challenge rooms, I just did one earlier where you pick up, it's the one I mentioned earlier where you can basically turn Donkey Kong into a train by picking up a rock and then sliding down these little tracks and jumping between these tracks.
There was one I couldn't reach and I didn't have a rock handy, so I just turned into the ostrich thing, flew over there, got the banana and then left the level. And it's like that's kind of what it's for sometimes, it's just...
Did that feel good though?
It did, but it's not as elegant as when you're playing as basic Donkey Kong and you identify that there's a hidden room underneath something that you're standing on and then you find this like really neat way to drop down and find your way in. There are moments of, there are eureka moments that are more satisfying than others in this game. And so I would say that only on rare occasions do the Bonanzas really offer those, but I will say that they do offer like quite a fun sense of physicality.
Some of them, particularly the basic first Kong one you get, just properly smashing shit up. And the fourth one that we won't spoil in this part of the episode, Matthew, just those are ones where I was like, oh wow, the way I can mess around with this environment is actually like exciting. It's more exciting than the base Donkey Kong.
And in that respect, they do their jobs. But I think I agree with you. I don't think you'll come out of them thinking, this is Nintendo doing something amazing that I never thought they would do.
They have subverted my expectations. Well done, Miyamoto and company. They're really not like that.
They, like I say, blunt tools I think is right. Yes, fair, as a description.
If you want to fully complete this game, you're going to have to show some like quite precise mastery of those characters, I'll say, at some point.
Okay, interesting.
But you come out of that going, oh, there was quite a bit more to those. And I wish there was a bit, I wish there was like more of an on ramp to that level of difficulty that they eventually find. I wish there was just a better gradient, I guess, from like the beginning of the game to the end of the game.
Most of the game feels like one level to me, and then suddenly it steps up two levels, and then that's it. I don't know, I never really had to master a huge amount to get through like 95% of this game.
Yeah.
But you can master, like there is space for that mastery. Like even, I mean, this is maybe a weird comparison, but like Mario Odyssey had that very, very flexible control scheme, like he had so many moves, there's so much he could do, and the way they best expressed that was by having those like time trials built into the levels where you could see ghosts of other players and you could see like, like the mad moves people were stringing together and the routes that they were taking to like cut off huge parts of a level. I think this game has the means to be as expressive as that.
It just doesn't have any kind of system to like test it. Like there is no equivalent of that, you know, and I was slightly surprised by that because I think there is enough going on under the hood here that I think it would be interesting to see how lots of different people are trying to achieve something in a given time. But they never really go there and that felt like a little bit of a backward step to me.
That's interesting. This is what's good about you having reviewed this and having a little time for your perspective on it to settle, I think, is that you've got a really good grasp of the overall structure of it and what does and doesn't work. And I actually got to say, it's nice hearing you dissect a Nintendo game without feeling like you've got an emotional stake in it, you know?
I mean, I do have an emotional stake in it.
Right, but this doesn't feel like Tears of the Kingdom when I think that maybe you were... Maybe it's because of how hard I was going against the crafting systems.
Yeah, it's easier. Yeah, because you also like this, so...
Well, that's it. So I think that maybe creates a bit of a safer space for you to be like, well, this is what doesn't quite work about it structurally.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm just a reasonable human being. I will happily say if something's not up to scratch, you know? I think it's funny that I like technically have one of the lowest scores for this game on Metacritic.
But-
That's the Guardian's scoring system, though, isn't it?
But that probably, yeah, yeah. I would have probably given it a nine if I had the option to. But-
Still twice as good as Mind's Eye based on that scoring system. And, you know, I agree, frankly, it is twice as good as Mind's Eye, Matthew. If not more so.
Yeah, okay. So those are my sort of like larger questions about the game, really, Matthew. I think we kind of covered a lot of the key stuff there.
So-
I did like this question about where is I at on Pauline?
Oh, no, I've got a lot. I want to ask all these questions, but I'm saying like a lot of the juicy game design questions you've done. These are, you know, these are all the, yeah, slightly more superficial ones.
So I did want to ask you Donkey Kong's redesign. We'll come back to Pauline. I like that he doesn't seem to really know what's going on in the game's plot a lot of the time.
Like, he just sort of goes, oh, and like, while Pauline's explaining something. And I like that he's sort of only partially a willing participant in what's actually occurring. And I found that very charming and liked his, liked his character design.
But what did you think of that? As someone who probably quite enjoys the animation touches of Nintendo games?
Yeah, I mean, he's a great Donkey Kong. It's not like a character I have a huge emotional connection to. I've liked a lot of the games he's been in, but I'm not like particularly protective of a particular era of Donkey Kong.
Like, as a side note, I think it is quite interesting how this game reckons with like the history of Donkey Kong as a whole. Like, when I was going into it to review it first, I was thinking, oh, I wonder if there's going to be like an into this about, like, which Donkey Kong are we kind of dealing with here? And I actually thought, you know, that's going to be too, too complicated a thing for the more general Guardian audience.
So let's not do that. But it is interesting to see this game have a lot of references to like arcade Donkey Kong and pull from that. Like, you know, literally that first mine level is full of like the iconography of the girders.
And I think they talked in the interview about like, there's a lot of like turquoise and pink in this game, which are the, you know, the two core colors of the levels in the Donkey Kong arcade game. So it like runs through it like that. But then you also have Donkey Kong Country, which Nintendo have a weird relationship with, like specifically Rare's era of Donkey Kong Country, because they didn't make it in house.
And there's always this, you know, rumormongering that Miyamoto is a, was a little like down on it, or thought it was a bit of like all flash and no trousers. And yeah, here they are, like acknowledging the music, recreating some levels directly in some like throwback homages.
Delightfully I will say as well, like delightfully.
Yeah, I mean, the funny thing is that you play them and they're so easy because you're so powerful and competent as this Donkey Kong, compared to like those same levels in the original, which were like a pain in the ass because he was such a like wretch to keep alive. You know, and now he's got like, you know, a 10 heart health bar if you invest in it. And back then he'd like one hit and he was fucked.
Yeah, that's interesting. But like, you know, they could have very easily like cut out the rare stuff entirely and like not referenced any of it. And maybe in their mind they'll say, oh, we're actually referencing Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze, which we made with Retro.
But you know, I think if you play it all the way to the end, there's clearly respect here for that rare line. Very dubious bit of crediting at the end where it's like, Donkey Kong is created by Miyamoto. No mention of any of the rare people at all.
And you're like, I don't know. I mean, someone else did design these other characters, but okay.
Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, and you get a bit of Cranky Kong. He's out there, isn't he?
Is he in each level, Cranky Kong? I've only met him once so far.
Yeah, he's basically like finding Captain Toad in the previous 3D Mario games. It's like you could find Cranky and he does like one of his comedy monologues.
His Type-5, Matthew.
He does a Type-5 on that level. That should be the name of the gem that pops up. Cranky's Tropical Type-5.
Cranky's Canyon Type-5.
Where was I going with all this chat?
DK Redesign is where we started.
DK Redesign. Well, yeah. But fundamentally, they reference pretty much every era of DK, but he is his own thing for this world.
I'd say this is like, if there is a Mario Odyssey cinematic universe, I'd say this DK exists in that and he is the DK of that world. In the same way that Mario Odyssey pulled on all these previous references to Mario to honor him from, you know, literally from DK forwards, this does the same. And I really liked it, I just thought it was really, really well judged.
I think like, if you've ever had any connection with this character, it's kind of represented in this game in some way. And that's nice, you know, there's a time when Nintendo might have been a bit sniffy about doing that, I think, given that he was made by, you know, not them for a bit.
It's funny, because I don't really have any relationship to Donkey Kong.
You shrug it all off.
Well, it's a bit like when the Cranky Kong stuff was happening, I was like, I know a reference is happening to me right now, but I can't pass any bit of it, really.
I sense nostalgia is happening.
Yeah, I'm sure someone, I'm sure Andy Robinson is delighted by this, that's going to be what I thought when I was playing that bit. But I did play like Dinny Kong Racing, I had friends who were massively into that game, and I did play a bunch of Donkey Kong 64 as well. But by no means would I say, Donkey Kong Country, absolutely none of it.
I've played those games ever so briefly on, probably on emulators or whatever, but at the behest of a big boy, in case Nintendo are listening. But yeah, it's a big boy. I meant a little boy.
Big boy?
What? Don't read into that. Just don't think about it too hard.
Yeah, so no relationship to it really. I think a lot of people will feel the same. I think a lot of people just, because when was, well, that is not true because Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, a game I absolutely love and I have not finished but I've played most of.
That is as much as it really gets. But even then, I think you can identify the Donkey Kong iconography that pops up here, like the mine carts and the 2D levels and all that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
So I do think it honors that very neatly while also feeling like I'm not like this is ground, this you're on the ground level with this Donkey Kong, you know, it all starts here kind of thing. So yeah, I think it works. I find his expressions delightful.
I find it delightful when you fall off and then a balloon picks you up. In the 2D levels, he just hangs there like when you pick up a dog with one hand, just like arms and legs just like dropped basically, just like he has no function. That's delightful.
Yeah. And lots of like the sound effects are just like, yaw, I'm a bit like that about it.
I really like that when you talk to the elders who give you the transformations, they're always ask you like, what are you trying to achieve here? Because the concept is that when you get to the earth center, there's going to be a wish. I think they say, what are you going to wish for if you get there?
And the three dialogue choices every single times are like bananas, which is what he wants, get to the surface, which is what Pauline wants or both. And I just like the idea that you can be like idiot Donkey Kong, be like just bananas. I just want the bananas.
I don't care about the other things. Even though you have the option to say both, you can still ought not to. He just loves those bananas.
It's very endearing.
He does. And him, I got to say as well, I do like the little... When you borrow out a hideout in these levels, you pay a little blue lad with a hard hat on to dig you through the side of a cliff.
And you have a little bedroom and a little record player and a little... Wardrobes, you can change clothes. The different clothes have various power.
Different sort of like, you know, stat increases basically.
You also have a butler outside.
Oh, I never noticed that, do you?
Yeah, there's like a little black frac tome with like a bow tie on. And like he looks like he's in a tuxedo.
I never noticed. Maybe my eyesight is totally fucked.
He can turn into like other shops. He can turn into the shops for you.
Oh, I did just notice him for the first time.
Yeah, he's got butler energy to me. A man who's never had a butler.
Well, it's just very nice when DK and Pauline have a little nap in the middle of a level. What is less nice is when Pauline starts asking dumb questions during the nap. However, it's now time to discuss Pauline, Matthew, who I found mostly fine.
What are your thoughts on Pauline?
I guess my biggest question with Pauline is what you make of her singing and songs, because her primary purpose in the game is to like… She sings a song that turns you into your transformation. It's not just the theme tune, like it is the thing that's powering it, it's how I read it anyway.
So she's on your shoulder, like, belting out these quite weird musical numbers that I couldn't always place what they were trying to riff on. Like, there's one for like a, there's a zebra and she sings this like, it feels like this Latin sort of pop number. That's the only one I really like.
The other songs are, I don't really know what they are, they like, they're what, in my head, they're what I imagine like K-pop to be.
I think that's a bit brutal on K-pop to be honest. I think it's, they remind me a bit of like, each one has a bit of a 3D Sonics theme tune energy to it. You know what I mean?
Where it's like, two-toothed Sonic Warriors, a bit of that, but like not even that catchy really. It's just a bit of a, yeah, I don't really, I don't love those. Well, being a bit sort of up and down on the music more generally in this game, there's like quite a lot of level tracks that I like.
There are some that I don't really think about at all in that, I know, I was probably very annoying for the listeners when I was quite dismissive of the Mario Kart World soundtrack on this podcast. I do apologize, that probably was too reductive there. I do engage with the music more here and there are some levels that kind of go for a slightly more atmosphere.
But in general, yeah, you'll hear that Bonanza music a lot, and I don't quite know what it's going for. I'm sort of like, oh, this is a bit of an endurance test for the years, this.
Yeah, because you can't place it. I think some of the lyrics are like nonsense speak, right?
I have no idea. If it turns out that they're Japanese and we're being racist, that's a bad look for your boy.
I've really listened closely to them. They're hard to place.
Yeah, I thought that too. I couldn't quite work out what they were.
I only like the one where she sings about being a zebra because that's the only bit I really understand is when she goes, zebra, zebra. But like the donkey cut, the big one is just dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum. I couldn't tell you what she's saying.
I assume it's about being a big old gorilla.
I guess the thing is, it's meant to, is it meant to sound like this is a little girl who's just riffing this on the spot? Because she does, right? I just came up with this song while we're performing.
But thus, her journey in the game is about becoming like a, I don't know, whatever she is in Odyssey, like a lounge singer. That's the B plot of Donkey Kong Bonanza. It's can she find her voice?
The Rogue One of the Mario 3D games, Matthew. Is that what you're saying? This is Rogue One leads directly into Pauline becoming a lounge singer and then...
Well, we've got to assume in that she's belting out the tunes in Odyssey. That's what she goes on to do. I wrote in my notes, she's no Cynthia Harrell belting out Snake Eater.
No, she sure ain't. I'm with you on that one, buddy.
When she does her song to break the void seals, she does that little whale that you did earlier.
Yes, I did a great job, didn't I?
You did. I always think that's about to turn into Lulu's cover of You Make Me Want To Shout. You know at the start where she's like, well, I always think it's that.
And then I'm slightly disappointed that she just like screamed a bit of tape off a door.
As ever. I mean, we're always learning little drips and drabs about your music taste, Matthew.
I'm not saying that's my music taste. I'm saying I know what that song is. I've heard it and it makes me think of it.
That's fine. I don't really think you have like a Lulu CD in your collection or anything like that. And if you did, I wouldn't judge.
Anyway, so yeah, Paulie, what about her sort of as a presence in the game? Like the little kid thing. Do you think that's charming?
Does that does that does it even register?
Yeah, it's fine. Like it kind of makes sense to have her there to like voice what's going on in the plot. It's not not that Mario speaks in his, but there's a little bit more going on.
And, you know, the enemies, they talk to you in the cutscenes, they're the evil void monkeys. And so having her there just to sort of like react and and move stuff along, that makes sense. Crucially, she doesn't, I feel, break the cardinal sin of being like too present as an AI companion.
Like she's not saying like, hey, Donkey Kong, we should throw some mud at that thing or whatever, you know, she just occasionally goes like, nice move or like, this is fun. And that's, but she doesn't say it so often that I'm like, shut up.
Or she goes, are you okay? Which is when normally when you've been damaged quite a lot and you need to eat some apples immediately.
She isn't solving the puzzles for you, you know, she isn't saying like, use the terrain defamation, Donkey Kong.
You haven't turned into a cursed looking ostrich for a while, Donkey Kong.
For a while. That's always how they phrase it in these games.
Yeah, it's true.
I wonder what it feels like to turn into that ostrich right about now.
Yeah, that's when you know a game's been through like fucking five rounds of internal testing or whatever. And like, we've got this agency to do this and you're like, yeah, well, just make sure you're a minor, there can be an ostrich, please. That's very important.
See a game gets a nine out of 10.
Yeah, that's part of it. She doesn't do that. So that's that's good.
You get to put her in some goofy little costumes. That's quite fun.
The costumes are cute. The cost. I like all of Donkey Kong's trousers.
His tie. My partner said he looks very dapper.
And I agree in the last level, you can buy some fucking brilliant trousers. You got that forward too.
I mean, we both we surely you empathize as well as a larger mammal who was always struggling to find trousers. You know, I was delighted to see my guy sort of like looking flash. You know, they fit well.
It was a great fit, as the kids say. You know, like it's, yeah, all good, really. Okay, I've got two more questions to really wrap up this, Matthew.
Then we've got a brief, a very, very short spoiler section, but then a little kind of hall of fame for DK Games as well. After a quick break, Matthew. So is this more of a killer app for the Switch 2 than Mario Kart World was?
For me, yes, but that's because I like single player Nintendo games more. It isn't any more sophisticated take than that. I feel like between this and Mario Kart World, you've kind of got both sides of the coin covered pretty comfortably.
You've got a pretty great multiplayer game and a pretty great single player game within two months of a concert coming out and I don't know, that seems good, right?
Yeah, I think this will feel more like it's showing you something you've never seen before, which is, I think, perhaps more of what I'm looking for when I buy a new console, or at least historically I did before they stopped bothering to do that with launch games for consoles. And it became some other weird criteria. Although the Astro Bot pack-in game did that very well on PS5.
So yeah, I would say that I agree with you. I think that those two as a pair works really well. That's why when we talked about the Switch 2 in the episode, I wasn't really invested in the, oh, it's launched without any games.
What a big deal this is. Narratives, because I thought they were all bullshit and I knew they dissipate as soon as Donkey Kong came out. It did, it has.
I feel like I was correct on that one. You were correct when you said that a Donkey Kong game would come out on Switch 2 as a launch title or near the launch window before Mario, Matthew. That's a prediction you made on a previous episode, right?
That's the only time I've ever got one of those things right. Unbelievable. It is exciting.
I don't know if everyone is inevitably comparing this to the one-two punch of Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey in the first year of Switch. It ain't that. No, it isn't that.
But it's also two things in quite quick succession. If they manage to get Metroid Prime 4 out and that is absolutely rock solid, I think this will be a pretty good year.
I agree. I'd be really curious to see what next year looks like. My guess would be that this is not the only game that this team's been working on for the last, what, eight years?
So I think we'll see a 3D Mario maybe in like a year or two as well. And I don't know, Zelda's going to be a longer wait, I'm sure. But yeah, I think that's a really solid, as console launchers go these days, really strong pair, you know?
You know, I've just played, like I say, 45 hours of this, and I can only have that experience in this one place. I really liked having it. It's been really fun in this moment.
People who do have Switch 2's generally seem on board with this game. It's quite nice to see our peers getting into it. It's always fun to see some Andy Kelly photo threads pop up on blue sky and be like, Oh, this is nice.
We're all enjoying this little moment together. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun to be part of.
It is. And the last very crucial question to pay off the title of the episode, Matthew. Is this better than Astro Bot?
Brackets. Does it have the sauce, the juice or the gravy?
I don't think Astro Bot has been part of this conversation because it is so different. Like, no reviews that I've read have made that comparison. I will say it's pretty redundant kind of pitching them against each other.
That isn't me trying to wiggle out of it. I thought it was better, yeah.
I think it's a touch better for me as well.
It's just a bit more interesting, you know?
Well, I think it is something you've not seen before. I think that one of the reasons that Astro Bot landed so well is because there was a big old gap there when Nintendo made nothing like it, right? And here was a team doing it very competently.
Yeah.
But they've made something new here, you know?
I will also say, because this doesn't have the backbone of a traditional 3D platformer, Astro Bot is the only game doing it. Like Nintendo literally aren't making a game in the Astro Bot mold unless they make a 3D Mario a bit like it. And it's nice to have a very, very shiny, you know, very, very well made version of a straightforward, you know, world by world 3D platformer.
You know, and I can't begrudge it for that. But I just I like the ambition here. And the weird thing is the stuff I like the most in Astro Bot, you know, is where it really threw the power of PS5 around.
And a little bit of me was playing this thinking, you know, oh, I wonder, you know, like, I wonder what they would do with that power and this similar idea. Or, you know, I wonder if they'll raise the stakes with, like, materials, physics, you know, in their next game or because they were really good at that stuff, like the way water trickled down things and all that kind of shit.
Yeah.
You know, it's yeah, they co-exist.
They're very different.
Yeah. What a cop out. Everyone thought I was going to have a meltdown.
If I was really petty about it, the Guardian gave Astro Bot five stars. I gave Donkey Kong four stars. I would have given it five stars if I was really that bothered about making a point.
I think Astro Bot has some incredible highs to it. And yeah, but they are very different. And I actually really appreciate how they use the Nintendo Switch 2's power on things like terrain defamation.
Because like I said earlier in the episode, no one else is doing that. It was very annoying when the Red Faction Guerrilla and its terrible sequel Armageddon were like a dead end for that entire idea. When it was mooted one time by a THQ exec, they would do a Saints Row game in that fashion, which I think destroying a city that looks like a real city would have been quite controversial if you're watching a skyscraper fall down or whatever, because I'm obviously the age we live in.
It's all right if Donkey Kong makes a skyscraper fall down. That's cool.
But it was always gutting that no one did anything with that. I don't even think that these developers have probably even played that. They've probably looked more at things like Minecraft and games like that in terms of how you interact with the environment there and how you can tunnel through an environment and stuff like that.
But the idea of breaking a bit of the game being more malleable than you think it's going to be, that is often I think what things that promise this physics-y elements need to do in order to be a success. Oh, you let me go further than I thought I could. I think this game does do that, from having materials that feel different, from having materials that do specific things like the rainbow-colored rock that you pick up and you start flying off and then Donkey Kong makes a funny little sound and it just finds ways to delight you and it's got, there's much more they can do with it than it seems like there is in that first stretch of game that you play, that first level.
So yeah, they are very different, Matthew. I think for me, yeah, slightly better than Astro Bot, but I really like Astro Bot as well. That's all good.
And crucially, nothing in this game that is as annoying as some of those challenge levels in Astro Bot, particularly the one with that grid full of fire stuff at the start of it. That one properly broke my brain at the end of last year.
Let's see if you still feel that way.
That is true, actually. So let's see how that goes.
Interesting.
Get to the end of the year and it's out of my top 10. You go, what? And then we have that argument.
I will say something I would say quite similar between Astro Bot and Donkey Kong Bonanza is that Astro Bot also had that thing I described where I felt like it was all quite one flavor of difficulty for like the whole thing and then had like a tiny handful of things that spiked and you're like why don't we just you know why don't we just kind of smooth our way into that a little bit and just to have a little bit let me get my sweat on a little bit from like the halfway point. Yeah, I think that's fair enough. Like Odyssey isn't, it also isn't that difficult.
Galaxy isn't that difficult really but I don't know. I would like a little bit of push back.
Bit of friction, yeah. Yeah, I think Astro Bot is definitely not afraid to do that, particularly the challenge levels they've added since then, they are quite sharp. I think they probably do prove the thing you say about how the platform and mechanics are maybe not the sharpest in the world, as sharp as they need to be or sharp as they could be.
Despite I think being of a very high quality, every now and then you just get one obstacle in that game that shows up the ways in which hovering and doing that little laser thing could be slightly more precise, or you as a player could feel like you understand the 3D space of where Astro Bot is in relation to something that's going to kill you. We just a tiny bit more comprehension than you feel like you have from the camera in the game and stuff like that. So yeah, last thing I'll say about this game, Matthew.
I did briefly think about how I was playing a game and taking it very seriously with a character that is called Void Kong. When I read the words Void Kong, I thought I'm 37 years old. That definitely happened to me.
Should we take a quick break, Matthew, and come back with your Hall of Fame for DK Games?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, brief little section here. I don't think we're going to talk about too many spoilery stuff, Matthew, because I think we can just discuss this later in the year, really.
But the one reference I did want to make is that the resort level I was alluding to earlier, which is about halfway through the game, where the game gets you to take a break, does look like they took the play area from Mario 3D World plus Bowser's Fury, specifically the Bowser's Fury bit, and turned it into a holiday destination. That's the one observation I wanted to make. It looks like Butlins came in and were like, you know what, we're just going to take this space, this sort of wide open ocean space with some cool things to jump on, turn it to a nice little holiday area.
Just wanted to make that reference, really. Anything you wanted to clarify from early in the episode or notes here before we get to the top five?
I'm currently being distracted by my neighbors having absolutely horrendous row, so I hope you can't hear that. I can't hear. If you can, it's not in my house.
It's the barking dogs never bite thing all over again, Matthew. It's real life happening around you.
That's fine. A lot of the stuff I'd want to talk about, I don't think you've got to yet.
But I will do soon.
Yeah.
There's a really interesting level later in the game that I want to talk about in a future episode that I think is quite high concepts, kind of a flip of what it does everywhere else. And so, yeah, let's dig into that, as it were. Oh, actually, one thing I did want to say.
I quite like the Void Kong boss fights where you're chasing after him.
I was slightly a bit more mixed on those. I don't think I thought any of the bosses were that good in this game so far, if I'm being honest with you.
I like the Void Kong one because he's just tearing up the levels and deforming the terrain for his own mad, the fairest purposes. And it was just another like, oh yeah, this background is just like a canvas that you can kind of do anything with, with this technology. If he just wants to make a big old pit to like fuck with you, he can.
And I was like, yeah, that's good. That's like the one bit it slightly tanks the framerate, though.
Yes, I noticed that as well.
Because the game's like, oh shit, please don't make 500 enemies in that hole. And yes, yes, he will.
Yeah, it's true. That's the only bit I noticed. That big sort of like, when you got to climb to the top of that thing, he's got loads of obstacles going on.
And you can just feel the number of physics objects like fucking with the game. And those like mud walls he put us up just grind to a whole Resident Evil on 3DS style. You know what I mean?
Just sort of like, yeah, that's the only time you notice it. It's true. That's funny.
So yeah, the only thing I was going to mention is that the, we talked about it briefly, but in that Resort level, the sharks that you kick and they form a little rainbow road. I mean, that fucking rules, doesn't it? I mean, and that's just one idea in one little level.
That level is about 20 minutes long. Yeah, that's good.
That's because you've just spent everything up to that point, destroying, and then you suddenly realize that you can, there are mechanics where you can like make stuff as well.
Yeah.
And then you're like, oh, right, I can make more matter in the world. And what does that mean for this game? And yeah, like bridging an archipelago of giant fruit.
That's pure magic. That's like one of the couple of moments where I got that like, oh, this is as cool as galaxy kind of feeling in my bones.
Yeah, it's sort of, I got like these weird little moments of pride as well, from when you had an area where you've had like three of those shark things, you've kicked them in all these weird directions, and it's formed this bit of modern art in the environment in the distance. I thought that Tony Soprano thing is talking about his dad, like he didn't design it, but he knew how to build it. I had that weird thing of working class pride of, I did that.
Do you know what I mean? I'm responsible for that. It's there.
There's a sense of permanence to it in the environment. Very cool. Okay.
Hall of Fame, Matthew, let's do it, or a top five, as you put it.
Yeah, let's do a top five. And I promise I haven't just devised this to take a big old shit on the original Donkey Kong Country.
As established, we like Rare on this podcast. We wish them well, especially after the last few weeks. So yes.
So I looked at all the things Donkey Kong has appeared in. If Donkey Kong appears in it as a playable character or a key element, I thought it was up for grabs. So my number five is a bit vague, thus automatically collapsing the Hall of Fame.
I'm putting in his appearances in Smash Brothers at number five.
I can see that. There's a definite relationship between those and this game, I think.
I think it's valid from a perspective of like, that is a realisation of the character and its moveset and what he can do and his power. He has quite a specific role. He's always been the big strong Smash Brothers character from the start.
Yes, they added other brutes as it went along, but he's like one of the OGs. Whenever I think of Donkey Kong, I will always think of Smash Brothers because of something Rich McCormick, who used to write for PC Gamer, told me about him and his mates playing it. I've definitely told this story in the podcast, so apologies for long-term listeners.
But they used to play a lot of Smash Brothers on the N64, and they were obsessed with the fact that Donkey Kong wore a tie. They used to joke their own little internal law was that he was going to work, and that this fight had broken out on his way to work. And they used to describe the act of Donkey Kong picking up another character and instead of throwing them, walking off the level to his death with them.
And they used to refer to them as his briefcase. Because they were like, he's going to the office, he's got his tie, now he's got his briefcase, off he goes. And there will always be a little bit of my brain that thinks about Donkey Kong's human briefcase in Smash Brothers.
I see now how this whole top five is basically a bit to dunk on the Donkey Kong Country games. I can see this happening in real time now, Matthew.
Well, I'm not, yeah, but I am saying that that suitcase is better than that series of games, so it's number five.
It said the quiet part out loud, and with that we can move on to number four.
Number four, because I can't maintain the bit long enough. I'm going to put in the modern Donkey Kong Country Returns or Tropical Freeze. You can have either or here.
Tropical Freeze is much better, though.
Donkey Kong Country Returns, for me, because it was the first one, and the one which took a series of games I didn't really care for and did quite a lot of heavy lifting in making it feel exciting to me, you know, it did a lot of the work. Tropical Freeze absolutely finesses it. If you just want to put in Tropical Freeze, I don't really mind.
It's a Donkey Kong Hall of Fame. Like, my well-being doesn't really hinge on this.
So you say.
But, yeah, I'm not including the original Donkey Kong Country because they do look like total ass now, and they are pretty shallow as platformers go. And I replayed Donkey Kong Country 1, specifically, to make this observation for this episode, all the way through, so...
Well, that specific style is just so of its time in a way that, you know, pixel art transcends the 90s, right? It just does.
Yeah.
But that kind of pseudo 3D thing, that does not, unfortunately. There's that Sonic game from the same time that doesn't either. It's just trapped in the 90s, unfortunately.
Yeah. It's a tough break. I know loads of people played it in their formative years, but there's just not a lot to it.
You can't really do much. A lot of that game is about throwing barrels at random walls, hoping there's a secret entrance. That isn't very satisfying.
I don't think it's like hidden exit game is anywhere near as interesting as any of the Mario platformers. But this pair of modern games, I just think they've got much better bones to them.
Very set PC.
Very set PC, but like enjoyably hard platformers. Like, it's one of the only first party games which actually has a bit of bite to them. Loads of secrets to uncover.
Very replayable. Like you say, it's kind of a cinematic platformer is where I've landed on these. Whether it's like the minecart levels and all this mad shit kicking off around you.
But other things like holding on to these great big swinging pendulums or like weird monsters chasing you through a temple. It's just a very exciting game to play through and enjoy. Not a very expressive platformer in the way Marrow is.
You know, it's kind of like do it his way or get fucked.
Yeah, but it's got a whiff. I think this game's got more uncharted to it than, you know, any other 2D platformer I've played. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, no.
It's exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, absolutely. I'd say the only bit where the original games hold up better than these games is, I think the enemies have a lot more charm in the original games. Those Tiki masks in Donkey Kong Country Returns are just like, what a shrug, you know?
Yeah.
Next, number three, Donkey Kong 94, the Game Boy game.
Oh yeah, I played this for an episode that we did, a Climb and Boywich 1. It's good.
Yeah, it's basically Donkey Kong 2, isn't it? It's the sequel to Donkey Kong. You get to the end of the traditional levels of the original Donkey Kong and then, drum roll, there's a hundred more levels for you to climb up.
It just imagines what happens beyond the end of traditional Donkey Kong, which is a great concept for a game. Quite forward thinking and interesting for the time, actually. There's not many other Game Boy games that rift on the source material in this way.
Loads of interesting mechanics introduced along the way as you climb up. Just a very neat puzzle platformer. Also, rare example of a Game Boy game that isn't asked to discover in 2025 if you haven't played it.
Yeah, that's true. I also always laugh when I hear the 94 part of this, which gives it the energy of it should have been bundled in with Madden or something. It's got that vibe about it, but it is legitimately good for sure.
Yeah, so that's definitely up there. You don't technically play as Donkey Kong. He's the enemy, but that's fine.
Number two, my beloved Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, which was EAD Tokyo who went on to become the team that made Odyssey and now Bonanza. So this was technically their first go at Donkey Kong. A score-chasing, high-momentum platformer where you ideally comboed the levels in one constant forwards push while controlling him with a pair of bongo drums.
Absolutely bonkers idea, shouldn't work, but it was the team that was just about to make Mario Galaxy, so they really knew what the fuck they were doing and had just a good feel for mechanics, textures, the look of the thing. A lot of this game feels like a proto-galaxy, you'll literally see bits of level furniture reused later in Galaxy just like five years later. Yeah, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat.
It's a shame that it's kind of rubbish to play it without the bongos, so if they bring this back with just like drumming the controllers, I don't know if I'd be particularly into it.
Lost the time a little bit this game.
A little bit lost the time, but that's okay. We can deal with it, which obviously leaves at number one, the newly anointed king of the Donkey Kong Hall of Fame, Donkey Kong Bonanza.
What a twist, what a twist.
Well, it obviously is the best one, isn't it? It wasn't going to be Donkey Kong 64, was it?
No, and yeah, I think it's fair play. I would be curious to just see what you said about how they could experiment with different types of materials and stuff like that. There's a lot I think you can do with this, potentially, and yeah, even if it doesn't quite reach those Odyssey heights, it's a very, very strong new strand of games for Nintendo to sort of pursue, these 3D terrain deformation games, you know?
Yeah, I would much rather they were making something like this, something new that I hadn't seen, rather than, you know, just relying on like an Odyssey 2. I would obviously love to play Odyssey 2 as well, but I think it's much more interesting that they decided to do this. Gave us a genuinely new experience.
We know that they can do the Mario games. We know that they've probably got a, you know, a Splinter group making them. But a lot of weird fan sort of divining going on, trying to work out like who could possibly be making what, you know, what's the quickest path to another Mario game for me right now?
And you're like, I think, I think Bonanza kind of has, has me sort of, you know, satiated on that front for a little while, you know?
Yeah, I agree with you. I think the one thing I will say is that as much as I like the Retro's 2D games, I do think that Tropical Freeze feels like it is the last word on those a little bit. And if they'd made a third one of those instead of this, I would, I much prefer the world where we get this, you know?
Yeah, and they have said that, you know, they were quite specific that there is like a 3D branch and a 2D branch to the Donkey Kong family, but I just don't see how Retro can possibly have like another one, you know, they're still making Metro Prime 4, that's gonna keep them busy for a while.
I don't also, I don't think it was necessarily a good thing to have lots of 2D Mario games up against the 3D ones at the same time as well. I think it highlights some of the shortcomings of the 2D ones and I wonder if that would happen if Retro were making 2D ones alongside this because this feels so, so much fresher as a, you know, as a type of game and those, despite being very well made, they are built on familiar parts. And so, yeah, I would rather have the thing that's taking the bold swings and the thing that feels like something I've played before, you know?
Yeah.
No, I get that. That makes perfect sense. And that's what we have.
It's a good Hall of Fame, Matthew, but regrettably it's been destroyed by Donkey Kong because it was made of deformable terrain, the Hall of Fame. So it's much like the cliffs in the Isle of Wight. It's been absolutely fucked up by a big monkey and a small girl companion.
That's tough, isn't it? But, you know, we've got insurance, so we can rebuild this place in no time, you know? OK.
And on that slightly labored note, we come to the end of the podcast, Matthew. So, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBasilPesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Blue Sky and Letterboxd as well. And the podcast is at BackpagePod.

Matthew, that's it. I can't remember what next week is. Oh, you're away next week, aren't you?
Well, I'm on holiday, so I won't be here.
Yep. So you've got Hear Me Be Tormented by Dave Scarborough, and a pile of absolutely shite Ghostbusters games. So look forward to that, and we'll see you next week.
Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
