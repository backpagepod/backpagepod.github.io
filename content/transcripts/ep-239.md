Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, not by Matthew Castle, who's on holiday in Scotland, no doubt offending the locals. I'm joined by Dave Scarborough again.
Hello, Dave.
Hello, how's it going?
I'm not too bad, thanks pal. It's another warm weeknight. I just watched The Worst Person in the World on Mubi in about six different showings.
Like I watched it on the train, in my flat, on the toilet. I mean, truly, the lack of attention span is out of control. How you doing?
Absolutely chipping away at your morale and at your perspective on life, right?
Yeah, it's a very, it's millennial coded in a way that so few films are, just in how indecisive the main character is and the consequences that has. I empathize the man still living in a rented flat at the age of 37. But yes, by what I cannot empathize with, it's just how damn attractive the characters are in that film.
So that's like a level, there's like the millennial sort of experience, and then there's a hot millennial experience, and I don't think I can empathize with that one. The five or six out of 10 millennial experience, that's the level I need to see represented in a film, really the in-betweeners age.
I get that. We're a couple of rungs down on the social magic of those people. Even the sophisticated dinner table talk that they have, just doesn't, you know, just wasn't really my experience at all.
No, no, it's true. There's no sound circus in The Worst Person in the World, you know, and other Bournemouth landmarks. No postcards in that.
So yes, that's what I've been doing.
No deep-fried turkey legs for them.
This is the first time it's just been the two of us. So you and I worked together on Games TM and, you know, you've been on the draft episodes before. I've been sort of humorously antagonistic towards you on those episodes, that's only because you're a very good friend, but I'm delighted to have you back.
And so-
That's what we tell people, you know, just to cushion the animosity, but you know, who knows what the truth is?
It's like WWE, but with fewer crimes, basically. That's sort of the K-fable, whatever they call it. They'll make a hard-hitting documentary about it one day when one of us gets canceled, inevitably.
So yes. So yeah, this episode's all about Ghostbusters Games, which was a subject you suggested, and I, can I say tolerated? I was sort of, I was up for it, because I know you're very passionate about this.
So what was the thinking behind this episode?
Well, I've been talking about different ideas around, what's a game series, or even just one game that I could talk about at length with, with any confidence or authority, and Ghostbusters obviously the natural conclusion to that, especially as given the last draft we did, I heroically championed Ghostbusters The Video Game as one of my entries. I can't even remember what category I put it in. I think Licensed Game it was at the end, after I did that curveball with Arkham City.
So yeah, honestly, I've played all these games, like I was trying to think earlier, and it's kind of hazy going back to like when you're five years old, four years old. And I baffled by people who are able to sort of recall with any vividness, like their childhood that young, which some people seem to do. But I can't remember.
But I have a feeling that Ghostbusters, the David Crane game, which we'll talk about, was maybe the first game I ever had, or that was specifically mine, at least, because my sister had an NES. And so I had like Mario in the house and stuff. But I feel like this was one of two.
And I think Sonic the Hedgehog was the other one of my first game. So it was very formative, this series on me. And Ghostbusters was a big sort of part of my upbringing as well.
My parents were big fans. They had the double VHS of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2. Real Ghostbusters, animated TV show was just constantly on.
So yeah, it just, it sort of was very formative to my youth. Just sort of fell in love with the franchise and all of its different media over the years as I got older and older. And now I'm a middle-aged man and I'm still sad enough to love it.
You're still under 40, aren't you? That's not middle-age. I feel like middle-age is, what, 45 plus?
I'm 39 next week. 39 next week. So I'm still clinging on.
I didn't get you a present.
Well, I ran out of Greg Grunberg action figures to send you in the post for your birthday every year.
Yeah. You just have to send me Greggs instead, like mine is to Grunberg.
I think you prefer that. Not quite the same.
Yeah, probably true. So yeah, I mean, this is the second episode this month that you're going to be on, Dave, because we're also doing, I have more to say on Ghostbusters, by the way. I'm not just disregarding your-
It's fine. We've got plenty to talk about.
We have. But yeah, we're doing the All-Star, a Japanese game developer draft at the end of the month with Ashley Day. I think podcasting car crash is incoming.
It's going to be delightful. The categories, I'll reveal those exclusively on this episode actually to build hype. Basically, each of us have to, all four of us have to pick games from these categories.
You have to pick a game developed by Konami, Capcom, From Software, Namco, or Namco Bandai, I guess, Sega, Square Enix, Nintendo, Sony, Taito, or Taito. I mean, that shows how little I fucking know about them, so that's going to be tough, I'm sure. And then also, this was Ash's suggestion, Treasure as well, the Shmup developer.
I think we've all played something by them, I would expect. So looking forward to that. And then a free pick.
So a developer not represented by all of those. So yeah, it's going to be good, I think. Yeah, 44 picks.
No doubt going to be an absolute pile up, like I say. You're looking forward to that episode, Dave?
I can't pick Lost Viadomus, so it's going to be a real reach for me to fill out my categories. But no, it should be fun. It's nice to sort of do something that's a little bit off the beaten track for us as like a group doing this stuff, but I suspect the same level of shithousery will go on.
In fact, last time we did one, I felt like, did we go too far? Like that's the question. Did we go too far?
Like Ash messaged me afterwards.
When I started chanting saying, kill yourself, kill yourself, he's suggesting that was too far.
But that was the first one we did. That wasn't even the second one.
Oh, was it?
Yeah, the second one, I said that Ash was a bad writer and he messaged me separately afterwards saying, did you mean that? Which I didn't, or did I? No, I didn't.
But it's all fair in Love and War when we're sort of exchanging barbs on the drafts.
Well, the big test will be, will you and Ash go for Matthew this time? So Matthew's not left unscathed.
Yeah, well, I spoke to Catherine at the draft and she challenged me to give Matthew both barrels.
Did she give you some dirt? She was like, these are his three vulnerabilities. These are how you make him cry during the episode.
She exposed all his sort of orange weak points to target. So I could do it with precision accuracy.
I find the best way to defeat Matthew is to strike him once and then just dodge roll repeatedly around him and then reach the back and then you just batter him from behind with the largest melee weapon you have. That normally takes him down. Phase three is a bit of a motherfucker though.
Yeah, I like to get some reach. Any long sharp object to poke with is... That sounds wrong.
It does. Good for me.
No, I miss Matthew profoundly. And I've been messaging throughout his trip to Scotland. He went to see a film, a film that looks a bit like Tar, but it's not Tar.
It's a European film, I cannot remember, maybe German. And it's three hours long. You sat in a cinema in Glasgow, and they just messaged me afterward saying, what was I thinking?
So there's a little update for the listeners on how that trip's going.
He knows Fantastic Four's out, right?
Yeah, I think he just wanted to avoid that. Classic Matthew behaviour. No doubt he'll see that and log that as a two and a half on Letterboxd at some point, Dave.
I look forward to your two and a half star review.
So yeah, before we get into Ghostbusters and Dave, I did want to talk about working together on Games TM a bit more in this opening section because we just had a guest on talking about that magazine and what it meant in an era slightly before our era, but it was the same version of the magazine. It had the same design and it had the same section, so continuity there. And I thought we'd only really touched on this briefly when you'd been on the podcast before.
So I thought we'd talk about it in a bit more detail. You worked on Games TM longer than I did. So, yeah, I mean, it was only eight or nine months for me.
I think I only had something like nine issues in the end that I worked on. It was very hard work, but pretty enjoyable. And so I remember there being a time where, around the time that the PS4 was revealed, you were working on the magazine solo, like the entire editorial team had quit, and then it was just you.
Was that a thing that happened?
I mean, gosh, what does that say about me? Yeah, pretty much everyone had quit, around that time. We ended up having now, editor-in-chief of GamesRadar, Josh West, he actually got pulled on to GamesTM during that period, so I wasn't quite on my own, but I was managing it on my own because, yeah, Rick Porter left, Ashley Day left, and I think at that point, Luke Albershe had moved over to play, so it was just little old me having to run a magazine, and I think I was staff writer.
Because the funny thing is, Sam, this happened twice. This happened just before and it happened just after. The first time I was just a staff writer, I ended up running GamesTM, and yeah, it was around the time.
It wasn't quite when the PS4 and the Xbox One were revealed. It was just before because we were doing a lot of speculative covers, where we would have some dodgy render of what a PS4 might look like, with lots of various angles and neon lights strapped around the side of it, and lots of cover lines like, the future of gaming is now kind of thing. So we did that for a couple of months until the actual PS4 was revealed.
Then I think you joined more or less as that happened. That was like February 2013, right?
13, that's right. Yeah, it was just after because I had to do Play's PS4 coverage where I think we had two pages on the fucking share button on the PS4 controller. I'm sure that was great copy by me written on Deadline Day.
Then yeah, I think straight after, like my reward for running Play. I ran Play Solo for a little while there as well, until we hired Sam Smith after Ian Dransfield left. Ian Dransfield now of Team 17, worked with Ash.
So yeah, I moved across. Yeah, you were a staff writer and then I think they made you feature editor because I think they were like, right, well. That was my reward.
Yeah. That was my reward for editing the magazine was to be given a job title, several rugs below the job I was actually doing. Yeah.
Yeah, at least two rugs. Three rugs below the person who was doing it before you.
Exactly.
So yes. Yeah, what a great reward. But yeah, so I like the magazine and I think that we had a good year on it because we had the new consoles to talk about, that was good.
We had definitely a lot of covers where there was a black box on there and that sort of thing.
But we have momentum at that point, right? Like there was new games, the tech was shiny. We had art that was fairly attractive to put on the cover.
I remember the initial PS4 cover had some terrible kill zone, almost like a HD wallpaper as a cover. Do you remember it? It was just like a skyline.
And then the PS4 logo, it was abysmal. But beyond that, we had a lot of great bits of cover I remember. And I think you and I remember quite fondly a couple of the covers around that period.
Funny enough, they're not necessarily related to PS4, but we had the Arkham Origins one, and we had the Wind Waker HD one. And those were just some phenomenal covers during that run.
They were so good. And our designer was Andy Downs. I think that's right.
Do we have Greg Whittaker? Maybe we had Greg at the start, and then he moved to Booker Scenes or something. Yes.
I remember Andy being there, because the day that I resigned, he said to me, just sort of like quick as a flash, oh, you seemed in a good mood lately, so I thought something had happened. That's what he said to me. And that always stuck with me.
I remember about Andy was, he used to listen to audio books of Game of Thrones while he worked, and I just could not understand how someone was able to sort of like digest something that dense, even in audio form, while they were doing their day job.
I think that was Andy Salter, not Andy Downs.
Oh, you're right, I'm getting my Andes mixed up. You're absolutely right.
You are, that's Andy Salton. Andy Salter currently designer of Retro Gamer, so you've outed in there, and it brought great shame upon him. I went with Andy as well.
Andy was the designer on Play when I was there, and he was super talented. He's a really good designer to imagine. They were, yeah.
We did some great covers for sure. Some that were just capitalizing on next gen. We had a shameless Witcher 3 cover, that in retrospect was a bit too similar to Edger's Witcher 3 cover, but that game very quickly emerged as Skyrim killer.
You were so proud of that cover line. You were proud as punch for about a week afterwards.
I think it was the only way I knew it was going to get signed off by management, because I think at that point we'd already seen the E3 stuff. I'd seen E3 and it was like, well, this is going to be the game this generation.
Yeah.
Because they had all that target footage that ended up being a little bit more than the game could actually do. That became a bit of a controversy, but it delivered what it promised, which was the open world fantasy RPG of that generation. So yeah, that was a big deal.
I agree that Arkham Origins won. The game was not that special, but that Joker art was absolutely incredible. So yeah, that was really good.
And yeah, the Wind Waker one, I just talked about this recently because we, I thought our Aonuma interview that we did in that issue was quite good because this was, I think we promised the future of Zelda in a cover line, which sounds like bullshit and kind of is to some extent. But I feel like we got some good alluding to the future of what it was going to be. I mean, I think you put that feature together.
Do you remember Buster Barrett?
Yeah, I do. Yeah, we definitely teased out some hints as to sort of the direction of the game, which was that more openness, less linear structure that would sort of define Breath of the Wild. I remember, I honestly remember this so vividly.
We were sat around in our pod and we basically got the sign off from Nintendo that we were going to do this as the cover. And you kind of turned around, it was myself and Dom Pepeat was a staff writer at the time, or maybe even news editor at that point. I can't remember.
But you were like, okay guys, we've got this opportunity. Who's going to write the feature? And I was like, I'll do it.
I love Zelda. I've played every single one of them. I'm a huge fan.
I can write this feature. And then Dom did this really impassioned speech about why to do it, how meaningful the franchise was, you know, various different like, sort of like personal takes on why bring a distinct angle to a Zelda feature, you know, taking on Wind Waker HD. And you were like, yeah, Dom, yeah, I think it's yours.
And then I interjected like, Dom has never played any Zelda game but Wind Waker, I think, at that point. And you were like, what? Dom's like, oh yeah, I haven't played any other Zelda games.
It was just a big, what the fuck moment. And you're like, Dave, you can write the feature. I was like, yeah, thanks.
Oh, I mean, I will say Dom was great, staff right. But that was a funny moment.
It was just general, like comedy, the comedy timing of it all. He was just so impassioned. And then I just had to nuke it because I wanted to write it.
Which was bad. I mean, maybe I'm, maybe I was a prick. Maybe I've always been a prick, Sam.
Maybe this is the problem. But no, I had a great time writing that feature. And we got the, I believe we had a very, we had quite a small number of questions we could ask.
And we had to split-
Something like 10.
Yeah. We had to split, I think we had 20, but we had to split them with Retro Gamer, right? So we had to sort of-
Yeah, because they did a blue foil cover at the same time that we did that gold one, right?
Exactly. So we had to sort of find areas, find questions that we would overlap on and then have our own distinct questions for our individual publications. So that added like a level of complexity to it that, you know, I'm not sure exists anymore.
I'm not sure if any editorial teams, any publishers sort of share interviews like that, but it did maximize the output and we did both get our own features with our own, you know, distinct agendas to them. So that was another big part of it. But what came out for us was not just sort of a celebration of the sort of franchise history, but as you say, you know, we got some really good sort of hints and teases of what was to come.
Yeah, I mean, I actually just want to track this down because Nintendo Life at the time covered the, you know, the feature and, and, you know, grabbed the A&M quotes and turned it to new stories. All great websites did to magazines back in the day.
Well, you know what? That was, that was a real, that was a real sign of success when you're on a Maglite Games TM back then, because it wasn't that often that you got quoted or your articles got quoted for online features. There was, there was a real line between online and print.
And it was very rare unless you had like a mega exclusive, like it was a Game Informer cover or even Edge Covers or an Edge 10. It was very rare that sort of print would break out into online in any meaningful way. So it was always sort of like the high watermark of success.
I felt anyway, if something you wrote in print translated to, to sort of the online discourse.
Yeah, that is very true. So I'll just read a brief bit from this quote, which I think sort of alludes to where Breath of the Wild ends up being, or at least how they were thinking about Breath of the Wild back in 2013, which was obviously four years before the game came out. But I think they started showing it either the year after or I think it was actually 2015 they first showed what was going to be Breath of the Wild.
So this is Aonuma. When Waker HD had a link between worlds, also give a little glimpse of this. These games may feel a little different from the experiences you've had before, and this will be a lot stronger in the new Zelda.
There are no limitations on what kind of place Hyrule can be. Other than that, it is a country where Zelda exists as its princess. We now have many titles in the series, so we are seeing characters and location names from previous titles coming up again.
We are using these for the fun, but there is no rule that we have to use these at all. We may even need to change things you might take for granted, like Zelda being a princess. I would really like the next Hyrule to be a setting no one has ever imagined before.
And so, you know, it's not saying outright I'm making an open world game there, but that was a version of Hyrule you'd never seen before in that game. So, yeah, it was just an interesting sort of moment in time, because one of those things where I thought, oh, if the quotes are absolute bullshit, we get nothing, no meat on the bones, this is going to be a terrible feature, but it did turn out really well. So, that was good.
So, we had Matt hand your hand on a couple of weeks ago, Dave, and he was your predecessor as Featured Editor on Gamestem. Yeah. I think I was even there in Bournemouth when you met him for the first time.
I have a vague recollection of that occurring and talking to you about that.
Yeah, maybe. It was a bit of a revolving door situation, like he went out, I came in.
I was curious. We talked in that episode about Games TM versus Edge. I was curious how you perceived the differences, how you saw one versus the other working on Games TM.
It felt like when you joined, certainly when I did anyway, it was something that was clearly defined to you. You weren't trying to compete so much, at least that was my perspective. It was, to describe it succinctly, Games TM was like the punk rock alternative to Edge's more sort of stuffy and technical analysis of the industry.
That was kind of how it was presented to me. I don't know how, like I don't think that necessarily holds up these days, but certainly like at the time that was how it was pitched. So whilst I think there's always going to be a degree of competitiveness when you've got two publications that are so sort of like closely compared, I think the only sort of times when you looked with any sort of envious gaze over to their side of the water, it would be like when they got a great cover exclusive.
I think one that really stuck out for me, I remember they got No Man's Sky, right? They had their cover debut of that. Oh, yeah.
I knew Sean Murray a little bit, like we'd met a couple of times. I think I hung out with him at an Xbox Showcase that lasted like a few days out in San Francisco, about a year before No Man's Sky was revealed. I remember just being like, oh shit, I wish we got that one.
I was sure to told us about that and we could have worked something out. There wasn't a huge number of those that happened, but when they did, that was the only time where you really felt the sort of pull of edge within the industry versus Games TM. But anecdotally, a bunch of people who read Games TM over the years and peers that I've met, have said that Games TM was there, and so I think even within the readership, there was some degree of competition.
Yeah. From our listeners' response to the episode with Andrew Had, I think that they divided between people who only read Edge and would not even consider reading Games TM, and I think still think of it as like an inferior competitor, and people who were like, yeah, I read that magazine solidly, and I thought it was really strong. I think I agree, I think maybe just because of the team working on it when we were there, it wasn't lighthearted as such, but it was serious about games in terms of being knowledgeable and authoritative, but it was still fun about games.
And yeah, I think Edge had a slightly different tack. But you are right, there was that period, I remember in particular that Edge was getting a lot of Sony covers that were just way ahead on everything, like Uncharted 4 or Destiny or Horizon, and No Man's Sky was one of those too. They just always seem to have really close times with Sony, and they were getting these covers before anyone else had seen the content, which now is like borderline impossible to do really unless it's an indie game.
So yeah, that was cool. I do remember that No Man's Sky cover. I was on PC Gamer at that point, but it was a beautiful looking thing.
But yeah, I saw it was quite different. It's weird though, I never had like a mega passion for Games TM. And then I think it was going back to play where I'd started my career and then running it for a while and realizing the limitations on play, of what you could really do with it in terms of the feature content or the types of the front end where I had the cosplay page.
I'm not saying the cosplayers don't deserve respect, but didn't really want to put a big picture of a lady in the front end with a little caption because I think it just, maybe people made assumptions of what the magazine was based on that. And I was much more like, yes, I do want to write 10 pages on the making of Kingdom Hearts. So that's what I ended up doing when I moved to Gamestem instead.
But what's that?
8 pages on the, what's called the Ujia? Like, yeah, all right.
The Ujia. That was your brainchild, wasn't it? That happened before I joined the Ujia cover.
What was the thinking there? That's got the whiff of a cover meeting suggested that, and then the ball started rolling down the hill.
That's actually, I'm going to throw all that Ashley day. That was Ash, the hubbub had bubbled up around the Kickstarter for that, and it was a Kickstarter, wasn't it?
Yeah, that's right. It was one of the first hardware Kickstarters.
Yeah, so he was like, we should do a cover on this. This is it. This is the new business model for the games industry.
And he was right to a degree, that was one of those first major Kickstarter success stories within the industry. And that became a massive trend for the next probably like three plus years.
I mean, it's kind of still happening. That time crisis gun has just made loads and loads of money on Kickstarter. And these things are still massive projects now launch on Kickstarter.
It's not really an indie platform at all now. I think like I just saw there was like a Transformers reprinting all the Marvel Comics Transformers books by like three massive companies on there. So it's just such a different platform.
And I think that yeah, like it was a bit of a sign of where things were going, you know.
It's not as much of a sort of cultural discussion point as it was back then, though. But yeah, it absolutely was a sign of times. And yeah, Ash was like, this should be our next cover because of that, you know, we should be leading the charge when it comes to the conversation around, you know, both Kickstarter as a platform for funding, game development, and also, you know, new hardware.
And then he was like, Dave, can you get all the interviews? So I had to find all the contact details, arrange all the interviews. I think I did some of them, Ash did some of them, and then Ash wrote the feature.
So it was kind of a split job between the two of us.
Yeah. The thing is, I don't know if it's still not the future in sense of, if anyone who buys a retro handheld now, they are all built with Android operating systems and mobile technology. Like it's not implausible to me that in a decade, it will be quite easy to get something you plug into your TV in that form.
That's incredibly versatile, that can stream all of your games from all of the different libraries where you own those games. And the Steam Link was kind of in the Ouya bracket as well. And I don't know, I think maybe the idea of putting Ouya on a cover and being like, this is the future is funny.
In which respect, I cannot deny that, that is comical. I don't think there was something... There is something about the future that was in the Ouya, it just wasn't the Ouya itself.
Yeah, it's reach exceeded its grasp. It was a classic case of like, it had the vision, but it didn't quite have the capabilities to back it up with anything that sort of revolutionized hardware at that point. But you know, the ideas were there.
The ideas were there for sure.
Yeah, so you know, I guess either when I was on it or when I'd left or you know, before I joined, what were your, do you have any other highlights of TM that you wanted to talk about?
A lot of my memories in that time were the people, you know, like yourself, like Ash, one of the features editors on one of the gaming mags is like my next door neighbor now and our kids play together. I made lifelong friends during that period and that's very soppy and saccharine to sort of say, but I did and so a lot of my most sort of like cherished memories was that camaraderie and us sort of all working together like I and this is going to sound really so and this is totally out of character for me on this podcast. But you know, I was seriously ill at one point, which you may remember and you caught my back and you were just so gracious about it.
You had to do that Troy Baker interview. You had to like you had to pick up a lot of my slack while I was off for a couple of weeks and yeah like you know it was it was that sense of team and like it was we were kind of all in it together because at times it was a really shit job. It had had huge deadline.
It had a huge amount of pressure with tight deadlines. We weren't getting paid much money and there was a constant like truckload of pressure being piled on top of us more and more so as the teams diminished further and the expectations were increased because now we had to add bookazines or we had to like slap on some added value like you know a guide to Skyrim on the front of X1 which you had to write in two weeks you know or whatever. You know yeah there was like some really really tough times but I think we all sort of lifted each other up during that period and I think it's a testament to like you know you mentioned Dransfield, still talk to Dransfield, Ash, Chris, Brian, you know I even see Hoddy one of our old sub-editors who lives locally to me.
Like you know I see a lot of those and Darren, Darren Jones I see quite frequently of Retro Gamer fame you know I don't think that happens everywhere you work. It's certainly not in my experience and I know you've had good experiences at various different publications now. But you know it was very unique to me and certainly something that hasn't necessarily been replicable in quite the same way.
Yeah I've had, I've made like good friendships post-COVID in working at game publishers. But it's very different to the type of camaraderie that was forged in the editorial. It is arduous work, it's never easy.
And yeah those mags, I think even at the time TM was still a 148-page mag, I believe. It was a monster. The big retro section which I think Darren edited most of it for us, which was cool.
I don't know if I want to... No, he did.
He did it at the...
A bunch of it.
He did it back then, we did it all.
I think he commissioned a bunch of the stuff because I remember going, oh hey, can I have a feature on Red Alert? Oh, no. It's one of the eight games I like and he went and got it, for example.
That was something that happened at a certain point.
Actually, I'll tie something into this we're talking about today. One of the best features I ever wrote, one of the ones I'm most proud of was a history of Ocean Software and went up to Bafta and I tracked down, and gosh, my mind is going to go blank now, but one of the co-owners who had disappeared off in out of games and was hard to track down, and I believe he was like a chairman at Chelsea Football Club. Again, I might be getting these details wrong and so someone may correct me on the Discord because I completely forgot his name, which is terrible, but it was some years ago.
I tracked him down because an old school friend of mine was like a PR for Chelsea, and I was like, is there any chance that he would want to sit down and talk about his history alongside Gary Bracey of working on all these Ocean Games? And this was a guy who was so far removed for the industry and so had no skin in the game anymore, that he was so transparent and just open about it the whole time there. I remember this anecdote that he gave about the Top Gun game that they released, and they put together this cover art with Tom Cruise on it and took it to Paramount, and Paramount said, No, we can't get the likeness right to Tom Cruise for the cover art.
And so they went back, Ocean was like, Well, we can't really sell a Top Gun game if we don't put Tom Cruise on the cover art. And so they were like, Fuck it, we'll just do it anyway. They were like, we're so confident, they'll never look and they'll never care that we'll just do it.
And so they did, they just put him on the cover, even though they were explicitly told not to.
I'd have got a picture of Anthony Edwards and said, called it Top Gun Goose's Story, or something like that. That's what I thought a little bit.
Top Gun is Goose.
Yeah, it's a Goose prequel, where he shoots down lots of aircraft.
The Traded Academy, yeah.
That's really cool. And those interviews are just like, are like gold. And it's why Retro Game is such a good mag, because I know you're talking about TM, but those sorts of stories are, these are from an age pre-industry NDA and things being under lock and key in the way that they are now, and things just don't get talked about in quite the same fashion.
So, yeah, they just opened up the archives. Like, here's a bunch of photos, personal photos we took of our time. Here's me on the set of Batman 1989, like hugging the Batmobile, hanging out with Michael Keaton.
We could use all that in the mag. And like that stuff's just like catnip to me. I just absolutely adored it.
And it was, that was a, yeah, a feature that I really enjoyed putting together. The access just made it something special.
So after I left TM in late 2013, I was-
The dark times.
Well, the thing is, I disappeared and I was a bit, the thing is, I had a bit of a bumpy ride when I first started on PC Gamer. And I was like mega defensive about it. And so I didn't really, I wasn't very likeable or nice to you or Dom when I left.
I was just being a bit of a dick really. And it was just because I was, I thought I was going to get like booted for not doing a good enough job on PC Gamer. And so I didn't really look back much at TM.
But you know, the mag ran for several more years. It was still well liked up until it ended. And it was a bummer that it ended because it was, it was good.
But what happened to you after, after I left? What was that all about?
Just, just spiraled into a deeper and deeper depression, you know, with your absence. I took to drinking.
You had up to three Capri Suns a day back then, didn't you, Dave?
It was off the chain. Just slamming Monster Energy drinks and smashing what we called the Dave Special at the sandwich shop next to the office. Do you remember the Dave Special?
What was the Dave Special?
It was just Chinese chicken with, with extra lettuce.
I always had Chinese chicken and cheese, and like even it's pointless because you couldn't even tell that the cheese was in there because the Chinese chicken drowned it out. So it's just empty calories. But yeah, I miss appetites dearly.
And then when I came back to Bournemouth years later, I tried to go back then they no longer did the Chinese chicken. And I've never found a Chinese chicken like that one again. Like whatever they did, whatever fucking e-numbers or like artificial bullshit was it, or non-chicken ingredients were in that.
It was so good. Have you had this as well? Have you never been able to find Chinese chicken that good again?
Never, never. It was, I can only assume it's just a mounting of MSG or something that was just like poured into every batch of it. It was just, it was an unusual Chinese chicken color as well I remember.
Because of Chinese chicken is typically a little bit more redder and this was like a really vibrant sort of pink. Like it was almost like a sort of chalky, bright pink.
It looked illegal, you know. It didn't look like something that a human should eat, you know. It's like, it looked like sci-fi food.
And it was, yeah, it was definitely not Chinese. That was like 100% what it was not. It was definitely some cursed British concoction.
Well, it wouldn't be one of your podcasts if we didn't deep dive into the food options around the local area at any time of us being employed.
Well, you missed out on Flavour. They were like the kings of Bournemouth. That was years before your time.
Flavour, this guy, this bloke called, I think he was called Tony the guy. And their sandwiches were like ridiculous. They had one that was called The Hangover Cure.
There was an entire cooked breakfast on a sandwich. That sounds disgusting. It kind of was.
But they had one that was called The American, which was sausages, like American mustard, and like fried onions, and melted cheese. It was so fucking good. And yeah, I used to have that on a torpedo roll.
It must have been about 2,000 calories. No wonder I got fat working for Imagine. But anyway, what happened to you on TM after I left?
I'm just thinking of food now. Do you remember postcards, which we always used to frequent?
Yep.
They did a special One Christmas, which I alluded to earlier, which was instead of like Southern Fried Chicken wings or Southern Fried Chicken, they did, which used to be amazing. And they still make it, and it's terrible now. They changed the complete recipe.
But they did for one-off One Christmas, a Southern Fried Turkey leg. And it was just unbelievable. And I've never, they never did it again.
I've never had it anywhere else. And it was just, it was a thing of beauty. I ordered like three in a week.
I just went back and got multiple ones. I just loved it so much. Anyway.
One of my all-time treasured postcard memories is when, you know, meet your ex-colleague of ours and a friend of yours, Steve Mumby, went and ordered a salad at postcards and took it back to the bar because he wasn't full enough after he ate the salad. And asked for a refund or some extra food or something. Oh, that was so good.
That sounds so much like Mumby.
Yeah, it was good. Yeah, they used to do an absolutely bang in. It was like a goat's cheese and red onion marmalade.
Yes.
Well, that was so good.
Yes, it did. They don't do the triple cooked chips anymore either. They used to do the best triple cooked chips I've ever had too.
And the whole menu has been completely demolished. It's nowhere near as good now. It's pretty bland family food these days.
Well, okay. I mean, nothing of note ready to share. I mean, I suppose you talked about it there, like the having to work with smaller teams and things like.
No, it was the smaller team. That was the struggle. It was, we did cut down the pagination to about, I think it was 125 after you left.
So that offered a little bit of, that eased on the pressure a little bit. But we definitely sort of, the direction of Games TM kind of shifted a little bit due to editorial overlords. It became less about sort of celebrating the culture in all its forms around video games, became more about sort of chasing mainstream headlines or sort of speculation on, you know, where the industry trends might be going.
And, you know, there's a place for that. And I'm not saying that isn't interesting. And that isn't like storytelling that I'm personally interested in because I think, you know, that is the Internet now.
That's what it all is. You know, what's coming next? It seems to be what all clicks are driven by.
But it was a shame to sort of lose some of the personality in that mix. Like, I remember the very first Bit Summit, they just did the latest Bit Summit, actually. I don't know how many years have been going now, I assume, given, must be 10 years, 11 years at this point.
Something like that.
Yeah. The very first Bit Summit, because we, James Milk was one of the... Milky.
Milky, yeah. He was one of the creators of Bit Summit, I believe. And so he was also one of our columnists on Games TM.
And he had given us a heads up that this was happening and we'll be interested in covering it. And we were like, absolutely, you know, this is trying to do something different by spot lighting, in the Japanese indie development scene. So I think I did like three or four pages at the front of the mag, which was sort of where our culture section sat.
And then I think the day before deadline, when it went through the review, it all got stripped out and told, I got told to like rewrite it all and like write something completely different instead. In like, you know, overnight I had to do it before we went to print the next day. And it was grim.
And that was kind of indicative of a lot of what started to happen around both TM and other mags. It became about sort of chasing the popular, like the sort of populous themes rather than sort of exploring what we found interesting as editors or what we felt was sort of important to spotlight. So that was a big change that I didn't necessarily agree with.
But yeah, I understood why it was happening. Magazine sales were sort of tumbling and I eventually got moved on to X1 to run that magazine. Again, I was editor, but I was given the job title Deputy Editor despite the fact there was no editor to be the deputy of.
So yeah, there was some great games around that time too. And that was Winnie X1 and the PS4 really sort of hitting their stride. I think one of the last reviews I wrote, I remember two of the last reviews I wrote were really in my zone.
One of them was Smash Bros for 3DS and Wii U. And then the other one was Alien Isolation, which I gave a 9 out of 10 to in TM. And yeah, and then I sort of departed shortly after that.
And honestly, that was because I saw the magazine sales dip in, the writing was on the wall, you could see those editorial teams sort of, you know, gradually just becoming smaller and smaller. And a job opportunity came up at Koch to for a PR role, a junior PR role on the UK team. And I went and I spoke to the head of publishing and I said, look, this opportunity has come up and you know, let's just, you know, have an honest conversation.
Is X1 gonna be around in a year, you know, and therefore will I still be? And you know, to his credit, he was like, you always have a job here, but X1 won't be a magazine here forever. And he said, you know, you may end up on another games magazine or you could end up on a knitting bookazine.
So I can't guarantee you'll be happy where you land, but you know, your job is secure, be assured of that. But if you think this is a good opportunity to jump into PR and it's something that you would enjoy doing, then go for it. And so that's why I made the decision to leave journalism, ultimately.
It wasn't so much something I desperately wanted to leave, it was more just a response to what was happening around me in print. And as I remember, the online editorial teams were pretty locked up at that point. There wasn't a lot of jobs going around that I remember.
And plus everything was in house and I was very much settled in Bournemouth. So it was hard to then relocate, for me at least, to relocate to Bath or to London. So I was very limited in terms of what I could do and where I could go.
Yeah, I think that's very true. I mean, I definitely remember that the Gamer Network was pretty much firm up until like COVID hit Reapop and then I think things maybe changed a little bit. But it was, I remember that being very similar.
The PC Gamer job that came up that I got was one of an ultra rare job. And I think I was the only, I think one of two editors who had gone in at that top level from another company. Everyone else was like a staff writer who had started at the bottom and worked their way up.
So, yeah.
That's typically how it worked. And the industry, like that generation of games journalists was still sort of all in their 20s. So no one had really grown jaded and tried to jump the boat at that point.
So everyone was still working their way up the ladder, especially online where there was less, there was way less movement online than there was in print at that point.
Yeah, it's true. It was, it did get dicey. And I remember there was that, I thought the games TM cover a lot, there was like the Nadir, was that Nintendo one?
That basically was like the-
You've got to do it in The Simpsons voice.
Yeah, well, I refused to do that. But it's more like it just, it was just a bit of like, it was Nintendo Eloeb, obviously, before the Switch happened. And then I think the Switch did happen and then that narrative completely reversed.
And, but I could just see the, I could see the wheels that turned to make that cover happen. And I was like, ah, I don't know, I don't think so. I mean, you cannot fight the decline of an entire medium.
These things are beyond your control. And all you can, I think all you should really do is focus on making the best thing possible. And I think that, yeah, if you're, if everything is driven by like an editorial edict, you're simply not going to do that.
You're going to make a worse product and you won't stop your medium from declining anyway. So you might as well make something good. That was sort of how I feel about media more generally, but yeah.
No, it's right. And we ended up like that. Nintendo is like a great example of sort of trying to, it wasn't leading any conversation.
It was reacting to conversation that was already happening. And Games Team became way more reactive publication than it had been prior to that.
And I think the problem with doing reactive covers is if you're always reacting to what's going on, you're not really setting the agenda at all. And I think the magazines are at their best when they are setting an agenda, when they are saying this is the big thing. You know, if Edge can go and get a No Man's Sky cover while you're doing something that's more reactive, then I think you're the one who seems out of date.
Okay, Dave, well that was some good Games Team retro chatter. I enjoyed that. Shall we take a quick break and come back and discuss Ghostbusters Games?
I would love to do that.
Now for a tone change. Okay, so Ghostbusters, Dave, I had some music playing in the break there. So they would have got like a chip tune.
What music are you gonna play? Yeah, what's gonna be your chip tune bed to this whole section? There's lots of different options to choose from.
Whatever doesn't get me sued by that Ghostbusters guy who got sued by Huey Lewis The News. That's the thing, if we play a bit of Ghostbusters music, do I technically owe money to Huey as well as, who's the bloke who did the Ghostbusters theme, Dave?
Well, you're talking about Ray Parker Jr. Well, there you go.
That was the first test, you see, to ensure that you are, in fact, a Ghostbusters expert and you pass. So well done.
I couldn't have fucked it any bigger than when I forgot Ernie Hudson's name on the last podcast. It was quite late at that point. We've been going on quite a while.
Yeah. Obligatory mention of Viz's Ernie Hudson bumming himself photo, and it's accompanying caption, which always makes me laugh. And I did mention on that last discussion we had about Ghostbusters, but cannot think of Ernie Hudson without thinking about that.
Okay, so Ghostbusters, yeah, we talked about your interest in it. And it sounds like you got a bit of an 80s culture fascination anyway, probably as a result of you being just a couple of years older than me, and maybe having that influence from your parents and your life a little bit.
I'm also the third child as well, so I was left to my own devices, which ultimately means you just sat and watched TV and raided all of the VHSs that your parents had. As a parent, I can totally relate to this. You get to a certain point where if you've got an older child, you want them to watch the stuff that you really like.
But then if you have a younger child, you're just like, they could just watch it too. It's fine, even if it is massively inappropriate for them.
I think that's very true. That's very true. My little brother likes all the same games that I do.
He likes The Simpsons, Fresh Prince, and all that stuff. The only thing he didn't get into that I liked was Buffy. He never really understood why I was watching that, I don't think.
Probably because it looked super naff, the effects and stuff, by the time that he was about 10 and I was about 21 or whatever. Why the preoccupation with Ghostbusters Games, Dave? Is this just an extension of your fandom, or is this a bit like Star Wars games for me, where you're just looking for that perfect game that captures the fundamental mechanics of catching ghosts in the film, much as you would search out a game with great light super combat or captures how an X-Wing flies or whatever?
Yeah. I think like Star Wars, Ghostbusters is uniquely suited to video games than a lot of other IPs, especially during that 80s period when every movie, they tried to convert into some video game version of it, whether it was like The Goonies or Home Alone or whatever it might be. Ghostbusters as a premise has this mix of sci-fi action.
The enemies are very inventive, they've got really gnarly designs and obviously, given that it's about catching ghosts, there's a lot of room for creativity and expanding that concept to stretch out a game's running time. Also even from a narrative perspective, and again, much like Star Wars, there's this huge canon where games can slot in without contradicting it too much and still feel quite authentic. Ghostbusters even within the individual movies have these long stretches of montages where they're busting ghosts, and so this way you can set your story, or this is where you can add additional scenes to stretch out your gameplay.
You know there is a great Ghostbusters game in the concept, and so it's just chasing the dragon, trying to find one that scratches that itch. I guess the question, Sam, is, because I made you play a couple, has there ever been a great Ghostbusters game?
Well, I guess should I talk about my relationship with Ghostbusters? Because I don't think it's come up on this podcast before at all. I mean, this is in the same category for me as Indiana Jones or Back to the Future, where I didn't watch them.
Actually, you know what? When I was really young, I saw Ghostbusters 2 because I remember the scene with the bathtub and the pingu really freaking me out.
Yeah, that's scary shit.
That's very scary. And so I vividly remember watching that on TV when I was definitely under 10 years old. So that sort of stuck in the memory.
But I didn't watch them again until probably around the time that the Ghostbusters game came out in 2009. I think I went and tracked down the DVD from CX or something and watched it for the first time and liked it, watched Ghostbusters 2, didn't like it. And then that was basically it, really.
I don't have a huge connection to it. I don't know if I've ever really even rewatched them.
So is it even possible? I've thought about this recently. Is it even possible to like latch on to like a classic bit of of sort of like 80s nostalgia cinema and have any anything more than just sort of a passing admiration for it if you watch it in later life versus if you grew up with it?
I just don't think anything can hook you like that.
I think it's fair to say it's not quite the same. But I would say that Back to the Future and Indiana Jones definitely seeped in more. I think it's because they are maybe objectively better pieces of cinema.
I mean, no offence there Dave. But I think that is part of it. It's just the level of craft to Indiana Jones.
Also the fact that I got into indie when Crystal Skull came out, and there was like a real rush of indie nostalgia at that time because you had…
You were still a teenager then though. So I don't think that counts necessarily. I think even in your teenage years with your soft squishy brain, you can still find yourself sort of taken by stuff like that.
Because I was the same with Back to the Future. I didn't really watch that properly until I was in late secondary school and just fell in love with it.
Yeah, that's probably true. I guess I would have been about 20 when Indie came out, the Crystal Skull came out. So that's something.
Then that Lego Indiana Jones game came out at the same time as well, which was really good, I thought. And so playing that at the same time, I think that did just imprint it on my brain. Back to the Future, I watched in 2010 when they released them all on Blu-ray and I was on Cipher now.
So I thought, well, I better watch these films. I only just watched Back to the Future 2 and 3 for the first time last weekend, Dave, coincidentally.
Wow, that's weird.
Yeah, that is weird. Ghostbusters, yeah, so similar time in between those.
But, yeah, I think Ghostbusters, like I think what makes Ghostbusters distinct, distinct, sorry, versus a lot of those other sort of like big like franchises or one-offs from the 80s and into the 90s is that for me growing up with it is a film that sort of matures with you. Like when you're a kid, you're in it for like the spectacle, for the scares, for the monsters. Like it's sort of very easy to sort of glob on to it just for the visuals in many ways.
You know, like the action is very spectacular and sci-fi and you know that as a young, young kid is just like mesmerizing and then you get older and then the slapstick humour kind of grabs you a bit more and then by the time you get sort of into young adulthood, the humour really catches on because you know there's always a whole bunch of innuendos to it but also that very specific SNL humour. You grow to sort of appreciate it more and I think again, even as you get into your 30s, you know, that sort of specific alchemy between Ramis and Ackroyd and Murray, like you can really, you can really feel their chemistry and like that they're very specific modes of comedy, just gelling together, which is, you know, it can't be forced. It's just something that these people have just sort of, their careers sort of grew together and they just knew each other so well and they're sort of like their rhythms.
And so for me, Ghostbusters has always been very, very different. It's why the sequels to Ghostbusters has been so hit and miss, because it is just such a specific thing from both a filmmaking standpoint and from a comedy standpoint, that it's-
That's the thing, it's got that 80s great sort of production design and creature design, like the blockbuster side of it is nailed, but there's no other real like SNL franchise in that same way, where it's a blockbuster, but also does have the DNA of those very coked up seeming SNL sketches, that Bill Murray was in, in the 70s. So yeah, I think there's definitely some truth to that. And then, yeah, I think your question about the game, I mean, the games rather, is that I think they're subject to the conditions that a lot of 80s licenses were, which is they all get farmed out.
There's like a million different versions of each game, and you might get one that is like total dog shit, like one of the worst things ever on one platform, that's then like a completely different experience on another. And Batman is similar in this regard, but I know there are quite a lot of examples of games of licenses like this from around this time period. And so, yeah, you get this ultimate mixed bag of stuff.
But then this has a slightly unusual distinction, a bit like Indiana Jones, I guess, where people are still trying to make games of it in the modern age. You know, it has persisted as a series. So the 80s nostalgia has really like had quite a long tail to it.
So I guess my question to you, Dave, is how many great Ghostbusters games are there?
Well, I mean, is it is it spoiled to say we could sort of end this on on on like my top five? Yeah, I think there are three great ones.
Okay.
And two other very good ones.
All right.
And then and then some hit and miss ones is my personal opinion.
Is that the rough arc of it though, that there is like a hugely variable quality of them over the years, and based on which format they end up on, which developers hands they end up in, etc. Is that basically the long and short of the history of these games?
More or less. I mean, I think Ghostbusters Games has one of the more convoluted histories in terms of there being several versions of many games that released over the years, even up to the more modern ones. Ghostbusters is a video game, which I'm sure we're probably going to talk the most about when we get to it because of it's so interesting.
That has several versions of it because just because of the timing of it, it came during the wee boom, and so there was this mandate to create something specific for wee players. There was a little bit more kiddified. And because of some of the limitations of the hardware as well, they can just do a straight port of the Xbox and PlayStation version.
So it's interesting to me that even a relatively modern day Ghostbusters game has this issue with multiple versions of the same game that's slightly different and has its own sort of unique experience to it. But that goes all the way back to the original David Crane one. I will sort of say, off the bat, what makes a good Ghostbusters game?
And, you know, you could chime in here and agree, disagree. You know, I think about what makes, like, a good Indiana Jones game or what makes a good Simpsons game or what makes a good Spider-Man game. And I think there are sort of core tenets to each one that, like, have to be there.
Well, when they finally make a good Simpsons game, we'll discover what that ingredient is for that license. But I take your point, Dave.
Yeah. And I think what makes a good Ghostbusters game, first of all, is the cast. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to have the voice actors, although they do appear in multiple games.
But, like, just having Venkman, Stantz, Spengler, Zedmore represented in some way, I think is important for the authenticity of it. Like, I don't think we've ever really broken away. And even the movies have struggled with this.
Like, you can't break away from that core quadrant. It just, you lose something when you do. So, I think that's important.
The other thing is how the busting feels. Whether they nail the Proton Packs or not. And obviously, there are limitations with older hardware as to how well they can do that.
I do think some of the older games do, and we'll get to that. But later games, like how they really get a grip on what it feels like to sort of have the pack on, firing the Proton stream, that is super, super important. Then the third one is Stay Puft.
I feel like you have to have some representation of Stay Puft in any of these games for it to really feel right. I don't know why. I think that's cheap and maybe just nostalgia bait, but I just feel like you got to have it there in some form or another.
Like the movies realize this too. You got to have a nod to it. And even if it's sort of completely tenuous, just sort of like why Stay Puft's there, it is kind of important.
And then as a bonus, I quite like driving around in Ekato 1. Not all the games do this, but some that do. I think that's a touch and like that is necessary to sort of really elevate it into sort of like the gold tier of Ghostbusters Games.
Yeah, I think that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.
Sorry, do you have another ingredient before I carry on talking?
Well, I will say as a bonus, now I don't think this is necessary, but any game that lets me explore the Firehouse, and usually within that, it's usually packed with Easter eggs. It's just an automatic win for me. Every single time it just works.
I've explored the Firehouse in a whole bunch of different games and a whole different versions of it. It just works. I just love that.
It really tickles that itch I have for the nostalgia of it all. To be fair, any game where I get to go to some recreation of a classic set, I just love it. This is super sad.
When I used to play Counter-Strike 1.6 all the time as a teenager, I'd play a lot of the custom community-made maps and someone made a Helms Deep map. I just love that. I used to play that Helms Deep map all the time because it was so lovingly recreated and you can go into the main hall, wander around and down into the little caves where the people were hiding.
It was so lovingly recreated. I love the attention to detail when people would recreate something from films. But anyway, that's just me as a nerd.
We can always be fun.
That makes sense. I mean, there was something that alarmed me yesterday was when you said that it was a big deal to the fandom that some video game had a certain proton pack that they all liked. And just the concept of a contemporary Ghostbusters fandom discussing this stuff is deeply distressing to me.
Is that a thing?
Hey, hey, hey.
Right.
There is a large committed Ghostbusters fandom and there is a Ghostbusters day every year.
There are dozens of us, stop gif.
There was a Ghostbusters day and it's actually bad that I can't remember it, but I believe it's in May. And Carrie Coon was even at Ghostbusters day this year, which surprised me to know him because I thought that was a paycheck gig, but she turned up and was just like interacting with the fans. She was there with Jason Breitman and I was just like, wow, like just just would not have expected her to get on that stuff.
So, you know, I couldn't love her more. You know, we're big fans of her.
Right there in the center of our Venn diagram and that of every man over the age of 35. There goes Carrie Coon, basically. That's the takeaway from that, Dave.
Yeah, OK. I mean, I sort of get that. They've released films in recent years.
I mean, I know that they've both been quite contentious. The last one seems like it got a bit more of a negative response than the one before. The one before was Afterlife.
The second one was Frozen Empire. Is that right?
That's right. I mean, I could rank those movies for you as well if you want. I could just reel them off.
You know, you go, I would say.
Yeah, why not? We got you here, so why not?
You got me here, why not?
Yeah.
You go number five. Hang on. Let me count how many there are.
Are you going to put the Paul Faith one at the bottom because you hate women, Dave? Is that what's going to happen here?
That's your agenda, not mine. Don't drag me down to your level. We've been through this.
Go on. I'm leaning into the mic so much. I'm actually going to get some audio spikes.
Number five, I would put Frozen Empire. Number four, I put the Paul Faith 2016 version. Number three, I put Ghostbusters 2.
Number two, I put Ghostbusters Afterlife, and number one is Ghostbusters.
Okay. That makes sense. So you do like Afterlife quite a lot.
I love Afterlife. Fuck you, Darren Jones. You hate her.
You know how much I love Ghostbusters Afterlife. He constantly ridicules and berates me for it. But he knows I'm right.
It's a great movie with its heart in the right place and it tickles all the right nostalgic lands.
Well, I watched that in Filthy, but I watched the first 10 minutes of it and felt like something was amiss. Like it wasn't quite, you know, because I think everyone talked about this, the mismatch between what the tone of the film was and what Ghostbusters actually is. And I must admit to feeling that a little bit.
But I think I would feel differently if I, you know, had the nostalgic connection to these films that you do.
So let's go into the timeline, I guess.
Yeah, okay. So, you know, do it, Dave. Like what's the brief history of these games?
So it all starts with Ghostbusters by Davy Crane, right? Davy Crane, yeah, famous pitfall maker. Was he a co-founder of Activision?
Am I wrong in that?
It rings a bell. It rings a bell.
Yeah. So yeah, this came out in 86. There's a bunch of different versions.
I played it a little bit later. I think a lot of people cite the ZX Spectrum version as sort of definitive, whereas I had it on the Master System. On the, I had like the Master System adapter for my Mega Drive, which is why I had this and Sonic for the Mega Drive as my first games.
And this was famously, they got given the license and Crane didn't have enough time to sort of develop it from scratch. So he was working on a game called Car Wars and he basically just used that as the basis for Ghostbusters. Car Wars was basically, you customized a car with different weapons while driving around a city.
So instead of it being like guns and stuff, it was a bunch of different ghost catching tools that you bolt onto the Ecto-1 and you can suck up ghosts as you drive it around and then they added the map stuff and the little sections of catching ghosts in between. So what I love about this game is that it has a real heavy emphasis on resource management and what it does, which not many, if any other Ghostbusters games have done, is it kind of emphasizes the fledgling business aspect of it. So you're counting your income to unlock the next upgrade, Superb Ecto-1, and for me it really represents like that side of the original Ghostbusters movie, which is the, this is like, these are some blue collar exterminators who are just trying to build a business.
Like there isn't any greater purpose when they start out other than just making money out of the thing that they know about. And then as you go, as you progress through the game, you start to see sort of Lewis Tully and Dana Barrett sort of roam around the map and then Stave Buff appears and you have to sort of contain the sort of spreading ghost plague as it's infecting New York City, which eventually leads to the standoff with Stave Buff, which is really tough because he jumps back and forth in front of the door and you have to time it just right to get inside. And then weirdly enough, that sequence in the first movie, which has the four Ghostbusters climbing up the stairs of Dana's apartment and then it does like the jump cut for laughs of like, you know, they're only on like floor 15 or whatever it is.
And they're gonna, you know, they've got to go all the way up to like 24. That's a whole level in this game. And you gotta go up like several flights of stairs for like Ghost to get to the top before you fight Goza.
But yeah, I love this game wholeheartedly. I do think I've played the others, the Master System version is legitimately the best. It had some pretty authentic sprite designs for characters like Dana and Lois.
Stave Puff looks great. You've got slime type ghosts. You've also got these ghosts that kind of look like bananas.
I don't really know what they were going for there. It's kind of weird. And then famously, if you complete the NES version of the game, it's got that hilarious poorly spelled victory screen of...
Do you remember it? Conglatulation. You've complete a great game and proved the justice of our culture.
Okay, right, right, right.
Justice of our culture, as you know, was the name of my warship in Helldivers.
That was the name of your land for Lindy Band in 2006, wasn't it, Dave?
You know what? It's not a bad name, actually.
Yeah. Helen in the Crowd, just you and a bunch of mates.
Yeah. So yeah, this is where it started out and I actually think it's a really, really, really strong start for Ghostbusters video game future. I think this is as good as a Ghostbusters game.
Could be at that time and I absolutely love it. You played it, I asked you to play it. What did you think?
I thought you hated it. Well, I just thought the map screen was, I mean, I thought that the screen that was where all the gameplay was happening was a map screen leading to the actual gameplay and it turned out the map screen was the game all along. Yeah.
I was completely baffled by it. Like I couldn't work out how I was laying traps. I couldn't work out why the money was ticking down in the top right corner.
I couldn't work out what the bar was when Stay Puft turned up. I didn't know what to do about it. I couldn't work out there's a rudimentary version of Pac-Man because I was leaving all these little sort of dots behind and there were these ghost lads around, humans around.
I found it so baffling and then a very long boring, overly hard driving section as you go back to Ghostbusters HQ constantly to get more equipment. I had no idea what was going on and I hated it, Dave. That's how I feel about it.
But I didn't hate the other ones. This was the only one I hated. So I guess it was just an effort to do something quite different than what you'd expect with this license, right?
Like you say, because of the origins that it has, is this other game retrofit into Ghostbusters? And I guess if you were there at the time, it probably seems quite ingenious doing that. You know, it's one of those things you can't really pass looking back at it 30 years later, you know?
No, it is difficult because it, you know, there is, I do agree, there probably is a certain clunkiness to it now. When, you know, back then, you got given a game, you just had to work it out, and you just would, because, you know, that's all you've got to play. There wasn't like an abundance of choice, at least for me.
But the way that it sort of like was juggling the business management aspect, the driving sections, the sort of the busting sort of interludes, which would change your money. On top of like this, I think it did a great job of sort of building this sort of like mounting dread. When you got to that map screen and you saw sort of like the presence of ghosts sort of building up in the different, in each corner and then these various sort of like, you know, if you know the movies, having the keymaster and the gatekeeper sort of closing in on each other, I felt it represented like the main beats of the movie, like surprisingly well for a game this old.
And honestly, I played this game endlessly, for hours, for years. I absolutely loved it.
Okay, well, fair enough. I mean, I just didn't, I wasn't there for it, but I could see why it would be meaningful. But the next game's got kind of its own weird history, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's Ghostbusters and Mega Drive, which had its own distinct experience that was unrelated to David Crane one. So we could just sort of talk about this really.
I didn't play this until much, much later. I had no idea in my childhood that there were two different versions of Ghostbusters on a system that I owned. Or at least, you know, Mega Drive and my Master System were kind of the same.
I probably would have got it. This is quite an endearing platform shooter. I do find the look of the...
You play as Peter Venkman and you basically go through various different levels shooting ghosts. You don't have like a typical proton pack. You're firing like these little proton bullets.
And do I hold that against it a bit? I do. I just have to say that, like that lack of authenticity bothers me.
But this is actually quite a charming little game. Venkman has this like bobble head that I find quite nightmarish. But it does have a great staypuff level, which is like this sort of example of what I think is really special cinematic level design, of that 16-bit era, like as you sort of navigate your way through the level, you'll pass windows and stay past head or sort of like peek through and sort of see where you are and then punch through the level to try and get you.
And like it's just super exciting and really tense and engaging gameplay. It has like a cool upgrade system as well. You earn money, you go back to your team, and then you go back to HQ and you can buy upgrades and health power-ups and stuff like that.
One thing I don't like, which I'm probably in a minority on, is that it has sort of like a Mickey Mouse Castle illusion style boss design.
Yeah, quite weird looking from a quick glance.
Yeah, really gnarly. I don't like them. I think they're just a bit too off-brand for me.
And like a common theme in this is how sort of authentic these games feel to Ghostbusters. And that sort of takes me out of it a little bit. And obviously, I think it is very much influenced by like, yeah, I say like Castle of Illusion and Games of that Ilk during that time.
But overall, it's actually a pretty good game. I quite enjoy it. I hadn't, I don't really know, weirdly enough, I don't really think this has like a huge reputation amongst like Ghostbusters fans, but I thought it was pretty decent.
Yeah, the Stay Puft thing really reminds me of how Jurassic Park on the Megadrive, you would have the T-Rex smash through the scenery as well. Like it was a nice little novel effect, you know. Quite a scary looking thing actually to just have a quick glance at the pixel art.
It is quite unusual looking, but then you see every other part of the game and yeah, it does look like there were sprites ripped out from a platformer that never came out or something. You know, it does have that vibe to it.
Oh yeah, it's like an echoed dolphin squid creature that you have to like, just in the middle of certain levels, you just have to shoot and decide where have they grabbed that from? Like that just has no place whatsoever in this game. Yeah, very odd.
Yeah, okay, interesting. So what's next up?
So then we're getting to the Ghostbusters 2 era. And this, yeah, this is where things get quite convoluted, but also where there's like some really interesting design decisions. So the first one was Activision's Ghostbusters 2 for the NES or NES.
This was released several months after the film it was based on. And it's a fairly basic side scrolling platform shooter. It's kind of trying to sort of visually echo David Crane's original one.
You blast go shoot Starwing in various settings. There's on foot sections, there's driving ecto-1 sections. And then you eventually get to pilot Lady Liberty in sort of like this Space Invaders style sequence where you're sort of blasting things with her lantern out of the sky.
Now that sounds all fun. This is one of the most tedious and punishing games I ever played in my childhood. I owned this game and I fucking hated it.
And like, you know, there is a moment in childhood when you get a game and or it can even be a movie, it could be anything. And it's like that first like moment your mind sort of like comes to grips with something not being good and you struggle to like to... This was it for me.
This was the thing that made me realise that bad products exist. Like not everything is made for me to enjoy it. Like it's just like things can just be bad, like inherently bad.
It reminds me a lot of Bart vs. The Space Mutants in being a series of very frustrating obstacles to avoid from one shotting you. And it's just one of those games from this era that just seems to be made to be as difficult as possible and sort of be like just erect like barriers in front of like you having fun as a player.
And yeah, I just remember getting incredibly upset and frustrated with it. And yeah, you don't even like fire your proton pack properly. It's just like, you've just got the slime cannon and you're just throwing slime everywhere.
It's just, it's terrible. I haven't really dug into the making of the Ghostbusters 2 game. Other than I know there was a licensing issue, which is why there's another Ghostbusters 2 game, which is Varsity Superior, we'll just about talk about.
But aside from that, I don't know the genesis of Ghostbusters 2 on the NES. It's just a really abysmal experience.
The one game that released between those, Dave, was something called Real Ghostbusters 1987, a Data East sort of like game that was on, I think it was an arcade game that was imported to Amiga. Dave, you know this one. That looks like a bit more of a twin stick kind of thing.
I don't know.
Yeah, I never played it, funny enough. But that came out there. There was another Real Ghostbusters game as well that came out in the Game Boy, which is a bit of a weird one.
We got to one of the more interesting games now, right? On the timeline.
Yes, that's right. That's New Ghostbusters 2. This confused me again, a very young child, 1989.
It would probably be about 1990, so I was about five years old. You know my weird family history. We used to give away our games consoles and get new ones and then get game consoles back in.
For whatever reason, I got given New Ghostbusters 2 on a different NES than the one I originally owned. I was like, why is this a different game to the one I was already playing? And then I remember giving it back and asking my parents to buy Ghostbusters 2 or whatever.
And then I had the other Ghostbusters 2 again. And it was all very confusing. But New Ghostbusters 2 was developed by Howe, Howe Laboratories, who famous for the Kirby franchise and later Smash Brothers.
Mother Earthbound.
And this this game is nigh on perfect when it comes to Ghostbusters. It is these chibi Pokemon S character designs of Ghostbusters characters in this top down three quarters perspective. You basically go around as two characters at a time.
You are essentially someone who's firing the proton streams. And then you have a character behind who's AI controlled, who's throwing a trap. So I think it's like A is the proton string, B is to fire the trap.
And you go around the events of the second movie starting in the courthouse, going through the sewers and through the train lines into the museum, and you recreate the whole movie in this really sort of endearingly like presented condensed down version of the Ghostbusters 2 narrative. And I absolutely love it. One of the key things I love about this is you get to play as Rick Moranis' Louis Tully.
That was a huge deal for me even as a kid, because obviously he's like he's a comedy relief character in a movie of comedy relief characters. But having that option was mind blowing to me at my young age. You've also got really cool versions of recognizable ghosts in the movies.
You've got Slimer, you've got that runner from the monster. I don't know how familiar of Ghostbusters 2, but in the montage sequence halfway through, there's like a marathon runner ghost who they capture in Central Park. He's in there.
Then there's just a bunch of generic slime creatures because of all of the ooze. They do Peter McNichol pretty dirty at one point. They give him a giant forehead.
I felt pretty sorry for him when he comes up. But this is a fantastic game and the mechanics are so, again, this is so early on in my experience with video games, to have a game which had AI behind you and I wouldn't say it's complex, but had a very unique take on this action gameplay for Ghostbusters. It just made it really exciting.
The level design has a little backtracking issue, but it's really well-crafted. It doesn't overstay its welcome. I think it hits all the major cinematic beats really, really successfully.
Also, even the soundtrack, it has chiptune recreations of music from the movie like actual songs. There's a song called Flip City that I believe is from the first level. Then We're Back, which has this, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
All of that stuff is so cool. I just love the attention to detail in it. It just has its own sense of humor as well when you watch the credits where ghosts are chasing the chibi characters around.
I just love it from top to bottom. Yeah. You played this, did you?
Yeah. I played half of this. It turned out last night because there's only six levels.
Yeah. It's not very long.
So the first three levels were that building that you clear out. The courthouse. The courthouse.
Then there was the train. There's a bunch of train related tracks that you're going to go across.
Fight Slimer at the end of that, right?
You do. Then there's a very, very long series of office, big office rooms that have slightly wilder, Zelda-y creature designs in them with these lads with big swinging maces who are just-
Yeah, there's Cyclops creatures. At that point, you're like, are they repurposing assets here?
Yeah. The really interesting thing is, because it's a game, sorry, it's a Howl Abitrary game. In my head, I'm always trying to do the massive, because I'm about 85 percent sure I know what the relationship between Earthbound and Pokemon is.
I think it's that developers from Earthbound who worked at Ape Inc who made Earthbound Mother 1 and 2, went on to form creatures who are one of the Pokemon studios. I think that's why the doors and the walls in this, and the characters have a similar art style to like basically Team Rocket and the Silph Co. When you're going around Pokemon Red and Blue basically.
So that immediately is the thing that we are like, oh wow, this is visually very distinctive. But gameplay wise, it is quite interesting because you pick your main character, you pick a supporting character, and then whoever your supporting character is basically has to get himself in position to drop the little, what's it called again, Dave? Sucking up ghost thing.
The trap.
The trap. It's just called the trap. Yeah.
So you're there with your proton pack basically holding them in place. You're waiting for Winston Zeddemore to sort of like, yeah, just sort of like for his pathfinding, not to fuck up from to go around the side, drop the little trap and suck a ghost in. It's a very nippy, satisfying little action game.
I imagine after playing the shite nez one, this would have really been quite exciting to you, but it sounds like you missed out on that because of your own misfortune as a child. Is that the- You basically happened there?
I basically had it once, and for a very limited period of time, I played through it and then I didn't have it anymore. I had the other Ghostbusters game again, and then until I was at university, assumed it was some sort of fever dream I had as a child, and I just imagined it. Then I go into emulators and I was like, oh shit, this game actually exists, and I just played through it again.
I've played through it a number of times as an adult. It's fantastic. And I think, did I mention, Satoru Iwata worked on the game as a technical director as well.
So I think you're right. I think it does have a lineage to Pokemon. Like that art style is so distinctive.
Yeah. It's kind of, as an adult now, and at the time obviously I had no idea about this, but it's just fascinating to look back on that it has some connection to some of the greatest Nintendo games of all time.
It's very basic. Like it's a very straightforward game.
It is.
For a licensed game of the time, it's pretty sharp. It works mechanically quite well, and it's distinctive in a couple of ways. So I can see why you like this, Dave.
Yeah, I just played this and an older boy told me to just go and play this in a Chrome tab, so that's what I did in order to get that background for this episode.
Well, staying on you Ghostbusters 2, there was also a Game Boy version of this. This had different level design. It was a little tighter.
There was a couple of little distinct differences. You can't be Lewis, but Lewis and Dana, you'll find hiding in levels and they'll give you a health regen. And then you'll find other Ghostbusters who will give you power-ups as well across the levels.
There's a few different enemies and the structure is just slightly different. I think the big difference is that the AI partner is even less, because the levels are smaller and they get stuck on stuff a little bit easier, a little bit too often. But again, it's basically the same game.
And so for me, it's still very winning and charming.
So what's next up?
So we're going to bounce around. I think we're going to try and move pretty breezily through the next couple. So you've got the real Ghostbusters on Game Boy.
There's a whole convoluted backstory to this, where this was basically a pile of junk that was released as a bunch of different IPs in different territories. It was Garfield, I think, in the UK. And then, yeah, it was Ghostbusters.
And it was based on a game called Castle... Shit, what was it? Castle Frenzy, I want to say?
Right, okay.
But yeah, it was essentially just like... They were just slapping popular IPs in whatever territory it was most popular in. And in America, I believe it was Ghostbusters.
Over here, it was Garfield. Part of junk, we could just move on. No one has any great affection for this game.
Now, here's one I was very skeptical of, because I did not play these games until this week and I tried them out. How familiar are you with Extreme Ghostbusters, the animated sequel to the real Ghostbusters?
Not at all. These are like some quite stylish cartoons back in the day, but just passed me by entirely.
This is the Gen X Ghostbusters cartoon. The thing that I absolutely love about this is that it's got a whole new cast of characters who are all just like edgy and like they have dyed hair and you know, they're all Peter Venkmans in their own way to some degree. But as their mentor, you've got Egon.
And so that he fit in with this sort of Gen Z crowd, he's grown a ponytail and it just has like this big divorced dad, midlife Christ energy to it.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I do know that. I do know that character sign, yeah.
Yeah, I just absolutely love it. But like, his personality is still sort of that dry, sort of, you know, on the spectrum, very sort of straight talking science nerd, but he's just rocking a sort of prog rock ponytail at the same time. Love it, no notes.
There are a few extreme Ghostbusters Games, only really two main ones. That's like some PC, like that's like a Buster Move game, and like, who cares about that? But the first one's Ultimate Evasion, which came out in the PS1.
This is a really, really boring time crisis alike where you move across like a few bland locations and shoot some poorly animated ghosts that appear. It may have been more fun to play with like a gun peripheral on the PS1, but I didn't have that and it was clunky. The presentation's poor.
The ghosts themselves don't feel embedded into the environment in any way. They feel like they're so... I don't know how to describe it.
They sort of pop out from the scenery in like a very weird visual presentation. Like it's... I really hated this.
It was tremendously dull. And I bounced off it after a couple of levels.
It sounds like a bit of a cash-in for the time where there was just suddenly a burst of light gun games as you could get that peripheral at home quite easily, you know?
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
It's the Link's crossbow training of Ghostbusters Games. Yeah.
A backhand, a compliment or accidental praise, you decide.
It was meant in no way to praise it. And then the other one is Code Ecto 1, which was for the Game Boy Advance. So this, they cut down the cast, you're only playing as two of the characters.
I do remember Eduardo, I don't remember what the other character is called. I found this surprisingly fun. This was a neat little platform action game for the Game Boy Advance.
The levels are broken up into sort of short little chapters. Ponytailed Egon gives you like some long expository dialogue at the start of each level. And then you sort of go in.
Each character, you can switch between the two characters at the same time with the left shoulder button. So each have different primary weapons. They also have secondary weapons that are different, like fairly decent Ghostbusters game.
The sort of sandwich between that sort of 80s, early 90s era and Ghostbusters, a video game in 2009. I would have asked you to have played this had I known beforehand how good it was.
I would have played it because it does look quite nice. The pixel art is not bad as these games go from the time on GBA. I think a lot of games, even licensed games of the time, just looks pretty good on GBA because, you know, the canvas was as such that it was easy enough to make a game look nice on that system.
So I agree. It's not like the prettiest game on GBA, but it looks decent for sure.
That's interesting.
Well, there you go.
The audio design is terrible, though. It has awful SFX for all of the action, and the ghosts just make these really lazy grunting noises. Audio, terrible, rest of the game.
Pretty decent. Enjoyable.
I mean, it's crazy how much they went for it with Extreme Ghostbusters. They were like, I guess it was that era where, when a kid's TV show kicked off, like Jimmy Neutron or something, they just went fucking over it to try and set it. That didn't kick off.
Well, but they went for it, right? They had like a PS2 game and all that shit, and it was like a very cursed looking thing, Jimmy Neutron. I don't think they even had a film or something.
Yeah, just garbage, but they just gave it a proper go, and part of that would just be like, yeah, absolutely carpet bombing basically the shelves with bad license games. So interesting there's one at least half decent one in the midst of that, Dave. So what's next from there?
So then we jump all the way, and like apologies, I don't think I've missed anything important here, but we're basically jumping straight to Ghostbusters Video Games, the iconic 2009 game that reunited the original cast. So it's difficult to know where to start with this because there's so many interesting facets to it.
Can I give some background on how this game ended up coming out? Because that's quite interesting. It was caught in the period where Vivendi stopped bothering trying to make their own games, which is that's a period that led to, well, they owned Sierra and it led to games like Fear coming out, for example.
But then they just full on bought Activision Blizzard. And at that point, they basically merged the publishing operations as far as I know and kept some of the games that were in development and then dumped a load of others. And so among the games that got dumped were The Chronicles of Riddick, Assault and Dark Athena, which was picked up, I believe, by Atari at the time.
And this Ghostbusters game that I think everyone knew at this point was going to feature the main cast, that got sold off. And the weird thing is...
To Atari as well.
Atari, but I believe it was published by Sony Europe in the UK, Dave, and that's why it released exclusively on PS3 first, before coming out on other platforms, which is a weird quirk of this game. So, yeah, in Europe, you could only play it on PS3 at first. And then, yes, but it was, like you say, there were multiple versions of this game.
And that's just as quite interesting, because Activision at the time was just like, no thank you. Which, I don't know, I don't think I would have made that call, because I think it was quite a commercial proposition. Like you said, it's unusual.
They got all of the cast back together, and it ended up reviewing pretty well. So why don't you pick up from there, Dave?
Yeah, digging into that history as well. I think a large part of that decision of Activision or picking up was because of the IP had been dormant for so long. Aside from extreme Ghostbusters, there hadn't been any mainstream Ghostbusters media.
There'd be comic books, obviously the animated shows like I just mentioned, there hadn't really been anything, and so there was an uncertainty. It's not like Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Howard Ramis were big business or like, they felt like they would appeal to young people. So there was this hesitance that there wouldn't be an audience for it, because there hadn't been anything significant from Ghostbusters in so long.
But yeah, this was developed by Terminal Reality, it had the rocky road to consoles. From what I understand, the lead producer on it had been wanting to make a Ghostbusters game for a long, long time. He had just done with the Vendee.
Correct me if I'm wrong, because you all know some of this, this was the idea. Just did Simpsons Hit and Run, which was like a massive success, obviously, and much beloved Simpsons game. And then off the back of that, they told him he could make any IP he wanted to.
And he said, I want to make a Ghostbusters free, basically. And so that's where things started. I've had a bit of some months before they sort of contacted Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, and they'd written the script.
I think initially they just wanted feedback on the script, or some, you know, them to contribute to it. And then essentially just snowballed from there into it being this sort of big reunion of the main cast. Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, they all have agents.
You could just call them. Bill Murray famously doesn't have an agent. He has a number you can call to his lawyer.
And sometimes they pick up, sometimes they don't. It's something like that. It's very, very strange.
And they were trying to get, you know, they were trying to get Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis to talk to him, to get him involved. And he just wasn't interested. He wasn't budging.
And then, and they had other members of the cast as well from the old movies. Had Annie Potts, who was back as Janine. They had William Atherton's Walter Peck.
And the missing piece was Bill Murray. And they just weren't sure. And they were exploring the ideas of having sound delikes and to sort of, you know, just have like a lookalike who they could, they could scan in.
And then they came up with an idea of how to get Bill Murray. And I don't know if you know this. So the first two movies, the mayor is a supporting character as he is in the video game and in the movies played by David Mark Gills.
And he was set to reprise the role in Ghostbusters, the video game. However, as they were struggling to get Bill Murray to join the cast, they kind of hatched a plan and fired David Mark Gills from the role. Or apparently they offered him a different part and he refused because he's like, I'm the mayor.
And instead they went to Bill Murray's brother, the actor and Caddyshack writer Brian Dole Murray and asked him if he would portray the mayor in the video game. And so they hired him and they gave Brian Murray like this big welcome. They brought him in to the studio.
They made a whole big song and dance around his character, showed him like the whole plot and going through the project, hoping that he would fall in love with it and tell his brother to come and do it basically. And then like Brian spent a day with them and then at the end of it he was sort of leaving and he kind of saw through it all and said, hey, do you do this for every bit part that you hire for the game? Or did you just do this so I would tell Bill it's a great game and he should do it as well?
And they were just like, yeah, we did it so you would tell Bill it's great. And it worked and he basically called up Bill, his brother, and told him he should join and he did and that was it. Now, you've played the game, the voice acting of, I would say, you could tell Ackroyd is just thrilled to be there, especially at a time when it didn't look like there was any hope of there being a Ghostbusters free, so you could feel the energy in his voice and he's spewing out all the paranormal mumbo jumbo with great glee, I would say.
And likewise, Ernie Hudson is really dependable in it. I think Harold Ramis is a bit hit and miss. He is laboured with a lot of the expository dialogue.
But it's fair to say Murray is the weak link, right? You've listened to him.
You know what, I don't think Bill Murray sounds that bad in this. Because I think it's really hard to tell with him when he's being dry on purpose and when he's being dry because maybe he doesn't give a shit about something. And so I personally think there are...
I played about two hours of this last night. I got past the whole ridiculous reasoning they get to go back to that hotel from the first film, which you'll know the name of that hotel, I'm sure, Dave. And then, like you say, the classic Stay Puft encounter, which looks very impressive, a Times Square and everything.
And the sort of like New York of it all is very well done, I think.
It's playing the hits. You go from the Cedric Hotel to Stay Puft, to the library, fighting the old lady, it knows what it's doing.
It does. And I think that it is a tree having them all there. I think I appreciate it slightly more now than when I did then, because I think that if you do like Ghostbusters, then having them all together like this probably is significant in retrospect, considering how old they suddenly all got and how Ray missed past quite suddenly.
And so I think that maybe as a, because now it kind of is a time capsule itself, whereas at the time, obviously, the getting Bill Murray to record New Dialogue as Venkman was a big marketing ploy to get people excited about the game, which I think it did. But now it's like, oh, it's the last time they had all of these guys in one place. Maybe they didn't all record at the same time, they probably didn't.
But they are all in this game, and it is a game geared around, you're the newest Ghostbusters. They even designed the main guy quite well, I think. He's quite a generic looking.
He looks like a dude who come around and fix your plumbing basically, which I think is what Ghostbusters should look like.
Yeah, he's like a dumpy version of the infamous protagonist.
Yeah, I think that's accurate. I think it's a weird game because it feels to me like, it feels like a Wii game in some ways, despite being a game made for controllers. And I wonder how much of that is the success of the Wii was starting to poison games on different platforms, like Harry Potter games had this at the time as well.
And just combined with the fact that naturally the way that the proton packs work means that you would probably, you can see the one-to-one really between how a Wii controller works and how that would work in a game. So yeah, the slightly unusual twin stick thing where you're shooting them and then trapping them, but you're pulling them around and you're moving them around this 3D space. It feels like it should be a motion control game, but it's not.
And the Wii version was just that. We'll talk about it in a minute, but that was what the Wii version ultimately adapted the main console version to become. I understand exactly what you're saying, but I think they absolutely nailed the proton pack gameplay.
The ghostbusting gameplay in this has never been bettered.
It does look good.
It feels right. It looks right. It sounds right.
It's just, it is great. And even playing the remaster in recent, it's still undeniable. Like, you just feel it when you first strap on the pack as the new recruit.
You go down to the training area and you fire it for the first time. It just feels right. To the point, it feels so good.
And it's so on point that when you unlock the additional mode, so you get like the slime mode, you get like a plasma rifle mode and whatever it is, you just don't want to use them because first of all, it doesn't really give you any reason to use any of the other modes. There's no great advantage. And I know they did that because they understood the appeal of like the, of just firing a proton pack in the proton stream.
And like, if you've mastered that, that's all people want to do. Now, there's a risk that would become boring and repetitive, but it just, it never fills it in this game. It really does capture the essence of watching those movies and wanting to be a Ghostbuster and wanting to sort of grapple, lasso those ghosts, drag them over and trap them.
And it's just perfect. It's perfect in every way in the way, in how it sort of turns out into a game mechanic.
Yeah, I like the physics-y way that bits the environment, get stripped off and the fact that in the remaster, which is the version I played on the Epic Games Store, I switched on the retain the physics objects so it doesn't wipe them or anything. So when you wander around the level again, I mean, it's a linear game anyway, you see all the damage you did sort of sticking around. And then it has that very pleasant 360 era A to B linear action game feel to it.
It's not, I've not played the full thing, but it doesn't feel like it's going to be a super long game, Dave. It feels like it's just a very competently made slice of Ghostbusters nostalgia that does everything it should do, you know?
Yeah. And honestly, it's very front loaded. So I think a lot of people play the first six or so hours of it and get what they get what they need from it.
Because you return to old levels as you go on.
Oh, no.
I detest in games.
Oh, no.
There's also a lot of artifact finding as well, which becomes a bit dreary. And I think the level, they're less confident with the level design when it's outside of the basis of the movies. Yeah, exactly.
So New York turns into a giant graveyard. They're going to sort of like the ghost world. All of that stuff just has...
It just lacks the flair of those early levels set across New York and in those familiar movie locations. So it's a bit of a shame. It kind of dings it a little bit if you've played it.
I played it through a couple of times, and you can turn it off after about four levels and feel like you've got it.
That's tough. I mean, I guess you could just watch the rest of the cutscenes on YouTube.
Before this game was announced, but it was well into development. I was at university, I'm going to say this is circa 2006 because I remember being in halls at the time. Again, bearing in mind, I was a massive Ghostbusters fan and there hadn't really been any interesting Ghostbusters media, and certainly no interesting Ghostbusters video games in a long, long, long time.
Then this tech demo or this prototype leaked online, and it was developed by this studio that doesn't exist anymore called Zootfly, and it was a prototype for Codemasters. This was basically a Gears of War Ghostbusters hybrid that used the likeness and audio of the original Ghostbusters movie. So you had, and this was around the time of the PS3 and Xbox 360 launch.
So this was really cutting-edge visuals, and like basically this demo had Peter Venkman reeling off some lines from the original Ghostbusters, and then wandering around sort of an open world New York shooting buildings that were coming alive. Now watching that footage again yesterday, the buildings coming alive looked terrible, but at that time, given there was nothing else Ghostbusters straight, certainly nothing that had the authenticity of Bill Murray involved, this looked like the best thing I'd ever fucking seen. And like again, looking back on it yesterday, they have these giant guns, very gears coded, that aren't like the proton packs you have now, the proton packs that we see in the movies or in the actual video game that came out.
But this was a huge, huge deal, and this really riled up the Ghostbusters fandom, including myself, who were like, who's making this game? This game should be coming out. And then nothing was heard about it, and I think it was like a year later that Ghostbusters Video Game was announced.
Now I watched a whole making of, or a whole behind the scenes of what happened here. Essentially, Coke Masters hired Zootfly to build this prototype for the Ghostbusters game, for a Ghostbusters game, because they said they had the official license and the likenesses of the characters. So they built this prototype.
Meanwhile, Terminal Reality were making, were making the actual Ghostbusters game and had the license. So they saw this prototype and was like, went to Sony and was like, what the fuck? You know, we thought we were making the Ghostbusters game.
Sony had no idea about this Codemaster Zootfly thing. Essentially shut it down behind the scenes. Zootfly never got paid for it, from what I understand.
They stuck around for a couple more years and I think they developed a couple more games, but they got, essentially got, allegedly, I should say. Yeah, allegedly got shafted on this whole thing. But, this was like this really, like, for me, and I have no idea whether it's true or not, I feel like this was a proof of concept to the terminal velocity guys, because the excitement, sorry, terminal reality guys, because the excitement around this prototype was so high that it just showed that there was this appetite for a really great modern Ghostbusters game out there.
And then when the reveal came, and it did have the original cast, and it did have modern gameplay mechanics, it was really sort of validating all that work that Zootfly had sort of put into that prototype. So they were sort of, they were thinking, they had different approaches, but they were chasing the same goal. And yeah, I think it's just worth noting that, it's worth looking up that tech demo, it's online.
It's quite dated, but you can see why that would excite old Ghostbusters fans like myself.
A bit of the old Deadpool VFX sleek sort of vibe to it. I guess a bit different because literally a different developer made it. But sometimes the fan reaction is the thing that gets something moving properly, or you know what I mean?
But I think you're right. I think that was the purpose. I think it was put out there because they wanted to get the fan reaction so that they could get the license, not knowing that someone else was already developing the game.
I think it was just unfortunate, well, it was unfortunate, so I think it should really be in that position anyway. But it was unfortunate there was a game well into development at that point of time anyway.
Well, okay. So I think, Dave, we should then fast forward through the rest of the Ghostbusters games. I don't think it ever gets that interesting again.
So list feature me through the rest of the Ghostbusters game history.
Yeah, okay. So there wasn't really another game. There was a direct sequel to Ghostbusters A Video Game.
Oh, one more point on Ghostbusters A Video Game. So as I said, the fandom are desperate for it to be canon. The Proton Pack that I own, which I showed the Discord fairly recently, has different modes, which include the modes that are featured in Ghostbusters A Video Game.
So there's all these allusions to it being canon when it's not. But one of the most interesting ones is the villain of the Ghostbusters A Video Game is Ivor Shandor, who is the person who built Dana Barrett's apartment and is a Gozer worshipper. He's the villain.
His design in the game is the same design. And I'm sure you remember this, Sam, because you're such a big fan of Ghostbusters after. He was played by JK.
Simmons in that movie. You see him in a glass coffin who gets resurrected by Gozer at the end of that film. It's the exact same design as the version in the video game, which the guys who made the film deny is the case, even though they look exactly the same.
That's an interesting fact for you.
That's like me getting in the weeds on Twin Peaks fan theory circa 2008. It just sounds like you all need to sort yourselves out a little bit. But nonetheless, I appreciate your passion for the idea.
I appreciate your passion for the form. There's certainly some Star Wars nonsense. We've all done the Wookiepedia, Darth Plagueis, The Wise, Deep Dive Dave.
So I understand.
Will we ever know who that guy in the cave is in Acolyte?
Oh, yeah, well, by the way, Acolyte, the TV show that stumbled across a better TV show in its final moments, they got cancelled. Well done. To everyone involved there, that was good.
Two hours content stretch to eight hours.
Anyway, what comes after that then?
Ghostbusters Sanctum of Slime. This was a direct sequel to Ghostbusters The Video Game. This is Poop.
It is a twin-stick shooter with its own stylized comic look. It was kind of based on the IDW comics of the team. I never really read the IDW comics.
I kind of feel in the same, actually, talking about Star Wars, I regard anything in comic book form or animated to be non-canon and therefore don't try and convince me otherwise. But anyway.
I kind of agree. Animatrix aside, I think I kind of agree.
Animatrix is, yeah, different. Because that directly ties in. So anyway, this is a four player twin stick shooter.
Gameplay is incredibly repetitive. I bounced off this so hard. It's recycling a lot of environments and enemies from Ghostbusters video game.
Absolute poop. Not worth the time of day. I like this next one a lot.
And I think you would like it too. I couldn't get you to play it because it's really, really difficult to play now. Do you know what it is?
No.
Lego Dimensions. There was a Ghostbusters set. It rips.
It rips. Not only because, and I've got the figures on my collection behind me, because it has a Stay Puft in it. And for listeners who haven't seen my pictures on Discord, I have a whole Stay Puft, Marth Schmellerman collection surrounding me in my office.
But this is great. It basically does what a lot of the Lego games did back then. It takes the movie, it just recreates it in Lego form with the original audio, but adds more physical and slapstick humor around the edges.
This was at a time when Lego games reach an impact was at its peak. And I'd say arguably the ambition of Dimensions got away from it as it was trying to sort of latch on to the Disney Infinity Skylanders toy-to-life success and it never quite got there.
That all ended in so many tears, didn't it? That whole thing.
I would say Lego Dimensions was probably the better one of the lot. I mean, mostly because like we were talking about earlier, it kind of jumped in on the 80s nostalgia bandwagons. You had like sets for Beetlejuice, ET.,
Goonies, and you've got like really nice Lego sets with them. Like they weren't particularly expansive Lego sets, but I like the idea of having to build game mechanics and put it on the little platform and that becoming gameplay that you got to tinker around with.
They did a Wizard of Oz set for this thing?
Yeah. They did a Portal 2 set. There's a little Portal 2 Lego Dimensions game.
I think I remember that one. That was cool. But they also had that thing as well where like the characters would interact with each other, right?
They would make quips at each other. So there's a bit of like actual franchise crossover. I can see why that's exciting if you've been sort of like if you've been ground down into a fine powder by franchises over the years, Dave.
As I have.
Yeah, exactly. There may be BA. Baracus sort of interacting with Ron Weasley is probably quite exciting to someone out there, you know?
I mean, these are all precursors to, you know, even Disney Infinity to a degree because, you know, that you could put your figures on and have different characters from Disney interacting. These are all sort of precursors to Fortnite in some way.
That's very true.
This was, yeah. Then we move on to Ghostbusters 2016. So they did a tie-in to the poor fag movie.
This was another isometric twin stick shooter like Sanctum of Slime. I played this at the time. I didn't enjoy it.
I didn't play it again this week because I remember it being so bad. And it was released to coincide with the Kristen Wiig movie, as I said, which, as we mentioned previously, you boycotted Sam outside the local cinema. I think I'm older now.
I think I'm going to be older than Bill Murray was in Ghostbusters this year. I believe Herald Ramus was 40, so I've still got another year, but I think I'm just about to overtake how old Bill Murray was in that first film.
But you know what, Dave? You look about 15 years younger than Bill Murray does in that first film, so don't worry about it.
I remember your response to seeing Bill Murray in the Frozen Empire trailer and just saying how you just described him as a baked potato. You said everyone else is it, no, that was it. It was the post-credits scene in Afterlife where you said, next to the gorgeous Sigourney Weaver who's aged like fire wine, he looks like an overdone baked potato.
That's brutal because I'm going to look like that in about 10 years anyway. That's just all the residual damage of working media, sort of doing its work to my body. But that's no offence to Bill Murray.
I mean, some dudes just look middle-aged early on, and he was one of them. So that's all I'm saying, Dave. Anyway, carry on.
So we've really got two more games to go. So I'm going to sort of bundle these together. We've got Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed, which came out in 2022, and we've got Ghostbusters Rise of the Ghost Lord that came out in 2023.
Now, Spirits Unleashed was developed by Illphonic. It's a 4v1 asymmetric multiplayer game. They developed, I don't think this is really your kind of thing, but they developed Predator Hunting Grounds, Friday the 13th, and they worked on Evolved.
So they were very much in the bag for these types of multiplayer, competitive 4v1 games and working on IP as well.
I like these kinds of things. There's a bit of this kind of game designed to the Gambit mode in Destiny, where you can invade other people's games. But yeah, it's not some kind of a...
I mean, they come and go these games. I don't think there's ever been one that's really stuck around.
I think the one that had the most potential to stick around... I mean, there is, there's Dead by Daylight. Oh yeah, Dead by Daylight.
Dead by Daylight. That is the one. But the one that Illphonic made that had the most potential for that was Friday the 13th, which again, someone will correct me on this, I think came before Dead by Daylight or at least around the same time, and essentially the same game but just with one character.
But like the license expired after the game came out, so they had to remove it from shops. Just the weirdest like story behind that. But I loved Friday the 13th.
It was a much more simple and hilarious like version of this formula, that felt more repeatable. Spirits Unleashed kind of gets dull after a couple of matches because there isn't enough variety and tasks and it doesn't ratchet up the tension in quite the same way. The level design is a little like rote, it just doesn't really give you enough to explore.
With Friday the 13th, you've got a whole woods and cabins and things move around each time you play it, so it's constantly challenging you every time you replay it, to get ahead of whoever's going to be playing Jason Voorhees. Everything's kind of the same each time and you have such an unfair advantage if you're the ghost, because you could just float above everything, run away. I played a few matches back in the day.
It is good, it is fun with people you know, as we've always with these things. With people you don't know, it is less fun. But a couple of things I really, really like about it.
It presents itself as a sort of sequel to Ghostbusters Afterlife. The idea being, again, I know you've got a photogenic memory of Ghostbusters Afterlife and the credits of that movie have the Ecto-1 going across A-Bridge in New York. I don't know which one.
Alluding to it going back to its home. This kicks off straight after that of Winston entering the Firehouse and rebuilding it and starting Ghostbusters business up again. You get to explore both the Firehouse and Razor Cult.
One nitpick, Razor Cult was never next door to the Firehouse. They've put them next to each other. A little bit annoying, impersonally.
But it's cool to actually explore that environment. There's lots of really nice Easter eggs around. Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd reprised their roles as well.
The story is super thin. The gameplay is fun. As I say, it just doesn't have enough variety to make it sort of stand out in that 4v1 genre.
Ghostbusters Rise of the Ghostlords, the most recent one. This is a VR game by End Dreams. I've played this quite a lot.
Sounds like a good fit in theory.
It sounds like a good fit. And I'm gonna go back to that thing about authenticity. The cartoonish design, I have a real aversion to in the characters and the enemies.
And like the tone of it is just a little bit skewed younger. It's weird because it's skewed younger. But VR by its nature is quite intense, I find at least.
And so when this game starts off, the intro is actually really cool to this. Like you're exploring this environment and then the main ghost bad guy eventually reveals itself and it all sort of builds up to this big reveal and it's really effective. But it's quite scary, you know, it is quite scary, but it's aimed at kids and it has a whole bunch of jump scares in it.
But I just found the design a little too childish for me and I didn't quite gel with it. And then like I played through it. I found the levels to be slightly dull and repetitive.
It's first person as is Spirits Unleashed. And I think Spirits Unleashed just had a better grip on the first person Ghostbusters mechanics personally for me. Didn't quite work in VR.
That's just my take on it. It's good, not great. Yeah, we actually skipped over it.
Ghostbusters, the video game in 2009 had a Wii version, which did use the Wii remote controls. And that was essentially the same game, that used the same audio from the Xbox and PlayStation versions. But that gave it sort of a, it had a slightly different story line, slightly different level design, and had a more cartoonish aesthetic as well.
I didn't really get on with that for the exact same reasons, but it has its fans. So that's there. They also did a DS version, which is absolute shite, but it tries to do the David Crane thing of having Ecto One sections too.
But again, shite game, really clunky. But that's it, I've recapped all of them. We did it.
There's a pinball game I didn't mention. There's a bunch of like PC educational games and I'm gonna talk about, but we did it.
We did.
Yeah, top five. Here we go, go five to one. Number five, I'm going with Spirits Unleashed.
Like I say, I think that this is a really good concept for a Ghostbusters game. The busting itself is really satisfying. They've sort of nailed the look and the physicality of it.
And I had a lot of fun playing this with friends, less fun playing with strangers. But it's an admirable effort. And I think I was split between putting this and the Extreme Ghostbusters Codecto One.
I couldn't decide which one of the two. I might just say both of them are fifth. But yeah, I think Spirit's Unleashed doing something a bit different sort of deserves its flowers for that.
Okay, fair enough. I think that makes sense.
Number four, Lego Dimensions. Ghostbusters set.
Yeah, that's wild. But it's good. Totally.
I mean, I guess.
It's so good.
Is it backwards compatible on PS5 if you go and buy all the different bits for it?
You know what? I've got a bucket upstairs in my loft with it all in. So I could check if it still works on my Xbox.
It screams Facebook Marketplace. Like you could hoover it all up for about 20 quid, I imagine, in some places. You know, it's got that vibe to it.
This is a future games court waiting to happen. A full Lego Dimensions deep dive.
I didn't buy that June Lego set at the end, Dave. I tore myself out of it.
You should have got it.
No, I'd buy it and then it would just sit there. And I'd be like, yeah, I've got Lego, Fatstead and Scar, Scar, but what am I going to do with it? You know, I just had no end game there.
You're literally talking to the guy surrounded by toy stay puffs that just sit there.
Yeah, they bring you great joy, but I look at my possessions and then just feel kind of like slightly hollow. And then kind of just carry on with my day. Unless it's a comic book, so they make me happy.
Anyway, number three.
Number three, Ghostbusters The Video Game 2009.
What? You're not putting that at number one. Surely that for most people now, you'd say go get the remaster for this if you're going to play any Ghostbusters game.
This is where I would say these are the great Ghostbusters games. My top three are great Ghostbusters games. Four and five are really good Ghostbusters games.
So I'm putting this number three. For the reasons I kind of said, this does get a little repetitive towards the backend. I think they ran out of runway to a degree due to some of the misfortune with publishers that were going on from what I understand from the development backstory of this.
But obviously the value of having that original cast together.
Yeah, it's just really interesting that this game was kind of like the Indiana Jones in the great circle of its day, right?
It absolutely was, yeah.
Yeah, we never thought we would see a game on that scale with that license, with that kind of cast like that. The casting actually makes it a real one-off. Can you think of anything else like that where, actually the only one I can think of is The Warriors from Rockstar, where it's like an old movie and they get the whole cast back together minus one or two people.
That is what they did for The Warriors. So that's the only other one I can really think of. I don't think The Thing has any of the voice cast, for example.
Obviously, they don't because they all die in the film. That's the film, The Thing. So yeah, interesting.
You're right. It is unique. It's a special game, I think, in the history of IPs being adapted to video games.
And it is iconic and deserved its remaster. I think there's potential for it to be a much, much better game. But it's hard not to love it and I do love it.
And playing the Stay Puft Times Square Mission for the first time was just awe-inspiring to me.
It gets enough right, you know?
It gets enough right, absolutely. And as I say, I think the more you play it, the sort of, your patience starts to wear thin. But I'm kind of ragging on it a bit too much for something that is one of the, if not for most people, the best representation of Ghostbusters.
And for many, many people, the actual Ghostbusters 3 that sort of bridged the gap between the movies, old and new. So it is very special. So number two, I've gone with the original Ghostbusters, David Crane one from 1984.
Thumbs down from me, dog, on this one.
I know. And I knew you'd hate me putting it here. But I love it.
And I love it because with the limitations of the technology at the time, it perfectly, as I said before, it perfectly encapsulated like everything that the Ghostbusters movie was trying to do in terms of like representing the science fiction angle of it, the action, the blockbuster feel of it, the cinematic feel of it, and also like the business management side of things. Like it really did juggle so many different elements that was sort of the core essence of Ghostbusters, the movie, in really early game design like trappings. And it's just exceptional.
And it may be because it was my first Ghostbusters game and it was such a big part of my early gaming childhood that I've put it so high, but I do think it's down to test time apart from for you, who absolutely hate it.
I think anyone who's never played it, didn't play it at the time, would think this is terrible personally. But I can see why the ingenuity of it, given the limitations, would make it appealing. So fair enough.
Okay, so the number one then, Dave, I'm guessing is the Howl Laboratory one.
Absolutely. New Ghostbusters 2. Like this, this to me is just fun.
It's an original take, but like the other games on this list, it has such an affection for the source material that it just gets it so right. Like, why else would Louis Tyler be a playable character if it were not because these people just love these movies like so wholeheartedly? And again, like much in the same way, David Crane with the limitation system at the time did some really spectacular things with gameplay mechanics around the concept of Ghostbusters.
This too, with the sort of, with your lead buster and your sidekick taking on missions, like going through some really lavishly detailed recreations of locations from Ghostbusters too, even down, as I said before, to the music, recreating some of the tracks from actual pop songs from the soundtrack. It really does knock it out of the park. I think it's incredibly replayable.
I've played it so many times over the years. The design of it, as we've sort of discussed, really feels like it's a predecessor to that era of like Pokemon and Earthbound. I just think this is a standout amongst all Ghostbusters games.
Not just because of that level of authenticity, but it managed to be authentic while being distinct. And no other game I think has really done that successfully in the Ghostbusters canon.
Yeah. Okay. Well, I think that makes sense as a kind of nostalgia pick.
I sort of do recommend to the listeners like fire up a Chrome tab, type in, play New Ghostbusters 2 NES and then give this like a whirl. Because it is quite interesting to see, like I say, the visual design of Earthbound and Pokemon, like the locations and the sprites just in a licensed game context. The fact that I guess like with Winston Zedemore's skin color, they just went with the same blue as his uniform, Dave.
Not many colors back then on the NES, I guess. So they did what they could without offending anyone. Fair enough.
Well, I mean, that wasn't the most problematic character in any of these Ghostbusters games. The guy who works in the takeaway in the Megadrive Ghostbusters game is definitely a stereotype that is a little cringe-inducing.
We'll leave that as a cursed delight for the listeners to track down. Okay. Well, that is the episode.
I did briefly have a section on other games that do Ghostbusting, but I think we need to talk about that in real detail, Dave, just because we're nearly at the two and a half.
Yeah, we are. This went on a long time and I apologize, but Luigi's Mansion is great. Phasmophobia is like, it's not busting ghosts, but it's Ghostbusting you and that's a whole lot of fun.
There's a whole bunch of ones you could go to. Maybe that's another pod altogether.
Luigi's Mansion is definitely the strongest, most obvious one of like, I don't think that game would exist if Ghostbusters didn't exist. It's a real one-to-one there. It's actually one of the only times you can really think of Nintendo sort of taking from pop culture in that way.
Being inspired in that very, what seems like a very direct one-to-one way. I had Ghost Hunter on PS2. I bought it in a two-for-35-pound deal from HMV, with Anubhusha 2, and Ghost Hunter was rubbish.
That's my take. That's a five out of 10 PS2 game from the time. Do you ever play that one, Dave?
No, I've never heard of it before.
Yeah, it's like you play as a spiky-haired guy, and you also play as like a ghost lady. It's from the developers of Primal. I think it was basically the Sony Cambridge lot who got closed down a few years ago, and eventually, I think they also made that Killzone game on PS Vita that looked amazing, but was about two hours long.
That was their last game. So yeah, interesting history there. Okay.
Well, Dave, thank you so much for talking us through those. And certainly, you are an authority on the matter of Ghostbusters. No one will doubt that coming out this episode.
Where can people get you on social media?
I'm on Blue Sky as Scarbs, I believe. And I always forget, don't I? I always forget all my letterboxes.
So let's just...
Scarby? Dave Scarby?
Davey Scarb.
Davey Scarb.
Yeah, Scarbs on Blue Sky, Davey Scarb on Letterbox. Check out my review of all the latest comic book movies. I keep seeing them twice at the moment for whatever reason.
But yeah, we will discuss Fantastic Four, Sam, once you've seen it. But yeah, it was good.
It's happening this Saturday. So that's coming down the pipe from me. But yeah, thank you for coming on, Dave.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on social media. And the podcast is at BackpagePod.
patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to. Additional exclusive podcast a month, the £4.50 XL tier. That helps to fund the likes of Dave Scarborough to come on here and share his passion in the way that he does.
Like when you're playing Worms and they use a cluster bomb and absolutely fucking goes off. That's basically Dave talking about Ghostbusters. So that was a great joke, David.
I had so many notes I didn't go into, but I think-
Any one of those like recite as we leave for any parting trivia for the podcast?
Any parting trivia? Oh my gosh. Hang on.
Let me have a look up on this.
Ernie Hudson had back pain when he recorded his lives for Ghostbusters 2009. Oh, very interesting, Dave.
No, I don't think anything is interesting enough to reel out, but...
Oh no. I've made you self-conscious now.
I know, I know.
I would like to have heard your trivia. Do you know what I thought, actually, when you were telling me about those last few games? Is that it's entered that space where you look at the box office, it's not big enough now to be like a triple A game.
Like that 2009 game was really a one-off. There'll never be anything like that again. It will just never be that hot.
And so it's sort of in that weird double A license space now, where I think you'll probably get a new game every five years or so, but none of them will be like exceptional. That's basically the future of these games.
That's a very sad outlook to the future of my beloved franchise. The movies are in the same rut. They're going to get a sub $100 million budget, and they'll star half the cast of Stranger Things until I die.
That is a bum note actually. Are they making a third one of those? Is that a thing that's happening?
Is Jason Reitman unleashing that on people?
You know what? It hasn't been confirmed, so I'm not quite sure if it is. I mean, Frozen Empire was not great, and I think it's because it tried to take too much from the real Ghostbusters cartoon versus, you know, taking stuff from the film canon.
It was just sloppy and messy, and really, the character of Phoebe can't shoulder a Ghostbusters franchise, which was a mistake they're making there. But anyway, I digress.
More Hating Women from Dave Scarborough there, and a perfect note to go out on. So, yes.
Plucky children. I hate plucky children.
Thank you so much for listening, and we'll be back next week. Goodbye. Bye bye.
