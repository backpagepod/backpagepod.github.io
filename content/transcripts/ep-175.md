Hello and welcome to The Back Page, a podcast about video games. My name is Matthew Castle, and you might better know me as the second hello you normally hear on the podcast. Your regular host, Samuel Roberts, is away on business, so you are stuck with me.
But don't worry, because I have a killer special guest to help fill the void. He's a person I've wanted to get on the podcast for a very long time, the author of three mystery novels, which happen to be three of my favourite mystery novels of the last ten years. They are The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, which won the Custer First Novel Award, The Devil in the Dark Water, and recently released The Last Murder at the End of the World.
And the man behind them is Stuart Turton. Hello, Stuart.
Hiya, man, how are you going? Sorry, before I let you answer your own question, I just want to put it out there that as Samuel's not here, I have issued a personal vendetta against him, and we will, our families will be forever enemies.
Oh no, that's tough. It's not the first vendetta against him. He's a man who's used to these things, so he'll be fine with it.
But how are you? Sorry, I should let you answer your own question.
I am good, I'm good. I'm glad that we've managed to grab an evening of your time. I know you are very busy on your sort of promotional tour, I guess, of Last Murder.
Yes, excited to be chatting. How are you, Stu? How are you doing?
I'm all right, man. Yeah, I mean, I'm an author, so like busy is a relative term, right? Like there's sort of doctor busy and then there's kind of author busy, which is sort of like sitting chatting a lot, which is probably what I'd be doing anyway in any profession that I was in.
So it's not too bad. It's just, yeah, there's a lot of sort of like new faces, a lot of sort of new conversations and small talk that's been happening recently, but it's fun.
Excellent. It was interesting, as I was writing this intro I was trying to work out how best to introduce you and describe you and, you know, I settled on, you're an author. But I was curious, what do you think of yourself as?
Do you think like author, do you think mystery writer, crime writer? I don't know if the kind of the genre tag, you know, feels extra special.
Oh no, it's really interesting. I don't. I think of myself as a writer because I was a journalist for years.
So I did that and I used to take any job, as you well know, like if you're a writer, you'll write anything. I think people assume that we sort of start off as one thing, we stay in that lane. But like I used to write technology, I wrote travel, I wrote finance, I wrote what lifestyle, celebrity interviews, whatever anyone would pay me to do, that's what I did.
So I don't think I ever sort of fixed the tag to myself. I'm just a writer. I still feel like tomorrow, if you handed me like, if you asked me to go and like interview Roger Federer about a new racket, I would probably go and do it.
Just like, I'm so used to saying, yes, yes, please God give me some money that I would like run after that gig.
Yeah, yeah. It was more like, I didn't know if it like, because, you know, you are part of this quite special club of people who get to call themselves mystery writers and crime writers. That's why I was curious if it was a thing.
But I think special is kind of like special the way your mum uses it, right? Rather than special.
I think, well, I obviously, I hold the genre in like very high steam. So as an outsider, if I wrote a mystery novel, I'd be using that all the time.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice, because once you're in it, it's like anything else. I reckon it's the same with you and sort of video games journalism and sort of like doing stuff for YouTube and working with PlayStation in your day job. Like that's a job that I suspect like 97% of the population wants.
But for you being on the inside of it, you're probably sort of vaguely aware of that. But it's just your day job. Like it's just mostly like it's a lot of like it's like a big pile of annoyances, is it?
And then occasionally somebody will come up to you and be like, hey, look, this is you do an amazing job. And you're like, I suppose I do. Yeah, I suppose I am very lucky.
But so a day to day basis, I don't hold it in that same high regard for me. It's just the thing that I do from nine to five. And then I go in and bath my kids.
Excellent, excellent. We tend to sort of split these episodes into two parts. And for the first part, I was going to kind of talk to you a little about the new book and your books in general.
And then in the second half, talk a little bit about video games, because I know that you are a big gamer. You know, maybe talk a little bit about how your books and games interact or how one may have influenced the other. But before we get to that gaming chat, and as we're going to talk about your books up front, I did want to kind of give the listeners an idea of your gaming credentials, as this is a gaming podcast, before we launch into the book chat.
So when you hit a milestone in your writing, whether that's finishing a draft or getting a book out there in the world, do you ever like hold back a game to kind of play as a reward? Do you kind of treat yourself that way? And if so, why are you playing at the moment?
Yeah, it's a big deal, actually. So what will happen is that the moment the book gets sent off to my publisher and my editor, I will immediately go and buy a new video game. That's the tradition.
That's always been the tradition. So like the most recent one I bought weirdly was the Prince of Persia, the new Prince of Persia one.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. What's it called? The Lost Crown?
Yeah, I keep want to say the Fallen Crown, Lost Crown.
Something like that. Whatever that everyone's howling at us out there. They're like, how do you know this?
It's the new. I think you can save a new Prince of Persia and everyone will be like, OK.
Yeah, yeah. So I bought that and then I got through that. I had to go to the US for a work thing.
So I finished that on the plane there and back. Like I love Metroidvanias. They're my all time favorite genre.
So I blitzed through that and it was the most perfect thing for me to be on a long plane journey. Like two flights. Like the kids were down because the kids came with me.
They were asleep. Once I got them down, I just picked this thing up and I just played and played and played. And it was entirely wonderful.
And then when I finished that, I came back and then there was another thing that happened. So I bought, actually, I bought Returnal and then blasted through Returnal, which I adored as well.
You blasted through it? That's a difficult game.
It's a... Okay, so I love games like that. I love soft systems games where as you play them, you pick up the knowing of how to play them, right?
And the skill level is only you knowing how to play that game. Returnal was that. And once you get to a certain point with that game, I found at least, it was never easy.
It was always a difficult game because they hit hard. But once you understood the attack patterns of all the enemies, it just became this lovely, almost like rhythm game. It was like, that's going to do that, so I go over here.
That happens there, so I go over here. Almost like a Souls-like or something like that. You get into this really weird sort of like, your fingers are doing most of the work and your brain is just off somewhere else.
But yeah, now I'm on Lies of P, which is really interesting because Lies of P doesn't do that. Lies of P is a really weird, janky, soft, Souls-like that doesn't do any of the things well that Souls-likes are supposed to do. Like it's, those games are wonderful and brilliant and I love them because they are fur in their unfairness.
Like everything hits hard and can kill you very quickly, but you can learn how to defeat those enemies because they move in a certain way and you can understand how that works. Lies of P does not do that remotely. Like the enemies just do really random things all the time and the attack animations are all over the place and the hitboxes are all over the place.
It's really annoying, but I have to finish it. So that's what I'm playing at the moment with incredible frustration.
Oh man, what a thing to have. The idea of rewarding myself for any hard work with a Souls-like is like, that's my idea of hell. I'd play a little bit of a Souls-like and then maybe reward myself with some work afterwards to kind of cheer myself up.
We got kind of called out by someone saying how quaint it was, how little we understood them or had kind of engaged with them and so this weekend I started playing Dark Souls from the start because I've only ever got about two hours into it and I can never make a character that seems to have a fighting chance. I think that's my problem. You know, like we have to pick the class at the start and so I kind of enter the world on the back foot.
But I was intrigued by Lies of P because you enter it as this pre-made character and I didn't know if that made a difference. It sounds like not from what you're saying.
No, I think the one thing about The Souls Lakes that bothers me quite a lot is that what comes with the genre, which FromSoft... Is it FromSoft? Introduced to it was this idea of like you're supposed to obscure the information.
So the difficulty isn't just in sort of like beating the enemies that are in front of you. It's knowing what stats do what and how to interpret them and sort of like how they interact with each other and sort of like how just to build a character. It almost forces you to go online to figure that stuff out and to get that information.
Because all I want to do is like pick up a sword and sort of like smack that guy in the face and work out how to avoid him smacking me in the face. But at first, like the game Dark Souls, I was like, I just didn't understand what anything did. And it gives you these obscure character classes.
It's somehow been baked in that if you like a Souls like, you're supposed to defend all parts of Souls likes. And I'm definitely not that guy. I think it's a huge, huge, stupid.
If that was a book, your editor would very much be like, don't do that. Like, don't do that. It's already that.
It's like, I don't think that part is fun. It's just something that we accept about it. And I think that's ridiculous.
Like, you should know what pumping that thing into there does. That feels like a fairly obvious oversight to me. But yeah, I wouldn't.
And again, I won't start with Dark Souls anymore, because I think that's the one that maybe is aged the worst. I think like it's really sort of like, it feels like sort of slow and muddy now and a bit like, I don't know. Like, I went back to that a couple of years ago and I had real trouble sort of enjoying it again.
Right. Right. Yeah.
I just thought it's, you know, it's of the Dark Souls, specifically games, it's the one that I'd made the most progress in in the past. So I thought I might have some muscle memory or whatever. But, you know, straight from the off, I was in that Undead Burg, whatever it's called, and just all these skeletons throwing grenades at me from a rooftop and I just got really cross and went and played Octopath Traveler 2 instead.
So that was my weekend.
But those, just to go, sorry, I know this is taking, I know we've started with the video games part first, but like, it's interesting to me because you asked sort of like why that's my reward game, like a Souls like, or even a Metroidvania. And it's because I think I need that sort of bit of challenge to disengage my brain from the thing that I've just been doing. So, as an Octopath Traveler, I will zone out very...
I was playing, I played a bit of the Final Fantasy XVI, which was just like, I never had to engage my brain at any point to play that game. And therefore, my brain then wandered to the work that I was trying to forget about. It went back to the things that I knew I'd have to do in two weeks or three weeks.
So, I think I need something that's really tough, or a big strategy game, I think would also work. But I haven't played one of those for a while because I fell out of love with the Civilization games and they used to be my go-tos for that.
Oh, this is nightmare territory for me, Stuart. Souls likes strategy games. Are you into management games?
That's another one for me. Terrible, that.
I used to be a massive football manager fan. But that's an all-consuming game that I've had to. It's like a diseased limb.
I just had to saw it off. It was like Evil Dead 2. It was just me sawing it off at the elbow just to be done with it.
Because otherwise it completely consumes me. And I look in the mirror and don't recognize who I've become anymore. I'm so worried about training schedules for imaginary players.
And I'm genuinely bothered about it.
Amazing. Awesome. So if those are your rewards at the end of a book, are you gaming during the writing of a book?
Or often hear authors talk about not reading as much when they're writing. Because they just want to kind of be in the zone. Do you play games while you're writing?
I play very familiar things. So Slay the Spire, I play a ton. Like I've got a thousand something hours on that game.
Like I just play Slay the Spire. Because I know every combination of cards and artifacts. And sort of like every enemy.
Like I know that game absolutely inside and out. And it's so comforting to me. So that's my...
And because one of those games, if you do exceptionally well in it, you'll be done, you'll still be done in an hour. And if you collapse, you'll be done in sort of 15, 10 minutes. So it's absolutely perfect for that.
But generally, I think the final six months of book, and it should point, it takes me about two years to finish a book, all told. At the beginning, the first three months of that two years is planning. So that's roughly me just walking around in the world with like the story trying to form itself in my head and me trying to hammer bits to other bits and solve problems.
I play a fair amount of games in that period, because again, I need to be able to take myself somewhere. I need my brain to stop. So sometimes I can't describe it, like unclench almost, like think about something else.
And then when your focus turns back to it, the solution is often in front of you. So I play a lot of games in that, and then it tails off in the middle bit, because I'm working eight, nine hours a day often, just to get the book out of the way and get the words down. And then the five or six months, there's nothing at all, because my entire life is the book, and finishing the book, and hating the book, and hating everyone who's keeping me from the book, and hating myself for ever starting this career.
Great. Wonderful. What a delightful rhythm.
It's a journey of self-loathing, honestly.
Awesome. Well, I want to talk a little bit about the books now. A little taster of some gaming chat later, I want to ask you a lot more about games.
I'm curious, what's going through your head at the moment with relation to the book at launch? Are you excited, terrified, relieved? What's the vibe?
No, I'm extremely anxious. I've said this before, the problem with this job, especially for me, is I don't think I'm massively suited towards it, like temperamentally. I love people and I love a chat and I love an office and I love having people around me.
I love the energy of that. So I first of all picked a job where I sit in silence and isolation for two years trying to finish this thing off. So that seems contradictory.
So the actual writing part of it, I never enjoy that very much because again, the only way to get this done for me is to sit down or a computer for eight hours a day, 2,500 words a day, every day. If I miss 2,500 words, I have to write the 2,500 words the next day on top of my existing 2,000. So it's 5,000 words.
If I miss it again, it's 7,000. So it's a treadmill. I'm always on this treadmill.
So I do that. So I find that quite tough and I find that by the end of it, I'm completely exhausted and just sick of the book. By the time the book goes, I'm done with it and I never want to see it again.
And then what happens, it goes away and you do the edits and you go through the copy editing thing, which is where people are like, hey, what about that? Did you see that? Did you mean this typo?
And you fix all those little bits and you get some distance from it. And then I start to see sort of what I think I should have done, what could have been better, what I could change, what I could fix, but it's too late. So that's a bit sickening.
And then from that gut feeling of revulsion, you get into publication, day, week, month, whatever it is. And then you're just, it just makes me so sick, the entire thing, because you're terrified. You are terrified about it.
You are terrified about the sales of it because the sales are your livelihood. So there is no salary in this. Like if my books don't sell, I don't pay my mortgage.
I don't buy my kids shoes. So that is my livelihood if it doesn't sell well. So you're terrified and you're living and dying on every review that comes in.
Even though I don't read most of them because you're like, well, if they point to a sort of negative trend, then I start getting bad reviews, then that's probably directly going to impact sales. And if the sales go south, then I'm not making my living this year. And it's the only thing I'll do for two years.
So it's not like I've got the ability to suddenly just pop another one out in six months and sort of like turn it all around. No, I find it completely horrible, pal. Like I really, really...
I was talking with one of your colleagues, Alice Bell, the other day on Twitter about this, how she hates publication day and just like disappears from social media while it's ongoing. And I feel exactly the same. It's really rough because there's nothing you can do about it.
Like you've written the book, you've given it to your publicity team, you've given it to your publisher, they're doing their best work. But it's up to other folk. Like you honestly can't do very much to implement it.
So yeah, no, horrible.
I am beginning to understand why Souls Likes Games are actually a very enjoyable experience now compared to this. Like very clear progress, very clear goals, you know, if you succeeded or not. That's yeah, I get it.
I mean, you know, speaking of sales, you know, obviously Last Murder at the End of the World was a Sunday Times bestseller. That's good. Congrats.
Maybe this is a bit inside baseball. I've always wondered about these kind of things. How quickly do you know if a book is is or isn't going to be a success?
Back in the magazine days, we used to make games magazines and sell them. And you probably wouldn't find out for like months if the issue you made had, you know, done OK, just because of the way information filters back. And like, you know, hopefully it's not too technical a question.
I'm just kind of interested. You know, how quickly do you get that read on on how books doing?
So you get your first week sales the following week, basically. So you're a week in arrears, obviously. So and it goes from I could ever quite remember this information.
So somebody will probably correct me. But I think it goes from something like Sunday. I think goes from Sunday to Sunday.
Basically is when the sales are counted. And there's a really weird part about this, which it's up to bookshops to enter the figures into this database, this database, which is like the thing that tops up all the sales figures. So and that's entirely voluntarily.
It's not an automated system anywhere. Like bookshops have to go type, go onto the system at a certain time of night on the Sunday. And they've got like one hour or two hours to enter the sales data for all the books for that week.
And that's how it works. So all the bookshops across the country will go in and they will type in their sales data. Amazon does it at their end as well.
And then that gets tottered up by this company. I think it's Nielsen does it. And then they toss it up and then they send out the sales figures to Sunday Times and the publishers.
And you get those on the Tuesday. So by the Tuesday, after your first week, you know whether you're going to hit that Sunday Times bestseller list or not.
And that's got to be thrilling to hit it though, right? Or is that a relief?
Yeah, it's such an awful thing because I sound really negative about the entire thing. But it is like, it's what happens, right? It's what happens when you turn your hobby into a job.
It's what happens when you turn something magical into a pet in a zoo, right? So you finally conquer the Pegasus, you drag it down out of the sky and you stick it behind bars in a zoo. And then all of a sudden, all the kids are just walking past it and they don't really notice it anymore.
So it's a bit like that as a job. It's kind of like, it becomes very sort of like, it's a thing that I started out of love. It's a thing that I started out of because I was compelled to do it.
Like I've never been able to do anything else and all I ever wanted to do was write. That was my hobby. And then you turn it into a job and then it becomes right.
Well, my entire livelihood, as I said earlier, is based on the back of these sales. It's based on the back of me doing my job well. But it's also based on this ephemeral thing of people deciding that they like the book that I've just written and I can't really control that.
So there is something thrilling about hitting the bestseller list, but it's also a kind of like, oh, good, that now allows me to go through this torment again the next time. I know that's really negative, but it's like the reward for sort of like selling well is that you get to try again next time.
Right.
That's it. And at any point, if you don't sell well, you can easily fall off the treadmill. So that's pretty...
It's an interesting... And I don't know if all authors suffer the same sort of thing, but I find it very anxiety inducing. And I'm not a particularly anxious person, normally.
That's not something I generally suffer through, but this particular process really kills me. Because it's some magical combination of judgement and capitalism. Like it's just...
You know, you just send this thing into the world hoping people like it, and if they don't, they just don't buy it, and then you sit there without any money and all of their scorn.
Amazing. Well, I mean, to steal your analogy, these books are these creatures in a zoo, designed to kind of catch the eye of the passersby. The Last Murder at the End of the World is a pretty funky creature.
It's like it's pretty out there. I imagine you've been asked a million times to explain this concept to the book, but for those listening who aren't familiar or haven't read it yet, or maybe looking to get it, how would you, how have you been describing the book to people?
So, The Last Murder at the End of the World is set 90 years after the world ended, so everybody's dead, they were killed out by this fog that covered the planet. There's only 122 people left and they're living on a small Greek island, and the Greek island is protected from the fog by this barrier that surrounds it. And in those 90 years, since the world ended, these are beautiful people, the selfless, the kind, the wonderful, there's no violence anymore, there's no strife, there's no ikemen, there's no pushing, there's no shoving, they're living a truly utopian existence, it's really lovely.
Basically, there's no social media, is what makes it. And then, one morning, one of them turns up dead. So into this community where there's never been any violence of any sort, there's suddenly a murder, a really brutal murder, and it's up to one of the villagers who don't even understand murder to kind of step up and understand what happened on the island.
And surrounding all of this, there are tons of secrets. So the island is like, they have a voice in their head that's talking to them all the time, sort of guiding them and directing them and encouraging them. And it can hear all their thoughts and they can talk back to it.
There's bits on the island they're not allowed to go to. They have a curfew, so whatever they are, they just fall asleep at like half six every night, no matter what they're doing, and then woken up at ten past seven the next morning, no matter where they fell asleep. So there's loads of strangeness, and there's loads of oddities, and it's kind of up to our detective, up to our protagonist, Emory, to sort of like sift through them and work out what's actually happening on this island.
Well, yeah, I read this book a few months ago. You very kindly sent me an early copy of it, and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was fantastic.
It was very you in terms of just its ambition and how stuffed with mystery it is. Like it's a really mysterious book. This is a really fucking mysterious book.
It's what I would write on the cover.
I should get a blurb out of you next time, because that's excellent.
It's that? You know, which is actually, it can be a bit of a rare thing in the genre. Like the pure mystery of the thing isn't always at the heart of mystery stories.
Like there's a lot of other stuff that people choose to write about. So I want to talk about some of that in a bit. But, you know, you've obviously now got this very smooth pitch for the book.
But I'm kind of curious how close that description that you gave now was to like maybe what you pitched to your agent or publisher before you started writing. Like, does the end result resemble what you set out to write?
No, not remotely. No, it's not even close to what I... I actually wrote the wrong book first.
I wrote 111,000 word book, which I tossed away.
Oh, man.
So that was the first... My first year of writing got tossed in its entirety, like top to bottom. And I started again after a year because that pitch was the most...
Oh, my God. It was the most sort of like university philosophy student writes a book, book that you could ever come across, which is wild to me because obviously at this point, I'm a 44 year old man. I've written two books previously.
I know the stakes around the novel. But what I ended up writing was so self-indulgent. And it was so...
It was fun for me to sort of write because it had this massive conceit at the center of it, which was, I think, wonderful. I think we met in... Inside baseball again, but we met in a bar a few years ago, didn't we, in Bath and we had a chat.
And I think I ended up sort of half drunkenly trying to describe this to you. That should have been my first sign that I couldn't adequately describe what I was trying to do. Because I couldn't adequately describe it to myself.
I just thought if I keep writing it, I'll work it out somewhere along the line. And I never did. I never got anywhere near it.
And it's funny because through that, I've always wondered how sort of like janky films and janky games and sort of turn up. I always wonder how that happens. And by writing that book, I think I worked it out.
Like you start with like the purest of ambition and an absolute belief in your own talent. And then somewhere you just hit your talent gap. You hit the threshold of what you're capable of doing.
And then you're just like, oh shit, like, oh my God, I'm so deep into this. And then you just keep struggling on until you finish this thing. And that's what I did for a year.
I had this like this book and it was again, it was fun to write and it was a big thing to play with. And I would love to revisit something like it in the future. But it was, it was, you would, nobody would have read it.
Nobody would have enjoyed it. It would have been the death of a career. And I just didn't want to, I didn't want to put anyone through it.
So I sent that to my, I sent that to my publisher. And basically the note, the email attached to it was, hey, this is 111,000 words. For the first time in history, I've met my deadline.
But we won't actually be publishing this, so don't worry about it. And then I went away for like two months and then rethought the entire thing and then went back to work.
Oh, right. Wow. I mean, the final book's still like pretty out there.
So I'm kind of, yeah, I'm intrigued to, I mean, obviously we'll never see it, but yeah, intrigued to see how different it is. That's interesting.
It's one of those things where you're intrigued until you started reading it. And then you'd be like, no, I get it now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because there is a level of out there-ness that you can, especially I think in crime, sci-fi it's sort of built in and fantasy it's sort of built in. In crime, there's still sort of anchors that you need to give your audience and your readers.
There's still things that they expect from that genre that you have to deliver. So there's a level of out there-ness that you can have and achieve, but it's still got to be tethered to the genre's trunks. You've still got to hit certain beats.
There has to be a body. There has to be an investigator. The investigator has to ask logical questions that draw them closer.
There should always be red herrings of one sort or another, or sort of mysteries to distract that aren't the actual mystery. So you're always trying to do these things. It's interesting.
And that book, I think, forgot that I was writing a crime book. After The Fat, I think that's what I worked on about it. Word Is Last Murder, for all the strange places it goes, I don't think that ever forgets that it's a crime book.
It knows what genre it's rooted in, and it's trying to give you those things, even as it goes along, even as it pulls you in strange directions, it always comes back to it. The central thread of that book is a crime book.
Yeah, it's interesting. Maybe you'll disagree with this, but I... No, I sometimes get the feeling from your books, they are meticulous mystery novels in terms of the mystery construction.
But I have sometimes wondered if the murder mystery element is what primarily motivates you. Just in terms of how much your books do fold in, outside of the pure mechanics of the thing and the tropes of crime, they are quite big books in terms of their ideas. But I've read other interviews with you, and I know that you are a legitimately huge mystery head, and that's where a lot of this comes from.
So I don't know if that assessment is completely wider than Mark, or are you driven primarily by the mystery of the thing, or do you see that as a vehicle for something bigger that you're attempting?
I think you can implant a mystery into almost anything else. I think a mystery is a brilliant foundation for almost any story. I think a mystery is fundamentally about uncovering secrets, relationships, details, and I think that's what all novels are concerned with.
I think thematically a mystery novel ties very well to lots of things that I am interested in. So I'm interested in crime, punishment, redemption. I'm interested in the human spirit.
I'm interested in us as people and what drives us to do heinous acts, and whether that can be trained out of us. I'm kind of curious as we as a society where we're going as a group of people. All of that ties into mystery novels.
All of that ties into the idea that somebody dies and somebody killed them, somebody's going to work out why that happened. All of it gets folded in quite neatly. So whenever I sit down to write a novel, you're completely correct.
I am a big mystery head. So I know the ins and outs of a mystery novel on a sort of mechanical level, on a technical level because I pulled them apart. I sat down, I spent weeks doing this.
I sit down with mystery novels and I pulled them apart paragraph by paragraph, chapter by chapter, working out what the tropes are, what's the thing that connects them, what's the thing that makes them successful or not successful, what do people want? And then I'm really interested in placing that into other things. I'm really interested in seeing how far you can push one of these things.
Like, could you set a murder mystery novel at the end of the world? Would that work? Could you have a murder mystery novel with an omniscient narrator who knows everyone's thoughts?
Could you make that work? Could you have a murder mystery novel with a time traveling detective who could just follow the victim through the day to see who killed them? Could you make that work?
So there's always a kind of like, there's always a sort of, I guess almost like scientific element to them what I'm trying to, I'm posing a question to myself as a writer, a challenge to myself as a writer that I'm trying to sort of like find an answer to. And I think that's what happened with the novel that I discarded was that I found a challenge that I couldn't meet. I found a challenge that overwhelmed me and overawed me.
And then I had to step back a little bit from it and do something else. But you're right. I think the drive for me is no longer writing a classic mystery even though I love them and enjoy them and respect them.
I think it's about taking that and building new things around it and seeing what it can support and seeing what that would look like. And I love building worlds. Absolutely adore it.
I love new worlds, new characters. I love situations that really test people, but not situations that we'll necessarily always find ourselves in. So that's for me the actual joy of sitting down on a computer for eight hours a day.
You're right, it doesn't often come from a satisfying murder mystery. It comes from building this world out and making it feel believable and making it feel like somewhere that you want to inhabit. Or you're really in it.
That's the other thing I love to do is create places that the readers genuinely, when they finish reading the book, they sort of have to blink a few times to remember where they are. So I want them to feel like they were in that space with me.
Yeah, well, I've been rereading Evelyn Hardcastle in the run up to chatting to you, and I've just forgotten how enveloping it is. You know, I often find with a lot of other murder mysteries, rereading them, it's kind of an exercise in remembering the amazement or surprise from the first read. I'm like, oh, yes, I remember this.
This was very enjoyable. But that book, I think it just has so much going for it in terms of how it discusses or investigates the sensation of not knowing yourself and being in another body and trying to work out what in you is the real you and what in you is this other thing that you've kind of stepped into. And you've heard this a million times.
It's just such a clever work. And it really holds up.
Oh, thank you so much. I think the thing I'm trying to avoid, and it goes back to the earlier part of this conversation, I think something murder mysteries can fall into and the trap that they often do fall into is that they make people only care about the last five pages. Like the entire...
And Christie did this in her later career. The only thing that ever mattered was the solution to the problem. And you could almost...
People would almost start skim reading the closer they got to the end because you were no longer interested in how he works it out. That stopped being of interest. You just cared about how it was done, who did it.
And hopefully, if the solution was clever enough and the explanation was logical enough, that in itself became the entire book. It wiped everything else away. My big example of this is Murder on the Orient Express.
Murder on the Orient Express is a shit book. Like, it is rubbish. It is.
It's terrible. If you go back and you take away the solution from that book, it is dreadful. It is her cupuaro moving from cabin to cabin, asking people which cabin they were in yesterday.
That's all it is. That's what happens for like 99% of that book. And then you get this incredible solution to the book.
And everything else is wiped away and it's incredible. And the counterpoint to that in her canon for me are The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Then There Were None, which are two books which you want to read again because you want to see if the ending was teased in the writing. And then There Were None, I maintain, is a very prototypical slasher fic.
I think if you look at the structure of something like Friday the 13th, it's almost identical to the structure of Then There Were None. It's a group of characters in an isolated location, all with sins who were picked off by a killer one by one. And the sort of like, you don't know, the point of it is whether they deserve to be saved or not.
It's really interesting, but I think it's a slasher fic. And I think you can go back and enjoy that book, even knowing the solution because the atmosphere is so thick, because it's terrifying and it's tense, and that still holds up on a second read. The solution is not everything that that book is.
And Roger Ackroyd is exactly the same. I think Roger Ackroyd, you would read that two or three times because you want to see if the solution, the book, the solution works knowing when you read the book again. It's got that element to it.
And there's a density to detail in that book, which he very rarely does. There's so many little details and so many little nods to what's really going on in that book. So yeah, I'm always worried about this idea that people might just read my book for the last 20 pages because my books are long, so that would be a terrible way of doing it.
But I want you to care about more than the ending when you read my book. I want you to be invested in these characters, whether you love them or hate them. I want you to be fascinated by the world.
And what you said earlier about mysteries, I'm in a very privileged position that I write standalones and my publisher trusts me enough to let me go absolutely apeshit every book. So I don't really have those limitations. There are a lot of authors though.
So that means everything in my book can be a mystery. That's what you alluded to earlier, like the setting, the world, the characters, the timeframe. From book to book, everything about my books can be a mystery, not just the mystery itself.
And hopefully again, I can write that in such a way that it gives people a reason to go back and read it again for enjoyment, even once they know the solution.
Yeah, and that really, really comes through in Last Murder. I mean, how hard is it to juggle that much mystery? Because I think I said this to you before, maybe I tweeted it, I can't remember, but I really do think Last Murder is one of the most mysterious books I've ever read in that it is a murder mystery, but it's in a community that you don't really understand, in a time and place you don't really understand, you know, who's framing it, who's telling you is a bit of a mystery in itself for a bit.
And the whole book is so systematically, it's sort of peeling back so many strands of like just understanding what it is you actually like dealing with, sort of begin with. That's, you know, you've obviously in your past pulled off this juggling act with Heaven Hardcastle, we had all these parallel timelines, but this is something slightly different, but feels like a similar exercise in terms of complexity. Like, was it?
Oh yeah, god yeah, no, it never killed me. Like it's just like, it's the thing that I am interested in writing. It's kind of, I couldn't write any other way, so it's hard to explain why I do write this way, right?
Like it's like being right handed. I just am. So when I sit down to write, this level of complexity is what I'm drawn to.
Like having multiple mysteries going on at the same time is what interests me in my writing. It's when I sit down. I want to be able to sit down at my computer every day and do something that interests me, whether that's a character, a conflict, a sort of like, as you said, just peeling back a bit of the onion.
I don't like exposition. I hate exposition. And I find if you've only really got one mystery, there's a lot of exposition trying to pad a book out.
You end up making characters run in circles before they can get to the thing. Whereas I've said this before elsewhere, but I don't like red herrings in books. I really dislike them because they feel like a literary con.
They feel like the author stepping in to pad their book out by making you look in the wrong direction. But what I love is multiple mysteries. I like the idea that the investigator, it's not that they're necessarily wasting their time.
They're just investigating the wrong mystery. So I try to give every character a mystery. I try to make everything in the world a mystery.
They're my red herrings. It's that the investigator has to peel back all these other mysteries to get to the one that's actually important to them right there and right there. So I can, through a combination of all those things, hopefully I've sort of just about answered your question.
But honestly, I would write that way even if not thought about it, right? Like it's just what I do. Like when I started writing Seven Deaths, I had no idea how it would come out the way it came out.
It was just what happened.
Given that this stuff is so sort of specific to you and your brain, what do you read for enjoyment? You know, like if you're writing stuff that really speaks to you, there is nothing else quite like this out there. I am kind of curious, like where do you get your, you know, your fix outside of, you know, your own writing process?
So I love literary fiction. I love things that mess with structure.
Right.
I just read The Beasting, which I don't know if you've read that. I have. That is entirely wonderful.
I recommend that. Before that, I've written a book. I had read a book called Spent Light.
Sorry, I'm terrible with names. Author names elude me all the time as well. But Spent Light, I've just finished a proof of All the Colours of Dark, which is the new Chris Whittaker novel.
Which is marvellous. Chris Brookmaier's new novel. I've just finished as well.
Basically, I like anything that plays with the form. I like anything that plays with structure. My all-time favourite novel is The Ghosts of Small Things by Arundhati Roy, which is astonishing.
That is basically every line of that is beautiful and a piece of poetry. It's written out of chronology. It's astonishing.
Everyone should go and read that. I think it's an incredible piece of art. It's really weird.
In my personal life, I don't read a lot of crime. I get sent a lot of crime because of my job. People want me to write things about the book and say nice things about the book.
When I see a quote on a book, I'm always like, oh, okay. Stu's into this. This gets the seal of approval.
I don't blurb that much. I tend to, usually four or five books a year. There's been a few more this year, but I think that's got a lot to do with the standard.
This genre is astonishing at the moment. The amount of talent in it and the sort of stuff they're doing and where they're taking the genre is astounding to me. There seems to be a real appetite for books that aren't procedurals and books that aren't doing the usual things.
I've read a lot of books recently that I've really enjoyed, but that's where I'll go because I want to prod my mind in an entirely different direction. I want to be reading something that's not in my own wheelhouse and see what flame that lights in me. Oh my God, that was such a wanky turn of phrase.
That was the real you finally coming through.
I know, yeah. People can't see me. I've got a smoking jacket and a pipe on.
It's an audio medium. People don't know what's going on. Yeah, it was interesting, actually, you mentioned, you know, you are, you do write standalone novels and each one is sort of a completely fresh concept.
Is there ever any kind of desire to remain in one of these worlds that you've put so much thought into world building? Like there are Easter eggs, I'd say, between some of the books and, you know, I never really know like, are we on the cusp of a Turton cinematic universe style? It's all connected, you know, are you going to like Stephen King it and it's like, it's all part of this mad sort of like metaverse or whatever, you know, I would imagine you're, you know, based on what you've done so far, you are going to keep writing standalones.
Yeah, I am. No, I have no interest in. There are Easter eggs because I loved reading that when I was reading Ian Banks and when I was reading Terry Pratchett.
Like, those novels and just seeing a character who I knew from another novel just sort of drift through the background of the novel I was reading, it always gave me a lovely little like tingle of recognition. I always enjoyed that feeling. So I like the idea that I can give that to my readers now that I've got three books, so I can sort of like do tiny little, and these are not as big as that, like I did very small Easter eggs through them.
But no, that's not meant to suggest anything more than just like, I think you read it from my reading my other books, like here's a little, here's a little nod to that. I like stand-blows because again, it's hard for me to sit down on a computer. It's hard for me to do this job for eight hours.
It's not what my personality wants me to be doing. Like I want to be, as I said, chatting to people in an office or outside doing something, like climbing a mountain, going for a run, whatever it is, like playing with my kids. So for me to sit down on a computer every day, I have to be interested in the thing I'm writing.
I think I have to be really sort of engaged with it. Or again, it has to be Dark Souls or Souls, like it has to be a problem. It has to be a challenge.
It has to be something that's absolutely going to beat me up until I understand how to overcome it. Like I really like that. And that's what gets me to a computer.
And again, that may explain why my books are quite complex because I'm constantly trying to chase that. I'm constantly trying to chase that level of, I guess, challenge and sort of like trying to sort of like work out at what point can I not stack this Jenga tower any higher? At what point could I move all the pieces around to start putting Monopoly pieces into the Jenga tower and still have it be a Jenga tower?
So no, I would never write a series because I would lose if I knew 70% of the book already, if I knew these characters, if I knew this world, I don't know what I'd be doing. I don't know. I'd be just writing stuff that I'd already written before and I'd lose that challenge.
So I would probably stop writing at that point.
I know it's a question everyone hates, but do you have an idea of what's coming next?
I was signed up for two books by my publisher and then they did quite well. So they've signed me up for another two books and at that point I planned out what I wanted to do for those. Now bear in mind, I planned out Last Murder and I threw it away and wrote something entirely different.
So it doesn't mean loads. It's not like one of those wax seals on a scroll or anything. It's more like a tiny doodle in a very light pencil.
But yeah.
Basically we will get a book. There will be a book at some point. That's what you're publishing now, nice.
Yeah, that's precisely what it will be and that it will have a really pretty cover because that's designed by someone else and it will have a map in it because again, that is designed by someone else. But they're the only certainties at the moment. But yeah, I'm planning it now.
I've started writing and this is usually the way it starts is like little scenes will suggest themselves and sort of like little lines will start coming into my head for the characters. So I'll start writing those down. So I'm planning and sort of jotting and that's where I am.
How exciting, how exciting.
Well, I like this bit. It's all possibility. It's beautiful.
Well, I look forward to reading a cryptic blurb of that in about two to three years time hopefully. So we're going to shift and talk a little bit about video games. Hopefully that's okay timewise for you.
No, I'm done. I've promoted my book. Now I'm off.
I've done everything I came to do. This has been lovely. Thank you so much, Matthew Castle.
I see how it is. So we're going to take a quick little break and we will be back in a second.
🎵 . Hello and welcome back to the podcast. In this half, I wanted to talk more about video games because I think it was video games that sort of first put us in touch. I don't know if you remember this, but I tweeted at you.
I read The Death of Everly Hardcastle. I absolutely loved it. I saw you on Twitter, so I sent you a tweet.
And I think you replied, Oh, are you Matthew from NGamer? And I was like, Oh, shit. I thought that was crazy for one.
But it also alerted me to the fact that you are an incredibly voracious gamer. And I think we've probably talked more about games when we met up before than we did about books. And it's a real pleasure to hear your thoughts on these things.
So, yeah, in this half, we chat about some games, some game related questions that I'd sort of extracted from my reading of the books. But to kick off, I was just kind of curious what your formative gaming years were like. You know, what were you playing?
What made you fall in love with the form?
My first computer was a Dragon 64. And you have to be a certain vintage to remember that bastard of a machine. And I swear to God, gamers of your, like with a Dragon 64 and then I had a Spectrum after that, I still don't know in hindsight whether this is true, but to get certain games to work, you had to fiddle with the volume knob.
Like you had to sort of turn it and it would like certain games would respond if the volume knob was turned. I'd love to know whether that was true or not, but like I remember that being a thing and some people were like just turn the volume knob to like seven and the game will come up. So these machines were like, I know it was insane.
That's gotta be like urban legend stuff. That was like, I had a friend who had a Captain Planet game on the Amiga and he told me that a particular level of it was permanently broken because his dad had hammered the space bar when he turned on the Amiga. And he was like, because of this, you can never enter like the third level of Captain Planet.
I was like, that isn't true. You have not rewritten this disc by hammering the space bar.
But there definitely were like video games were, I definitely got the sense and I love to go back. I've never investigated this where you got the sense that the developer had never got past like designing level three, because these were like proto days of video games. And like, I don't, there were no rules about them.
They were sold on cassettes or they came with magazines and they were like, that you would get, there was a game called Treasure Island where like, I always remember you could sort of get to level three and go no further. And you would got, if you would, I can't remember what it was, but there was some pirates and it was almost like Frogger and you had to get between them. And it was incredibly hard to get between them.
But even if you did, you got to the top of the screen and you always died. Like you just died. Even if you got past them.
And it was really, and I remember being a kid then like, because you're a kid and you're all the time in the world and your entire world is made of marshmallows. Like I just did this stupid thing over and over and over and over again and always died. So I don't think there was a level beyond that.
And I don't think it mattered back in the day because your tape cost you three quid and the developer did not think that it mattered. And I loved, I came out of that sort of like, I had a Dragon 64, I had Spectrum. I had a, I went Nintendo rather than Sega.
So I had the NES and then I had a Super Nintendo and then a PT. So I went through that. That was my path.
And I love that, I still adore that sort of like, proto-gloop era video game. Where there weren't genres, there just nothing was codified, nothing was solidified. There wasn't a first person shooter and a strategy game and a sort of like, there was just some dude with a bag load of ideas just making stuff.
And like, so like every game was wild as you want and wacky as you want. And it could be a combination of 20 different things. And from level to level it could change and like, that's what I still look for in video games.
I still look for that level to level surprise. But I think...
What gives you that feeling the most these days? Like what was the last thing that did surprise you like that?
In that same way, it's an excellent question and I couldn't tell you. It'd be something I think weirdly like a monowind, like an Elder Scrolls like game where you go, your quest starts in one place and ends up somewhere entirely wild. So it's almost like a piece of storytelling within a game rather than a level variation.
Because I do think games have become quite codified now. There's loads of interesting stuff in there. I'll tell you what actually, no, I'll tell you what did it.
Paradise Killer. I don't know if you've played that.
Yeah.
I took like a sort of Return of the Obra Dinn, something where you get into the game and you're like, I don't know what this game, Inscription did it as well. Inscription was wild. That kept altering and changing on me.
I really like that. Tons will come to mind in a moment. But there's a lot more than sort of like these indie games where you're like, they don't have that same need to sell a game to X amount.
Well, they do for their living, same as me, but like their ambition is much sort of like wider and sort of like much more like, no, I have a great idea. This is what we're going to do. Let's see where it takes us.
Interesting. You should mention Paradise Killer and Obra Dinn. I have a question about those and I want to ask you a little bit later.
I better know what it is as well. I bet you can guess what it is, but we will get to that. We often talk to games journalists on this podcast, most of the guests we've had on, and we talked to them about the magazines they read growing up.
I'm curious that as an avid consumer of games, and I know that you were familiar with NGamer and Catherine's work on RPS, you're a gamer, did you read games magazines growing up or gaming websites? Were you into that?
Yeah, completely. It was PC Gamer for me. PC Gamer, growing up, because that's when I had my own money.
Basically, when I had my own money to go and buy a magazine, before that I'd have to ask my parents and that was always a pain, but my mom used to work in Asda and she would do cleanup on the aisles. So she'd be able to bring me back the magazines that I hadn't sold back in the day, or the tapes that had fallen off the magazines on the spectrum. So she would bring me those back and I would have a pile of those the next morning.
But when it was my own money, yeah, NGamer came later, but it was PC Gamer when I was suddenly given pocket money and I could go out and buy them. And that was a once a month purchase and you would read it. And again, pre-internet, that was all your gaming information that you were going to get.
So I would get that and I would get Edge and I would just turn through them and I would like, I remember there was never a game in one of those magazines that lived up to how it felt when I read about it. It was impossible because you would get like the write up of, I think it was called Hostile Waters.
Yeah.
Yeah, do you vaguely remember this? And you take control of all the vehicles and you're kind of like, so like you're fighting a war through an acapella go and you sort of like, you take control of the planes and the jeeps and the buggies and they've all got personalities that speak to you. I remember reading the read up of that game in the magazine and nobody's ever been more excited for anything in their entire life.
Like I swear to God, when I finally, and I hope this is not too crude, when I finally had a lady naked in front of me for the first time and knew what was about to happen, I was still not as excited as I was for Hostile Waters. Because like, there was like three months between me reading all this amazing stuff it could do and seeing the pictures in the magazine and being like, my head just filled out this game and I was so excited and I got it. And it was a very good game and I enjoyed it a lot.
But it was defined and it was smaller than my head had made it. And it was obvious. Do you know what I think I hate the most, and I still hate about video games, is when I hit the rule set that powers the video game, when I become aware of the boundaries of it and I bump into it.
That's when I hate video games the most. When I love them the most is when I can forget that that rule set exists. And I genuinely feel that I am in this world with all these possibilities.
Like I adore that. Like Baldur's Gate 3 did that for me just recently. Like I genuinely felt that I could almost go in any direction, do any combination of ridiculous things and it would sort of like allow me to do that.
So those are the magazines. And I think that might have been what got me into journalism as well. It was that, it was that.
It was just reading them and being like the way that made me feel and the magic of the words on the page and what they could do to your brain, I thought was incredible.
That's so funny to me that I like, that's the first reference of Hostile Waters on this podcast, a hundred and something episodes. When you were reaching for like, oh, I read something. I was like, oh, he's probably going to say like the famous Deus Ex review in PC Gamer that everyone remembers.
Where Kieran did all the breakdown of the things. It's like, oh no, no, it's going in a different direction.
Yeah, yeah, it's going to Hostile Waters. Though I do think Kieran Gillan loved Hostile Waters as well. So like, as a vague, because that was my era as well.
Like all that lot on there. But yeah, just because I remember that being the game that really stuck out to me. And Quake, I remember the preview of Quake made that seem like, and again, there was a sort of technological shift coming with that that was like tied into the write up.
And I would love to go back and read that preview now, because I'm sure it was like, probably you'd be talking about almost like photo realistic graphics and stuff. It would have been, oh, so good, mate.
It was so hard. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like, I don't think myself or Samuel would have ended up doing this career if it wasn't for like the excitement those magazines generated and then the kind of promise of being able to like be part of that machinery and get other people excited.
Sorry, I've never asked you, what did you, what were you reading, where did you start your gaming?
Yeah, so, I mean, like, I probably didn't start reading magazines properly until like the N64 era. So, you know, I was just such a Nintendo head growing up. You know, I had N64 and NGC were my two magazines of choice.
You know, I didn't really read the official mags. My brother had PlayStation, so he had official PlayStation magazine and PSM, the unofficial PlayStation magazine. And they were like, they were just great mags.
I'm a big future mags person. I ended up in the future, but I was just a big believer in those things. And Edge, I came to a little bit later.
I always found it a little bit too snooty when I was like a teenager, you know, or like highfalutin, mainly because they were like, you know, they take things that I adored, like, you know, maricot, double dash and take a big old shit on it and be like, well, this isn't for me. But then actually, you know, now actually edge is like very much my bag. And, you know, I also find it quite hard to sort of untangle some of these magazines from people who worked on them who are like, I now know.
And they're just like, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, magazines are like, Oh, a bit of a weird, a bit of a weird, weird thing for me now. But yeah, but I read the odd issues. I picked up PC Gamer when there was a game on the cover I was interested in.
So, you know, probably a lot of the, the big famous, like mega high review score issues were ones that I read.
For me, that was like, because I got that every month, there was obviously, I was really excited that there was a quake on the cover of stuff. But like, I'd usually had enough pocket money or sort of like char money to sort of pick up a game a month when they were about 30 quid or something, you know, 25, 30 quid. And that would be, so it was this big thing.
It was like, there's this bag, there's this treasure bag. And you're like, oh, what am I, like all these possible things I could get, like what am I gonna get? And I was always drawn to that.
I remember Dungeon Keeper, like it was just, oh my God, it blew my mind. Like I read the review for that and it was one that was immediately out. And I went down to WH.
Smith's and immediately, when you could buy in WH. Smith's. And I bought Dungeon Keeper in WH.
Smith's. So even that, like these games that were like structurally a bit weird and were sort of like, like structurally, like hostile lot is the same, bring it up again. But like, it was like, it was a mishmash of ideas trying to pull in different directions.
And I always, I was always drawn to that. Giant Citizen Computer was another one.
Oh yeah. So Giant Citizen Computer, I remember buying that specifically on the promise of, you get to be like the giant thing that eats things. But like, I'm pretty sure that was like the last campaign of three.
So like- They'd obviously worked on the least. Like it was the dullest part of that game by a margin.
It was, but like, I feel like it's what motivated me to play the rest of that game. Cause I was like, I just want to be the big thing that eats stuff. Like, being a god or being a giant monster was just a power fantasy.
Like I really wanted to see something deliver on. It's the same reason I bought black and white back in the day was I just wanted to see a big thing be powerful for me. And yeah, sort of like racing, yeah, with giant citizen computer, you end up like racing through the good bit to get to the less good bit.
I mean, to be honest, though, pal, like if you're really interested in massive things, eating smaller things, working in the video game industry must be wonderful for you.
That's basically all that ever happens. Yeah, it's my, it's literally my dream come true. I just sit there going, man, if 13 year old Matthew could see the devastation these giant things are wrecking, he would be like, just thrilled.
I didn't have to wait for the last level of video game making. Like I could just see it happening right now.
Yeah, that's true. That's true. What was the, can you remember like, what was the worst thing you ever bought gaming wise?
Like when games were like precious to buy.
I can't remember the name of it. It was a first person shooter that was set. You play, I think you played like an angel and you were sort of bombing through these really rubbish levels with really rubbish weapons.
I can't even remember the plot of it, but it was dreadful. It was really, really bad. And all the pictures again, like made it look incredible, but the game itself, I think that maybe the first time when I understood that level design was important and sort of like that, like having interested enemies with any sort of like intelligence was like interesting.
So like, I remember that. And it was the first time I've been like, I really want to, I'm desperate to take this back. I like, I desperate.
I saw, I bought, that's only happened to me twice. One was with the first garbage album, which I bought off my own money. And I was desperate to take that back.
And it was with this game, which I, oh, I'm gonna have to look this up now. This is what I'll be doing for like the rest of our-
Not the thing, not Messiah, where you possess things as the angel.
No, that was brilliant. I love that game. That was, yeah, that wasn't a bunch of game, was it?
No, shiny.
A shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's a little bit- No, I love- Evan Hardcastle, that game.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is actually. No, I couldn't think of it.
Getting into bodies and having their power. I mean, this is like a crude observation I'm gonna make again in a few minutes. So, look forward to that.
No, that was the only one. I think that was the only game I ever regretted. I think it was the only one I ever spent a lot of money on.
Well, for me, like 30 pounds as a sort of like 14 year old or 13 year old was like, why? What's happened here? Like, why is somebody?
I can't, I think it probably fundamentally introduced me to the unfairness of capitalism. You know, I was just like, I can't, this can't be fair. Like, I've worked really hard for this money.
It's good to get it out the way, isn't it?
Yeah, that's it. I've spunked it on this pile of dog shit. Like, why is this?
This is, no one should allow me to do this. Somebody should have stepped in. There should have been an adult.
We're gonna find out what that is, and I will put it in the episode description at some point. Due to your interest in games and how switched on you are about games media and the fact that you worked as a freelance journalist, did you ever have a desire to get into games journalism? I don't know.
Did you ever do that in your freelance career?
No, never. I would love to have gotten into video games journalism. But what actually happened is that I left university, as everybody does, because that's what they like you to do.
And I didn't know what I was for. I'd taken like an English and philosophy degree that left me fit for nothing. And I didn't really, I just didn't have anything ahead of me.
I didn't know I wanted to be a journalist. I didn't know I wanted to be a writer. I didn't know I wanted to be an author.
So I went traveling for five years, is what I ended up doing. It wasn't the intention, but I left home and didn't come back for five years. And I traveled all over the place.
I was in South America, I was in Central America, I was in China, I was in India, I was everywhere. And while I was working, while I was away, I was writing sort of the English, basically I would walk into, if the town had like an English language page of a newspaper, which they frequently did, I would walk in and say, hey, I speak English, could I write this page for you? For like whatever money you're willing to give me.
And I did that for like a few years and I taught English in schools and stuff. And that's how I made my money a little bit. So when I came back and needed a job, that was the only skill I had.
The only skill I had was that, the only thing I could put on my CV was that I left university and then I wrote these articles as shit as they were without any training. That's what I'd done. And obviously nobody would employ me because that's a terrible CV that's five years behind everybody else's CV because they left university and got internships and went and did proper things.
I ended up working. Nobody would employ me for about a year and a half. I was just unemployed.
Couldn't get a job. I was doing like temping and I was doing any job that would pay my way. I was doing, but I had no career or nothing.
And I was eventually, I got hired by a technology magazine in London and they took me on and they trained me and they looked after me and they taught me everything. And they were entirely wonderful. But then that's what happens usually is that then you become a technology journalist.
That's what you are. So if you want to do any freelancing, it should be technology freelancing. That's where you're going to get hired.
And then I left that because I went to Dubai because I got a travel journalist job in Dubai and that's where I met my girlfriend and the rest of it. But it was very sort of like, that was the magazine you were working on. That's the thing you were going to do.
And all along I would have loved to have gone over to video games journalism, but I never had the CV for it. Like I had a CV in technology. So they would have, like Future would have taken, because I was working for Dennis, who was back in the day of Future Rival.
And I would have got, you know, I could have possibly applied for a technology magazine at Future, but nobody would have looked at me for a video games journalism.
They're so adjacent though. It's kind of crazy. Like, you know, you'd think people who are into one are into the other and vice versa.
No, it's, I mean, it all worked out. Like I think-
Yeah, I mean, yeah.
But I mean in the sense that I think if I'd gone into video games journalism, I never would have left. Like I loved being a travel journalist. It was really good fun, but I knew it wasn't what I'd be doing for the rest of my life.
Whereas video games are the thing that I love. Like, you know. So if I'd got into that as work, I don't know whether it would have spoiled.
In the same way almost that like writing books has slightly spoiled my love of writing. I don't know whether working as a video game journalist would have done that for video games. Yeah, it happens.
Yeah, I can imagine it does. How could it not? But also like that's what I would have wanted to have been.
That's what I would have been doing all the time. And I can't imagine me drifting out into anything else.
Right. Where was the swankiest place you went as a travel journalist?
Oh, mate. I worked for, do you know the airline Etty had?
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so I worked for them. I was on their inflate. And it was back in the day when everybody thought that Dubai was just the swishest place on the planet.
Right. So working on that magazine, everybody just thought the people who were getting on these planes were just sheiks paying for everything with diamonds. So everybody wanted to be in that magazine.
So we went, everywhere we went was a five-star hotel. Every meal we ate was a Michelin star meal. At the swankiest, I mean, I've been to, we were in the Maldives.
We did a five-star thing in the Maldives.
Wow.
We went to, you know, we did safaris in South Africa, five-star safaris in South Africa. We did, I mean, everywhere, like Sri Lanka.
And you swapped this for two years of anxious book writing on a cycle.
Because, yeah. And I still, I always say this, like, travel journalism, not just that. I mean, that stuff was lovely, but within that, you got to do genuine travel journalism.
I got to go to China and write about censorship in China, which was, I went into the country, I talked to loads of people, then I got the hell out when people started to notice what I was doing. You know, I wrote like a lot of genuinely great stories that I'm massively proud of on that magazine because there was a little bit of room to do it. But it just, again, everything changes and what started to happen was that the market changed, and this is just magazines all over.
Staff started to be shed after a while, the money started to go out of it. Suddenly, the budgets available for the trips shrank, the places that wanted to shrank, and just like it wasn't the same job after three years. So it was sort of the perfect time to move out of it and go and do something else.
But I absolutely, and also Brighton is, especially I think maybe being an author, it's vocational. It genuinely is. Like not to get, and Brighton isn't anyway, but like being an author, so many people want to be authors.
And if you go to an event, sort of 50 to 60% of the crowd wants to be an author. They want to be sitting where you're sitting. But the truth is like some like 90%, I think you've only like 0.0001% of everybody who submits a book gets it published.
Like less than that make any money out of it. I think the average earnings for an author in the UK is about 7,000 pounds a year or something like that. So not a livable wage.
Most books, they come out with a whimper and they disappear. And that's not the author's fault. It's just because the industry doesn't support all the books it puts out, which is a trap estate.
So if you look at the numbers, being an author is a terrible career decision. It's ridiculous. Nobody should ever want to do it.
And the only reason it works is, again, because it's vocational, because we can't help ourselves. And that's what happened with me in Troubled Journalism. I loved that job, but I was an author.
Like there was some bit of me that wanted to be an author. There was some bit of me that wanted to write a book. And I was never going to be satisfied until that happened for all the stress that it brings me.
Yeah, that's like me with writing captions under screenshots. There's so many other things that I'm like, oh man, it'd be great to write a book, but my true calling is writing 13 to 15 word captions under screenshots, so yeah.
I love that. I think like, do you know what? If you can find the one thing that makes you happy, like imagine how happy the world would be if people went on Twitter because they'd found the one thing that made them happy and it was captions.
Instead of slugging people off on like strangers they've never met, they're like, I'm just off to write a funny caption.
Yeah. So to sort of steer kind of the conversation kind of closer to your current work, lots of people, it isn't just me, have drawn comparisons between your books and video games. I don't know if that's because they know you like video games and you begin kind of like sort of imposing that on these things, but you know, I'm gonna throw some sort of specific questions at you, but before we get to that, I just kind of curious if more broadly, you know, you do think that like gaming has had an influence on your writing?
Oh, completely, yeah. I think, and I know where this question is going and I know the games that are gonna be raised. I think for me, what's interesting about this is there are definitely comparisons with certain games, but what I find fascinating is obviously those games were never in my head or they weren't released when I started writing, but I think the mechanics of video games is the thing that I've drawn from without ever realizing.
I had no, when I was writing Seven Deaths, I had no awareness that I was drawing from video games as a pool of inspiration, no clue whatsoever. I thought I was drawing from movies. I thought I was drawing from books.
I thought I was drawing from, because the list of inspirations I oversight for Seven Deaths when I was publicizing it was like that's an egg of a Christie in a Groundhog Day loop. That's how I described it to everybody with like quantum body swapping if you'd ever seen that show. And then I did an interview with Eurogamer and I wrote and purchased the Pointed Art and he was like, but there's these video game things happening.
And I started thinking about it. I was like, yeah, of course there is. Because I think I am the first generation of author who played as many video games as they read books growing up.
Because I was there with the spectrum. Like I was that guy. Like I was right there at the start of that industry.
I was right there when these things began to get popular and I have carried on all the way through. So naturally, like my inspirations are coming and pulling from that pool. Of course they will.
And I think what I pulled from specifically is the mechanics of things. How do you escalate a story? How do you escalate it in video games versus how do you escalate it in a book or a movie?
Video games have wonderful things like mini bosses. Like they have like these, like the obstacles before you get to the main thing to heighten tension and create a challenge and to have a smaller problem to overcome before you get to the bigger. And I've pulled from that.
And I remember saying to somebody, again, I love a Metroidvania because I love the idea of a labyrinth that you have to explore and you have to grow in power and knowledge to get through the labyrinth, right? And that's what storytelling always is. That is the power fantasy of video games.
It's kind of like in a book, I apply that same power fantasy. It's about accumulating knowledge. And then by accumulating knowledge, you get to overcome the boss at the end.
So I think that's what I've drawn from. But then this eerie thing happens where these games come out, which I think you're about to list, right?
Yeah, well, yeah. I mean, that was definitely a question I had. I had some other things, but yeah.
Let's ask about these specific things. Like sort of like famously now, your games, your books seem to release around games which have similar concepts or settings in like the eeriest way. So in your book, Evan Hardcastle, for people who haven't read it, it's, you know, like Stu says, it's a sort of time loop where the protagonist is moving through the bodies at a country manor, trying to work out who's trying to murder another character in the country manor and having to solve that using all the different bodies that they occupy.
And this came out quite close to The Sexy Brutale, which was a game set in a kind of strange sort of casino country manor with a time loop structure to it and a body hopping kind of character switching, you know, it may have even been eight characters again. I can't remember if that was specifically true. And then your second book, The Devil and Dark Water came out, I can't remember if it was before or after, but around Return of the Obra Dinn, which was a historical maritime murder mystery, which that book is also.
I was gonna raise it as just a, you know, it's a funny coincidence that these things happened. What I was actually gonna ask was whether you felt it had happened again, whether there was anything out there that did remind you of last murder, or if you felt the kind of that coincidental curse was finally broken.
No, I thought that Paradise Killer, when that came out, it was sort of similar to something I was thinking about for last murder. Last murder got changed, so that kind of went away a little bit, but there's a few similarities there. Do the two's really wild?
I have the same thing with titles. Like I inevitably seem to pick titles that then turn off.
I was gonna ask about this too.
Yeah, it's really weird. So I think I'm just like a lightning rod for like the universe. So like Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle came out around the same time as The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.
Devil in That World doesn't have any comparisons, but The Last Murder at the End of the World was beaten to the punch by a TV show that came out called A Murder at the End of the World.
I couldn't believe it. When I saw it, I was like, that isn't like, I'm sort of surprised the powers that be didn't kind of confer on this to make sure that didn't happen.
It's mate, it's completely wild. And it's like, with all these things, you sort of start getting to the point where you start getting a little bit paranoid and you're just like, look, I've got the receipts. I was working on this well before these people sort of turned up with their version of their titles.
But like, I think it's just sometimes there's something in the air. I think there's a cultural thing that happens where people are sort of like, you're inspired by the things that went before, right? So for me, writing Seven Deaths, I was inspired by Groundhog Day.
I was inspired by quantum leap, these shows, these big shows and these big movies and these big event things that have been in the water. And I wouldn't be surprised if the Sex and Brutal developers had that same sort of like, list of interests, like the same list of shows and things that they like. Just the sense of like, when you start to pull together and if you've got a certain type of mind and you enjoy a certain type of thing, it sort of leads you, you know, like parallel evolution almost.
And like Return of the Obra Dinn was almost like a perfect video game adaptation of what Devil in Doubtwater could have, do you know what I mean? Like it was absolutely perfect. Like I adored playing that game from top to bottom.
That was my favorite game for about two years. Because it contained within it everything that I was doing in Devil. Like it had the same sense of eeriness and the same sort of like what the hell is actually, beyond like who died and why, like what the hell has happened on this boat.
Like it was ontological as much as everything else. And it had that same mix of like supernatural otherworldliness with scientific method and rigor. And sorry, deductive rigor.
It was just insane. But it's, I like it. Like I think it's one of those lovely things where I'm like, there's a bunch of creative people out in the world creating interesting things around the same basic totems.
And it's funny to see where that leads people. And I tend to feel about it the same with adaptations of my work. So there's currently like an adaptation ongoing for Seven Deaths into a television show.
And hopefully there will be for Last Murder. And having those conversations is all about what can we change? What, how can we differentiate?
What works for television that didn't work in the book? You know, and it's about seeing how you can take basically the same ingredients and come up with a very slightly different pie. And I think that's very, very fascinating.
Yeah, I love that you were saying about Obra Dinn there, just reminding me that one of the things I really loved about Devil in the Dark Water is the idea of, for people who haven't read the book, it's about a murder mystery on a ship, but a lot of what is key to the characters is knowledge that's locked in other classes on the ship. You know, there's literally like a sort of almost like a subculture that people have to kind of get into in order to work something out. And I got a big dose of that in Obra Dinn as well.
I really love that sort of sense of there is information and secrets only known to a group of people. And you are, I mean, you're a total outsider in Obra Dinn because you're literally like a person in the future looking into the past. But yeah, I thought that was such a fascinating part of the book.
I've, you know, really not something I necessarily saw, like talked about in like the reviews I read and stuff. But I, and again, that thing you said earlier about the, you know, it's a quest for information that is the Metroidvania of it, you know, is, is the, oh, if you could like it literally, it's, there's an act of translation that is required in Darkwater. And you're like, oh, man, if only these people would talk to each other.
Yeah. And it's that I think with every book that I'm writing, and it must be the same in video game creation as well. You start with an idea of, like, what's the one thing in this that is not the same as anything else?
Like, yeah, forget your plot, forget your characters, forget even your big head scratching concept. It's kind of like for me, what is the thing about this novel that's going to make it different for me and for other people be something that not because anybody could write a murder mystery novel on a ship, I think. But I like the idea of doing it as an ontological thing where it was like, is there a devil who exists or not?
Like, we don't know. And like half of the book is about working out whether this is going to be a supernatural mystery or whether it's going to be a straight up Hound of the Baskervilles. Like, which one is it going to be?
And then within that becomes the stuff that is pure me. Like, I am from the northwest of England. I grew up in a working class town.
I'm bothered by class. I am bothered by how classes interact. I am bothered by wealth and inherited wealth and sort of like what we pass on to the children and what opportunities that provides for children.
All of these things bother me and they keep coming up in my books every time I write them. So on Devil, it was about like the lower classes on the ship had access to certain bits of the ship and the upper classes have access and they weren't allowed to meet. And because of that, they couldn't solve this mystery.
And I love that idea that this distance between the classes also completely was about to hobble the entire ship. Read into that what you will. But I did it in Seven Deaths and I've done it again in Last Murder.
Like it's just a thing that will be in everything I write, I think, because it bothers me and it's innate in me.
Yeah, no, that's fascinating. Another thing I wanted to ask about, and this is sort of gaming adjacent. When I saw you talk about Devon and Doug Walter a couple of years ago and you were talking about, and I think I'm not misrepresenting this interview you were doing, but you were talking about not necessarily knowing like who the protagonists were or the idea of like finding the protagonists in the writing.
And that actually made me think, you know, more broadly about how people pick the protagonist in like a video game, say, and like the perspective that you choose and how that changes the whole perspective of the book and of a game and a book and how all this stuff works. Was that just something that happened in Devon and Doug Walter or is that like a process you go through like with all your books? I'm kind of curious about this sort of protagonist sort of discovery in the act of writing.
Yeah, it's a fucking terrible way of writing a book. I just got up front this entire thing like is a dreadful way of doing it, but it is what I do for every book. So I throw away an insane amount of words all the time.
I already told you about the 111 for Last Murder. I threw away 90, I think it was 94 and 97 for Seven Deaths. I threw away 130 for Devil.
Devil's an enormous book.
Yeah.
And it was like, but it was even more enormous. The first draft of it. Seven Deaths was fairly straightforward because I was bothering Agatha Christie's archetypes.
And then my idea with that book was that you should have like, I wanted that to feel very much like an Agatha Christie novel with a spin. Including sort of like, that's why it's an isolated country house. That's why these archetypes exist.
It's why you've got the methods of killing that are in there. They're all borrowed from Agatha Christie. And then I try and subvert them or change them or manipulate them in some way.
So, I knew the characters because I knew her characters. And then all I had to do was add things to them or change things. When I was writing Devil, though, that's my second novel, there's a sort of Sherlock Holmes and Watson, sort of like archetype in that novel called Sammy Pipps, who is the Sherlock Holmes alike and Aaron Hayes is the Watson alike.
And it took me a ridiculous amount of time to work out that the most interesting character there was my Watson alike. And that was the point of view that I should be going after. Like he had a lot of the book and a lot of it was told from his perspective, but you had an awful lot that belonged to the Holmes character.
And then there was this other interesting character in that called Sarah. And again, she was like, primarily in that first draft, she was like chief amongst the suspects. But the more I wrote, and the more I wrote the book that I eventually threw away, or the huge chunk of it that I threw away, the more I realized her viewpoint was the interesting one, her viewpoint.
Every time I was writing from Sammy Pipps' perspective, I was bored, and I was unengaged, and I was lethargic about what I was doing. And every time I was writing Sarah, I was energized again, and I was engaged. And every time she was talking to my Watson-alike, my Aaron Hayes, that was fireworks for me.
I absolutely adored doing that. And I just let those guys, this is going to sound insane, but I just let them chat. I would just write reams of dialogue of them just talking to each other because I enjoyed that so much.
So that's what I was doing. It was kind of just like writing my way into their relationship, writing my way into their dialogue and their sort of short hand with each other and their understanding with each other and how they communicated. And I honestly thought that was, I just had my baby daughter, my first daughter.
So I thought that was happening because my brain was addled through a lack of sleep and having this child and having my life upended. And I was like, once, and then it took me two years. So my daughter was two when I finished.
I was like, well, I'll never do that again. And then I did it on Last Murder as well. So I think it's kind of a, I think it is my process.
I think if I'm unsure, I find certainty by writing certainty. I find, I write through all the possible avenues and all the options and all the characters and all the plot lines and everything that could possibly ever happen. I effectively write it down and then pick from all of that what's interesting to me.
And that's how I came up with Emory for this novel. That's how I found her by just writing and writing and writing. And then every time I drifted back to her and every time I got back to her viewpoint, because there was loads of viewpoints of Last Murder originally.
And she was a small one of them. But every time I went to her, I was like, hang on, this is where I want to be. Like I want to write more of her.
I want to spend more time with her. I don't want to be over there with these guys. They're dead old to me.
This is where I want to be. But again, I don't recommend doing it because it's fucking stupid. It is an asshole and it's a pain.
And you spend a lot of time doing something that you know will help you eventually. But in the intervening time, it's just irritating. Because you know it's not going to be in the book.
But you sort of know you've got to do it.
As someone who does spend so much time thinking about character in depth and spending time with your own fictional creations, do you enjoy very like writerly or character heavy games? Because a lot of what you've mentioned have been a bit more like systems driven or less like a narrative games. I think that so far anyway.
I mean, apart from Baby Borders Gate 3, obviously, which is like characters the game.
Yeah.
Do you enjoy narrative heavy games or do they jar with you on some level?
No, but I will play one. I think a narrative heavy game, a single player, I will play one every two years.
Right.
And I'll enjoy the crap out of it. So I played both of the Plague Tale games.
Oh yeah.
So I played both of those and I really enjoyed those. But effectively they're the same game. Yeah.
They have roughly the same systems and the sort of characters. But I really enjoyed those and I really... But I loved the first one when I played it.
I played that on my Steam Deck and had a really great time. And then when the second one came out, I played it for about three minutes and then dropped it. My mind's got to be in a certain place and I don't quite understand why that is.
Right, right.
I've got to be in a certain point in my life. I've got to have a certain... I don't know.
A lot of things have to be in alignment for me to enjoy a narrative game. So I've just started playing Guardians of the Galaxy.
Oh, yeah.
So I was playing that. And again, I've just bounced off it after about...
Oh, that's a shame.
I know. And again, I can see that it's a very good game and I can see that it's very interesting. But I think because I feel like my options in the scenarios are always relatively limited.
And again...
Yeah, that is true. I think what I found interesting about that was more them wrestling with a license which has been so clearly established by films that you're up against these things which are in the front of everyone's minds. And I thought it was interesting how they took the same source material and were just trying to leave their own mark on it.
I mean, maybe that's a slightly cold and clinical way of looking at it. But I found that interesting as an exercise for sure.
Oh, that's interesting. Because I'm not that orfe with the sort of movie stuff, movie properties. So like, that's not something I've ever been that interested in or sort of ever really...
So for me, I didn't really have any problem divorcing those two things. Like those were kept on my screen and I enjoyed the dialogue and the bands had seemed quite interesting and stuff. But it was more...
When I began to see what the game was, I think after about an hour it's like, so I'll go into this room and these enemies will pop up or this enemy will pop up. And then I will give my teammates one of like three orders that they can be given. And it's usually...
And this makes it sound worse because the game is very fun. It's beautifully made, crafted. But you know what I mean?
Like when you get to that rhythm and again, I think maybe it comes back to the idea that when I can very clearly see the video games boundaries, that tends to turn me off it. Sometimes and maybe this... And again, this is the first time we're thinking about this.
So maybe this is too sort of sci-pop 101, but like maybe it's more when I'm sort of like in my life, I need a bit of guidance and I just want some sort of like barriers on my side. Maybe that's why I get into these things. But again, I was really enjoying it, but it was like there's a linear path that you're going to go down.
There's no branching options. You're just going to go down there and then you'll get to this thing and these enemies will come out and then you'll make these selections. And it'll always be relatively obvious what the selection should be because that enemy will be fast, so it needs to be tangled up or there'll be lots of them.
So you'll need to use a big grenade that kills a lot of enemies. They seemed like fairly obvious choices. Was something like Returnal, which devoured me for a couple of weeks, was like, that was just purely me escalating my skill level to what it was doing and understanding the world, understanding the enemy patterns.
And then it kept changing that up. And I just found that infinitely rewarding, even though it wasn't infinitely rewarding me with more story or more guns or anything. I don't know.
I don't know what else.
Yeah, I am like, I'm quite into this like new generation of sort of genre games, which are traditionally varied mechanics first, like the rogue-like, that are now trying to stir in more narrative stuff into the pot.
Yeah.
Like, I don't, did you play much of Hades?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I loved Hades.
Yeah, like I thought that was such a great marriage of that kind of purity of just playing the thing, but at the same time, seeding these characters who, due to the nature of the loop, you were kind of unpicking over time, and it never became an explicitly narrative game, but over 20, 30 hours or whatever, you suddenly realize you've really bought into this world, which was just a sort of dexterity action challenge, you know, as far as you were concerned. But yeah, I thought that was, that was like, you know, I'm hoping for more of that kind of stuff. And the Returnal has a bit of it too, you know, like her backstory and her story kind of bleeding through it.
No, I like that as well. Sorry, just to pick up your point, because I think it's a really interesting one, because it goes back to, obviously, my day job is all about, is all about narrative, and it's all about sort of like taking you down a linear path and sort of like, again, it's that sort of idea that I'm trying to convince you that you're walking down a corridor, and all the doors are painted on the walls either side of you, but that you feel like you could go through any one of those doors, like that's my entire job sometimes. You're right, it's interesting with Returnal, I was interested in the story of that, and I was interested in when it would piece me a little bit of the story, I loved that, I loved getting those, those little bits, much more than I think I love getting whole heaps of exposition and story all at once, like constantly, and Hades was a great example of that, and that was another game where like your skill level was constantly being pushed, and you constantly, those first few levels maybe you struggled with, suddenly you're breezing through like two hours later.
I really loved that feeling, that sort of like, that your power level is going up because your skill level is going up. I adore that. I get rewarded for story, it's like just a double whammy.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Are you, I have to ask, are you a Hitman fan?
Weird, I missed, and do you know what it is? I always, always wanted to play Hitman. Like I've always wanted to get into it, and I just keep missing it.
Like it just, from the early ones would come on, and I never played the first one. And I always meant to go back to it, and then a new one comes up and pops up and reminds me. And I look at it and I'm like, I think I would love that.
And I just never get around to playing it, because I never have played it. It's a sort of loop now. I really should address that.
I mean, I only ask to me, of all games which have big, like, Evan Hardcastle energy, the idea of a man who is, you know, stuck in a level that repeats itself, everyone there is on a grand routine, who can, not through possession, but through disguises become other people, and gain access to different places based on who he is. If ever you were to make an Evan Hardcastle game, Hitman would be the engine and world for it, I think.
That's interesting. The only thing with Hitman, I guess, is that he can always resort to shooting people.
There is that, yeah.
But Evelyn was always about, and I think maybe all my books do this, I do not like violence, which is a weird thing to say, but I don't like our societal stance on violence. I don't like it in my own life. I recognize that it is out there, don't get me wrong.
So when I am writing my books, violence is always punished, it never works. So if you try to force somebody out of someone through violence, that will never work. So in my Hitman game, the moment you shot somebody, it would be a level over.
And not like in a sense of like, but almost like a GTA way, where you would shoot somebody, like a thousand people with machine guns would come.
Hitman is kind of, I think it does train you to see violence and there's more chaos that comes from violence as having failed. Like the art of Hitman is only the single villain in the level is removed if you play it properly and you play it successfully. And that's what you aspire to is a world where everyone is untouched apart from your target.
And I also think there's like a, there's a dark justice to Agent 47, which is, I think probably would speak to some of the elements in your books in terms of, like you said earlier, an interest in like justice and retribution. I think that's in there. You should definitely get the Hitman trilogy.
The new Hitman trilogy is about as good as it gets, I think.
Alright, I might do that next then. I might that after I finish Lies with P and throw my computer through a window of frustration, I will start on Hitman.
I was also going to ask, are you into time loop games? Because obviously you've written like, what I think is the time loop book. Do you play things like, I guess Sexy Brutale was one example.
Did you play The Outer Wilds?
No, I tried playing The Outer Wilds. And I, what happened to me and The Outer Wilds? I got, I didn't get stuck, but I did that, you know the bit, the tutorial that just teaches you how to fly the ship?
Like when you first, like you go around the corner and there's like a little launch pad that teaches you how to fly the ship. And I did that for about seven minutes and then I found it.
Nah.
Nah, I don't think so.
Oh, there's, I think there's two kinds of people, or there's two kinds of experiences people have with Outer Wilds. And one of the experiences is it's your favourite game of all time. And the other experience is you didn't really like the ship flying.
Like there is no middle ground. It's either I wasn't in with the core mechanics or it's I saw it through to the end and it was like a profound experience for me.
This is the thing. When that turned up and everyone was talking about it and I was aware of the discourse, I was like, that sounds like my absolutely perfect game. You go and find the narrative out of all day and you go and find bits of the story and your two experiences never really be the same and you start pissing it together yourself.
And you're right. But the method of me getting to that story just pissed me off immediately. So like it wasn't...
Whereas again, we go about something like Obra Dinn where it was like, this is your device, use it this way. And once I understood the mechanics of that, it was a really fluid way for me to get into that world. I never had any trouble digging through the story.
Whereas Out of the Wilds immediately, I just can't quite get a hold of how I'm supposed to navigate this. And that would just frustrate me every minute that I'm doing it. So I'm not going to do it.
It reminded me of something else that did that to me recently where the actual method of exploration completely undid the game. It'll come back to me. It will come back to me.
Interesting. You're very well played for a person who has a lot of writing work to do. I'm always impressed by this.
Lots of planes, mate, usually. I used to play games. That was my hobby.
I would do it. Every minute I wasn't writing, I'd be playing video games. And then when I have kids, that sort of went by the wayside, but I would carve time out for myself to do it.
With one, I would carve out time on the weekends to do it in the evening. And then you have two, and it gets enough. I've got two daughters.
My youngest daughter is eight months old, nine months old. So that time is very fleeting. But what I've got now that I never used to have is just a lot more travel time.
I do a lot of publicity in different parts of the world. There's a lot of planes. There's a lot of airport lounges.
There's a lot of hotels. So things like Steam Deck, Laptop, and my Switch go with me in every bag. And I just plow through things that I'm in.
And it's really nice, actually, almost, because it means that you get things in a hit. You get sort of like... Again, almost like the Hostile Waters thing from earlier.
I get to really look forward to something and then sort of commit a lot of time to it. So I was going to the US the other week for a thing. And I ended up, of all things, playing the Batman Arkham Asylum, the first one, again, which I completed back in the day and really enjoyed.
I was just like, I just fancy playing that. So I downloaded it on my Steam Deck and I got onto that plane and just played that game for seven hours, solid. And it was delightful.
It was the most fun I've had in a very long time.
Brilliant momentum, that game, just constantly. Something new every 20 minutes. Great treatment of those characters.
And good narrative as well, what we're talking about. Sort of like good doling out of life. Daft as it gets and as ridiculous as it is, there's always something big and high-energy happening that just drives through.
And again, that was a perfect time for a narrative game. We come back to it. It had just enough freedom for me to sort of like pick my own route through things.
But then there was these big narrative blobs being doled out.
That's cool. I wanted to sort of like wrap up a little bit with, I had this very broad question. I don't really know if it makes a huge amount of sense.
I may have even mentioned this to you before when I finished reading the book. Like without getting into it, I actually thought The Last Murder was going to kind of be about video games at several points in the story. Like I thought that might be the thing.
I think that's because it's a book with like, it's like very clear rules. Like it's like a society governed by rules and you're learning the rules of this world and what it means for like what people are able to do and how they're able to act and what that potentially means for this murder that's happened. And that made it feel like really game adjacent to me.
I mean, even like, you know, tell me if you think this is, this is spoiling anything and I'll cut it out. But there's like a fog that sort of surrounds the island. And I spent a large part of the book going, oh, is this the fog of war?
Like I really thought, I thought the book was an, I thought the twist or whatever was going to be that it was somehow an RTS game. Because of the nature of the society and like, that there are figures of power and then there are almost sort of a society of helpers. I was like, is this like actually The Settler?
Or is this like The Sims? I was really kind of convinced by that.
Do you think you would have thought that if you hadn't known me?
That's, well, that's, that's I think what I was going to kind of get to. I do worry that I, because I know that you are into games. I kind of come at it going, oh, this is going to be about games, clearly.
But, you know, I think as we've, you know, discovered chatting today, like you've just, you know, you're interested in so much more. And I love that your crazy passion for games and how kind of rich your knowledge is, is replicated in your love for mystery fiction and bigger ideas. And I hope it's not too sort of fawning of me to say, you know, you've got a very, very like rich, exciting mind and it makes rich, exciting books.
So that's very kind of you. I mean, to go back to your earlier point before I explode from like an ego overload, I think the thing about rules in my books is all my books are really big on the rules. Like they always, it's because what I tend to do and I learned it very early, is I tend to give myself a broad palette to draw across.
So like my books always cross genres. So like Seven Deaths had a big helping of sort of like fantasy sci-fi, whatever you want to turn that in with the body swapping and with the sort of like repeated day. And then Devil was a haunted book, but it was a piece of historical fiction at the same time.
So it almost had to obey the rules of historical fiction while doing the most fantastical thing, which is an occult supernatural book. So you've got these broad canvases. And the problem when you do that is that you can almost go in any direction at any point, right?
You can lean very heavily into one thing or the other. You can flip-flop chapter to chapter. You could do like a huge bit of haunted fiction one chapter, and then it could be a detective novel the next chapter, and then you can be a romance novel the next.
That is not very satisfying. And I learned that very early doors, that what you have to do is create an even tone that brings all those influences into every single chapter. Every single chapter is all of them all the time, rather than suddenly feel like a different book per chapter.
And the best way to do that, I have discovered, is rules. Lay down your rules very early doors for the reader. So you tell the reader, look, this is an elevated situation.
These are strange things are going to happen, and we're going to go in these directions. But these are the rules to obey. These are the rules the character obeys.
These are the rules that you're going to obey. These are the rules that I, the author, am obeying. And it puts us all on the same platform.
It makes the world easier to swallow for the reader. And my books are always about, again, an accumulation of knowledge. They're always about you don't understand what's happening, but you will if you trust me to get you there, right?
But in the meantime, this is the box we're going to play in. So like, this is as far as we'll go and no further. Don't worry about it.
So it's a little bit more of that. It's not even necessarily sort of in the way a video game puts down rules that I'm sure I drew from that inspiration as I drew it from it for a lot of other things. It's more about giving you something to hang on to while I give you this very crazy world with a lot of stuff happening where you don't understand half of it to start off with.
And then what I always try to do is make sure that those rules are crucial to the escalating tension of the world, but also the resolution of the mystery. So they're always tied into the plot as it goes. Yeah, so it's a sort of interesting sort of mechanical answer as much as a sort of like...
No, I think that's absolutely fascinating stuff. And yeah, it's... I've got to stop imposing these game readings on your books, Stu.
No, don't make us... Again, they are there. And like, as we said earlier in the chat, it makes complete sense because I grew up on video games and I think I do pull from video games.
I pull inspirations. I pull mechanics. I pull tension from video games quite a lot.
So it's never quite as broad as like, that thing was in a video game and I loved it and I took it away in the same way that it's very rarely. I liked that thing in a book and I took it away. It's usually like, oh, I like that atmosphere.
I like that way of like making something dangerous. I like that sort of like way of... That sort of vagueness.
But yeah, The Fog of War is probably completely true. I probably just... I needed something to circle the island.
I probably just like ripped off The Fog of War.
What I'm really taking away from all this is that book four is going to be a murder mystery with heavy elements of hostile waters. That's... Is that right?
Is that the headline here?
The book I've always wanted to write. Just, I know it's not even going to be a murder mystery. It's going to be a straight up novelization of hostile waters.
Straight up novelization of hostile waters.
I'm just going to go back and rip off all the dialogue. Yeah, it'll be great. It'll be absolutely fantastic.
Absolutely amazing. Well, Stu, I am going to wrap it up there because you have been so generous with your time. Almost two hours of waiting away to me.
Thank you so much for coming on and answering all these questions. I hope I haven't asked you things which you've been asked a billion times before.
No, not at all, pal. Like, it's been really, really lovely. Honestly, I've had a really, really great time because it's not often...
I always get asked about books, and there is a big overlap between books and video games. Yeah. But I do love talking about video games, and I very rarely get to do it.
So, like, this is a genuine pleasure for me.
Oh, well, it's been great, and I'm sure everyone will have loved hearing your thoughts. For people who maybe haven't read your books or want to pick up your books, they are all available. They are all out there.
The Last Murder at the End of the World is your latest and greatest. Is it just enough for someone to buy the book? Do you, like, recommend they get it from a particular place?
Is it better if they buy it from a particular place? What's the deal with book buying?
It sounds like a Jerry Seinfeld sketch. Jerry Seinfeld sketch, doesn't it? Have you ever noticed books are filled with paper?
Yes. So, it's better in terms of, like, the amount of money that comes through to me. It's better for people to buy a hardback of paper from the local independent bookshop.
Then a sort of, like, chain of Waterstones or a bunch of other things in the US. Or a bookshop.org. Or something like an Amazon.
Distantly down the line. Or an e-book. But, I say within that, to be honest, life's expensive, man.
The world is so fucking expensive right now. So, do whatever's best for your wallet. If you buy one of my books, if you get it out of the library, I am delighted that you took the time to read it.
I genuinely am. Drop me a review somewhere. It will always help me if you enjoyed it.
But, if you're reading it, I can't ask you for anything more.
Amazing stuff. And, do you like people to follow you on social media? You're quite a keen social media person.
I use Twitter. I sort of vaguely use Instagram. I try.
I've got to be upfront about what my Twitter is. My Twitter is usually me talking about trying to get you to buy my book or trying to get you to come to one of my events or like I'm not the sort of tweeter who just like tweets observations about my daily life. But usually, I hopefully I do those things in a funny way that is kind of entertaining.
So like I am trying to reward you by booking you about my book with hopefully something that's relatively amusing.
Where can people get you on Twitter then?
I'm at Stu Turton, Stu underscore Turton, Stu Tur... I don't know. It's one of those.
It'll be fine if you want me. I'm on there somewhere.
Underscores are quite a controversial subject on this podcast due to my conflicting social media. I will wrap up by saying people can follow me on social media. I am at MrBazzill underscore Pesto on Twitter and on Blue Sky.
I am at MrBazzill Pesto, no underscore.
That is controversial. If I'm Stu underscore Turton or at Stu full Turton, it's because somebody got to my name first and they were, it turns out, a gay porn star in the 80s, which is excellent. So somebody with a miles more interesting story than mine has my name and had my social media handle.
But that person is not going to sell you books in an amusing way.
Yeah, exactly. But they will be our guest on next week's episode, so I look forward to that. Stu, thank you so much for talking to us.
Good luck with the rest of the book's international launch. And maybe we will tempt you back at some point in the future once Samuel's around and we can talk more video games. This has been a delight.
I've loved every minute, Mal. I'd love to come back. This is so much fun.
Thank you so much.
Fantastic. Right, well, I'm going to say bye for now. So bye from me and goodbye from Stu.
