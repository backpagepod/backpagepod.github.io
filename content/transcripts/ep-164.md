Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, have you seen Jonathan Glazer's The Zone of Interest yet? Is that on your watch list?
Oh my god, what an opening.
Sorry, that's what I'm gonna go do after this, and I've got just like a moral conundrum kicking around my head of, is this a Tango Blast film? Which is, you know, like something I asked.
Oh no.
No, it's not, is it? Like Oppenheimer was like borderline, but this I feel is like definitely off the cards.
No, I've not seen it, but I just, everything I know about that film suggests this is a Tango Free Zone. That's often the dilemma at our house cinemas because you're rarely seeing a film which should be accompanied by mint straws or Maltesers, but you do it anyway. You do you, that's what I say.
Well, yeah, I mean, this, I'm always like sensitive to the situation, but I have been pushing it lately. I saw All of Us Strangers, which is a very sad film with like the largest popcorn that Picture House would provide me. So took that in with me.
The time I pushed it and I thought, is this a good fit was Titane eating popcorn during that and having a little cheeky rhubarb beverage. Didn't really quite seem to look the right fit. Yeah, so that's for me to weigh up, but yeah.
I remember eating minstrels during Ang Lee's Lust Caution, which is like got so many sex scenes in that, there's inevitably a bit where someone looks at you and you're scoffing while people are boinking on screen and it just looks weird. The optics on that are weird.
Yeah, like the passion that those characters have on screen for each other, you have for your minstrels. So I think that people need to be sensitive to that, you know, and sympathetic, but yeah.
I like to try and eat sweets at the loudest parts of the film. To disguise my clicking jaw, my jaw clicks when I eat minstrels. And so in Lust Caution, it's two people going at it quite loudly.
Yeah, biting down too hard and then a tooth just shattering in the middle of the cinema, just with the most unholy sound you can possibly imagine. So yes, okay, good. Fun little preamble there.
We have Jeremy Peel back of the podcast. Jeremy, how's it going?
Oh, good, thanks. Yeah. I also saw Oliver Strangers the other day with half a hot dog and a large Pepsi Max.
Why half a hot dog?
Because I have a wife and I shared it with her. And yeah, but yeah, it's a weird, again, you can't like, there's like one club scene in that film where you could feasibly coiff a tango and not feel weird, but it's a very narrow window.
Yeah, for sure. There's like, yeah, otherwise there's a lot of sad, quiet scenes in like sort of near empty buildings and near empty London essentially. So yeah, somehow I made it work.
I don't think Andrew Scott even eats in that film. I think he eyes up like, you know, yesterday's takeaway at one point and decides against it and never eats again.
Yeah, it's part of the, what people speculate is going on in that film, but I won't spoil it for the listeners who have not seen it.
I was gonna say, I think someone should make a website which tells you like the time codes of when it's acceptable to eat in a film. A bit like people who are like, you can take a wee break here or this is where you can kind of insert your own interval or whatever. That would be handy.
Maybe have a dropdown menu of these things are acceptable. So for zone of interest, you click on it and then it's like Tango Blast, no, Dark Coffee, yes, you know.
My understanding is that sometimes they have tried to warn against bringing food into films. Like Schindler's List, I think they banned taking food into cinemas. I think they did that in respect for that film.
But since they've left it to us now to decide, it just means every single one is a moral quandary. And Oppenheimer really was borderline, but I just thought, you know what, I'm gonna chance it. Even if I just do it when the bomb goes off, I'm just like fucking right go.
And it's like horde mode kind of like with a big bucket of popcorn.
That's definitely the chomping minute in that film.
I'm imagining Samuel throwing a mushroom kind of popcorn up in the air and just opening his mouth, just trying to catch as much as he can as it comes back down during that moment.
Yeah, it's roughly the same. The sad truth is though, I'm just such a greedy bastard. I can mostly get through the popcorn in the adverts.
I mean, you got a good 20 minute window there. Like I can chow down no problem in that time. So yes, it's a pleasure to have you back, Jeremy.
Are you enjoying your continued status as a sort of meme subject of The Back Page? Our listeners have definitely been toying with you lately. How are you feeling about that whole thing?
Yeah, it's good. I was saying to Matthew on Twitter that it's, I like that Back Page Discord users have only got like a side on photo of me to work with. So they can flip it left and right, but there's no kind of like front on angles, which is difficult when you mock me up into movie posters.
So I appreciate like the extra effort that's made there. Also, they're so quick and reactive to episodes that it's like, the first I'll hear of it will be, oh, here's us three and Catherine in a poster for Ryan Reynolds' Green Lantern. There's a Chinese Lantern in the corner and it takes me a couple of days to discover the context.
Inevitably, it's not full justification for what's happened.
I think that was made before Matthew had even talked about that Lantern on the podcast, which was, I've got to say Matthew, a scintillating two-minute intro to last week's episode. Listening to the batch that was like, wow, this may be the best two minutes we've ever put in this podcast. But yes.
Matthew, how do you feel about the way that the listeners are like, I think you in particular, they see you as a subject of fun for memes. How do you feel about that whole thing?
I think there are quite a lot of photos of me out there for various reasons. Like I'm easy to put into things and I've got a nice big head. So it's quite a good head for sticking over the top of other heads.
You don't have to wrestle too much with dimensions. So I get it. It's absolutely fine.
I'm not precious about it. As long as they don't stick me on anything inappropriate, that's fine by me.
Sounds like a dare to me, but I feel like it was a backfire.
The thing is, if I ever see one where I'm less keen on it, the second The Back Page podcast Twitter account retweets it, it's like, oh, well, this is obviously acceptable now. I may as well not make a fuss.
Oh, no. Should we go through some kind of meme approval process?
No, I'm only joking.
That's fine. What makes me laugh is every time I see that still of you from the middle, Gist on a documentary, I laugh every time I see that image, knowing where it's from and its history and your IMDB page. There's a lot of law within the law when it comes to you, Matthew.
Jeremy, we've got you on for a couple of reasons. This episode is all about how you write a video game magazine feature or a video game feature in general. Obviously, Jeremy, you work across printing online as a freelancer, and me and Matthew have done a bit of both as well, so we can speak to that.
But fundamentally as well, you've launched a new project, and I thought it'd be a great opportunity for you to come on and talk a bit about that. Tell us about The Peel Perspective.
Yeah, thank you. I appreciate having you give me a little space to chat about it. So it's a Patreon project and it's for my writing, basically.
And if you're familiar with the kind of things I write, you know vaguely what to expect. The immersive sims and RPGs and Driver and Xbox 360, Curios and PC gaming classics and all that stuff. But the idea is that it's kind of a place for myself, you know, as a freelancer for several years now.
All of my stuff is kind of thrown in every direction to different outlets. You know, for somebody who theoretically does like my work, it's kind of hard to like know where to go to find it all. So the idea is I'll write sort of bespoke stuff for the Patreon and also I'll be writing a newsletter that collates, you know, all the other things that I've written that month elsewhere and talk about the process of making those happen.
It feels kind of wild to have my own tiny little business, I suppose. Never had like my own venture before. So yeah, it's been it's been cool so far.
That's cool. Increasingly, I think where media is going is that it's just less dependence on Google, which, you know, makes the same mind up about how to treat your content and has obviously bent the entire sort of like approach to editorial around around how it functions. And then, yeah, where that ends is currently a subject of a lot of discussion.
And it feels like the sort of the old magazine model of you build a little silo and then people find you and support you. You have a smaller audience rather than the biggest possible audience, but you make it sustainable to create stuff within that ecosystem. Our podcast is a little bit like that.
But do you think that's where things are going?
Yeah, definitely. I mean, even through the length of my career, the kind of like deep dive features that are my speciality. When I've worked on sites, they've always felt like a bit of an indulgence.
Like I've always had editors who really wanted them and who really appreciated them. But the way the sort of Google model for an advertising model for sites works means that it's never the stuff that can keep the lights on. It's quite heartening, really.
Like it feels like there are increasing numbers of people who want to seek out this stuff and fund it themselves, you know, as The Back Page Patreon is testament to and, you know, magazines like A Profound Waste of Time. And there's a certain point where I was writing an article which was funded by a Kickstarter for a magazine. And at the same time, I was doing the PC Gaming Classics podcast for you guys, which were funded by a Patreon, and I realized, okay, like, we can legitimately make these things happen ourselves now.
And then it only took me about 12 months to actually get around to doing it myself. But here we are.
Oh, that's fine. When our Patreon, I think we talked about it for about a year plus, Matthew, before we launched it, it was a long, long process, wasn't it?
Oh, yeah, we put it off and put it off. Because it's always, it's a risk, isn't it? You kind of put yourself out there a little bit, like just deciding the price of your Patreon, you have to put a price tag on yourself and I wouldn't, wouldn't wish it on anyone.
Yeah, it's a, it's a weird feeling and like on the morning I launched The Peel Perspective, I was just reading and rereading the feature that I was launching with like, oh, this is a bad one. This is the first bad feature I've written in two years and obviously it wasn't. It was just like, there's a lot of pressure on you as, you know, selling yourself as an individual, it's different to, you know, being a part of a magazine where you're just part of the proposition.
But, you know, feedback's been really nice and I'm less panicked about it now.
Yeah, I think you're sort of, I think you're off to a good start. I mean, that's the thing as well. It's just like the podcast for us, it will never, I don't think it'll ever be enough to live on by itself, but it's definitely sustainable and it's a thing that we own and it's a thing that we'll continue to own no matter what might happen with jobs or careers, that kind of stuff.
It's always a thing that we will have. So that's how I try and see it. It's a long-term investment in yourself basically.
So yeah.
Cut to a year's time where we're stuck in a really messy Hall and Oates style battle for control of the podcast.
Yeah, I mean, we can't rule that out basically. Yeah, I get the rights to like back and you get the rights to page and then we form separate podcasts.
So I don't want games court.
Yeah, I get that in the divorce. That's like the child no one wants basically. You get the draft episodes.
Okay, good. So Jeremy, what kind of games do you think you'll end up covering on The Peel Perspective?
Because I want it to be sustainable, it has to be the kind of stuff that I naturally lean towards, right, so it's, you know, I tend to write quite a lot about immersive sims like Thief and Deus Ex and stuff like that. I tend to like revisiting, you know, if there's a new game from a studio, my natural inclination is to go, oh, what did they make previously? And to go and find that game and to work out how things have grown from that point to another.
You know, for instance, I'm playing The New Prince of Persia at the moment and I feel like the, you know, that's from the Rayman studio and I feel like that link is a little underexplored in most of the writing around it so far. So I kind of want to like dig into that and how Ubisoft Montpelier got from there to here. And you know, I have all sorts of like obsessions as well with games like Driver and, you know, stuff that kind of happened in the in the noughties.
So it's going to be a mishmash of stuff, but like it's very particularly my taste and my natural inclination to look back rather than kind of constantly looking forward in the hype cycle, I guess.
Yeah, that makes sense. I'm looking forward to Driver San Francisco Month from the Peel perspective. That should be a good content takeover.
Yeah, okay, great. Well, where can people find it, Jeremy? And check it out.
So, it's patreon.com forward slash The Peel Perspective. I so nearly said The Back Page then, if it wouldn't have worked. Yeah, and if you find me on Twitter, jeremy underscore peel, then I will directly do it there as well.
Nice. We'll tweet it out as well. And Matthew has signed up for it and I had a PayPal error, which is why I've not signed up for it.
That sounds like a terrible excuse, doesn't it? But I promise it's, but I think it just, there's like a whole thing where when you're a creator it tries to, you have a dummy sort of like consumer account and that I don't think actually like works properly. So I have to back you from the Back Page account.
I'll try again today, but yes, those are my terrible excuses.
It's a very specific excuse and as we know, all lies tend to be unusually specific. I really appreciate it. And Matthew, the third person, you're right in there, my third subscriber.
So that felt like a lovely vote of confidence.
No worries.
Lovely stuff. And yeah, I look forward to seeing how it develops. That felt very brief, Jeremy.
You can keep bringing it up if you want to. Matthew, are you going to say something?
I was going to say how everyone knows how benevolent and kind I am now.
All a lie, all a facade. So yes, so before we get into the subject of this week's episode, Jeremy, what did you play last year that you liked? Anything you felt was unloved on the end of year list?
I asked this because I think you do have that more, slightly more PC gaming leaning sort of like taste. And so, or at least, you know, historically those kinds of genres really appeal to you. So what ended up appealing to you last year?
Did you feel there's anything that was missing a little bit from the discourse?
It's weird because there were so many great games last year that there were games that were acclaimed, but then just didn't, couldn't or didn't factor into the end of year discussions because there was so much. I feel like System Shock did kind of end up being one of those games, which was a hugely important one for me. I think I think it did get some nods towards the end of the year, but understandably, like, you know, Baldur's Gate and Zelda and all these other things ended up dominating discussion.
But it's such a unique object, that game, because it genuinely is. For those who don't know, like it's a remake. It's beautiful.
In fact, the most beautiful game I've played in quite a while, like it has a sort of shimmering quality to it, which seemed to like, at times I was playing it, it was so beautiful, I could kind of feel like tingles in my shoulders. It was almost like an ASMR kind of like beauty to it. Extraordinary kind of like turquoises and neons and oh, it's incredible.
And yet, like the level design comes straight from that 1994 game. Like it is legitimately recreated in the way it was, which, you know, could have backfired terribly. Because, you know, there's so much stuff from that era which has not aged.
But it turns out to be one of those fantastic sort of like dungeon maze designs, which still really satisfying and you don't get many of those today. So yeah, it really stood out to me in my memory. And I think understandably it didn't really sort of get as much attention as it should have done by the end of the year.
Yeah, I think that's right. And I was hoping you'd bring that up when I asked this question. It's what Night Dive is up to must be pretty exciting to you, right?
That seems like it's your sort of Jeremy Peel quadrant staying there.
Yeah, definitely. It's like the me and Phil Van Joek Venn diagram. It's really like they just sort of remake the things that we loved.
And yeah, I'm really excited to see what that team does within Night Dive, right? Because they've got the teams who remaster stuff, but they now have these fantastic and now seasoned people who have made almost a brand new game. And I can't really predict what they'll do next.
Who knows whether they could do a brand new immersive sim by themselves if they wanted to. They could do a 4K Turok. Who knows what the hell they're going to do?
So that's quite an exciting corner of games development.
Yeah, I think there's only 40 people at the studio all together. And it kind of, I guess that sort of tracks in the sense that, well, they probably, I assume they had some kind of outside help with it. But, you know, it tracks in the sense that it was in development for such a long time.
Like it was 2015. That's when they basically started and then had the Kickstarter campaign. So long, long cycle there.
I'm pleased it worked out so well. But I do agree. Yeah, it did get washed away a little bit in the discussion last year.
And probably didn't help that it was just it only launched on PC last year. Maybe when it comes to consoles, there might be a good chance to reappraise it this year. So, yes, and it's certainly one that me and Matthew both missed.
So, yeah, that's cool.
I kind of sad now we didn't get a... I'm picturing a Games Master style review where in the little graphics box, it's got like graphics nine out of ten. And then it got me shoulders are tingling.
Classic Turner phrase there. Yes. Anything else, Jeremy, that you wanted to highlight from last year?
Oh, there was a great little game called Vemba, which I think did get some attention as well. Yeah. And it is the sort of game that ordinarily might pass me by.
I got it for my wife and I know she's interested in kind of like Indian food and cooking. And it is, you know, part of the fundamentals of that game is that you are making these delicious meals and kind of like taking in the crackle of onions and sizzle of these delicious foods. But it's also this really effectively told immigrant story in Canada, I think.
Yeah, and it's only maybe two or three hours long, right?
Yeah, I've got to say, I only laughed then, not because of the game by any means, but because Matthew's experience with the game was turning it on. Did you say you just couldn't be bothered, Matthew, you turned it off? That was one of our very tired end of year episodes last year.
I just missed a couple of... You can fluff up the mini games surprisingly easily in that game, I found. And I couldn't bake some kind of, I don't know, sort of dumpling type thing.
There was some kind of steaming device that I couldn't quite get my head around and thought, nah.
I know the one. I would say, like, I think sort of baked into the idea that, like, this is somebody rediscovering the parents' or grandparents' recipes and not really knowing how to pull them off and sort of experimenting. Like, I think you are supposed to fail to a degree.
But yeah, I can understand in the sort of, like, the overwhelm of talking about end-of-year stuff last year. There was just so much you couldn't really... I can understand that, like, failing at making biryani wasn't really on the cards for you.
Is there anything you're particularly excited about this year, Jeremy, or anything you've already been playing from this year that just got you buzzing? You've been playing Prince of Persia, right?
Yeah, I really love that. It's interesting for me because I'm not a big Metroidvania guy. I don't think I've played any Metroidvanias before.
And I knew kind of how they work and it functions in the way I expected. But, yeah, it's really cool to see some of that, like, emphasis on momentum and what Ubisoft Montpelier calls musicality to, like, the movement, kind of translate over from the stuff they've done before to this game. And just to see them get a win as well, because that studio has been working on Beyond Good and Evil 2 for an unholy amount of time.
And obviously there's, like, goodwill around that project has somewhat evaporated and it doesn't seem like it's been fun to work on. So, you know, it's really good to play a great game from them that they've been able to finish and get out there.
Yeah, absolutely. I think as well, I actually will be curious to know if it... Do you think it will lead you to any other Metroidvania type games?
Does it kind of create any appetite for you to go find those games where you get those, build up that power set, revisit places, unlock secrets, that kind of thing?
Yeah, probably. I've heard people mention Ori quite a lot as a sort of a natural next step from this one.
Metroid Dread is the one that I... That was my journey into it basically was I played a bit of Super Metroid and a bit of Metroid Zero Mission and then basically Metroid Dread was my first sort of like shotgun blast of that genre. And I would say that if you love that slide in Prince of Persia, it's got the same slide.
Maybe Ori's got the same slide too, I don't know, but...
Ori's very acrobatic, but it's a bit more sort of floaty. It's not really about like weight and heft that game. Bad combat, amazing platforming.
Interesting, whereas Prince of Persia, I think, has got great combat. But it's interesting, I don't think I've ever played a Ubisoft game that's this tricky, and I mean that as a compliment. Sometimes parrying is too risky, and you are better off using the other ways in which your character can navigate a sort of combat arena, like sliding beneath them, jumping over them, that sort of thing.
Parrying carries great risk, and that feels like there's a little bit of from software energy carrying over to that decision. But I find that really interesting, because the parry window is so tiny, so tight, but they must have thought really carefully about how tight that window is for the normal difficulty setting. I don't know if you had a take on that, Jeremy, how they've calibrated the difficulty of that game.
Yeah, for sure. It feels right to me, the difficulty, but it definitely is... It's a game where I go to the...
There's a fella near camp, I think you mentioned, on one of the pods who teaches you moves, basically, like advanced stuff, and you can feel how high the skill ceiling is, because I would take a couple of lessons from him and be like, OK, I need to just absorb them now, I can't have another eight lessons because they won't go in. And then actually going out in the world and having fights, I feel like I'm just kind of flying by the seat of my pants and hoping that I will, you know, some muscle memory or just a little breathing room at some point will allow me to implement the stuff I've been taught by this guy. Like, it feels like there's a lot going on, a lot you can learn and master, but it doesn't feel terrible to just kind of thrash around and figure it out during that phase either, which must be a very tricky balance to get right.
Yeah, I agree, there's so much depth to that combat that you do and you get from those tutorials. And what I've found, it's a very slow process of me rolling out the lessons that I've absorbed from that guy into the combat. So I'm like, okay, when I am in the air, I can do this.
And I know if I just take a beat while I'm doing a combo, it will have a little bit more heft to it, that kind of stuff. And it takes, genuinely, it takes hours for you to build the confidence to start trying that stuff and for it to actually absorb it properly. So yeah, I agree, some really interesting choices made there.
It's a good match for the length and like the, you know, the sprawling nature of the game. Because you, so you've got the sort of metroidvania structure of like, oh, you're unlocking more abilities as you go. So those will keep you entertained, but also you are personally unlocking new levels of skill, ideally, you know, so you kind of, you've got both of those things improving in tandem, which feels feels real good.
Absolutely. You're playing on Switch as well?
Yeah, it feels like a natural home for it, right?
Oh, yeah. It feels like a magic trick, how nicely they've got it running on there. It's just so slick, like just 60 frames.
And yeah, it's a slightly soft visuals, I guess. But I think it's just beautiful, a wonderful game. And yeah, really a real delight.
So nice to have an entry of the top 10 this early in the year, Matthew. That's good just to get that ticked off. Yeah, absolutely.
Now you just have to play nine other games.
Got my fingers crossed for Norco 2 this year. So yes, Jeremy, is there anything else this year that you're excited about?
Oh, I've got you one. I interviewed Jeff Vogel recently, who's been knocking away making Ultima style RPGs for 30 years, I think. And I played some of his new one, which is the Geneforge 2 remake or remaster.
That's really good. That feels like a sort of early fallout riff, like very open-ended, very atmospheric, and like a sort of good place for people to hop off Baldur's Gate 3. Like for people who don't necessarily need sort of AAA production values, that guy's got all this, you know, so much of the stuff that Larian does going on as well, because he's been working with the same influences for the same length of time.
So, yeah, I think that's how in March.
Yeah, interesting. Yeah, that was not my radar at all. So, okay.
Well, thanks, Jeremy, for telling us about The Peel Perspective. Do you want to remind people again where they can find that?
Yep. That's on patreon.com forward slash The Peel Perspective. And I've already noticed a number of back page listener names on there, and that's hugely appreciated.
Thank you for the support. There has to be some upside to being, you know, a sort of like comedy character, comedy side character in the meme sphere, so I'm pleased that's kind of worked out for everyone. Okay, we'll take a quick break and we'll come back with the subject of this week's episode, how to write a feature about video games.
Welcome back to the podcast. So in this part of the episode, we're gonna talk about how to write a feature about video games, something I've not done now for about three years, but will pretend I still know how to do. Jeremy does it all the time.
Matthew did it a whole bunch too, but Matthew, do you write many features these days?
The Shootakumi piece last year was a pretty chunky one.
Yeah.
I did an edge cover feature the year before. I do one feature a year.
Yeah, yeah.
It's just enough time to forget how to write them and then write a bad one and then feel bad about it.
Oh, that's funny. For context, actually, I don't know if you feel comfortable sharing this, Matthew, but you've been writing a review for the last few days and it has driven you to Alan Wake II style mania, basically. The process seems to have taken its toll.
How do you find the process of writing these days?
Horrible. I write a lot in my day job, but it's a very different kind of writing. Been writing more for video since I left magazines, but I try to do, quote unquote, proper writing every once in a while.
But it's definitely a muscle you need to keep using. And without that, I can feel myself struggling. Just so dead on the page.
You know, it takes me many, many passes to get it back to what I would say is like usual or good standard. Right. And it's not like it's not like dispressurable to actually be like writing and thinking about games.
I like that. That's that's fun. And I've always enjoyed that.
But it does it does make me realise how sort of flabby my writing has got, which always makes me feel sad.
Right, right.
I will say as a as a reader of your stuff, Matthew, that doesn't you can't see that pain on the page.
Like it's still thanks, Jerry, that's very kind, but that's but that's because I go through this horrible process with every piece of writing and Sam knows this because he's always like, why do you do it? Why have you taken a bit of work? You always say this, you always say you had a horrible time and I always do have a horrible time.
This is such a marital dynamic going on there.
So yeah, sadly, he's like, you don't need to do it. We've got the podcast. The podcast is successful and you're like, it isn't a money thing at all.
I just feel like I need to prove I can still do it.
Yeah. I do feel grateful that it's something I've done most days for like over a decade because, you know, all the strangers has a depiction of writer's block at the beginning. And I'm very lucky that like I look at what writer's block depictions are, I don't really recognize that.
And I think it's because, you know, I've had to sit down and get something out like every day for so long and that so much of that, you know, that helps you so much, basically. It becomes infinitely harder, as you say, when you've not done it for a little while.
Yeah, I think as well that the thing is, the weird thing is, I think when it's an area of writing that I'm comfortable with, I don't, I'm a bit like you, Jeremy, I don't really have any trouble getting things onto the page. I'm actually, the trouble is, I might kind of be bothered enough to edit it through to the point where I think it's good enough to submit. That's the, that's the real struggle for me.
The first draft part, I can pretty much get there, no problem, and very, very quickly. But yeah.
Yeah. So, but, but I have found that when I have to experiment with other types of writing, so at the end of last year, I built, I built an application for a narrative designer job within Frontier where I worked because I thought, oh, I've seen all these ex-games journos, like move into games writing seemingly quite easily and have never quite had the same opportunity. And I thought, well, I'm already here at the company, so I'll try and build something here.
Put together this application, I spent two weeks on like some very, very like some short stories basically that were kind of my writing samples and I polished them and polished them and polished them and they took the job down the day I went to submit it and withdrew the role. So it was like not worth it. But in going through that process, I realized, oh no, I do still have this.
It's just that when it's the type of writing I'm confident in, like writing about games, I actually don't struggle with it at all because I'm just so used to it. I think that is it really. I think the rinse and repeat factor is the key factor there.
If you've done it many, many times and you don't spook yourself out of doing it necessarily, unless you're Matthew, of course. But yes.
I like the idea that Frontier HR team are like, oh yeah, we took it down because we heard we had some real cringing coming from you.
Yeah, well, that's the thing, though, it does feel like, yeah, just it feels like bearing all in a way. It's just so...
It's tough.
It is tough. Yeah. It's like would I let a peer read one of those bits of writing, but not the other one, which makes me think it probably wasn't good enough.
So yeah, anyway, enough about that. So this feature, so what are features? Maybe you've listened to this episode and you don't exactly know what the term means.
If you do, obviously don't consider that patronizing, but it's a kind of an umbrella term really for a bunch of different stuff you'll find in a magazine or on a website. So an op-ed where someone writes, I think this game is a piece of shit, that is fundamentally a feature that you're reading there. But more traditional types of magazine features are like cover features.
So the big feature on the big game that goes along with the cover, there's features about specific subjects. Maybe like it's a technological advancement and they've got a few different speakers talking about it. You've got list features as well, which are obviously very self-explanatory.
Making of type features, maybe you see those about older games, that sort of thing. There are many different types of them. And there's a varying amount of lead times that they require to bring together.
And a lot of the planning of a feature section, for me at least, was around what can arrive when? What can you get in on day one? And then what can you get in on like day 28 when the magazine should have gone to press but hasn't somehow still?
So I wanted to dig into that whole process from basically from sort of conception to completion basically. But I suppose to start with, and Matthew I'll ask you this first and Jeremy I'll ask you, but what makes a great feature fundamentally?
I worry some of this is going to sound really basic bitch when you say it out loud, but crucially, maybe compared to other writing you might find in a magazine or a website, I'd say at its heart is a story, like it has to have some narrative structure and it probably or it should try and take the reader on some kind of journey, you know, it isn't just a case of here's a load of information, you know, it's trying to kind of shape it into something more.
Yeah, I think the journey thing Matthew touched on there is really important that it's, you know, it's asking for more of your time as a reader than a shorter thing would. It's got to develop in some way, have a starting point and ideally as a reader you should come out of it thinking, oh, I never thought about that before and I've learned something and I feel, you know, nourished for that or oh, this expressed something that I have always felt about X game and now I can put words to it, you know, that sort of feeling, I guess is the like platonic ideal of a feature.
Nourished is a good word, I think it's, you know, the other bits of piece in your magazine, maybe your reviews will provide that, your previews might a little bit, but the features are really where you want to nourish the reader. That's where, you know, they want to feel like the value of what you're selling them, them paying the six quid or whatever it might be to get the magazine is, it comes in that form basically. So, yes.
Yeah.
And it should feel like the centerpiece or the, you know, the features should feel like the centerpiece of a magazine, like it's worth pointing out, like, I would say this because of the features guide, but it feels like features are the showcase for a magazine, they're like the place where you get to show people who you really are. But then I imagine also news reporters also feel like, you know, they're doing the most important work. It's sort of ideal, I suppose, that, you know, you feel your specialism is the real deal and what it's all about.
But that's how I do feel.
It's interesting that you say that. And one of the reasons I came to features a little bit later than some of my peers is that on NGamer, it had cover features and it had a cover feature slot. That was often, though, just like a lead preview or a lead review.
And anyone who read that mag will remember it was quite scattershot. It had a section called World of Nintendo, which was basically five mini features that were each a spread. So there wasn't much space in NGamer to ever do.
You never really got like six or eight pages just to sort of, you know, to craft something bigger. You know, we maybe did that ten times the whole time I was on that magazine, as opposed to like Edge, which has an established feature section, or PC Gamer, which had, you know, features in the middle, but also in its back section, long form writing, which would tick that box of feature writing. So I kind of, you know, I kind of NGamer raised me in almost like this sort of insane like box out culture, where everything was like micro and very snacky.
And, you know, I think it was trying to capture the energy more of like a, you know, like a Japanese games magazine, you're meant to look at the spreads and go, fuck, look at all this chaos here, which maybe wasn't the best grounding in traditional feature work. That's my defensive. That's me being very defensive about my feature writing.
That's funny. Sometimes when I ask you these questions, you automatically put up some sort of like barriers Matthew, when you're talking about it, like the way you do it, which is funny. Funny you're so self conscious about this stuff after all this time.
It does make sense though that NGamer, the personality of that mag was very much in the small stuff and all the little gags and whatnot. It does vary between different magazines and PC Gamer, traditionally I say it's like the voice leads in the features and also the captions. And then with Edge, it's very much like features are where we are sort of feeling.
It's worth pointing out as well that as well as being the sort of like the sort of centerpiece of the magazines in terms of how they're written and the content that's being presented, it's also how they're designed. A lot of the magazine is templated by design because usually it's only one person, especially these days, it's normally one editor making the whole thing. Back in the day, it might have been two or three, maybe four on some bigger glossier magazines.
But now it's like one person generally speaking. So your preview section and your review section and maybe your back section and new section, they all have existing templates. They're still working designing them and making them look good, but the features are completely original.
So how the imagery is used, that sort of thing. That's where you're meant to be wowed on a visual level as well. You're flicking through the magazine and those pages are meant to be the pages that jump out to you and get you to stop and go, oh, what's this?
And then take a look. They are a centerpiece in all senses of the word, I think. So that's important as well.
It's interesting. The tone thing is interesting as well, actually, because the thing I was going to ask next was what makes a less successful feature. And for me, it was always when I sort of like, I got something back from a writer and the tone of it was so dry and un-PC gamer that it would have to go through just so much editing to get to the point where it felt like something that we might plausibly write on team.
And I think that obviously that is just kind of part and parcel of like actually making a magazine, but I think sometimes when that process was just so exhaustive, I would talk myself out of the idea it was ever a good feature to begin with. Or sometimes we did features in PC Gamer, I thought, was that quite right for this magazine? So I remember we did a feature on Steam machines back when that was a thing, like in 2014, and it was just so dry and technical.
And it was, I ran it because we had like quotes from Valve and you know, anyone knows that speaking to Valve is very, very unusual. So anytime you get to have them on the record about anything, it seems worth talking about. But I, when I finished like sending out, you know, perfectly well written and everything like that, but I just thought, oh, was this quite right?
So the sometimes I think the times in which the feature becomes unstuck is when, yeah, when either it's totally maybe doesn't quite land where you want it to, or the subject is just slightly wrong for your audience.
Yeah, I'd agree with that. I'd say the other major risk is that the central, either the central idea, if it's a more writer driven piece, or the access, if it is a, I'd say more content driven piece, I think I can make a distinction there in my head in terms of like, if something's coming from, you know, I am a writer putting together this idea for you, or there is this thing that we want to cover and so we're going to go and see it. If the content of either is too thin to sort of support the piece, that's always really obvious.
You know, there needs to be a certain substantial idea at the heart of it, or it's never going to work. You know, I know this from doing cover features where we've had bad access, you feel yourself stretching the, you know, the handful of facts you have, you're like, I know I could do this in a 300 word preview better, there's no reason for this to be two and a half thousand words. But on the other side, sometimes someone can come to you with like a sort of passion project or something they're really into, and they can sell you on it on their personal enthusiasm for the topic.
But when it actually comes to the writing, you realise that they maybe haven't thought too deeply about it, or that their actual take is a little bare bones, and they're just restating it again and again. Like we had a big retrospective slot in Nintendo Gamer, yeah, and it was a big piece of writing, it's like two and a half thousand words. It wasn't specifically a making of, though we did encourage dev access to give it a bit more prestige, I guess.
But we'd sometimes get them back where it felt like someone's childhood memory, which you could probably summarise in a hundred words, written out to two and a half thousand, and it was just fucking death. Like there's a really notorious piece of writing in Nintendo Gamer, again, which I won't name, but you could probably guess it. If you read back through them, I'd say one stands out as being truly rank, which we got on the first day and, no kidding, I think both myself and Charlotte were rewriting it and taking swings at it all through the month because it just fucking blew.
It was so boring. It was our mistake for commissioning it in the first place, but that's the big risk with features I think, is not every topic is deserving of several thousand words.
I agree with that as well. But that's a big risk when it's that high a word count as well, isn't it? If it goes wrong, it goes really wrong.
The access thing is interesting as well because that would shape so many things. All of the worst cover features we did on PC Gamer were when we had access that was just an email Q&A and it was really PR-ish answers with very little insight together. I would always write those features because I felt guilty giving it to my team to do it because I just knew that the access made it such hard work to just pull six pages out of it.
Yeah, that's interesting. That can shape a feature to make it less successful as well.
On the design side as well with that, when you get like three screenshots, that's rough and you can see a designer go, I got nothing to work with here and I've got to fill. It can't just be a page of words and you're like, well, that's kind of what we got.
Yeah, that happens many times over. Jeremy, do you want to jump in here?
Yeah, I wrote a feature for PC Gamer Mag, which was about Death Stranding's PC version and there were some Kojima quotes for it that had been sent over, but they weren't good and they were very short and I think it kind of left them in a weird bind where it's like, we have quotes from Kojima, like we can't not use them. But I think it was Robin who came to me and was like, can you figure out a way to make this meaningful and in that instance it was like, okay, I need to find a focus for this that doesn't rely on the quotes delivering the meat and I used it as an excuse to dig into Death Stranding as an argument that Death Stranding was closely related to PC simulation genre and SnowRunner and Truck Simulator and stuff like that and in the end I felt happy like, okay, I've said something here and it was worth the reader's time. Also they got some Kojima quotes and you're just trying to avoid like that strain of, you know, it being visible on the page that you just don't have the access that you would have liked.
I can't remember what celebratory issue it was, if it was like 150, 100, 200, I don't know, however many issues there were of O&M. Our philosophy behind the issue was that we were, it was going to be full of like dream features. Like every writer was going to do the passion thing that they wanted to do.
So I did a big Shootakumi interview and we did the Sing, kind of what happened to Sing, Hotel Dusk, sort of shut down story. I'm pretty sure it was Joe Scrabbles who wanted to do a wonderful 101 thing because that was big at the time and we sent all the questions to Platinum. We got back these eight one line answers from Kamiya and we were like, well, this really cannot be stretched into anything.
They were so disinterested. And so there was just a box out in the directory of like, oh, and by the way, here's some stuff Kamiya said about wonderful 101 and we just printed it there. Like as disinterested in the answers as he was in answering them, which I thought was the right way to go.
Did he just send over some links to his tweets, Matthew, basically, just like...
But they were less interesting and thought out than his tweets. It was like, I hope you like the wonderful 101 and things like that. And you were like, great.
The funny thing about not getting the Kojima quotes you needed, Jeremy, is that he's always banging on Twitter about the minutiae of his games, particularly his modern games. So I'm surprised he wouldn't want to give quite, you know, sort of verbose answers. Maybe just he treats interviews very differently, but I don't know, that's kind of a surprise.
But yeah, I wondered whether it's in, you know, they considered it like, oh, it's a hardware story, you know, it's a port story, whereas the PC game, it was the first opportunity to write about Death Stranding. I don't imagine that Kojima Productions really saw it that way or appreciated that, understandably.
Yeah, didn't they go to the Game of the Year, didn't they, Death Stranding?
Oh yeah, I was in the discussions for that Game of the Year at PC Gamer. It's the only one.
That makes it sound like you were going to be Game of the Year.
Yeah, I was a contender for that, that Kojima went out. Yeah, I remember being in the end of year discussions for whatever year that was, and it felt quite controversial and it felt quite... although I was rooting for it as well.
I know Rich Stanton's a big Kojima head obviously, and obviously saw the greatness in Death Stranding and I think it's very deserving, but I think there were certain team members of PC Gamer who felt a bit like, what have we done? We've turned some kind of irrevocable corner here where we've made the king of PlayStation, the number one PC Gamer of this year, so yeah, it was a fun one.
Maybe I'm being, obviously I don't know the personal tastes of everyone on PC Gamer, but whenever I see something which I know is a big, rich game doing well on PC Gamer, I automatically assume that he's kind of steamrolled in there somehow, so like Death Stranding. Street Fighter, wasn't that really high up there, the greatest PC games of all time?
Yeah, they've got Molly as well on that team as a big fan.
Right, that's the thing, I don't want to attribute it all to Rich, but whenever I see that I'm like, man, he did a number on them.
Yeah, I've never heard someone say Rich was a shy advocate for the stuff he likes.
Right.
Yeah, it's a funny thing is that, I mean, while I wouldn't have liked to have looked in that comment section, I think in some ways that did demonstrate that, I guess a slightly off topic here, that what PC gaming is, the nature of it and how it has evolved over time and the fact it was such a big success on PC. So, you know, it was quite a big story, I think. It was, you know, one of the first PlayStation games that made that journey, but it obviously resonated in that, you know, I think what you put in your feature, Jeremy, is part of that.
It just, you know, the DNA of what PC gaming, part of PC gaming might be is present in that game and therefore it's adjacent to things that those players might find interesting or important, so yeah, I think that kind of makes sense. But yeah, like I say, I'm just glad I didn't have to read the comments or look on Twitter. That's good.
That makes, yeah, preserving my mental health by not thinking about that. Okay, so Jeremy, because you are a long-time freelancer, I know obviously you've worked on staff at PC Games and TechRadar, so you know, you've done the editor side of things as well, but as a freelancer, how do you pitch a feature to an editor? How do you get them interested or excited about an idea?
Yeah, for the longest time I couldn't, like, when I was a student, like, I was doing my magazine journalism degree, I just couldn't get anyone to tell me what a pitch physically looked like. I was like, yeah, but what do you, what do you put in the email? I just, which I just, like, I remember asking, like, a really seasoned editor of magazines and he just didn't really understand what I was asking for, which was basically like, I needed to know, you write a headline, you write a few sentences beneath that headline in the email, ideally, the first one will probably lay out the basic idea and then the following ones will give you a sense that there's somewhere for the story to develop, that that journey is actually going to happen when the feature is written.
So like, on a very basic level, a pitch is like some sentences that you send to an editor and hope that they see the value in it, you know, that's particularly like, it's trickiest when you're an unknown and you're really relying on getting across the sense that you have somewhere to go with the story and that it's like, it's going to hold people's attention just through, you know, a very small pitch, because if your pitch is too long as well, then that's going to, that's going to lose people and that's not useful to editors either.
It's interesting. I got actually got when I was an editor, I got so few genuinely good pictures or suitable pictures and I guess partly because a lot of my freelancers were kind of knew that I would knock on their door if I had something that was particularly relevant to them. The things that were going to create it out of nowhere, like I just I can't ever really remember a time that I saw like a two how I if I was to pitch the times I did pitch for urban features internally when I was at different publications, it would be like right.
I know that they've got probably a short attention span. They don't have much time to read this stuff or they have to do something else. So it's going to all be in like the top two lines.
Basically, it's going to be this about this game or this set of games and this is what we're going to say in the feature. And then here's the access. I'll try and get that sort of thing as a freelancer as well.
It helps to lean into niches because most editors in their teams will have like the main bases covered on whatever the focus is, that's PC or whatever. And yes, it's a weird spot as a freelancer where it doesn't make as much sense to really keep up with all the mainstream stuff as it does to really kind of dig into something they won't be thinking about because that means you can then bring them a pitch that they won't have thought of and is then a valuable addition. So yes, it's a weird spot to be in a freelancer.
Yeah, I think as well that it's sort of in those kind of specific pitches, you get to see how much the writer can demonstrate their understanding of what they're pitching for. So sometimes you get writers pitching to write specific parts of a magazine. I imagine that I would guess that this is just pure guesswork that Chris Schilling and Alex on Edge, the thing they get the most is probably pictures for Time Extend.
Because I'm not saying it's easy to write, but it's easier to write than going out and getting some access, right? You are fundamentally just playing a game again and finding some fresh thoughts on it. Now I think that feature is very meticulously curated and well done every month.
But I imagine, that would be my guess Jeremy, that's probably correct that they get a lot of pictures for Time Extend.
I'm pretty sure that's true, yeah. They tend to have a number of those in the bag in advance because it's not a hardship to find a good writer who wants to write about an old game and those are easier pictures than a completely original idea that will carry you through 2,000 words.
Like you say, it's not timely either, so you can just bank them and then you can give it to a designer on day one and say, please design this and that's again, part of the consideration of how the features you commission for a magazine are, when can you actually get them in? Because a cover feature, that could go up into the last minute while they're chasing down assets or interviews for you, but yeah, something more retrospective can go a bit earlier. The pictures that always switched me off as an editor were things that were just pure op-eds.
I just always wanted a little bit of meat on the bones in terms of, here's some comment from someone that feeds into this or something that supports this idea, or at least an intent to go out and get that stuff and maybe they'll end up getting one out of the four interviews they tried to get for the piece to support it, but even so, it just gives it a little bit more meat on the bones. That's what I would look for when I was editing Mags. What are some examples of features we found incredibly successful over the years?
Matthew, I'll start with you.
Obviously, I'm going to say the things I have written about Shoe-Tacumi over the years have felt very satisfying to me. Whether they were of necessarily huge worth to a broader audience, they're pure vanity projects and things that I was personally interested in. But in terms of actually having great access and that access genuinely moving forward, kind of what we knew about a game, that felt to me like a bit of a sort of a gold standard of what a feature can achieve.
Like uncovering something actually new is always a great feeling. It's mostly on the interviewee to offer that stuff up, but I think asking the right questions and having the right angle of approach is a really important part of good feature writing. I didn't actually write this one, but one that I really, really loved and remembered from NGamer, one of the few kind of non-cover feature features we did do was Quinton Smith did a really good bit breaking down the Simple DS series, which was like a range of ultra-budget DS games.
They were all numbered, there were loads of them, and it was about culture and philosophy behind them. I don't think it actually had any developer access. It was just, hey, here's this weird sort of subculture of DS game that exists.
I guess not dissimilar to what he's been doing with Chris Bratt in terms of digging into like weird and wonderful gaming activities happening as part of People Make Games, but sort of felt like a little proto version of that of just a, oh, I'd never knew about this thing, and look how wide-ranging interesting that is. I always thought that was quite an enviable piece. I was proud of a few cover features that I did.
I think this harks back to what makes a successful feature, so much of it being on access, but not in terms of just you want more information on the game than anyone else, but having more of a story to tell in terms of going to a studio and meeting people and taking a physical journey to a place can show you things or give you inns to a story or give you colour to a story, which actually does help inform the telling of the information which people are predominantly there for. They want to know about Tomb Raider, but the fact that you went to Crystal Dynamics and you saw their weird office set up and the weird challenges they faced kind of.
Gave me this idea of these people putting this character through hell as an adventurer. But then they had this quite weirdly inhospitable office because of these great big windows. They were bathed in sunlight and everyone worked under these huge parasols above their desks.
And I remember coming in, seeing all these people hiding under parasols, working on this thing which is about facing the raw elements and that just instantly gave it like, oh here's a bit of a framing device here which makes this seem, I don't know, much more interesting than it would be. Just me telling you what I saw in a Tomb Raider demo which could have happened anywhere. Or when I went over and met the Dragon Quest team.
I could have had those answers in an email for sure from that interview. But seeing how Yuji Horii carries himself in a room and how other people act around him, this legendary figure, you know, person behind one of Japan's most important gaming series. Next to him is the composer, you know, this very ageing guy, one of his peers.
And then you have the young producer who, you know, truth be told probably made most of the game happen and the kind of dynamic between them was quite kind of revealing in terms of how important Yuji Horii is as a figure and where he fits into the development process. And that gives you just, oh, here's the colour. This is a bit of like human interest stuff.
And those to me always felt, you know, I didn't get to do many of those things, sadly. But, you know, whenever I did have the opportunity to go somewhere and see something, it's as dumb as it may sound. But from the second I was on the flight out, I was in metaphor mode or I once, you know, anything that happens out of the, you know, is there something here that happens to me that I can sort of work into this just to, just to make it seem a bit more, you know, engaging and original.
They always turned out quite well because of that.
Yeah, 100%. I agree into like on actually physically getting to go somewhere, which, you know, I'm very grateful that we have Zoom and whatever that allows us to reach people that we would never reach otherwise. But when you get those opportunities to go and like drink in a place and, you know, just feel the vibe in a room during a conversation and see the facial expressions and how people work, like that's all potential material for a feature.
And I went to visit Danbusters in Nottingham last year, this year, not that long ago. And they, that's the studio that was originally the TimeSpotter studio. And then it was a Crytek studio, famously went unpaid for some months and is now Danbusters and has put out Dead Island 2, which is like a well-received, really good game.
And you know, there's a story of a studio that has weathered numerous cataclysms. And in that studio, they had big models of LA-styled zombies, you know, to kind of, you know, Dead Island 2 sort of thing. But they weren't even from Danbusters' version of that game, because Dead Island 2 has been through a number of renditions.
So those models were from like an E3, one or two versions of Dead Island 2 ago, like that a different developer had been making. And it just felt like, I think, me and you, Matthew, think in the same way of like, you're looking for those metaphors. And that was one of those moments where I was like, you know, this tells the story of this developer, which is still here, despite all these, you know, terrible shutdowns and cancellations that have happened over the years.
They're like, they kind of pulled stuff together and made something good of it.
The other one that always sticks out to me, basically, when they revealed Borders Gate 3, they revealed it to a small handful of UK journalists. And we went to Sven's house, like, you know, his actual house, and he showed us the trailer in his living room. And then we had a barbecue with him and his family and then played some D&D in their back garden.
It was so sort of personal and small going on, you know, knowing what Borders Gate 3 would go on to be. Like I didn't really know how to kind of like tack it. I felt like it almost was invasive in some way to kind of talk about it.
You know, I don't want to talk about this guy's house, that seemed weird, or like the fact that his, you know, wife gave us some sausages. But at the same time, like the whole day I was like, this is so rich with writing potential for like talking about this game. Ultimately, I think what I decided was, Borders Gate 3 was such a big announcement.
I just didn't really want to get in the way of it too much in the piece. I just wanted to, I wanted to put the interview first and the actual information. I didn't think RPS wanted him, me kind of bollocking on about drinking, you know, a Belgian beer in an ice back garden while looking at, he had a bit, they had a big dog that for some reason was like penned in.
I think it had been naughty, like done something naughty. And the whole time I was looking at this big, massive dog thinking I'm really glad it's not out here being like naughty around me, because I don't think I'd like that. But these are, these are, yeah.
So I just had to like eat all that information in that case. So you do have to judge these things.
And now we know that dog was a shape-shifter druid.
Yes.
Yeah, it's, it's funny, it's always, I think I took it for granted when I did get to go to a studio and, and, you know, walk around a little bit, because obviously you are, there are normally restrictions on where you can go unless you're visiting a, you know, a really sort of indie outfit, like, you know, Hello Games when they made No Man's Sky was basically next to like a sort of very small mom and pop sort of car repair garage operation. So it felt like basically like a renovated house when you went into the studio and things like that do make great color, especially when the game was, you know, pitched as this sort of like giant killer future of games kind of thing. However, it turned out, you know, we sort of know where it went from there.
But yeah, it's that stuff. I don't think I really understood how valuable that was. And then when the pandemic happened and now I feel like studio visits are a bit less common.
I think that stuff probably has more value than ever because it really is a way that you can distinguish a piece, isn't it, from a typical preview because so many previews in the last few years have been done digitally that, yeah, I think getting to see a studio in this sort of trying to embed that experiential element is, if I was still in journalism is something I would totally do. But yeah, okay, so in terms of features for me, so my all time favorite magazine feature in a games magazine is Edge's 200th issue, the making of PlayStation feature they did, which I think got quite a lot of attention at the time. They did 200 covers for that issue, I think, as well.
So that was like a big operation. I may have even mentioned this feature before, but it was just that they spoke to basically Phil Harrison and a few other relevant people about how PlayStation was created in the 90s, and they even featured sort of logos, unseen prototype logos and prototypes to hardware, things that had never been seen outside Sony before. And so genuinely amazing.
There's a big, there's a photo of about, I would say like, I don't know, a hundred different controllers that have been 3D printed basically just next to each other as they tried to figure out what it was. And you can see the progression of how they got to the, you know, whatever the PlayStation pad was called before it was called the DualShock, the PlayStation controller, I guess. Just an amazing journey.
And yeah, some of the some of the access is really good. There's like a story that that has always stuck with me. I guess I read this 15 years ago, it's stuck in my head all this time.
But Phil Harrison talking about how Ridge Racer was clearly the standout game amongst the Japanese launch games to PlayStation. And it seems so unlikely that the PlayStation was going to be a success at launch because they just didn't have those killer titles. Then he mentions he was at the studio after being demonstrated Ridge Racer Phil Harrison.
He goes, it was almost an afterthought. One of the men demonstrating it asked, since I was there, would I like them to show me another game they're working on? I went, yeah, sure.
I said, what's it called? And they said, it's called Tekken. And so that's like history being told that I just that's a piece of his gaming history that, as far as I know, is not anywhere else except for in this one magazine feature.
I love that as a this is like genuinely, you know, a seismic shift occurring in games moment captured in sort of print form. This is exactly what, you know, magazine features are meant to do, I think. So that kind of stuff that stands out to me, there are so many over the years, but that's one that really just like in my head is that the platonic ideal of access things you've never seen before stories being told about something in the past is still relevant to the present.
It kind of has everything really. Jeremy, what about you? What are some features that you love or like?
I think from a couple of years ago, which was like a remote interview situation that worked out well, I pitched to PC Gamer how Dungeons and Dragons shaped PC gaming. And the big get for that interview was Warren Spector, who by that point, I had written the oral history of Deus Ex and he was like the big sort of like, you know, silhouette in the middle that I hadn't managed to nail down, but for whatever reason, I have managed to get through to him for this thing. And you know, I also had like one of Bioware's founders in there and somebody else as well.
And it like, it felt like one of those features where I got to, you know, do an angle that nobody else was doing. And like, I got to demonstrate like, look, here's Warren Spector's influences, here's like the, the, the D&D games he played, DM'd by a famous sci-fi author when he was growing up. This is how we got immersive sims.
This is how we got there. And then move on to Bioware and go, look, this is how we got companions in RPGs and all this kind of thing. Like, this is how we got Mass Effect and, and like really sort of demonstrate how we got to, from A to B.
Like that felt like a good one for, you know, that I felt like I kind of built it from whole cloth to use the American term. Like there was, there was no access for me there beforehand. It was not a story anyone was asking me to tell, but I like, I invented it and it, and when I did the interviews, it turned out there was, you know, a lot of meat there and like a genuine story to tell.
Also just like a great moment to be able to tell that kind of story, but as like the, you know, the sort of like, I guess, percolation of, of D&D culturally, but also just, you know, obviously Baldur's Gate 3 and sort of like the moment we're in now, it just, yeah. I imagine that's a fairly, a fairly timeless read. That's pretty amazing.
Yeah, I think, Jeremy, in general, like I enjoy following the sort of trajectory of your features. I think, generally speaking, if you go to PC Gamer or Rock Paper Shotgun, look up your byline and you'll see a bunch of like, you know, I would say like peel ass features in there, sort of like chats with, you know, sort of like, like heritage kind of or legacy PC gaming developers and, you know, drawing attention to that kind of thing. I really enjoyed your interview with James Olin last year as well.
And just like, is Exodus the game that he's working on?
That's the one. Yeah. So at the time it hadn't been revealed.
But yeah, he was obviously deep into, into working on that. And yeah, like he's responsible for so much of what we think of as, as Bioware DNA and was just this guy in Canada, he ran three D&D games simultaneously and yeah, it sort of just reached a point where, you know, half of Bioware stuff were, were playing in his, his tabletop games. So it felt weird that they didn't hire him, I think.
Yeah, it was a great piece. Actually, I'm surprised Exodus did get a bit more hype off the back of the game awards thing, because it seemed like it was what a lot of Mass Effect fans have been asking for in some ways. But yeah, yeah, long way to go on that one.
But yeah. OK, so what are the challenges of writing a feature, Matthew, as the man who seems to struggle the most with the writer's block of the three of us, what do you think the challenges are?
The dream scenario is that you have such a huge amount of content out of an interview subject, or you have all this gold. But then the challenge becomes, and it's kind of a nice challenge to have, I guess, is what you put in. This is actually also true of reviews, where all these ideas and opinions and takes on a game, but fundamentally you're like, well, I have to pair this down, you know, I have to get to what actually matters here, and no one knows, you know, what they haven't read, you know, no one knows what didn't make the cut.
And that's always the thing I've struggled with, definitely in reviews, really in features. When I did the Shooter Killing Me piece for A Profound Waste of Time, you know, we talked for like, I don't know, an hour and a half, you know, there was just so much stuff there. You know, what's really relevant, what's really key, and I found that maybe I didn't necessarily get it right first time, you know, I'll be quite open that that's, you know, the hardest I've been edited in a long time was that piece by Simon Parkin, because that's the role he was playing, they kind of brought Simon in to sort of help with some of the editorial.
He was quite kind of rigorous, not in terms of like, oh, this this just isn't interesting or relevant, but like how I'd treated the information. I'd, you know, maybe this is getting lost in the weeds a little bit, but you can sometimes like over rely on quotes, let someone just sort of, you know, talk, talk at great length when you could probably summarize what they said a bit faster and make room for something else a bit more interesting. And I'd definitely done that, you know, I'd used kind of Takumi as a kind of crutch.
Maybe that was me being a bit starstruck, maybe it's me being a bit of a bad feature writer, who knows. The other thing is judging what's going to be relevant for a broad audience. Again, with that Shuu Takumi article, what it eventually was, if you've read it, is a quite broad making of.
It's like the story of Ace Attorney from its early inception to it being released and then a little bit on its legacy and what it means to Takumi. And that's absolutely fine. I think for that publication, that's what Caspian really wanted us to do.
To me, I'm like, if I'm going to have an hour plus with Shuu Takumi, I want to kind of pick up from where I left off with those previous features. Super hard, super nerdy and knowing not to do that. Understanding the brief and understanding the audience may sound super obvious, but there's a lot of temptation to not do that.
Yeah, I sort of see there that it's tricky as well because, you know, Found Waste Time is a relatively new publication as well. So it's sort of like, you know, they're sort of their own style, their own approach to doing things. It's, you know, it's going to be in a more sort of like larval form than it was for Edge, for example.
Like Edge, for example, right for Edge, for example, it's just a very different kind of like, yes, kind of a run up to take. So, yeah, that's interesting. OK, Jeremy, what about you?
What do you think the challenges of writing a feature are?
I guess I think the main one is structure because typically like these features are going to be quite a bit longer than your average, you know, internet piece and you when something gets that long, you have to actively work to build scaffolding for a piece basically to like so that it makes sense and it holds the reader's attention and it doesn't get muddled and it delivers on the promise of what you said it was going to be about. There's quite a lot to do there and you can be writing something and thinking like, okay, if I'm here now, where am I likely to be in 500 words time and where is that going to segue to next after that? You're jumping between these subjects, trying to make sure it's entertaining all the way through and that it gets you where you need to go in that long journey.
So I feel like there's kind of a whole skill set there, which doesn't really come into place so much when you're writing short news stories and stuff like that. There just isn't the room to get really lost. So that's tough.
Like you say, if you know there are certain points you need to hit along the way and you want it to form part of an overarching narrative, and then you have to decide what is important to this narrative and what can be dropped from this narrative, even if that risks it being maybe a good quote that's maybe slightly unrelated to the thing that you're talking about. The structural challenges of it are significant, for sure, when interviews are a part of it. Okay, so on the preview features side of things, how hard is it to pass games before they're released, which often forms part of how a feature is written?
Because what's interesting is when you're writing a cover feature, the access you get, you can get that at any point along the line. So it might be you get an interview when a game is announced, and you are the first person to ask about that. But therefore, there is very little material to base your questions on.
Or you might be doing it very deep into the sort of publicity cycle where you're getting close to launch and you feel like you've got a good idea of what it is. But then maybe you'll come out and it won't be what you thought it was. Or Matthew, what do you think the challenges of that are?
Yeah, that's a fucking nightmare. It made me think actually of writing about Mass Effect Andromeda for OXM, where I was at E3 and I managed to bag like a half an hour interview with the creative leads on it. It had just been announced.
I don't think there was anything about it. You can sit there and go... I'll just ask you a load of questions as if it was just Mass Effect 4 as we know Mass Effect to be.
Is it a third person shooter still? Does it still have these biotic powers? They start in the other.
In that case, maybe a bit waftily, but I remember trying to make it about more where they were coming from as people and what interested them most about Mass Effect and what interested them most about space travel and sci-fi to give an idea of like, well, you know, is it in good hands? You almost had to frame a new question for yourself to give it some direction. Where's this coming from?
Who are these people? Rather than what is it specifically going to be? Because, you know, they weren't going to go, you know what, Matthew?
Yeah, we're going to tell you all about this game, which isn't going to come out for three years. It just wasn't going to happen. That is always difficult being on a fact-finding mission for something which you have no idea about.
Jeremy, what about you? Because you've done a fair few of these features as well, right?
Yeah, there's a night as well, isn't there, to kind of like knowing what to forgive and not focus on. You know, often we see early builds of games for previews. So, like, it doesn't really make sense to write in a feature that this game had no icons on the interface and if it launches in that state, then I will be very disappointed because it's obviously not going to launch with no icons on the interface.
But at the same time, you can be caught out by stuff where, like, you know, you might be assured that a performance is going to improve by launch and then, ultimately, it's not significantly improved, but you can't project ahead, you can't predict the future, so you have to kind of, in many instances, give developers the benefit of the doubt and hope that readers understand that you're seeing things in that kind of limited context and, like, look, we're going to get the full story when we review this, when it's out, and that's just the way these things have to be. There's also a weird aspect to previewing stuff, is, like, a sense of responsibility for, like, conveying what the game is properly. Like, I've been working on an edge cover feature this week, and that's quite an unusual press trip scenario in that usually, like, you're not the only journalist on a trip, right?
So there's, you know, there's various interpretations and tellings of this game that all come out at the same time when an embargo hits. Whereas in this case, and in a couple of others I've had before, I'm the only person going to that studio. That studio is telling me the story of that game, what it is, how they've worked on it over years, and I am then the mouthpiece to, like, this game will be announced via my piece.
That feels like quite a heavy responsibility. Like, I've got to make sure I get right what the game is and that I've fully understood what I've seen.
And how is that Princess Peach game?
It's weird because, like, you know, I've only had, like, very good experiences with that situation, but it feels quite high pressure to go to a studio and be sort of like, you know, people are conscious that, you know, you're... you represent the, like, the breaking open of their big secret, you know? Yeah.
This is the point where the thing that they've not told anyone about for years goes public and I'm the guy they've got to get that across to.
Risky business.
So that's kind of the most sort of high intensity version of the preview, I guess.
The other thing as well is that, you know, Edge is read by game developers and the cover, having that cover still means a lot, you know, has a lot of cache to it. So yeah, it's still significant for sure when you're the tip of the spear.
Have you ever had one of those sort of scenarios, Samuel, the first, a genuine first look?
A few times. So we had it for, I don't know if we were first first, but I think we were close to first with Turtle War Warhammer, for example. But in some ways that's a known quantity, right?
People know what Turtle War is and, you know, Warhammer. It's very much a chocolate peanut butter situation, that one. So that felt relatively low pressure.
I'm trying to think of other times this has happened. I saw actually, I would think we were very first. I'm not so sure about, but I was really close with GTA 4.
No, that's not true. Actually, that's not true. We saw we saw it in action for the first time.
We were some of the first to see it in action for the first time. And they didn't release a video of what it was. So we had to write what it was.
And so that felt intense because you're trying to relay this narrative without people having a visual aid other than screenshots. That was tricky. Cool.
That's what I love going back to a game where you've had to do that and then seeing the thing again and being like, oh, man, I got this really that really wider than Mark or I forgot that I had that with Rise of the Tomb Raider. In my preview, I'd say 10% of the details were a little bit off. Yeah, you know, like a little bit misremembered the animal she fought and some of the things she'd got up to.
And it was just it was quite like, oh, well, and it's kind of I thought it was quite endearing.
But I found it really stressful as well when we as a as a PR, it's quite stressful because you hope that they they understood everything you told them or they spell every character name right. And that sort of thing. And when it goes to print and you can't do anything about it, it's sort of like you're sort of there thinking, ah, damn it, and I think that, yeah, this thing happens in reverse as well.
I'm sure they are reading this stuff nervously thinking, oh, I hope it I hope it kind of turns out all right. But yeah, yeah, it's gosh, do I have any other examples of this? I was just scanning the PC Gamer covers here.
We sort of ended up doing games that were too big. We sort of like were there sort of like when they announced things like Just Cause 3 and things like that. But again, kind of a known quantity.
We did have this when one of the big covers I worked on a PC game was like Civilization Beyond Earth and we were genuinely the only people who had seen it. So we became the number one resource on the internet for it. So like the Civ kind of like Reddit was breaking it apart and all that kind of stuff and we just had all these details.
And yeah, again, it feels quite high pressure. But it's interesting because there was that was also a point in that game cycle where there was a lot of optimism for it and then when it comes along at launch people are just not into it. But at announced is that interesting thing of they're essentially trying to sell that they've made a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri and or so a modern Civ game.
And so that pitch is very exciting. So when it's early on in that process, all you can do is be optimistic about what's to come and then the reality of the game might end up being something else. When I was a writer, another one I had was, I think we were among three, I think the only three outlets had gone to see Call of Duty World at War.
And that did feel quite intense because we had the cover and I think that it was sort of like it was a Treyarch one. So it was the first game that was coming after Call of Duty 4. And I don't think I, on the ground there, passed what a sort of like a big deal it was that there was a follow up to this game coming the next year from a different developer, but they were using the same tech and this kind of began the sort of like, it felt like this is a sort of beginning of the end of the, you know, the original Infinity Ward thing where they would go off and form Respawn.
So this is very, it's very intense World War II game. But yeah, that was quite intense in some ways because it was like, it's using the same tech as Modern Warfare, but it's gone back to World War II, which I think had started to be perceived as this kind of like, oh, we've seen too many of games in this kind of setting at that time. And yeah, then it was, and it was also that thing of like, Treyarch knew they were making a game where they would be compared, sort of like apples to apples with Modern Warfare.
And so they felt like they wanted to put their mark on it, that sort of thing. They kind of want to sell to you that like, this is the next one that everyone will play, but they're thinking if the Modern Warfare element is the thing that really tapped into players' interest, then we'll go back to World War II, do quite the same thing. And then I think the fact they kind of move it forward a little bit to Black Ops suggests that it took them a little bit of time to get there.
But you know, Treyarch are now the primary developers of Call of Duty. So I don't know, I guess like smaller scale, though, you know, I guess it's a slightly different deal. It's a very waffly answer.
But yeah, Jeremy, you've written a lot of old school making of tight pieces now. What kind of response do you tend to get from personnel who worked on 90s or noughties classics? Have they started to note who you are?
Because I find that I mean, this is always pretty much true. But when people are out of the kind of NDA-ed working for a big developer zone, they can they're genuinely more candid, they're willing to talk about stuff in most cases, and you get a bit more of a different sort of response from them than you would if they're part of the PR sort of hype cycle. How do you find that whole thing?
Yeah, it can be really nice where like people aren't used to being asked about the game, like it kind of falls out of public memory. And then, yeah, we've come back around to like, oh, this is a this is a 30 year old classic and and we want to know how it was made. So these are people who haven't been interviewed by games journalists for decades, if ever, you know, I can, yeah, that can be really like a positive experience of them kind of actually getting to tell the story of this thing.
Yeah, there's certain figures like that I've kind of repeatedly interviewed for these things now as well, like Austin Grossman, who's now like a successful author, also worked on Deus Ex and System Shock and Trespasser. So, like, I've kind of I've kind of ended up with some of these people who are like big personalities who don't get interviewed. But, you know, for modern stuff by games journalists, and I kind of realised like, oh, there's this person is full of stories and is fun and expresses things in a fun way.
And like, there's there's just a lot to dig into here. And I want to keep coming back and sort of, you know, sit at their knee and hear them tell their anecdotes.
Do they ever suggest stories to you? Like, oh, man, one day I should really tell you about X.
Things come up and people say, oh, you should really talk to this person as well. Like, oh, yeah, I did not. I did not think of that.
Like, one person I haven't talked to, but comes came up a lot in System Shock stuff was Seamus Blackley, who didn't really work on System Shock, but like his physics systems were the basis for it. And, you know, he went on to be a hugely important figure in like how consoles are made. And so like you end up with this sort of like little black book of, oh, yeah, at some point I will want to move on.
And with the knowledge I picked up there, speak to this other person and find out where they fit into this whole thing. There's also stuff like, you know, like I've interviewed John Romero a few times. And I always feel like I want to be especially attentive when it's John Romero because he takes like an active interest in the kind of history making around doom and quake and all that stuff.
Like he's not shy about like coming to an out and being like, you've actually got this slightly wrong. And this is how it happened. And not that I don't take care with like every story I write, but I'm aware like if I get this wrong, John will call me out on it justifiably.
So this is the other thing about like writing about very old games is that people's memories start to fail as well. Like as ask anyone to remember something that happened 30 years ago, I think this happened.
Yeah, that's that's what this podcast has proven time and time again.
Sometimes even five years ago, it can be kind of a struggle. Yeah, I think about I thought about this yesterday when I saw there's like some charmed actresses who were on Charmed. They're arguing about who forced who off of the show and like I think I think I never watched Charmed, just to be clear here.
But Shannon Doherty, I think, accused Alyssa Milano of getting her booted off the show. And Alyssa Milano made the point of like, well, this was 25 years ago. And so, you know, if you didn't talk about it then and like now it just seems like revisionist history, because it's so long ago that no one can remember it as clearly as, you know, as they otherwise might.
And I thought, I thought it was interesting, because I'm not saying that, you know, whether she's right or wrong. I have no fucking idea. But I just thought it's kind of a good point.
When it's that long ago, it does kind of become just so murky that having a you just you can't even trust what it feel like your own crystal clear memories of something.
Yes.
You know what I mean? Like it's. Yeah, yeah.
That's that is definitely what this podcast is going to be like in 20 years time. When I'm like, well, it all started due to my love of Onimusha 2.
So you'll have an exact record of what you said 20 years prior that listeners can pull up and tell you.
The creation of Gamescore will be arguing over who who was responsible for that disaster. Basically, that will happen. That's interesting, Jeremy.
That's yeah, that's that kind of makes sense, I guess. But yeah. OK, so what happens to a piece after it's written?
What does the edit process look like for a website versus a magazine? That's something else I wanted to talk about. So I think that, yeah, so a writer would submit something and then it really I think this really depends on your time, your timeline.
If it's a cover feature, chances are it's been done very quickly and it needs to be designed and sent very quickly. And I think in some ways cover features are sort of the easiest to edit as well because there's only, you know, if quotes are doing the telling for you, you're not really going to you might edit down a quote a little bit or condense it just so just for sort of space reasons. But the content of them is kind of like what the point of the piece is, to a large degree, so that that can be very fast.
But other types of features can take longer or maybe like I think word count is like a key part here as well. So you would go you hand over, let's say a piece comes in, it's very long, you hand it over to a designer, it comes back. And then in InDesign, what it will do is it will show the pages as they'll be printed out.
But you can click on the text box and it will show you how much over it is and there'll be this white space off to the side of InDesign that has fucking a wall of words on it. And then your sub editor will do their best to chop it down. But then it might come back to you because they can no longer chop it down even further to make it fit the space.
And you'd ideally want to give it another two pages, but you don't have another spare two pages to give it in your flat plan. So that can be quite complicated. But Matthew, what do you remember of that edit process for a magazine when a feature would come back?
I don't know if I particularly cover myself in glory here, but I was a bit of a bad in-house editor for things. I wasn't always the most collaborative editor and kind of remain that way now. In an ideal world, you'd have infinite time to be going back and forth.
But often we were so up against it, I was often taking a kind of hatchet to stuff myself, which I know loads of writers absolutely hate. And I don't like it when it happens to my writing. But that's, you know, those were the conditions in which we worked.
With stuff like that, I could help with punching it up a bit, just trying to make it a bit more like entertaining or kind of zippy or whatever. We never had anything too like wider than that. We tended to use a very small pool of trusted freelancers who tended to get it right.
Like, if you got it right once, you were basically in with us for like the next five years, which is why like so much of our stuff was done by like Chris Schilling and Rich Stanton. You know, they were just the safest of hands.
Yeah, I know you mean like trusted writers, key part of how this stuff gets made for sure. It's like there's a logistical sort of like dependency element you have. I certainly found a PC Gamer, it's very hard to forward plan on features as much as I'd like because I didn't have a features editor and I was doing the features myself in terms of ideation until Phil Savage joined the magazine, which helped us get ahead a little bit more.
But it was always hard anyway for like anyone to find the capacity to think beyond the issue you were working on. There was no like, there was no high level thinking about where to go next, other than maybe the cover feature where you're talking to publishers about what might be coming down the line. So yeah, tricky for sure.
On website side, so Jeremy, you've done a bit of this web editing, this side of things. But I found this interesting because in that, I found that you're editing against people's attention span in some ways. You just, you knew that they probably weren't going to read more than like, I don't know.
I felt like topping out about 1600 words as much as I could generally felt like I could get away with on a website. Like with some exceptions on PC Gamer for sure, but definitely was on TechRadar. I thought, well, this could only go on for so long, probably.
And so that becomes a challenge in the sense of how will you keep people's attention? That sort of thing. How do you make the kind of like headline right for a website?
Because, you know, generally speaking, your feature headlines might be a bit more conceptual for a magazine or just like a couple of words or that sort of thing to just try and grab attention off the page. Very different because you've got Google algorithms to think about. So you've got to have like the name of the game in the feature headline.
You've got to get on from there. You got to have a little bit of spice to get people to click. So complicated.
But what do you make of that side of things?
Yeah, obviously you don't have the maximum word count, which is such like a practical concern in mags. But, you know, I think like that's also a benefit in some ways. And I sort of brought like a magazine attitude to web editing where like like I do believe like it's rare that a piece isn't made better by having to cut it down a little.
And it's, you know, it can be painful as a writer when you see something's been cut down and you're like, oh, does that mean I did a bad job? And I was also always at pains to talk to writers and explain why I'd made those decisions. I probably took too much time doing that even.
But, you know, it was important to me to like to point out like the reason these cuts are made is because I can see what the central idea of your piece is and these elements are getting in the way. Like if we cut some of these bits, then we get an undiluted version of the thing we're getting across and that's better. And that can be hard to instill online where there's no work out.
And often, like, you get these sort of bloated features which are designed to sort of stay at the top of Google and they end up getting longer and longer. And, like, inheriting those as an editor is quite weird. You're like, OK, we've got sort of 10,000 words on, I don't know, the best cat games or whatever.
The Witcher 4.
The Witcher 4, which we have no details on. And, yeah, you have to kind of, like, figure out how do we balance the priorities here and make sure this is readable and that, like, somebody reading it would come away with a good impression of what our site is about.
I always have my limitations as well with editing where this is where my sort of, like, intellectual limits come to play as well, where I don't have the attention span to properly edit one of those SEO sort of, like, headlining kind of pieces. And so they would always end up being the most, like, awful garbage or they'd be, like, incongruous bits and pieces of it where I'm like, OK, this release date sections, bits of text are being repeated down here. I found updating SEO pieces was where I did my worst editing, actually.
And I think that most people, most writers do, because you're trying to work out what Google's made up ridiculous rules are, that they just change on a dime and don't explain properly ever are. And so that was kind of like the push and pull in my head a little bit of, like, OK, well, creative energy might as well go into the good stuff. But yeah, it's that's where I wouldn't cover some myself in glory exactly.
But yeah, so I guess like along similar lines, less traditional types of feature. How do you make a good version of a list feature, for example, which, you know, you mentioned it there, Jeremy, but it feels like it's junk content in principle because, you know, this features we know are sort of like SEO gold. But they are also really important because they are the bread and butter of your your site in terms of well, there's a few different reasons they're important.
But, you know, they are they they make money because they're going to be the most clicked features and therefore they're going to generate a lot of ad revenue for you. But they're also it's really important for if you're a games website for your best PC games feature to be really good, for example, or the best FPS games and that sort of thing. They are signature pieces in a way that convey the values of your your site and your team and what is important to you as a brand.
So how do you think that you make those good, Jeremy? What's you've obviously we've done a whole a fair bunch of these. What is that?
What is a good version of a list feature look like?
Yeah, so I guess what you're fighting against is that is a sense that it's just kind of feels a bit empty and that it's just kind of filling a slot. But that I feel like list features really lend themselves to comedy because they have that sort of slightly throw away feel lets you not sweat too much and, you know, get to kind of bog down in things and have fun with it. Like the most red feature I will ever write was, which fall guy are you, for PC Gamer, which was an idea my wife had.
I've got to give her credit for that. And I'm pretty proud of that one. Like, it was very silly and sort of had some dark existential humor in there.
And people obviously like a time when everyone was playing fall guys, they did actually kind of recognize these archetypes and different ways of playing. Like, you know, pick out like, oh, there's, there's the guy who sort of waits on the line to grab people and help them off. And what does it say about them?
That's how they choose to live their life and this kind of thing. Like, you would never write in that way in like an edge cover feature because you feel like you've got to kind of take things a little more seriously. But in that format, you can kind of muck about in a positive way.
Yeah, that's interesting. What about you, Matthew? Do you ever get involved in these kinds of features much?
I suppose at NGamer, you probably did make a few list features.
Yeah, lists were like bread and butter. I love a list feature. I think as a technical writing exercise, writing really concisely and nailing the appeal of a game in 100 words, that's a great task.
I enjoyed doing it in 15 words in the directory, but a list is a more substantial version of that. I was really into list craft in terms of the importance of the 100th game in a top 100 list. We would always talk about, do you throw something in shocking to upset people?
Do you defy expectations? Do you take something that should be in the top 10 and put it in at 100? Just to say, all bets are off and this is happening.
You lean into the feature, you lean forward, you're locked into it. The art of standing out as a list when it is on paper such a vanilla feature is really fun. Working now more in the video space where lists are huge business and there's loads of channels built almost exclusively on list features.
Outside Xbox, outside Extra, they've done big lists. I wrote a couple of scripts for them when I was doing freelance. The exercise there was a bit like when we had Rob Pearson on the podcast and he was talking about the kind of art of trying to find a new angle or a weird gaming habit that triggered something in everyone's minds.
The challenge of that is one thing, but also just the opportunity to flex the weirdest corners of your gaming knowledge and really dip into something specific. When you're talking about those ultra specific YouTube lists, seven most cursed hacks in gaming or whatever, and you're like, have I got seven in me? Can I genuinely think of seven really interesting hats?
But when you do it, you're like, yes, fucking knowledge. This is amazing. This is why I played games for 30 years, so I could write about these hats right now.
And so yeah, I have no shame in it. I think where it becomes garbage is the people who don't respect the lists and do treat it as just an exercise and like, well, we have to have these for SEO purposes. And you end up with basically everyone repurposing the same list and all this consensus are like, these are the 10 best stealth games.
It's always the same fucking things that you read over and over again. And that really bums me out. There's room for immense craft if you truly respect the list.
Yeah, there's a long tradition of them in mags. Like when I was 12 or 13, I would read, you know, a few magazines, 50 best albums of whenever, and like learn a lot and absorb the craft of that short form writing. And yeah, it isn't just like, oh, this, this, you know, this fulfills an online need.
Like there's a reason that lists have happened for decades in entertainment journalism and they can be really good.
Absolutely. I think I do agree with what you're saying there, Matthew, where I think there are just some, you know, sort of like, you see these junk factory SEO articles. When we did the Sega episode with Ash, I was looking up like what the consensus best Sega games are.
And I was looking for that lived in experience that we kind of got from Ash when he was talking about those games. And it is quite hard to seek out. And instead it becomes like, you say, like the self-perpetuating same 10 or so games where you don't necessarily feel like you're getting that sort of like nutritional value from the entries themselves.
And yeah, yeah, it's it's what I loved about that Ash episode is that and this is hard to do in a written list is you also had the opportunity in the space to say, you know, these are my 10, but you know, not these games for this reason, you know, like it's equally interesting why a Sega person wouldn't pick Sonic the Hedgehog, say, and that's maybe like, you know, a list can't encompass everything it isn't. But I am almost as interested in that.
Yeah, definitely. The honorable mentions was definitely like was almost the sort of like classic top 10 Sega listed itself, wasn't it? Like it was, you know, having Sonic and Yakuza not on that list, for example.
Yeah, I agree. It's sort of like I think it's when you can use that tiny space of like words to properly communicate your authority and experience. And, you know, doing that concisely really is like you say, Matthew, just an art form.
So I agree. I love I love a list feature. They are probably that it's still probably the thing.
You know, the things I read the most. I will check out, you know, sort of like Vulture's best TV shows of the year to source recommendations. I'll read everyone's best films of the year list.
I read so many A Game of the Year lists last year because last year's games were so there were so many of them that it was it was challenging to find people who are outside of the narrative are talking about the same five or six games that had come to dominate the year. You know, the Zeldas and the and the Baldur's Gate 3s of the of 2023. So yeah, hugely important for sure.
Okay, so last question, then are any white whale features you want to land yourself at yourselves? Matthew, I feel like you have done this with Shu Takumi a little bit. Do you think that got something out of your system ticking that off?
Yes, in terms of talking to him like there's a there's a there's a version of that feature where somehow I am in Japan with Shu Takumi, a translator, and we get to like not talk in a in a blank Capcom office, but you get to hang out, you know, almost like those Archipel videos. I want to talk to Shu Takumi in a fucking bookshop, you know, I want him to show me stuff that he likes. I want to know more about him.
That's just because I'm nosy. What one thing I've always wanted to do years ago, I remember Edge doing a feature about a state of of like British racing game studios, and it was like a round table with four people from it. And ever since then, I've I've been really big into the idea of rivals coming together sort craft, which doesn't happen very often.
PC gamers organized a few good panels like this at GDC actually, where I say rivals, but people from similar, you know, similar genres come together and talk about them. Maybe that's stepping aside as a writer and letting them do all the work. But as a reader, I would certainly want to read like, you know, I've long dreamt of doing basically that that same edge feature.
But for the writers of Japanese crime games, you know, I would love Shutokumi and Mr. Danganronpa, maybe even throw Yuji Horii, who did the Portopia serial murder case, which is like the visual novel, which kind of kicks off a lot of people's interest in the genre. Just to hear people who've all done the same job talk about it. Yeah.
I'd love that. You know, almost like the collected works of that they do in Edge, but like for a genre kind of step forwards beyond that even.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Weirdly, that is kind of a thing in in film journalism, right? Like actors on actors is a big, you know, it helps when those people are celebrities, but it feels like it is sort of uncapitalized space in games for whatever reason.
I agree, like the Ben Affleck interviewing David Fincher was a fun one from a few years ago and Fincher just giving him shit, which he likes to do. But again, it's that sort of access that, yeah, I mean, you just, it tickles something in your brain. It doesn't feel like they're just campaigning for, you know, it doesn't feel like they're just selling something, you know.
But, you know, imagine like Miyazaki talking to like Anuma about like adventure games.
Yeah.
Like, oh my god, it would be like, oh, they'd have so much to say to each other, surely, you know.
Yeah, it's yielded, in the recent years, just so many good moments of actors interviewing actors from that kind of stuff. So yeah, I agree. Jeremy, how about you?
Is there any kind of, do you have any White Whales?
I have interviewed a lot of my kind of gaming heroes, Harvey Smith and John Romero and people like that. There is one I picked up through writing about System Shock, which was Terry Brogess. I never managed to pin her down.
She doesn't do interviews, as far as I can tell. She was the voice of Showdown, but she's like a really fascinating figure as, you know, a woman in games when there weren't so many of those and was in a grunge band in the 90s and then, you know, worked in the kind of audio at Looking Glass, but also was a writer on Early Thief and like helped come up with a sort of weird Lynchian tone of that stuff. So, like, I know there's an amazing profile interview waiting there, but like, and you know, I've not been able to nail that.
That's another tricky part about pitching is like, I've definitely pitched that and then not been able to deliver on it is this weird sort of dance where like, you can't go to an interviewee before you've approached an editor and be like, I'm going to write about you for PC Gamer because PC Gamer hasn't agreed to it at that point. But equally, when you go to PC Gamer and say, I'm going to interview this person, hopefully, you also haven't nailed it down at that point either. So sometimes you just have to move on, be sad that you weren't able to deliver the thing you'd hoped.
Yeah, for sure. All right. So yes, White Whales.
There's many more besides as well. I think I would love to do the... I still think that people like reading the definitive interview with X of somebody who made important games in the 90s or the noughties and go out and get that stuff.
I absolutely love the Simon Parkins podcast interview with Peter Molyneux, for example. I mean, I still feel like I learned things from that that I hadn't seen him talk about for many interviews. Talk about his time as an EA executive I found really interesting and how he sort of like...
I think the story of how he sort of fibbed to get the studio going, just like pretending to be a game developer is just like a really just wonderful bit of like Britsoft lore and never gets boring to hear that story. But then also as people get older, their reflections on how things panned out in or certain decisions they've made does change. So then, you know, yeah, that that means it's always it's always interesting to hear from those people.
Okay, that brings us to the end of the episode then. So yes, I think we covered a lot of territory there a little bit of scattergun I guess that second half but do you think we nailed it, Matthew? Do you think we covered what it's like there to write features, the challenges?
If this was a feature submitted to me, I'd tweak a few sentences but I'd definitely send it to print.
Yeah, cut it down by 500 words but otherwise, yeah, pretty much there. Jeremy, what do you think we covered every area there? Is there anything unresolved for you from that discussion?
I don't think so. I felt good to talk about the craft for an audience that I know is interested in hearing it as well so that was fun.
Yeah, it's been a long time since we did a Magcraft kind of episode.
Yeah, earlier on when we used to do a lot of this, you sometimes get, I wish they wouldn't bollock on about magazines as well.
Oh yeah, that did happen, didn't it?
Yeah, and then we sort of stopped doing it for a long time but so yeah, sorry that one guy.
Sorry that one guy who listened to a podcast called The Back Page and was upset at the magazine chat.
Yeah, it's kind of like, it's a bit lighter these days. I guess we've kind of kept the Mag Chat to when we have a guest on and we talk about it that way and I think some people miss, want us to have more of those episodes but yeah, it's always a tricky balance for us between the right kind of subject, someone who comes on who knows what the podcast is or engages with it and then yeah, it's actually, it's weirdly harder to figure out that you think it is. We also don't want it to just be a procession of our pals talking about stuff that we worked on and have similar stories.
I don't know, it's a delicate balance but yeah.
I've told all my fun stories as well, we've only got the sad stuff left.
Exactly.
You say that Matthew but you came up with the I sang a song about funerals with Alexa Chung a few weeks ago. I couldn't believe that you'd kept that in for almost four years.
Yeah, how did that never come up?
Well, you know, that's one of my lower tier anecdotes.
I think that's like the architect in The Matrix just going back in and adding a bit more detail to you know what I mean, like this person could just use a little bit more backstory so we're just going to roll out the Alexa Chung DLC for Matthew Castle and just sort of see how that goes.
I did say to Samuel, maybe he's just started making these up but then...
No, that's... I swear that's real.
I believe it's real for two reasons. A, you're not the type of man to start making shit up on your podcast and B, it just has the ring of a classic castle story where it's like it's adjacent to something glamorous. It was like, oh this person became a model and presenter but you were focusing on like the local newspaper story that covered the production and how good the amateur production was.
You're like, yeah, this is classic Matthew. This is real.
This is, that's a very, a very astute observation of how I see the world and where I place myself in it.
Yeah, that's a great, yeah, that was a wonderful story. I think Alexa Chung's now come up on like four episodes in a row as well. Very cursed.
