Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how did you find the response to our Game of the Year episode? Good, bad, how are you feeling about it?
Yeah, good. You know, lots of people were playing Cobalt Core, or Cobalt Core, or Cobilt Core, however the fuck you meant to pronounce it.
God, yeah, the listeners picked me up on me, because I said Cobalt Core. And like, even when I said it, I remember thinking, it's not the right way you say that, and then it was too late, I'd gone all in. And then in the Discord, people were like, is this a UK thing of how they say Cobalt or...
Yeah.
And then I thought, you know what, I can't be mad because it just means that people listen to and enjoy this podcast, which is what we really wanted, wasn't it? When we started, so...
Exactly, yeah. Well, that's just classic us, isn't it? Just zooming in on the one piece of criticism.
No, it's good. People seem to like the lists, and even if they didn't agree with all the choices, that was fine, you know, they let it go. I can see some people nervously dancing around the fact that they don't like Jedi Survivor as much as we do.
Or I do, specifically I do.
But that's okay, that's alright. You know, I think some people are like, but the performance, surely, surely that's a thing.
I think you said that a little bit like Scottie for a second then. But the performance, Captain!
I do plan to do more hidden impressions this year.
That's one of my predictions for the year. You will do more impressions of Star Trek characters.
I will have done all of the, at least the crew of the original series. Maybe we'll start pushing into like Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.
Hooray, will that be part of the mix, Matthew? Or do you think you'll draw the line there?
I can't really think what her voice is like, but I'll give it a go at some point.
Okay, good to know. So yep, all of that is coming up. So this episode is our 2024 predictions.
Normally at the end of the year, we give people the sort of good version of this episode, which is did the predictions come true? But as people will know, at the end of last year, we took a break, so we didn't end up doing that episode. So we'll squash a bit of that predictions from last year revisited into this episode, not as much as we'd normally do.
And then we've got a fresh set of predictions for this year. So Matthew, how are you feeling? Fresh being maybe the incorrect word there, Matthew.
How are you? How are you feeling about this episode?
Yeah, good. I mean, every year I look forward to this episode, because it's nice to have traditions, isn't it? Yeah.
But at the same time, when I come to make my predictions, I realize that I don't have it. I'm just pulling some ideas out my ass of things that I think would be nice if they happened or would be interesting if they happened, or things that are just so silly or out there that if they did happen, it would just be hilarious that we managed to predict something like that. If you read the official, the proper version of predictions online, it's a bit more like industry analysis, which isn't really the vibe, I don't think, here.
No, definitely not. No, this is just some silly nonsense we pulled out of our ass, like you say. And like, actually, one thing I learned listening back to the 2023 predictions, so we did last year, was that was where we coined the term, Piers Harding, Tubby Rolls, which is, basically, there is an analyst called Piers Harding Rolls, who comes up with, I don't know, educated guesses about games business, I don't really know how that started, industry really works, but we do our own sort of our own jokey version is Piers Harding, Tubby Rolls, because we are large men.
So that's, that's kind of like hilarious banter we managed to come up with in January 2023. So yeah, that just sort of marked that milestone there, Matthew.
Oh, that's good. Happy birthday to Piers Harding, Tubby Rolls.
One years old. Well done. Okay.
So then, yes, we have predictions to get on with very shortly. Before then, Matthew, I thought I'd give people an idea of what we're working on in January because we are back in full force this month making a full set of episodes. So I thought I'd give people a very quick rundown.
So this is a predictions episode January 5th. On January 8th on the Patreon exclusively for XL tier subscribers, I'm going to bang on about my trip to Japan. I apologize in advance for that.
Matthew will listen to it and ask me questions. It might be illuminating. I'll try and make it kind of like a travel log or semi useful or at least like Michael Palin style.
Yeah, maybe a little bit of that. Just sort of, you know, just try and give people a little bit more value. So it's not just me reading out a list of games I bought in Super Potato, which is not very nourishing podcast content.
So I'm well aware that could be a disaster, but I'll try and make it good. Behind the paywall is probably where it deserves that deserves to be.
It's got a hint of the us recounting the escape room, except it's one of us recounting a holiday.
That you weren't there for, I haven't even seen images for.
Like the escape room where you're scared the whole time that a man is going to jump out.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's basically yeah. That didn't happen in Japan.
I wasn't worried about a man jumping out, so that will happen. And then regular episode next after that will be January 12th Mailbag episode. So we're doing one of those.
We know how we feel about that. And then what we've been playing will be January 19th. I've got quite a mix of stuff to play and talk about for that one, Matthew.
Some leftovers from last year. And then the awesome Patreon January 22nd. The best TV shows are 2023, a little bit later than we normally do.
But me and Matthew will talk about that, since TV is one of our specialist subjects.
I'm crowding in the last couple of watches. So yeah, same here.
And so we've also got something for the Sega heads who we are perennially letting down on this podcast. Top 10 Sega Games with Ashley Day on January 26th. That'll be the last episode of the month.
And yeah, in February as well, Matthew, I'd like to do the best games of 2002, because I feel like that's something that I've, you know, I just, I feel like it will be a good signature episode for us. So we can talk about that off air. But that's this month.
So giving the Sega sickos what they want. And so yes, thanks so much for listening as ever. So let's get into this episode then.
We're not going to do the whole list of predictions we had last year, because I think that will take up a whole episode and we don't want to do that because we wanted to focus on this a little bit more. So we'll do some we got right and then some we got howlingly wrong. So Matthew, to start with you, which of your predictions from last year did you get right?
None of them really, to be honest. But I guess the closest I got was one of my predictions was Starfield will be fine. It will be an unusually smooth launch for Bethesda game, which I think is true.
That was good. So I'd give myself a tick for that. My other one, which is…
I don't know if it's true or not. I said Netflix games will start to succeed where other mobile subscription game services have failed. What an exciting prediction that was.
I don't know if that's true. Like it certainly isn't on the tip of everyone's tongue. But they're still going and they're still adding quite big hitters just before Christmas they did the Grand Theft Auto trilogy and I feel like you know they're building up quite a good library and I think if people were to go on to the Netflix app and look at the free games that they get as part of their subscription on mobile you'd be impressed actually at some of the you know pretty premium things that are on there.
But you know I don't think they've solved the problem of how do we get people to know that these things exist in a tab on the mobile version of Netflix and until that happens it will never really explode but it's not like you know Apple Arcade just feels like quite a shadow of its former self and this hasn't quite reached that stage yet. So kind of Netflix games exist still?
Yeah I mean like I saw Jeremy Peel playing the GTAs on his tablet over Christmas and he was out on a boat?
That GTA port apparently has like different lighting options than the console ones have. They haven't put those lighting options in the console version. I was quite annoyed about it because I'd like to give those a well but apparently it's a more authentic kind of like PS2 sort of lighting they've gone for with these different filters so I'd quite like a piece of that as a big PS2 head obviously.
So yeah, so you know if Jeremy Peel is playing it, is that a measure of success? I think so. So you know, I'll give you that one Matthew.
I think that's alright.
Jeremy Peel may feature in one of my predictions.
Blimey. We really got to get him back on actually. I don't think he's been on a regular episode since, I think it's at 2021 we did the GTA clones on trial?
He must have been in on 2022, surely.
Oh of course, he was on the RPGs episode about Baldur's Gate wasn't he? Yeah, okay, yeah. But still, you know, it's sort of like, I'd like to get Jeremy back on.
He's always welcome on this podcast. So okay, good. Talking about him, like he's a fictional character, I always enjoy doing that.
Well, it's nice to give the Discord like some fresh content for them to like, sort, they don't really dunk on him, per se, but he is sort of a play thing to them, which I think is nice.
Yeah, he's like those two Shakespeare guys combined. We talked about it before. Jeremy Peel is that to the Discord, so that's good.
They are very much alive. Which of your predictions did you get right?
Yeah, so I'm going to give myself half a point for this one. So New Super Mario Bros. returns in time for the Mario movie dropping, which is a three-star joint at most.
I mean, I got that bit right, the last bit.
Well, you see, when we read that, I was like, the Mario film or the game is a three-star joint?
No, no, I meant the film. I meant the film. Right, because I complained about, I listened back to the episode and I complained about the idea that I didn't think it was going to be very good.
And then, you know, I haven't seen it, but it feels like it's left kind of no real cultural footprint. That film is just sort of come and gone, despite making an absolute tonne of money. I probably did what everything that Nintendo wanted it to, like it made Mario even more famous as a sort of brand, I suppose, but it wasn't strictly New Super Mario Bros.
But I feel like Super Mario Wonder was this really. So I'm going to give myself half a point.
Yeah, it's what the it's the New Super Mario Bros. team, you know, they're not making New Super Mario Bros. because they're making this.
Yeah, exactly. And so I thought, you know, that that was the point is that like it was a 2D game to match the sort of like wider audience who would come in with that film. So half a point for that one, I think.
I had the Oculus Quest 3 is released this year with some killer games and marks of breakthrough and VR adoption. But the reveal is weighed down by some metaverse nonsense no one wants. Now that last bit actually wasn't true.
They actually very smartly left metaverse completely out of the pitch for the Quest 3 and they just focused on games. I would say that when it comes to killer games, it's sort of like a bit 50-50 on that one. Assassin's Creed Nexus is pretty cool.
I've been playing that. And then Asgard's Wrath got a 10. Asgard's Wrath 2 got a 10 from IGN.
So I think some people have really been enjoying that kind of like action RPG thing. So I'd say that as VR goes, those are kind of up there when it comes to titles. But I don't think the Quest 3 is specifically marked a breakthrough in VR adoption.
I think it's the Quest 2 being sliced down to a very cheap price. It apparently sold an absolute fuck ton of copies of, well, units basically over the break. So I think I can give myself a full point for that one.
What do you reckon?
Yeah, that's all right. I mean, listen, it's not like there's a prize at the end of this.
There's not? Oh, fuck. Okay, never mind.
And then Game Pass increases in price. That did happen in July. So I've got that right as well.
That was very Pierce Harding, Tubby Rolls.
Yeah, it's not a very exciting choice. This is meant to be like colorful nonsense where we can talk about games, you know what I mean?
If you read the online articles about predictions for 2024, they're all like, expect loads more layoffs. And you're like, great. That's not really the vibe of this episode.
No, it's not really what I'm going for personally. So yeah, that's not good. But okay, so those are the ones we got right.
But what about the ones who got terribly wrong? I would say most of mine, Matthew. But what about what were the big howlers from your selection?
E3 is back, but the E3 experience is increasingly fragmented. E3 is dead. It's officially dead.
Didn't happen this year, you know, for various reasons. So that was only it's right in that the E3 experience is like increasingly fragmented unless now it's just Jeff Keighley's for the taking. But I guess we'll see how it plays out.
But it still seems pretty messy to me. Like we sent some people from our company went out to E3 and not E3, to LA during Summer Games Fest. And, you know, you were taking taxis across towns as like rival publisher events and things like that.
And you're like, this doesn't this doesn't feel like a unifying thing quite yet. This this prediction was I must have really been making up the numbers. I have no idea where this came from.
I thought that there would be a Warriors tie in for either Lord of the Rings or Star Wars Clone Wars.
Oh, I love that one. That was completely like off-brand for you. A bat shit had everything that one.
Yeah, no Warriors game announced this year, so, you know, it could still be working on it. But, yes, the big one I got wrong was I made a bold prediction of the top five games on Metacritic, which is a bit like one of those bets when you bet on, like, lots of different things happening. What do they call that?
You know, when you bet on, like, five successive horse races and you get, like, a mega prize.
I don't know. I actually don't spread. I have no idea.
I have no idea at all.
I think it's whatever Adam Sandler does in Uncut Gems at the end, where he bets on, like, this, this and this and then they all happen or whatever.
It ended well for him, didn't it? So, yeah.
Well, it ended just about a similar way for me in this episode. My top five games on Metacritic were Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Hollow Knight Silksong, didn't come out, Resident Evil 4 Remake, Half-Life Alex on PSVR 2, which didn't happen, and a Cyberpunk Complete Edition, which also didn't happen or definitely isn't on Metacritic. I got two out of five.
Yeah.
Top five games on Metacritic were Baldur's Gate 3, which maybe I should have seen coming, Tears of the Kingdom, Metroid Prime Remastered, Resident Evil 4 and Super Mario Wonder. So, I should have trusted in Nintendo.
That Metroid Prime Remastered did better than the Resi 4 remake.
Yeah, it's the third highest reviewed game of the year.
Well, I mean, is it good or depressing that there's a remake and a remaster in there? I suppose it's like the remake probably not so much, because that's a new game at least for the remaster.
Also, they just shadow dropped. Is that the right phrase?
Yeah, it was just there, wasn't.
To be fair to it, no one has talked about Metroid Prime for the rest of the year, but for like two days, all these dweebs were like, Metroid Prime, yeah, 10! And then forgot about it.
All these dweebs.
All those dweebs. And they gave it 10.
Yeah, I mean, the thing is, it was cool that it came back, and I bet it sold more on Switch than it ever sold on GameCube now. Like, it's for sure. Yeah, its reputation is inflated.
So yeah, I mean, that probably is what happened there, and it was the start of the year, so people were bright and optimistic. I don't know, but we're actually going to formalise the top five predictions, aren't we? You and I are both going to have a go at this at the end of the episode.
Yeah, well, I guess we'll break that down a bit later.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, any more handlers you wanted to go through?
No, that was mostly it. The rest of mine were just a bit too boring, really, to talk about. Or some of them I'm going to roll over into the new year, perhaps.
So, what about you? What were you horribly wrong about?
Yeah, so I'm saving a couple of mine for this year as well. I'm going to roll, well, actually just one of mine I'm going to roll over. But Final Fantasy XIII and its two sequels are updated for modern platforms.
Nope, that never happened. The funniest one was Sony Unveil's native PlayStation 3 backwards compatibility, leading to a broad reappraisal of the Resistance trilogy. That never happened, obviously.
Nintendo Switch successor is teased right at the end of the year. Nope. This is the year Sony hard pivots into making big multiplayer games happen.
Nope, that didn't really happen last year. Last year was Spider-Man year. And, yeah.
Everything they announced going forward was a multiplayer game.
Yeah, like they got Helldivers this year, right?
Helldivers and that, that, um, well, you know, there's that kind of heist game, I can't remember the name of, something like, like illegal games or something.
No, I never heard of that.
It's the way, it's Jade Redman's one. It looked like Watch Dogs, that trade.
Oh, yeah, it was like.
A pun on like something games. Yeah, that Marathon.
That, yeah, that and Marathon were in the same live stream. And I was there thinking, ah, I love single player games, you know, man, I'm just a big fan of them.
Yeah, so I actually don't think you were that far. I don't think this is howling me off.
No, this is happening. This has been in the sort of the sort of like on the way for a long time. So, yeah, I guess it's like a half a point for that one, maybe.
Yeah, but it didn't really happen this year.
Back to this non-existent point system.
Yeah, that counts as absolutely nothing at all.
You're really trying to reinforce this point. Every time it's looking good for you, you're back on the point.
Yeah, so I play to win and not to lose, Matthew. That's what I do here on this podcast. And then the last one that's probably worth mentioning is A Link to the Past remake, announcer switch.
The thinking there was just, you know, The Link's Awakening one did really well, it would seem. And, you know, it was sort of like, it seemed to go down quite well as well with Zelda fans. So I thought they would get to this next because it's a little bit more ambitious to do A Link to the Past.
So, yeah, but that never happened. So again, no points for me to resurrect the point system one last time. But yeah.
Was Super Mario RPG? Was that also Grezzo, was that the team that did Link's Awakening?
Oh, gosh, I have no idea, actually. Let me just find out.
I mean, playing that now, that really has the feel of that Link's Awakening remake.
Oh, really?
Yeah, like in terms of production values and like the intention of the thing and that they haven't really meddled with it at all.
Yeah.
You know, if it's not the same team, it feels like it's come from the same place in the same process.
OK, so there seems to be like a whole OK, right. So there was apparently like an IGN sort of investigation, semi-investigation to who did this. So they reached out and apparently it was a joint effort between Nintendo internal studios and Arte Piazza.
I don't know.
Oh, that's right.
OK, yeah, yeah. So, yes, that's but then there is no Arte Piazza in actually written in the game, apparently in the credits. So it's quite quite an odd one.
But anyway, yes. So there was also but the Arte Piazza, of course, stands for Arte Pizza. Oh, yeah.
Very good. And so, yeah, so apparently it was directed, though, by Aeko Moriwaki, who was also an assistant director on Pikmin 4 and worked on Yoshi's Crafted World. So this was definitely like a Nintendo internal joint in some capacity.
So, yeah, I agree, though, who knows what Grezzo is up to. But maybe they're doing this for this year, Matthew, who knows? So, yes, that's pretty much last year.
I hope you enjoyed that.
There might be some points in it yet for you.
Yeah, I will say as well, actually, that having sort of gone over these, I'm quite glad we didn't waste an episode on revisiting these. They're not that interesting. They pretty much are just fine as a footnote at the start of the episode.
We've actually found the optimal version of this. Yeah. It's like, let's do it.
Let's do two episodes in one and just make the whole thing shorter.
Exactly.
Well done, us. We've saved you, listeners. We really did you a favor there by disappearing for a month instead of turning this into a two-hour episode.
Any other observations from your predictions, Matthew? Anything you want to discuss before we move on to this year's predictions?
Only that I'm glad I don't really have to do this for a living and come up with serious predictions because it seems like a grim business.
So yeah, I must admit there was a moment where I had 11 out of my 12 when I was sat in Starbucks today and I sat there for 25 minutes thinking of a 12th one. And I was like, why am I doing this to myself? Was this a good idea for a podcast if this is how I feel about it?
If this is what I'm doing to myself? You know, it's tough.
I must admit, I asked everyone at the company at lunchtime. I was like, we're doing this predictions episode. What would you predict?
And then I did that annoying thing where I asked everyone's help. But every idea I got back, I just wasn't into it at all. So I just kept being like, no, you don't really understand it.
Good job, none of your colleagues listen to this podcast and hear their ideas being slurred.
Well, they heard me doing it in real time, being like, and I was trying to explain to them the kind of thing. It's a very annoying habit I've got. It's like I ask for help and then I'm just not interested in any of the answers.
I'm not very good at masking that.
Yeah, that's tough. It's almost such a good editor though, is the way you make staff feel bad inside. That's always been your strength as a boss, I would say.
It's not one of my management strengths, it's like pretending I've heard a good idea.
That's funny. I just know how you do it, you go sort of go, yeah, you sort of do that sort of thing.
That is literally the impression people do of me at work, of like, oh, here he goes. Or I'll be like, hmm. I'll just say hum and hopefully, you know, people will know not to pursue it.
The funny thing is with us, because I sort of tend to just fire ideas at you sometimes with the sort of energy of Alan Partridge, whose little recorder, really, except the little recorder is you on Discord. So I just fire those at you and I can't hear you going, hmm, so I have no idea how you feel about them, but then they go into a podcast schedule and then they're happening. So who knows how you feel about being dragged along for the ride.
If there are any that I didn't like, you know, I'd be like, well, not that.
Yeah, you're like, why Destiny is good, part two, no, that's, you veto that one. So last question before we get into predictions, Matthew, is there anything more broadly you want to say about this coming year? Like sort of like wider thoughts about the year ahead.
Have you been looking at the list of games? You've been getting excited about it. How are you feeling about it more generally?
Yeah, I am excited about it. I think there's enough weird bullshit that speaks to me. I don't really know what the the mega mainstream AAA hits of the year are going to be.
It's quite hard to see that, but if you're into sort of weeb shit, you know, you've got like quite a lot of persona or persona adjacent stuff, you know, you've got like a dragon infinite wealth, that's going to be massive. There's, you know, I mean, for heaven sakes, we're getting another code, switch port, you know, that's absolutely bizarre and so up my street. So yeah, I think it's a pretty exciting year for the kind of people who would listen to this podcast, I think.
Yeah, I think so. I was considering doing a persona episode, but I don't know anyone who's like a bang on massive expert for it. So I did want to have someone on to talk about it, because obviously three remakes out very, very soon.
But yeah, there's lots of people who are like big persona, four and five heads.
Well, that's the thing is like each game is kind of its own meta series, really, isn't it? So they've got their own universe and rules and things like that. I am excited about three remake, especially because it's just on Game Pass and you can pre-install it now.
And I'm like, yeah, I was quite dismayed, though, to learn that Infinite Wealth is not a Game Pass game. I think I just assumed it was because it was in the Xbox conference last year, but it's not. So I have to pay cash monies for that one.
Cash money.
That and FF7 as well. You got like a real, like you say, a big bank of weeb stuff. So it really is like the first two months or three months of the year, just off the hook, really.
There's lots to get excited about. Like you say, though, I think it's the wider shape of the year is a lot harder to sort of perceive from here because there's, you know, I would say like on the Microsoft side, Hellblade 2 kind of feels like the you'd expect to see at this year, you know? I don't know if they said when it's actually coming out, but like that's that, you know, it's been in the works for a little for a while.
And so it was a trailer at the Xbox conference last year. So you'd expect that.
Yeah, maybe a Forza Horizon. That is a prediction. But like, like based on the cadence of those games, you'd expect there to be that.
Yeah, it's been like, what, three years since the last one. Yeah, that's about right. You know, so yeah, Fable is going to be further off probably.
But yeah, yeah, they didn't say 2024 for that.
And then there's obviously going to be a big Nintendo something this year. So maybe we'll get into that when we discuss our predictions Matthew. So yes, okay.
So yeah, I'm looking forward to the year. Also, I will say the start of the year, I don't mind not having what we've got is probably still too many games for me to actually play what's coming out. And so especially because I'm still catching up from last year.
I don't know everyone is but I'm just like, if I haven't touched Bowls Gate, do I have any business starting Persona 3 remake? That's these are the questions I will ask myself this year. And I'm sure many people do the same.
So yes, Matthew, should we take a quick break and come back with our predictions?
Let's do it.
I'm starting to get hearing because I've been eating a big cheeseburger.
Oh, it's good.
Yeah. Jolly enough. All right.
Welcome back to the podcast. So 12 predictions each, one from, sorry, let me start again.
You're about to explain the concept of each.
Yeah, I was.
It sounded like you were about to go, one from each of us.
Fuck's sake, I still forgot how to podcast. That first hour of the game of the year was all right when I listened back to it, but there's still like a few moments where I'm like, do I know what words are there? That doesn't quite sound right, but okay, I'll start that again.
Welcome back to the podcast. So 12 predictions each then. So let's kick off, Matthew, with one of mine.
Can we go first with me?
Yeah, let's go with you first.
Yeah. So we're allowed to roll over up to three predictions from last year. I've rolled over one.
So this first one is one of mine from last year. So a bit of reheated content there, getting the KFC bucket out the fridge on Boxing Day and giving that a bit of a reheat. Sorry, that's a very specific memory of a Christmas from two years ago when we had to-
Yeah, that's it. That's just the bad COVID Christmas haunts me still. I don't need to go into that again.
Okay. So this is the thing I think must happen after FF7 Rebirth comes out, right? A Nier Automata sequel was revealed this year, and it's the best game Platinum has made since Vanquish.
So I said this last year, the Vanquish bit is just a bit of spice on top, a cheeky little bit of oregano, like don't overthink it, I would say. But Nier Automata, it was a 2017 game, and we are seven years hence. There has been that near the original remake, obviously a few years ago, but that wasn't Platinum.
You would expect that the big sequel to this six million plus copies selling game has to be in the works, it has to exist, and this would feel like the right time for it. But then I said that last year, Matthew, and I was wrong. So what do you think?
Do you think there is actually a Nier Automata sequel? Does this not exist? Are they just not making these games anymore?
Based on the numbers, you'd think it would make sense. And it does just feel like maybe where it sort of sits amongst other games, I think you're saying after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, that makes sense. Yeah, it's kind of hard.
It feels like there's a lot to be gleaned about Platinum out there. You know, they're sort of quite open in terms of interviews, as far as, you know, these slightly boutique Japanese studios go. And Kamiya leaving, you know, he's talked a lot about it.
And, you know, the vibe from him seems to be, you know, this isn't necessarily the kind of cutting edge place that it was originally, or that I kind of hoped it would be. And, you know, the kind of work we're doing doesn't really interest me. And perhaps that kind of work is, you know, sequel work on something established.
So why not? It feels that that feels feels good to me. I mean, I think I've predicted in the past, you know, didn't come to anything, but you know, there's this still apparently something coming from Mr. Astral Chain at some point, whether that's like Astral Chain 2 or whatever for Switch.
I don't know. But thinking, you know, I probably think about Platinum more than I think about most Japanese studios. So I hope that they're doing at least something that's rewarding for them.
Yeah, it's funny because there was a rumor during the rounds over the weekend that one of the things being prepped for Nintendo Switch 2, whatever the successor is called, was a Bayonetta trilogy sort of like package where they've added HDR and given it a bit of a shot in the arm. I think Bayonetta 3 could do with a little bit of that, to be honest, just a little bit of a facelift. So I think that was during the rounds.
Rumors do tend to come out of Platinum, like you say, more than they do other Japanese studios where there seems to be a little bit of grounding in them. So I do agree. It's been a little while now since they've had a big signature game.
So, yeah, I think Nier probably makes sense. I mean, yeah, it's Astral Chain. Astral Chain is a possibility, though.
That could be an, again, like an early Switch 2 thing that they'd be saving, you know, to hold them back for that. But I don't know.
I mean, they made Astral Chain sort of, in my mind, how I remember it, was sort of alongside Nier Automata anyway. Maybe that's not quite right, but, you know, they're a multiple project studio. They're not just, you know, one game at a time, so, you know, there's no reason it couldn't be.
Yeah, I think they're a couple of years apart, so that's, you know, not a massive amount of time, but yeah, it's, yeah, okay.
Maybe they've lost that guy's papi-amache head. They're like, we just can't announce it, because we can't find his fricking mean head. It's in storage somewhere.
That's funny. So, I know, actually, when I was in Tokyo, I missed by one...
Did you stop wearing a papi-amache head?
No, but I missed by one day. There was like... It was going to be Kamiya and Mikami on stage together, having a discussion.
I mean, I couldn't have understood it anyway if I'd have gone, but one day out... It was like the Saturday I flew back. I think they were doing it then.
And I believe that the Archipel Channel will have that as a video at some point. But that would have been an amazing thing to behold in person, wouldn't it? These two masters having a discussion.
So, yes, who knows?
You should have stayed out an extra day, gone to it, and then you found yourself stuck sitting behind the Papier-Maché head so you just couldn't see any of it. You were like, oh, fucking down with the giant head already, man.
What's funny is, right, I feel like I'm trying to move on from the Papier-Maché bit and you're like, oh, no, no, I'll keep forcing it back in. And then it's going to come up in every single prediction now or something.
No, no, that's it. I've done all my Papier-Maché moon head material.
You're like, oh, I've bought a Nintendo Switch 2, but it's come with a Papier-Maché head. If you did that for every single prediction, I would be quite impressed. And then worn down.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can make that work.
Fair enough. Let's go to your first prediction then.
My first prediction is a very boring, you know, let's just say Switch 2 will launch with the same form factor as the Switch. I don't think they're going to do anything too out there, too experimental. I know that, you know, direct sequels like that don't tend to happen.
Probably the closest thing you have is, you know, 3DS to DS, which is probably as in 3DS to the DS, not 2DS, which is we have this massive DS platform, probably the thing most comparable to the success of the Switch. And we don't want to kind of rock the boat too much. Let's keep the kind of form factor that people understand, but with a bit more heft, a bit more power.
I don't think they're going to add a glasses free 3D screens or anything dumb like that. As part of this prediction, I'll carry over my Kid Icarus Uprising Switch port gets announced as part of Switch 2 rather than original Switch. I still think Sakurai kind of winking at the idea of it on his YouTube channel was just too much for it not to be a real thing.
I also predict at launch that will be Mario Kart 8 Extra Deluxe with all the DLC from the last two years included.
Oh, that's a good one.
I thought you were going to do the Mario Kart. How many times have people heard that fucking tune on the menu screen?
Yeah, that's not what I was going for. I was going for Kid Icarus, but we had already moved on to Mario Kart, so there's a little bit of a nowhere, to be honest. Surely, we must be at the point where we can have a Mario Kart 9.
Are we not allowed that at this point? I really think the DLC they've done for Mario Kart 8 is fantastic. It really adds a lot of value and it's been great to come and discover.
It is another Mario Kart, isn't it? It's a whole Mario Kart game of campaign.
Yeah, the campaign. Story mode.
I'm sorry, Matthew. What do you call it in a fucking Mario Kart? You know, the thing that you do, the career.
It's another career in Mario Kart.
Yoshi's Racing Career. I'm alright. Sorry, somebody's joking.
I feel like I've caused a real upset there.
I don't know what you're... Just let it go.
Okay, I will. It's fine.
I promise to move on from Papi and Ash Ahead. If you promise to move on from the campaign. And that's how I crowbar Papi and Ash Ahead into this entry.
Fantastic. So this is actually my fifth prediction as well. Nintendo Switch 2 is unveiled this June.
Alongside 3D Mario, that's my guess. And one of the things they will show off with it is Tears of the Kingdom running at 60 FPS. I think they'll do some kind of like premium upgrade thing.
You can give your games maybe like a paid upgrade for your existing games to make them run a bit in a shinier way. I doubt that would be an out of the box thing they would do. Maybe I'd be wrong, but that's a big question, Mark.
Yeah, maybe it could be a feature that they package in with their continued Switch Online subscription. Because they've had quite good form of like, here's this quite transformative DLC that you probably need. And it's a part of this online subscription, or you can have it separately.
Maybe they'll continue doing that.
Oh, good. Because I want the Castle family plan for the Switch Online, I'll get 60 FPS Fire Emblem.
If this is real. How they should announce the Switch 2, is just with the Zelda Tears of the Kingdom trailer that I love, but just at 60 frames, but with that same mad fucking saxophone music.
Yeah, and a papier-mâché head at the end somewhere. Alright then, let's move on to my second prediction, shall we?
He does wear masks.
Uh, yeah, you know, like the sort of like, if he wore the sort of like, the big moon, was it the Majora's Mask thing, the sky? Yeah, like that's all.
There's that weird, there's the weird guy who I want to call Nelson, but that isn't his name. The guy's collecting, he's like the freak who like lives in the little monster hut, and he's the guy you give the little star shines to that you get in the caves. He gives you all the monster disguises, but I don't think they're Pappé and Mache, I think they're knitted.
He gives you like the knitted Bokoblin head and the Lionel mask. They've got a DIY Vitam. What's his name?
It's not Nelson. He's like, Neil...
Alright, you play this game way more than me, so you've got a better insight.
Yeah, I just wish I could remember what his name is. He's green and he's got quite big teeth.
Okay, well look, if we figure out who that is, then we'll have it, isn't it?
Okay, smoke volumes. I don't want to talk about this any more.
We've been surprisingly feisty on this episode, you and I. We're a bit more tension than I'm used to.
I'm sorry, I've got to look it up.
No, it's fine, go ahead.
Zelda Hot. No, not Zelda Hot, you idiot.
How about Cheeky Swig? I'm a Monster Energy drink. White flavor for anyone at home who's wondering what flavor that is.
Kilton. What did I say? Nelson.
Nelson. You say Milton, he's called.
Kilton.
Oh, Hilton, okay.
Kilton.
Oh, Kilton, sorry, I was missing that first syllable there.
Anyway, that might be in the worst minute of this podcast.
Who knows, we won't be able to top it before the end of this episode. Some of these predictions are quite dubious, Matthew.
Me Googling Kilton from Zelda while you drank a Monster Energy drink.
Don't worry, I'll slow it down to like 10 seconds for the listeners so they don't have to suffer through the painful silence. Okay. All right, then, so we move on to my second prediction, bloody hell.
So Matthew's beloved and languid Hotel Dusk and Last Window will have a remaster announced later this year, similar in vein to the Another Code remasters releasing on Switch this year. So it feels to me like...
That's one of my predictions.
Oh, yeah, is it? Well, that makes sense. I thought it would be somehow.
I can take a couple that Matthew might also take. I won't step on his Level 5 one, which is inevitable. Although I haven't got a Level 5 one.
Oh, thank you. Oh, one of mine was going to be... This is the year of the big Level 5 resurgence, but I guess we kind of know it's happening because Deka Police and later in the works.
So, yeah, this makes sense, doesn't it? Because those Another Code remasters are looking quite nice. They don't look like they're too expensive as projects go.
My guess is that Hotel Dusk was a bigger hit than Another Code was, so it would make sense if they did this pair and then moved on to Hotel Dusk and Last Windows. So, Matthew, how are you feeling about this as a kind of prospect for Nintendo Switch?
Yeah, I mean, I literally wrote in my production, if Another Code can happen, this definitely can happen. You know, it seems wild to me. And the only thing that may have factored into their thinking is because Another Code R, the Wii one, didn't get released in the US.
You know, some of the thinking might be, well, let's take a punt on it. You know, we don't know for sure that it won't work. But then Last Window didn't get released in the US either, I don't think.
Right.
I'm going to have to check that up because, you know, you know me, I'm only interested in what happens in Britain.
No, you are right. It was never released in the US, which is interesting, isn't it?
So, you know, you have both this and Another Code, exactly the same thing. An entry in the US, an entry not in the US. I mean, Hotel Dust and Last Window are infinitely better games than the Another Code pairing.
So it would be mad if they didn't. But, you know, I guess we'll wait and see. Maybe like Another Code R is easier to port because it's already kind of console feeling in that it's a Wii game.
But they only have to do the lift on the DS game, which is quite short. There's not a huge amount to it. I actually haven't played the demo of that yet on the Switch.
Which is a failing.
Well, I can sort of like, I can already hear in my head the Nintendo Direct guy going, you are Kyle Hyde, an ex-cop turned salesman. I can already hear that in my head.
Kyle Hyde is rubbing shoulders with the crazy residents of Hotel Dust.
Yeah, so that's sort of like, that feels right to me and I agree with you. I mean, I gave another code a go for I think the DS draft and it just found it a little bit of a tough hang. Like it's just, I think that there's just something about the kind of like noirish theme and the presentation of Hotel Dust that goes down a little smoother.
And another code is one of those sort of like, a certain type of Nintendo fan is obsessed with it. And I'm like, okay, that's fine. You can, you know, you have your fun.
This is not my sort of thing, but that's okay. Yeah. Okay, cool.
So we both have that one. Maybe we'll have the same predictions down the line and this will be done in five minutes now. So what's your second prediction, Matthew?
My second prediction is Nintendo will celebrate 20 years of DS by adding DS games to the Switch Virtual Console.
How's this going to work then?
Well, in the same way that DS games were on Wii U, they basically only put the ones which were fully touch controlled and you could play them entirely on the gamepad with a finger. You know, you could do that on the touchscreen of a Switch. They may do that as a Switch handheld only mode.
Hmm, interesting.
That's my proposal.
Okay, I look forward to you going in front of Doug Bowser and presenting that. That should be good.
Yeah, I mean, it does limit you to, you know, small selection of games. Actually, that's not true. There were some ones which weren't just touch controls, but there were definitely many of them, if not all of them, you could play on, touch it on, thus the gamepad.
So lots of things like a power paintbrush and that Kirby game where you've got all the Pitman Kirby's mass attack. Is that what it's called?
Oh, right. Yeah.
Yeah. Brain training, that kind of stuff. Just something to acknowledge 20 years of DS.
Yeah, I agree. This is something that needs to be excavated. In some ways, I wondered if them doing another code was them gesturing towards, we're going to try and get some of these games off of DS now and onto modern platforms just to try and salvage them.
So, you know, but then doing that for giving that same treatment to all those DS games seems implausible, doesn't it? And whereas like a software based solution would, you know, or like an emulation based solution would probably make more sense. So, yeah, OK, interesting.
I think I could see that's happening.
Rubrabbit's port when?
Excellent. I'll look forward to that. Would that mean that you'd have a Wendel on there?
Would that be all right?
I can't remember if that was on the Virtual Console on Wii U, but, you know, the things you get in Virtual Console tend to be the things you got before in Virtual Console. So whatever that line up is, it would probably be that.
Okay, interesting. Probably you have to relicense the music, so that would be a no-go dog. Okay.
All right. We'll come to my third prediction then. This is a discourse prediction.
People will bang on all year about how this year is a quiet year for games in 2023, and by the end of 2024, we'll all be sick of talking about it. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, that's probably true. Though again, if you look at the number of massive things announced for this year, there's no reason it can't be as busy and exciting as last year, but it's hard to see what the tears of the kingdom or Baldur's Gate 3 is going to be this year.
Yeah, that is harder to figure out. Those things were all in the works for a while. We actually got to this point of the year, I was listening back to predictions, and we knew that Final Fantasy was coming out in June.
I think we knew that Diablo was coming out then too. Whereas now, you kind of know what's coming out up until spring, and then it basically becomes a big question mark after that, doesn't it? So yeah, I do agree, it's hard to figure out what that would be.
But yes, I think there will be a bit of that. But I agree, I think that if there is a Nintendo console launch this year, then that will inevitably make the year feel quite massive. So yes, what's your next prediction Matthew?
I think the 3D Mario team might be working on a 3D Donkey Kong game.
Okay, interesting.
This is purely based on how prominent Donkey Kong is in mainstream Nintendo. Like how big his role was in the film, and the fact that there's a big Donkey Kong theme park extension at Universal Studios. The thing that struck me when I watched the Mario movie was they spend a lot of time in Kong World or whatever they call it.
And it wasn't pulled from anything I recognised. Like it wasn't, you know, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat or Donkey Kong Country or anything like that. But it seemed quite fully realised as a society and setting.
To the point where I thought I wouldn't be surprised if this was a thing which existed in some other form, which they were able to pull from, you know? This feels too thought out and complete to just be a random thing. They pulled out their ass for a film in a theme park.
Right. So you think it's another of those complete Switch games that sat in a drawer somewhere?
Yeah, and there have been rumours in the past about someone working on a Donkey Kong platform. Not necessarily like a sequel to Donkey Kong 64, the rare thing. But, you know, that Donkey Kong, weirdly, without having a huge game series of his own, is as iconic or key an icon.
He is as key an icon as, you know, a Mario, Zelda, Peach, you know, the big names. So maybe it would make sense. Why not take a punt and try and give Donkey Kong something to do?
Yeah, that was a genuine thought when I came out the film. I remember turning to Catherine and saying, you know, given how much that game pulled from games for like every inch of the Mushroom Kingdom, it was really fucking odd. Like how many other Kong family members there were and like their village and temple.
There was something off about it. It was something like, that feels a little bit too good to me.
Was Frankie Kong in that movie, Matthew?
Lots of Kongs were in it. Cranky Kong was, like an old Kong was.
Diddy Kong, I'm assuming.
There was an old Kong. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's absolute, you know, well, all of these are just pulling out my ass.
But, you know, that's the kind of thing I would have bollocksed on about in NGamer.
Well, I suppose the other thing that I kind of think about is that, when they did Kirby in The Forgotten Land, that felt like an elevation of Kirby a little bit, like, let's do something. Let's do a big signature game with this character who's not, like, been sort of, like, waiting in the wings or anything, but where maybe you just take it to that next level when it seems more exciting, it becomes a bigger deal. And maybe it's been a little while now since it's been a Donkey Kong something like that.
Yeah, I suppose the only thing I'd say to pour a bit of cold water on that is the film thing might be because they're thinking about film spin-offs rather than, like, game spin-offs, you know?
The design of it may also just be, well, we're going to build a theme, you know, our next theme park is going to be Donkey Kong themed. I just think that that's a little odd, you know, that they've had this huge Mario Kingdom and I wouldn't then go, the next thing you'd do, if you were to build another Nintendo theme park, would I go all in on Donkey Kong? Probably not.
But they have. And there's, I don't know, maybe they're just trying, maybe they're just laying the foundation for Donkey Kong being a bigger presence going forward.
Okay, interesting. I quite like that one. Okay, cool.
That's probably my best, most thought out prediction.
So you're setting the bar low for the rest of them, basically?
Yes.
Okay, so my fourth prediction is Death Stranding 2 is the big Sony exclusive game for the year, along with a full sequel to Astro's Playroom. But Ghost of Tsushima 2 is also announced this year. This is based on nothing at all, pulling this out of my ass.
But Death Stranding 2 is something we know exists. I think it kind of makes sense that they would, that consumer productions would get this out the door before they switch focus to that, the thing they announced last year, which I can't remember the name of.
Is it BD?
It was the thing that's got Hunter Schafer and Sofia Linus.
Yeah, Jordan Peele's...
Yeah, that's it. So whatever that is. You said Jeremy Peele there.
Like I say, I think that Death Stranding 2 in theory, I mean, it's a big project, but they have also... I think it's been five years this year since the original came out, so this would seem to be a big sequel they can do. I still find the idea that this game would have a sequel to be quite interesting.
It seemed like quite a singular... It reminded me, it's a bit like Ueda's games on PlayStation, where you're like, oh, I guess this is just a kind of like funky, sort of like weird one-off that gets a lot of attention, then you kind of respond to something else. But the fact there is a sequel is quite interesting.
We don't see much of it, but I could see this being a thing this year.
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty conclusive as stories go, the first one as well, which is strange, but yeah, I mean, that makes sense. I must admit, one of my other predictions was, we get a full Astro Bot game, so the sequel to Astro's Playroom. So I think we're both thinking along similar lines there.
Yeah, which I would be, you know, that's probably the thing I'd be most excited for if Sony did announce, just in terms of, I thought Astro's Playroom, you know, while quite a small little thing was beautifully made and constructed, about as, you know, good, you know, high polished and non Nintendo 3D platformers as there's been in the last 10 years.
Yeah, absolutely amazing pack-in. And like, yeah, just a full game with that level of imagination would be very welcome. It would also be cool to just have a game like that on a Sony platform that doesn't have, there's necessarily a Sackboy related game, you know, or Ratchet and Clank's a little bit different.
So, yeah, I think that that kind of makes sense. So, yes, I'm glad we're united on that one, Matthew. You want to think about Ghost Tsushima 2.
That game, that original game is four years old this year. So, you know, you would expect that, you know, they're probably making a sequel to it was a big success. Any thoughts on that one?
It's been quite locked down, given how kind of leaky a lot of things have been. No one's really heard anything from Sucker Punch. You would think based on the model of how things work and when you have a successful game, Sony tend to make a sequel to it, that this would be a thing that would happen.
Yeah, so yes, we'll see how that goes. So Matthew, what's your next prediction?
My next prediction is something we've sort of talked about or theorised about before, which is a Resident Evil 1 and Zero remake revealed, as in a game which brings together those two experiences. I don't know if Resident Evil 1 is maybe substantial enough for a story and a game to do a Resident Evil 2 style redo of, but I think if you mash together parts of 1 and Zero, a bit like they did in Umbrella Chronicles, that would make sense. Yeah, basically, I still think this seems more likely to me a continuation of their remake path than Five.
That's mainly because I just can't see what they do with Five. Maybe we disagree on this. But, you know, one of the most iconic locations ever already has a beautiful remake, yes, but I could just see the excitement of being in that house and seeing it up close with that kind of more free camera.
An announcement trailer which all you need is shots of rooms from that house and that zombie head turn and then people go nuts. You know, I could just see that. I can almost see the promotional campaign for it better than the game itself.
A bit of a Moonlight Sonata as well, like on the...
You know, you could see that at the end of a Game Awards or something. Kind of like, we've got one more thing for you. And then you see like, yeah, Moonlight Sonata, extreme close-ups of like photorealistic plates on that dining room table, like lightning or rain against the window, you know.
Very close-up shots, you can't quite see what the house is. And then you have that zombie head and everyone's like, fucking Resident Evil!
Yeah, I think that... So I think that's quite likely. Whether that happened this year or not, I'm not sure.
Like, one of the rumours was Code Veronica was next, which... I think the only source for that was like 4chan or something. But I think that...
I think what we have learned from the success of these games is that they could just do all of them. And people would buy all of them. People are just up for this.
You know, they just... Resident Evil's cache is extremely high. And people worship those old games.
But they are cumbersome to go back to. For most people. And for new players especially.
So I think that just giving people those new ways in is okay. I mean, it's not like they're cashing in. You know, this is like a 22-year-old remake at this point.
The GameCube one. So, yeah, I think that's okay.
And this is definitely the most iconic one left to remake. Like anything else is kind of interesting and cool. But it's, you know, based off a game which is like less loved or less well known.
Maybe they don't want to follow up four, which is another just like knockout punch. Like, well, you're obviously going to dig this. You know, maybe you put some lesser games between four and one so that you can kind of, you know, you can almost bank one for like instant fan appreciation.
Yeah. So you don't need to blow it, you know. That is already riding high because of four.
Yeah, Code Veronica is pretty cool. I played it last year for that moments episode we did. And I did really like it, but it's quite, I think it's hard to picture in my mind's eye how, how that's translated.
And I like just because the teaser trailer at the Game Awards, what one image gets you to go, oh, shit, it's Code Veronica.
Oh, gosh, what is that? Do I even like this like a boss fight in the fog, which is pretty cool. But I feel like it may probably be like Chris fighting Wesker in.
It's like a bit where like Wesker's running up walls and like Matrix style and Chris is trying to shoot him. That's pretty good. But there's a lot more of that in five, I guess.
So that's kind of like, yeah, I don't know, I don't know. Maybe I didn't get far enough into Code Rolika to identify that. But I think that's what I picked up on in the episode is that because it was a Dreamcast game and then it was a PS2 game, I think it's like technically one of the worst selling Resident Evil's and therefore it probably has the least cultural cache because of that.
So you can't picture in your mind's eyes readily. Whereas obviously like Resi 3, everyone was kind of like pretty much, oh yeah, Nemesis, all that stuff. So yeah, I don't know if Code Rolika has that because it's maybe a bit more splintered in terms of the audience.
But I don't know, they could prove me wrong. Also, the other thing was, I made this point too, but it was the ways they use the new gen, sort of like real time lighting and stuff that makes that game kind of special. And certainly the first chunk of the game, if you remove that, it's just a behind the shoulder sort of thing.
I don't know if it's mega distinctive, as Rezzy's go. It might just be a bit more, it might feel like more of the same, unless you do something radical with it. So the other thing is, I think they could go the FF7 route with V, and that's, I think we hinted at this before when we discussed V.
But V's ending, I think, does change a couple of things. Like, I think it sort of suggests that, maybe I was right, I can't remember exactly what happened here, but you have to play separate ways as well, because that's got some Wesker stuff in it. But it's sort of like, I got the impression that they were teeing up the events of V, but in a way where it was not going to be exactly the same.
So I could see them do some kind of like V, but then it's got like a, maybe like a weird symbol in the title or something, and then it's like a new take on V, because they don't want to do the slightly problematic version of V. Yeah, and then they can avoid going into VI as well, because no one's dying to, I don't think anyone's dying for those games to be remade as is, just because they are, you can play them now and they're still pretty, they still feel pretty contemporary. They certainly look pretty contemporary, because they're such nice looking games at the time, so yeah.
Yeah, definitely something with Resi this year. Capcom's big thing at the moment is Dragon Stock, too, isn't it? Which, that looks really fucking great, actually, like all the footage I've seen of it.
It looks pretty special. Maybe we should do an episode about that this year, Matthew, that might be cool. Play the first one a little bit.
Okay, good prediction. I like that one. So, my next one.
Let's think. I already did the Nintendo Switch 2 one. Oh, that's it.
360 backwards compatibility briefly returns as the Transformers games Wolfenstein 2009 and cult favorite Singularity return on Xbox Series X and S. So, I think it was Xbox's Sarah Bond who just tweeted out the 360 logo at the end of last year. And so, it was a bit of maybe a bit of a tease of stuff to come.
It makes sense with the Activision deal closing that something like this could come along.
Maybe she just had it on her phone as a recent image and she butt-posted it. I am only ever a butt accident away from posting the picture of Guy from Borgon on Twitter.
Just now your profile picture on Discord I noted.
Yeah, so there's a bit of that going on. Maybe this is her Borgon man.
Well, I've got no idea about this, but I think this came up because Hasbro were asked about the Transformers games that were quite well regarded on 360 there. I think it was Fall of Cybertron and War for Cybertron. I think those two were the ones that people liked.
I don't know if The Bourne Conspiracy will come back. I'm not sure about that one. Either way, it would be cool to see some more 360 games on Xbox.
Any thoughts on that one, Matthew?
Yeah, I'm into that. You'd hope that them having this library would give them some new avenues to pursue. It leads nicely into one of my later predictions, which I can do now, which was rather boringly every Xbox Call of Duty is re-released on Game Pass, bringing a huge re-evaluation of Infinite Warfare and lots of work for Jeremy Peel.
Yep, I like that one. I did ponder similar ones. They're all pretty much available to actually play backwards compatible, but just not on Game Pass.
Yeah, I just think for them to go like, you have all of Call of Duty now, here it is. That's obvious. That feels like a, that would have been a classic E3 conference beat.
And now it'll just be whatever they do. Is it, is theirs, I can't remember if theirs is just sort of Phil Spencer standing in a void or if he's still doing them from his office at home. Those kind of COVID sort of reworkings, but it'll be more like that.
Yeah, so that will be a good day though when all that Activision stuff hits game parts. Like it's, you know, Sekiro will presumably be in that bunch. That's, you know, more people playing that is no bad thing.
War 3?
Was that Activision?
It was. I wonder if that will get excavated. I really like it if that was, because it would be quite fun.
It'd be quite fun to just see some of those, because they did quite a lot of Marvel games, Activision, didn't they? So you got like Deadpool and Ultimate Alliance and things like that. So it could be some fun oddities.
They could do a remake and call it Wolverine Excavated Edition with a big X.
Now you're getting bonus predictions. And there'd be a big Papier-Maché Wolverine head on the cover, Matthew. OK, so what's your next prediction?
My next prediction is... Well, it's actually quite similar to that last one. Xbox will revive Tony Hawk Pro Skater with a 3 and 4 remake.
Oh, that would be so good. I'd love that.
Yeah, just 1 and 2 did such a good job. You know, everyone loved it. Critically acclaimed.
But obviously, you know, that's a studio that could be put to better use. Making a thousand gun skins or whatever for Warzone, so no Tony Orks from them. But you know, the Xbox have been a bit better at this kind of stuff.
And you know, considering some of the random shit that they have bought back in the past, like fricking Voodoo Vince.
You know, Phil Spence, I think, understands the power of sometimes doing one just for the fans. And the kind of good will it buys you, you know.
I think that will be where the sea change happens, is my guess, is they get StarCraft III off the ground, and just these things that have maybe been gestating that people really like the idea of. I think he's big on wearing a Hexen shirt, isn't he? So maybe you'll see a bunch of old Activision FPS games.
What if your guys at Soldier of Fortune 2, Raven, get that back on Game Pass, Matthew? That would be phenomenal. A bit of a re-evaluation of a problematic phase.
There are some games from there that I don't think can come back.
So yeah, I think that's a good shout. Tony Hawk Remaster is so, so good. Oh, it's a full remake, isn't it?
It really does sort of scratch the same itch, and you realise that it's got the same tail in terms of the appeal that it used to have. It didn't feel like a novel blast in the past. It was like a blast in the past of like, oh no, remember this game type, it's really, really good, and they did such a good job with it.
So yeah, I'd like to see that, that'd be cool. So okay, Matthew, I like that suggestion.
The cursed alternative is loads more Crash Bandicoot.
Yeah, toys for Bob. What are toys for Bob doing? That's what Reddit's always discussing.
Oh, they're probably like, please let us make more Crash Bandicoot, you know, a labour of love for us, rather than, you know, make us design more Jeeps for Warzone. They're like, less fun, more Jeeps! Get back to the jeep mines, you motherfuckers!
A very nuanced take there on the game.
You wouldn't get that from Dean Takahashi on Venture Beat.
Okay, good. With that in mind, let's move on to my next prediction. Those long-delayed ports of Twilight Princess HD and Wind Waker HD finally come to Switch as a platform near the end of its life.
I think we're getting into that last stretch. Let's get a bunch of old stuff onto the platform, stuff going on. Thousand Year Door feels a bit like this, Matthew, where it's like, what will still get people excited and buying games in 2023 while obviously not necessarily being the heavy hitters that people are waiting for?
And let's face it, these games are done on Wii U. They are just waiting to be put on Switch. It's as simple as that, really.
Thoughts on this, Matthew?
I was laughing at my Dean Takahashi joke and I missed the very first bit of this production.
Okay, great.
Was it the Zelda games?
Yes, those long delayed ports. How loudly were you laughing at your own joke during that? You cut out my audio.
That's amazing.
Sorry, I just missed the word. That's all. I was like, is this Xenoblade X?
I was just reverse engineering what it could be.
No, it's Twilight Princess HD and Windweck HD.
Oh yeah, I mean, long thought to be finished. Just release them. Just release them already.
Let us all get excited for two days. Give them stupid scores on Metacritic. And then move on.
Cheeky 95, 96. Cheeky 95, 96.
From the dweebs.
I like the idea of you calling other Nintendo fans dweebs. That's like very rich. But yes, okay, good.
It seems like we're agreed on that one. That just has to happen at some point. It's weird that they would only remaster Skyward Sword in this generation.
That would be quite odd, wouldn't it? To just do that one and then no others.
I love seeing now the narrative's changing to anything less expected that hasn't happened. People are like, they're holding this back for Switch 2. I just don't know what you would gain from it.
We kind of know what those things are going to be. I think they would run on Switch fine.
Yeah, they ran on Wii U fine. That's the thing.
Just do it.
Such a lovely looking thing, Wind Waker HD. People just deserve to have that in their hands at some point, I think. Okay, so what's your next prediction, Matthew?
I believe a game from Tetsuo Takahashi's past, so that's Mr. Xenoblade, is revived. A bit vague, whether this is Xena Gears from Square Enix, which is one of their cherished RPGs, which just hasn't been touched or anything has been done with basically since the original version, and given their just incredible appetite for remakes over at Square Enix, that seems odd to me. Less likely is he takes another swing at one of his great sort of like unfinished sort of opuses, opi?
One of his other projects. Xena Saga, I mean this is based, this is tenuous as shit, but at the end of the future redeemed, the Xenoblade 3 DLC, there are some quite hefty nods to like the wider Xeno universe.
Right.
And the idea that Xenoblade exists as part of, as part of this world which also splinters off to become Xena Saga and Xena Gears. And I don't think Nintendo could, you know, my dream, the best thing would be they redo Xena Gears. He does it with Nintendo, but I don't know why a PlayStation thing would become a Nintendo thing.
I can't quite sort of see the root to that. But some of these other things, maybe. I just feel like that's a really competent studio.
And there's clearly like a fondness for his past work. There's a love for some of it from the fans. There's still like a nostalgia or an interest in it from him himself.
This is probably quite unlikely because why would you redo something which is already kind of proven to not really be of much interest to people? Like, you know, XENO Saga is a proven, is a provably niche thing. But I don't know.
I just I feel like his past work, his past work should be renewed or reevaluated in a way.
Yeah, I think that I think the most likely outcome of this is XENO GEARS redone in that Chrono Cross, Tactics Saga, sort of like, you know, FFA, FF9, sort of like Redos for Switch and other formats we've seen in recent years. Because like, you know, they have been they have been seemingly tackling like that sort of PS1 generation of games a little bit more. I think like one that was in the leak by NVIDIA that hasn't come to pass yet is FF Tactics.
So I think that might happen first, like that one. But they've I think they could they would get to this. They still make as many as much Scranix does.
So it would suggest it's got a bit of a long tail in terms of its cult appeal. So I could see that being the one. The reason I think it's going to be Xenosaga is because I think that's a is that a Konami game?
Or is it Namco?
Namco Bandai?
OK, well, OK, yeah. If it's Namco, that is actually like they've done like bad and Kaito, haven't they? So you would think that that's actually like reasonably plausible.
So, yeah, OK, yeah, I think that's probably quite likely.
I was just trying to think of something to talk about.
Let's just move on there before we go any further with that one. So my one is, again, pulled out of my ass. The creators of FTL and Into the Breach subset games unveil a new game and it becomes an immediate Game of the Year contender.
So we must be getting close to when they'd be revealing their new thing. I think it was 2018, Into the Breach. So, you know, like a good six years ago.
They have done an advanced edition of it, obviously, that you can play on all formats. But I can't see that being the only thing they've done in that time. I expect they've got something else.
I think they are quite big on taking their time and making sure they make something good. It's functionally a two-person studio, I think. But this is, again, just a complete shot in the dark, but feels like about time to me.
I think it's about...
I thought you were going to guess what the game was going to be about there. That would be the wildest prediction ever.
So there's six years between FTL and Into the Breach, and it's six years between Into the Breach and Now, which is what makes me think this might happen. So, yeah, that's my punt, Matthew. But when we talk about these kind of, I guess, blockbuster indie devs, the people who make these games that are always mega successful, they're the ones who I'm probably...
I'm always the most excited about just to see what they've been doing because they're interested in genres and I'm interested in strategy and tactics and with lovely pixel art and great music, they are very dependable. I just love to see what they're working on. So, any thoughts on that one?
I also want to play whatever that team comes up with next. Yes, please.
Yeah, I think maybe because I've been playing a bit of the old Cobalt core, maybe this has just put this developer back in my brain because obviously there was a hefty amount of FTL in that game's structure. So, yes. What's your next one, Matthew?
My next one is... You can sort of see my mental through line with a lot of these, how one has inspired the next one. Thinking about Zenegis and Square Enix, maybe think that Square Enix will give a second remake treatment to Dragon Quest IV, V and VI, which were so lovingly handled on the DS, but kind of perfectly aimed at the DS level.
I think they'll get the 2.5 remake treatment. I think they'll be next on the list. If you're going to do it for Star Ocean, do it for fucking Dragon Quest, which maybe more of us care about.
Are they doing it for Star Ocean? That star they did Octopath Traveler?
Well, yeah. The one that came out this year, the Star Ocean, what was it called? I missed that.
I missed that. I don't know if they gave it the safe treatment. That's quite appealing.
Those games really do look nice. I had the Live Alive one, which a game I didn't think was amazing, to be honest, but the style is bad.
I like the process when they put games through that, and rather than just the kind of HD pixel remasters, which always look a bit rank, I much rather something that properly updates it. I went with Dragon Quest IV, V and VI just because those are the ones I'm most familiar with because of the DS, and that's when their stories start getting a bit better, and they're just very, very compelling games.
Yeah, I'd love that. I think that would be fantastic. Because the pixel remasters for Final Fantasy are so good, it does feel like there's no rush, really, to do FF4 and 6, which would be the obvious ones from that bunch.
Chrono Trigger would be a really good shout for this, I think. It's one game, not a series of games. There's a lot of pixel art in there, but I think it's got a lot of potential.
But yeah, Dragon Quest, I think they have been focusing more on the sort of Squaresoft side, but it would be nice for them to switch focus, because I agree. Again, it feels like they're always trying to build Dragon Quest into something the West cares about, and the best way to do that is to give people access to the best that each of these series has to offer. So yeah, I think that would be a good one, Matthew.
I like that prediction. That's neat. Yeah, I do like the free line.
What is he thinking? That's what I think every time you give me a prediction in this episode.
Well, I thought Square Enix, and I thought, well, this is good from Square Enix.
Yeah, fair. All right, you might like this one. So Metroid gets its own Nintendo Direct this year, with a full unveiling of Metroid Prime 4, as well as the news that Metroid Dread 2 is in the works from our guys at Mercury Steam.
So, again, Metroid Prime 4, long, we know this game exists, long gestating, would love to see it. Could be that it's coming to the, you know, the next Switch, that's probably quite likely at this point. But in any case, I think that it's surely a dead cert that there is a Metroid Dread 2 that is coming, right?
Because that first game, phenomenally successful, completely, like, you know, reawakened the commercial prospects of Metroid. I think that the pairing of Metroid Dread with that Metroid remaster, I think it just shows that, like, people, obviously, Metroidvanias becomes, like, such a huge genre across, you know, basically, like, across every platform. It's now like, you know, it's a very prominent indie genre.
The idea of, like, you know, the masters coming back and reclaiming it, I like that narrative. But I think the idea of Metroid being big enough to get its own, like, live stream with a bunch of cool stuff in it, that'd be pretty cool, I think. So that's a bit of a bold prediction, but what do you think of that one, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, I'm into it. I dig it. Yeah, it'd be great, please, yes, please.
I'd love more, yeah, Metroid Dread, or, you know, the next game in that lineage. Metroid Prime 4, yeah, I don't know. Metroid Prime 4, like, it'd be cool if it happens, but also, I just wonder if it's just so far removed from, like, what we loved or the initial buzz or the excitement.
You know, maybe it's just a thing of its time, and, like, I'm not pinning any big hopes on Metroid Prime 4 being some, like, amazing, life-changing thing.
Yeah, weirdly, I'm more excited about the idea of more 2D Metroid, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure why that is, but, yeah, maybe it's been so long.
Yeah, a lot, you know, Dread was just so good and just felt so nice and, yeah, I mean, it makes perfect sense, we'd want more of that. I just think, like, Metroid Prime, you know, it wasn't like Metroid Prime 3 was, like, a masterpiece or anything. You know, it was already a series, sort of, in decline from Metroid Prime 1.
Yeah. Which is the best one, so, yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, contemporising it is a bit of a challenge, really, isn't it? It's, um...
Yeah, and the one that they're clearly struggling with, the fact that it's changed hands and... I'm not saying that, like, good game design is inevitable. I know that's not true, but at the same time, just the sheer length of it and the fact that it's had such a hard ride, which suggests that it's not obvious or easy, like, what necessarily is what they're meant to be doing with it.
Well, that's it, because the specific alchemy of it is quite unusual, really. It's much like a puzzle adventure, as it is a first-person shooter, and so they're quite hard to make. And to get the balance right is quite tricky.
So if you have a game that's got a lot of set pieces in it, does that not quite feel right? You know, like, how do you get the flow of the world right so you can sort of wander from a lava area to an ice area pretty seamlessly without it seeming weird, which in 2D kind of makes sense. And the magic trick of Prime is that it does those transitions so well between parts of that world.
But yeah, it's sort of like doing that in the modern age might be... that might be quite complicated to figure out how do you replicate that balance without it being just a carbon copy of what Metro Prime is. It's a very particular challenge, I think, for whoever is designing that.
I think the solution to that is you're in an icy room, there's a door, you shoot it, the door opens, and then you're in a lavary room. That's how that's going to work.
OK, good. That's the GDD sorted out there. Well done, Matthew.
I look forward to reading your Confluence pages as you lead development on Metro Prime 4. So that's good. OK, what's your next prediction?
Carrying over one of mine from last year, where I predicted that there was going to be a... I don't know if you remember, in 2022 is when we had the... Here's all the Silent Hill stuff we're making, which then vanished off the face of the Earth.
Quite a weird PR campaign to announce all that stuff and then not talk about any of it, bar the sort of disastrous thing that they released, that streaming thing that I don't really understand that they did at the end of the year and everyone said it was terrible. Like, instant momentum for Silent Hill instantly squandered. And so I predicted that a similar thing was going to happen for Castlevania.
I thought they were going to go, look, here's all this Castlevania shit we're working on. And that didn't happen last year. But I still think there is Castlevania to come, maybe not in as big a way as that Silent Hill.
The really obvious thing and my prediction is that the developers of Dead Cells, who obviously did the Castlevania DLC for Dead Cells, I think that may have been a test run for them doing just a Castlevania game. They've talked about signing up to do third party IP from other studios, and that's their next big project. I'd be amazed if after the strength of what they did with Dead Cells, that wasn't the next 2D Castlevania.
The funny thing is that I think that Dead Cells is maybe as popular as Castlevania ever was. It's got 123,000 Steam reviews.
Yeah, so maybe this is totally wrong.
But they might be passionate enough about it that they're like, yeah, we'll have a run at it. And like you say, the test run theory makes sense.
And the money to, you know, someone else's money to be thrown at something, you know?
Yeah, I think they've got a game called Windblown coming out. Is that right? It's like coming into Steam Early Access.
But anyway, that's...
The thing which is confusing with Dead Cells is there's a team that made it kind of split into another team that's like, we're not going to do Dead Cells. We're going to go off. And then the team that was left kind of was created to sort of specifically shepherd and look after Dead Cells.
Right.
So I think sometimes there's like... You can read stuff about the creators of Dead Cells, and it's actually two separate studios doing different things.
This is like how there's like 19 studios who are like made up of former CD Projekt RED developers. You know what I mean? They're all making different stuff.
And they're all from the makers of, yeah, Cyberpunk.
Tell the Witcher 3.
And it's like, I played a bongo drum on the soundtrack.
There you go. Lots of devs' contributions to a masterpiece.
Sorry, I don't mean to sneer at the bongo drum player for Cyberpunk. Bongo drum player? I only...
That's a real throwback. There was years ago, maybe it was like when Kickstarter... What was the first thing on Kickstarter that really exploded?
Gosh, I can't really remember.
Broken Age.
Broken Age, yeah.
In the rush afterwards, loads of people were trying to get games off the thing. I just remember this thing where a guy was like, from the makers of Donkey Kong Country Returns, this team of people are pitching this platformer on Kickstarter. And the connection to Retro Studios was, as a guy who had played, like, you know, if I say he played the clarinet, you're going to think that I'm doing a bit because it was your dad or whatever.
It was literally like a session musician on Donkey Kong Country Returns was involved with it. And they were using that as their, this is from the makers of Donkey Kong Country Returns. Sorry, that was a very long, boring explanation of why I said bongo drums.
I don't want you to think I was being dismissive of musicians.
And that musician on the bongo drums had a papier-mache head on. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. That's the end of the podcast.
Okay, let's move on then. Very good. This episode's got a wild, weird energy to it.
I don't know what's happened really. I think it's just early January. Are things really going to be okay?
I've got a feeling to it.
I've done two days of work, which were both slightly hectic. So I've got like a, oh no, I'm doomed for the energy.
Yeah, and I haven't started my new job yet. So I've got my sort of nerves, etc. So yes, a bit of that going on maybe.
Okay, my next one then. Ubisoft Star Wars game slips to 2025. That's Outlaws, the open world game.
But that's okay because we'll get the Splinter Cell remake this year. So this was something that was announced in 2022. The old Splinter Cell remake.
I think it would be very welcome because people really like that series. It's got a lot of... Even after all these years, it's been more than 10 years since they released Blacklist, the last one.
People are just still up for it. And I think the idea of that series coming back would be really cool. At the same time, I think the...
It's unclear when Ubisoft started making that Star Wars game, but they only announced a deal for it at the start of 2021. So to turn around this big open world game in that time period, it's quite tight. It was revealed this week in a blog post from Disney that it was coming in 2024, but I can see this moving back a little bit.
Maybe the extra runway might be good. They released an Avatar game in December, and it felt like it was very much right at the tail end of a really long release cycle of stuff. So this is just my prediction anyway.
I've got no insider knowledge of this, obviously, but just a feeling that that Star Wars game might not be as close as it seems like it is. What's your thoughts, Matthew?
Bit piss, hard and tubby rolls, for my liking. But yeah, I can see that.
Well, let's just move on to your next one then. We must be near the end of your ones, right?
I've only got one left.
Oh yeah, perfect then, Nier.
Yes. What disaster pod.
Oh, I'm going out on a high. Nintendo continued their 99 series of online battling games with Rhythm Heaven 99. 99 people playing an increasingly demented rhythm game until they've dropped out.
I just, I could picture in my head like, you know, the monkeys with tambourines or the tap dancing monkeys or the one with all the chickens are like marching time or the little birds and the camera keeps zooming out and out just with like 99 people. Maybe it's because I played a bit of that Headbangers, which is like a Battle Royale rhythm game. But I was trying to think of what was the silliest Nintendo franchise that you could turn into a Battle Royale.
And Rhythm Heaven is what I've got. That's my grand finale to this episode.
Have you ever talked down a pod more in like real time?
No, this has been good. I just, I think I threw myself by telling that story about the Donkey Kong Country Returns bongo player.
I threw myself. Yeah, so, oh gosh, so I like the idea of this. The way you read it out had the energy of when a listener sends in a letter we're not quite sure about.
Like when you were like, it's 99 people doing this. I was like, that's quite funny. Just the way you said it just reminded me, the intonation just reminded me of that a little bit.
Yeah, I mean, I'd like that. It's pretty cool they've kept this series going. I mean, that would be the most high concept one they could do.
But I mean, I guess like you're probably only being half serious with that pitch, aren't you, Matthew?
I do struggle to think other games they've done where you could do like 99 people in a big like mad maximalist version of it. They did Pac-Man, which wasn't technically there. So I don't know why you couldn't do like 99 Bomberman or something.
Yeah, oh, the Bomberman is a really good show, actually. What an absolute fucking chaos that would be, actually.
I'd be like, college.
Just like four on the screen was like enough for pure chaos in the Snake's Mega Drive days. But yeah, I like that. That's good.
Bomberman is probably more likely than Rhythm Heaven.
Rhythm Heaven, I just imagine a cacophony of noises as everyone gets it fucking wrong, basically.
What about 99 WarioWare?
Oh, gosh. Which one would you do? I mean, what would happen in WarioWare 99?
Because the games get faster and faster as everyone's dropping out. It's just how many WarioWare games can you do?
Oh, yeah, you just have to survive for as long as possible. And then you just see, like, Fall Guys style. You see people just disappear from the side.
I actually love that idea. It just keeps going. The idea is, as well, it's 99 mini games, so you actually have to survive for 99 of those micro games to actually like...
That's how long the game can go on for, basically, before there's a tie-breaker round. So, yeah, I'd love that. That's like War of Attrition, a Hunger Games-style approach to it.
War of Attrition, yes. Okay, good. That's a nice prediction there.
So, I think, like, this is a bit of a... Is this a little bit of a softball one? Maybe a little bit, but...
So, Sega's new versions of Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio released this year, and they're considered really rather good, and this kicks off a big The Dreamcast era's back narrative for Sega, because they seem to be digging into their older series here in a way that I don't think anyone was expecting, because they all do remind people of the Dreamcast days where they were struggling a bit commercially, and yet they have really doubled down on this. There seem to be quite a lot of them. But I've just got a feeling that people are going to have the appetite for Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio in particular, and then that combined with a strong Dragon year, Infinite Wealth has got the whiff of, that's going to be the big game that that studio's made in the last few years.
That'll be the one that, you know, again, like maybe raises the profile of that series. I've just got a feeling it's going to be a good Sega year, man. That's my kind of like general take here.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, absolutely. That announcement of we're secretly remaking all of our back catalogs, sort of major big hitters, yeah, was really surprising. And a really weird way of doing it, like, probably was the big, no one could have seen it coming, surprise of the Game Awards.
That was really cool. I would question the sense of like Golden Axe being in the mix. You know, you see a bit of that and you're like, oh, who wants that, really?
There's a lot of games that are like that you can play on different platforms. That's the thing, like hack and slash kind of co-op games, you know.
Yeah, I just don't know what a like next-gen version of that is that's of any interest to anyone, really.
Do you ever play PS3 Golden Axe, Matthew? That was rough. The slightly DMC-ish one was quite a bumpy ride, that.
Yeah, but this similar kind of, you know, already similar energy to it. Where, like, you know, let's make a really beautiful Shinobi game, you know, 2D. That seems smart.
That looks quite way forward-y to me. I wouldn't be surprised if way forward we're involved with that.
Well, we know how you feel about those, so...
Yeah, you can take a drink, Simon Perkins. Yeah, so, yeah, kind of like an interesting project, but also mad to, like, announce so many games so vaguely all at once.
Yeah, I was waiting for the Peli to drop where they were going to go, and they're all inside a Fortnite-style metagame or something like that. But then, no, they're all actual, they seem to be all actual games that are coming out, single games.
Yeah, it reminded me a bit, actually, of when they announced the Platinum deal, and they were like, here's all these games we're making with Platinum.
Yeah.
And it seemed, you were just like, holy shit, this is really exciting for, like, a year. Like, maybe this is just, whoever, there's, like, our marketing guy Sega, who's really big on the, let's do it all at once really quickly, it'd be exciting.
What I suppose to, the other thing is that these games are, they hail from an era where game budgets were a lot smaller, so theoretically, it shouldn't cost as much to make a crazy taxi as it does to make a, you know, like a Star Wars Outlaws. That's a dumb example, I'm pretty sorry, but, you know what I mean? Like, these feel like they could be mid-budget things, like in theory, you shouldn't have to, it shouldn't cost you, you know, like, 50 million plus to make a crazy taxi game.
That should be a smaller project, you would hope. And then, yeah.
Cut forward three years to Sega is now closing after it was revealed Golden Axe is the most expensive video game.
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, how are these fair commercially? I've got no idea.
But I do like it as a wild punt. And it's just cool. It's just cool to see them.
I'm like, yeah, I'll play another game. I'll play a crazy taxi, you know.
It does empower all the Dreamcast heads, which is like, you know, a bit of a tough break.
I know you hate to do that. Yeah, that's tough. Okay.
They're all going to be like, we're going to have to talk about these games and remind everyone how little I know about Dreamcast, which sucks.
Yeah, but you can talk about fucking crazy tags. It's not like rocket science, is it? It's a pretty straightforward thing to discuss.
But yes, we'll suffer through it with Ashley Day anyway when he comes on the part later this month. Okay, last one then. Matthew keeps delaying the Game Boy Draft episode until December when it finally happens and he thinks he's fucked it in round one.
So trying to get Matthew to do more Draft episodes has proven quite difficult. He's not really up for it in the way you would hope because Draft episodes are meant to be quite light touch. You pick ten games and then we move on and everyone has a good time.
But now they've become like Matthew's writing all those fucking bitmap books on each platform. So he's got to play every single game ever released before we do the Draft. Would you like to explain yourself, Matthew?
I mean, it is basically that. No, it's just that when we're on Nintendo territory, you know, I have to bring my A game and I'm just a bit patchy on Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. It's not things I go back to.
Yeah, I just need to do a bit more. I need to do a bit more work.
Yeah, in some ways as well. That's going to be quite intense. I think we're going to have to do 20 games for that one because it's just it's three platforms.
Technically the combined, isn't it? Yes, it's going to be quite an up. What about PS1 Draft?
Could you do that one a bit sooner? That's just 10 games.
As a Nintendo person, I don't really care anything non-Nintendo. I feel no shame if I fuck it. Because it's like, well, what did you think was going to happen?
PS1 would be a disaster for me. But I can do it.
Let's do it in February then. That would be good.
Let's do it in February.
All right, cool. You can ask all your colleagues anyway what they pick and then you just come talk about it.
Can I bring in a guest ringer person for me to be my people's champion?
Yeah, sure. Why not? That would be like...
And then Matthew's like, oh yeah, I'm a big grandeur ahead suddenly. And I'm like, where did that come from? But yeah, that would be fun.
I think PS1 would be good. And like, 10 games is not too intensive. If anything, that episode's more work for me because I have to tell the story of the PS1 without having lived it in the same way I did with the other platforms we've covered where I feel like I was able to get my arms around their history quite well.
So yeah, but I'd like to do that. In February, if you fancy it, Matthew, we can do PS1. But then yes, Game Boy, as mentioned, can wait until December.
Where Matthew has finally played like, what is it, like Ninja 5-0 or whatever it's called. Yeah, I have played that.
That's one of the few. That's the thing, I've got my super niche things fine. I just need to like, you know, play Kingdom Hearts and things like that.
Oh yeah, yeah. Chain of Memories is really your sort of thing.
That's where it will be won. It will be won in that fucking dirt, you know.
Oh gosh, yeah. Like it's sort of like that's actually that's the probably the most sort of like niche thing. I just thought I have to have that.
Which I bought in Japan, which was a pack of Kingdom Hearts like playing cards that were all like the cards in that game. I was like, you know what? I've just got to have that.
I can't really explain why, but that will be mine. So, okay, good. Well, we've got that.
Let's see. We have a nice, we can have a nice port category for that one for GBA. Because I mean, there are so many ports.
It'll be a good draft when we finally do it. We just got to get there. All right.
Okay. That's the end of the predictions, Matthew. Should have one final quick break and come back with a quick final section.
Does that sound good?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, very simple this final section. It's kind of like a best games of 2024 critics draft, I guess.
Me and Matthew are going to pick five games each, take it in turns, and we're going to try and like basically get the highest total Metacritic average at the end of the year for our selection of five games. I think our listeners are doing something similar in the Discord right now, Matthew, but this is something you want to be...
Yeah, fantasy critic is a thing. Yeah, my brother's been doing it for several years. It's quite a...
The official rules of fantasy critic have got all these like weird, weird extra bits to it. I think you only start scoring when a game is above 70 or 80. And then so every point above 70, you get points for it.
And then I think if it's below a certain number, those points start to get subtracted from your overall thing. And you also do a counterpick where you bet against... You bet on something being bad and you get points if it is bad.
It's quite involved, but this is a simplified version. We're just going to have five games and then at the end of the year, see which of us just got the most points on Metacritic, right?
Yeah, basically. Matthew was never sure he could stretch it to a full episode, that idea.
Yeah, I also felt in the past slightly uncomfortable about it. I mean, this is going to sound very sort of hand-wringing of me, but when I was still reviewing games quite regularly, it felt like I shouldn't probably be playing this stupid scoring game and doing this. Not that I can swing a Metacritic score, of course I can't.
I know that's preposterous, but like, I don't know. But when you're in that line of work, it felt like you maybe shouldn't be playing this game. Is that dumb of me?
I mean, you know, I think you're overthinking it. No one's out there thinking Matthew's fixing this.
You might be like, you dropped this on edge because Sam needed it for his fantasy draft. Which is something I might do.
But I wouldn't care that much. I wouldn't even give a shit. So that would be fine with me.
There you go. That was just a tiny little insight into what the inside of my head is actually like and how much I overthink these things.
All right, well, OK, so that's why we're just going to do a simple top five and then we'll just like, yeah.
We need to start with the coin flip.
Yeah. Do you want me to do this for once? I've got the coin flip thing up.
Yeah.
Yeah, OK. Do you want to do heads or tails?
Tails.
No Google has it built in. That's quite exciting.
Yeah.
It is tails. So yeah, I mean, you just go first. Right.
I go first. Yeah. I mean, the thing I will add, like, if the game doesn't release this year, you get no points for it, obviously.
And there's a bit of a risk factor with that because obviously games are always moving around. So yeah, it may be maybe pays to pick things that have release dates already. So yeah.
Yeah. Or you bet. You bet big.
Or Mario 3D game unannounced.
I'm going to bet on. So for my first pick, I'm going to take Hollow Knight Silksong.
Interesting. That is a bold pick.
If it happens, I think it will be a massive scorer. There's just not a version. I just don't think the fans of that game will let it be bad.
It's whether it comes out this year. Big, big if.
Okay. Interesting. All right.
Well. All right. So that game is like when it comes along, I think I'll probably just shadow drop.
Basically, they'll just be like, here it is. And then it will take the Internet will completely lose its mind. Because if I were the devs, I would be thinking we don't need to do a marketing campaign for this.
We just need to be like, press the button. It's out. And then the world changes around you.
That'd be very exciting to do that. So yeah, I think this would appear to be the year. I think we're approaching the third anniversary of that edge cover now.
So I think we are. So yeah. Okay.
All right. So that's your number one. My number one is Metaphor Refantasio.
The game from the Persona devs or some of the key Persona devs. It's a new game set in a fantasy universe, like a new franchise basically, and seems to feature some of the same stuff, but also some sort of like things they weren't doing within Persona. I think it's almost certainly going to be a monster scorer.
So this feels like a safe bet. I think it'll probably come out this year. They've said it's coming out this year.
It's, you know, there's gameplay out there of it. It's been in development for years. So yeah, I think this is a good shout, Matthew.
Yeah, that was definitely on my on my list. I've got a list of things in order that I was going to claim them.
Yeah, so I've done it too. So I'm sure we'll have some overlap here. But what's the number two?
Point of order. Where do we stand on DLC?
You can pick it if you want. It has to be substantial DLC. It can't be like a hat or whatever.
You know, like, yeah.
What if I say Elden Ring Shadow of the Earth Tree?
I thought this had come up. I mean, I sort of like resent it on a fundamental level. But I'm going to allow it.
You know, that's where I'm at. Thank you.
I mean, the thing is, it's important that this list doubles as things that I'm personally interested in. So Hollow Knight Silksong, Elden Ring Shadow of the Earth Tree.
Yeah. I do kind of want to say you can only pick a game that you know you can finish. Do you know what I mean?
That's not, that's like, that's, that's so many games I can't finish.
No, that's fine. Go ahead. You have your fucking Elden Ring deal too.
That's a good shout. All right. So I'm going to, next up, I'm going to take Dragon's Dogma 2.
This is like, this has big games journalists like this energy to it. Capcom has made basically bangers nonstop for about five years now. I don't see that changing anytime soon.
I like everything I've seen of this. They're doing it for, you know, Joe Scrabbles. That's just great news, I think, for everyone involved.
So yes, Dragon's Dogma 2 is my number two, Matthew. Thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, it looks absolutely brilliant. I've not, you know, not played it myself, but everything they've shown of it just looks like, you know, the core idea of Dragon's Dogma 1 sort of fully realized with a bit more heft behind it. Yeah, I mean, it's one of the games I'm most excited about this year.
Good stuff. So what's your number three?
My number three is Paper Mario, The Thousand Year Door.
Yeah, good call. Good call.
Again, like, it's a fine game, very enjoyable. I know some people are just so nuts about it that they will inevitably review it and punch its score up. This will score higher than it probably deserves to.
In a similar way that I think happened with Super Mario RPG, which is actually like an old-ass game under its graphics as I've been discovering these last few evenings. Yeah, like, but who cares? This isn't about what I think about it.
It's about what the reviewing masters think about it. And I think they're going to give this a fat 90 plus.
Yeah, I think that's basically true.
So, yes, good stuff.
This is a very cynical excitement.
You're picking things that you don't like.
I do like Paper Mario A Thousand Year Door. I don't think it's a ten, but luckily there are a lot of clowns who will.
Dweebs, as you keep saying.
Dweebs and clowns.
Okay, I'm going to take Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth, my third game. This is out very, very soon. The last Yakuza Like A Dragon drew a lot of acclaim.
I think this one, with its Hawaiian setting and no doubt a preposterous array of minigames and the two protagonists, past and present Yakuza coming together, is going to appeal to people massively. I can see this being a high 80s at the least, so it feels like a steady one to have in here, Matthew.
And it's definitely happening, unlike some of mine.
Exactly, it is definitely happening. So yes, it feels like a sensible pick. What's the number four?
My number four is Persona 3 Reload.
Hmm, yeah, an interesting one.
Probably like the riskiest of my picks so far. Like, I'm basically going on the goodwill towards Persona. This looks like a big sort of, you know, well, it's a big leap over the original material, and it looks much more in line with what you'd expect from Persona 5.
That speaks to me. There's been a little bit of kind of grumbling about some of the features they haven't brought in from the PSP version. Is this right?
That's right. There's like an extra chapter, I think, at the end.
And also the male-female protagonist choice, I don't think is in there. So is that enough to get this dinged? I'd be surprised.
I know some people will complain about it in their reviews, but I think this will still come in high. I mean, in terms of my Atlus things, metaphor refantasio was higher than this, for sure. I think all eyes are still on that one.
But I think this will bank some reliable points.
Yeah, OK. Then those points will all be eights, basically. So that's fine.
OK, yeah, I think that's a good call. All right, I'm going to take Hellblade 2 for number four, Matthew. I think that if you try to deny this as a good pick, then what you are basically saying is it's not OK to talk about mental health.
And frankly, I found upon that perspective, I don't think that's appropriate. And how dare you? What were you thinking, even suggesting that?
So thoughts on that one, Matthew?
I do think this will be good. I don't really rate Hellblade 1 that much. I think it's fine.
It didn't really do it for me. But I feel like they've invested a lot in this studio for this game to be much more ambitious and a big step up. And with that big step up, it should finally become the more critically acclaimed thing that it should be.
But yeah.
Side note, when I considered moving to Cambridge last year and I was sort of like looking around different areas, I discovered that Ninja Theory owns a pub in Cambridge and really wanted to go in there. Just love the idea of a game studio owning a pub, but didn't go in there in the end and probably won't go back to Cambridge now. So that's that dour note there to end on.
Thank you for that.
No worries.
That's slightly better than my Donkey Kong Country.
There's not much in it though. There's not much in it between like a 4 out of 10 or 5 out of 10 is there. So when it comes to anecdotes.
So what's your fifth and final pick, Matthew?
My fifth and final pick is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
Fuck.
Okay.
Yeah.
Very good. There is a version where this goes wrong again. In terms of if they go too far down the kind of weird meta level with this.
Now that I'm very invested in the contents of Disc 1. I obviously don't want to see them mess with those classic scenes and those classic characters. Maybe that will happen.
But I feel like they've got a lot more material to play with to make a full game. So they maybe don't need to pad it in weird ways that they may have done with remakes. So yeah, I think this is going to come in high 80s.
Yeah. Okay. I think that's a good call.
I think that's pretty much where it's going to land. We know that there's a baseline of quality they're working with from what was in the original remake. So yeah, I had this as my number five too, but you took it.
That's fine. So my last entry there, my fifth entry, is going to be Unicorn Overlord, the next game from Vanillaware. Amazing name for a game, obviously.
I think we'll agree there. That and Metaphor, Refantisio are kind of like competing for the most preposterous JRPG name for the year. So I appreciate that as a battleground.
But I think Vanillaware has steadily built up this reputation as one of the RPG heavyweights. I mean, you know, all like, I guess sort of games in that vein, like strategy slash RPG, I guess they sort of go between a little bit. But this game is pretty sort of like trad looking RPG in some ways, but also has that kind of like very distinctive sort of like soft anime art style that you see in Vanillaware's games.
And a little bit horny, obviously. That's also part, I say a little bit like quite a lot horny, honestly. But I think that their games always do really well critically, and this will be a good call for that reason.
It's out in March, so it will be here this year. I don't know if it releases here in March, but certainly it's sort of like they have been talking about it in the West. I don't think there's going to be the big wait for it like there was with 13 Sentinels.
So yeah, this feels like if I can't have FF7, this might be as good a banker in terms of the Metacritic score. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, kind of fits in very neatly with your kind of, yeah, your Atlas games and you're like a dragon where you know that these games will be given to the people who like these games to review.
Yeah, absolutely.
Again, a cynical way of looking at it. Like, I think we both know how these things sort of work and how, you know, outlets behave. Yeah, that's a pretty safe bet.
Yeah, you've got your one freelancer.
This is going to have the best shot it's going to get is, yeah, for sure.
Yeah, you've got your one freelancer, you slide it to him and then it comes back as a 92 and you're like, is this definitely a 92? They're like, yes. Okay, well, I guess I'll publish it.
And then people are complaining because you gave that 92, but you gave like, I don't know, this FPS that sells 10 million copies at 83 or something. Basically, that was my entire experience running PC Gamer. I hope you enjoy that insight.
Oh, dear. I really like Vanillaware. Their games are, they're interesting.
Not all of them are actually freely available on modern platforms. There's a bit of variance there. So just did Grim Grimoire, one of their cool PS2 games.
That was redone on Switch and PS5 last year. And you can play Odin Sphere, which is, I think, my favorite of their games that I've played. I've not played 13 Sentinels.
Odin Sphere is on PS4, so you can play on PS5. That's a cool game, a sort of side scrolling RPG thing, which is a game with amazing artwork. They're just a cool little dev, and I'm pleased they can keep making their thing.
And it seems like 13 Sentinels hit a level of popularity or cult appeal that they haven't previously seen in the West. So I can see them building on that this time, Matthew. So one of my most anticipated of the year.
OK, that's the podcast done. If you'd like to support the podcast, after listening to this, you probably don't want to. But I promise we do make good episodes as well.
I think there was enough good in this.
No, it was fun. It was fun. patreon.com back page pod.
If you'd like to get the two additional podcasts a month or just support us more generally. It's a £4.50 tier there and a £1 tier £1 tip jar tier. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I'm MrBazzle underscore pesto on Twitter and MrBazzle pesto no underscore on blue sky. But I don't really post there, so I wouldn't bother.
He doesn't. My social media strategy this year is I'm a bastard on blue sky and I have a jokester on Twitter. That's what I'm doing this year, so enjoy that.
We'll see how it pans out. And yes, the podcast can be followed at Back Page: Pod on both platforms. And I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on both platforms. Thank you so much for listening and we'll be back next week.
