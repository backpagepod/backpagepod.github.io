Hello and welcome to the backpage XL, a patron exclusive episode. of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts. I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew. Game score's gone down quite well, hasn't it? So that's uh that's something. Does that give you more faith in the format

Matthew
00:36
than you had previously.

Samuel
00:38
No.

Matthew
00:39
Every time this happens, every time it it it somehow goes well and all that does is lock us into doing another one and it's It's really the build up to it that I hate. I hate the turmoil of it. I hate the turmoil of prepping for it. So i i it i any success it has basically commits us to that turmoil again. And one of these days we will do one where The pilots don't align and it isn't good. And people will just finally see through the whole thing and it'll just be depressing. We're lucky that someone always brings it. Between you, me and the listeners.

Samuel
01:14
There's there's always a bit of it that works.

Matthew
01:16
Yeah.

Samuel
01:17
I thought this was one of our better ones actually, and I thought the key was having fewer entries. And so we don't sort of splutter out about um one hour and forty five minutes in, which I feel like it's happened at least four times making games caught. So that's That's like a real, you know, net win for the listeners. Um I f I feel like it went well. But you know, I think the key for me this time was I I took two days to prep jokes as opposed to just the one lunchtime or the one hour or after work. Yeah. And that did put me in a slightly better position, but I don't know. I laughed at some of your stuff. I think a lot of your best stuff anyway was you talking about how shit your stuff was. And the listeners also seem to enjoy that. So uh you know, I th I've got I've still got faith. There's life in the old dog yet.

Matthew
02:00
I I just when I was editing it, I it was s it was so painful listening back to how bad my stuff was. And it's it isn't like play acting. I was like, oh god. I just I hate I hate the guy who wrote that and I hate the guy who said that. And that guy is me.

Samuel
02:15
I didn't think it was that bad, but because you remarked upon it being bad, it just turned it into a more of an ordeal.

Matthew
02:21
The SEO in the C was so fucking weak. It like it wouldn't even work written down. Like as I looked on the page I was like, oh there's no no one can sell this. This is so bad.

Samuel
02:33
Well again, I don't think it would would have been funny if you'd have said it with no additional material. But because you teed up by saying This is shit and it's going to be shit. Now here it is. And then afterwards we're like, that was so shit. It was it collectively, I think it it worked very um don't say very well, it just it worked, you know. So we've we've it's over. The key thing is, like you say, we're good for it, Matthew. We will offer people meat on the bone and value down the line. And I think this episode is maybe part of that because You have told me you told me a little while ago you wanted to do an episode around the play date because you'd been, you know, cranking it. You'd been sort of building up to this. You've been checking out the catalogue of this little hobbyist. uh sort of indie machine that has that is definitely the a subject of fascination of journalists. Um whether it's like a big deal culturally is I th that's I mean like or I guess like how we measure whether it's a big deal or not is something we'll discuss in the episode actually. But what sort of like what prompted this um from your side?

Matthew
03:31
W we have a playdate for starters, so and it's not not the the most uh interesting of beginnings, so I just kept sitting at my desk thinking, oh we could cover that at some point. I wanted an excuse to play it. I'd only dabbled with it a tiny bit when Catherine got it. Catherine basically like reviewed the the first season or covered the first season, I think. on RPS and then it's been sitting around our house unloved, but I thought I should give it a go. I must admit when I suggested it, I wasn't like in the middle of a deep love affair with Playdate. I was like oh I'll suggest that and now give me a good reason to buy it. I mean I don't wanna step on toes of what's gonna happen in the rest of this episode. But if I'd maybe known uh how difficult I was gonna find playing the play date, I might not have done it. I Um A bit of a kind of like a oh that would be funny. I thought the title would be funny. In my head, uh you know, the idea of t two giant men crank it for your pleasure was the name i I had in my head and I thought, oh that's that's funny. That looks funny on a spreadsheet.

Samuel
04:34
Oh yeah. I mean but only one giant mad has cranked it and the other one has not participated. And um yeah, and it's not I haven't even called the episode that. Would you like to change the episode to reflect that?

Matthew
04:46
That's fine. I I I prefer what the episode is now. I just I I worry because usually when we do these deep dives, it's Oh here's this thing that I really really love or or we really really love and that's why we want to talk about it in depth. Where this one we kind of committed to it before I knew if I liked it or not. And I do like it enough, but I don't love it. And that's that's the problem. So apologies to the three Playdate guys on our Discord. who think it's about to get a huge endorsement. Um not that I'm a huge endorsement. Um but yeah, so kind of conflict about it.

Samuel
05:22
Hopefully it'll be good. Yeah, for sure. And so I guess there's a t there's a tiny bit of me hanging off of this with discussion of niche handhelds generally because it feels like we're in a bit of an age of those, whether it's high-end um hardware that replicates, you know, original hardware like the analog pocket or of course a Steam Deck which is a bit of a I think it's that's been a bit of a game changer and has unlocked uh sort of whole bracket of handheld PCs. Um and I think you know anecdotally I hear about a lot of people who don't have gaming PCs or have never had gaming PCs and are starting their Steam libraries from scratch by buying one of those, which is uh I think a sign that Valve has um has uh you know it it's a good project for them and it is unlocking like a new audience that Is maybe intrigued by PC gaming, but doesn't think that buying a, you know, 1,500 pounds, you know, PC is like a what a something a normal person does, which I think is fair enough. Um so yeah, I I think it's there's there's that combined with things like Evocade where you can buy, you know, different cartridges of uh original games um to run on them. I think they're they're a British company who make that which is Quite cool and they've unlocked they've got some good licenses um in bringing that to life, work with Capcom and many other publishers.

Matthew
06:36
And I had a nightmare about Evocade last night.

Samuel
06:40
What?

Matthew
06:42
Please don't. But I had a I had a really strange dream where I and I've never met him in person, so I don't really know if what he looked like was right, but I was at Wes Fenland's house. Oh right, yeah. And I was asking him about Evercade, and he was getting really annoyed at how little I knew about it. And uh that was basically the nightmare, was just me having a really bad social interaction with this person who I knew through you. So I didn't want to kind of like muddy the waters for that reason. And yeah, feeling a huge amount of anxiety about how little I knew about Evercade.

Samuel
07:20
How strange. I mean, I don't even know I s I seen that Wes knows what Evercade is, but um I mean Wes is very tall. Wes is probably uh taller than me and about as tall as you, Matthew.

Matthew
07:29
So um Oh no, he wasn't in my dream.

Samuel
07:31
Well that was he like a five foot two or something? Was he like a little little Wes micro Wez Um okay well um oh I lost to think about that. I wish I had some more insight on the dream, but um I don't sadly. Um so you have that combined with obviously things like emulation handhelds which have gotten uh see a massive amount of traction and have become a more and more of a professional endeavor in the sense that the the devices which looked a bit shonky and sort of something something you'd be a bit embarrassed about a few years ago are approaching, you know, they are not at anywhere near the level of something like a PS Vita or a Nintendo Switch in terms of quality, but they are, I would say, you know far better than they were about five years ago. So, you know, those have become big business too. So there's a lot of um there's a lot of this stuff going around, but Playdate is by far the most interesting because it is um uh functionally uh its own platform. It's not like a Android-based thing or whatever. They've made their own, you know, uh s store and games have to be made specifically for it because it has a particular interface because It's got these Game Boy style controls, but also the crank, of course. So, you know, it's a real one-off in you know in the in that market. But yeah, these things are exploding. I l I learned today, Matthew, about um uh an emulation device that is basically like key ring sized but can still play all kind of Game Boy games on it and stuff. And I just thought, who's buying that? But

Matthew
08:53
Uh after the play date, the idea of an even smaller handheld gaming device just really not appealed to me.

Samuel
09:00
Yeah, yeah. So I mean, I I d I did want to ask you, uh based on that, do you think gamers just like collecting tat Is that why do we just like hoarding handhelds, putting them in our little quality street tins or wherever we keep these things and just sort of like having them? Is there a is there a a sense of Uh just it's a new it's a new trinket to look at and it doesn't take up too much space so it might be fun to dabble with this. What do you think is behind this? burst of handheld stuff going on.

Matthew
09:27
It's weird because it's a part of gaming that I've had no interaction with. It's not that I'm disinterested in it. I've I find it Like whenever I have a cursory glance at it, basically whenever you tell me about oh I've just got this or I bought one of these things or I've been playing X on my Y or whatever You know, I'll I'll think, oh maybe I should get into that and get one of these things. But I it it's kind of uh you know, outside of like your Steam Decks and your play dates. The scene has a kind of slight tint of murkiness to it. Oh definitely, yeah. Yeah, and and and that's what makes it quite unusual, because it's like a huge industry. but also one which has this undercurrent of illegality to it. I'm not being like some Narc here saying they are illegal devices, not at all. But that does make it quite a strange world to try and get into. because it's, you know, talked about in an official an official-ish way by some people. But a lot of it is Reddit threads tr g giving vague hints of like, oh this thing's good and this thing's bad. And I I just f I find that quite a hard space to navigate. Getting in into it is quite hard. I mean, c can you say what you have?

Samuel
10:43
Uh yeah, that's fine. They're just Android based handhelds. So um this one I've got now is called the um by the way, this is not a video podcast. When I said writ with this one. It's not me. There's no way you can watch me showing you what this is. Um just I'm I'm just illustrating the thing that I bought most recently. The Retroid um Pocket Flip 2 is an Android-based device that has, I think, uh something like uh sixty four or hundred and twenty-eight gigabytes of memory on it and it can it's got enough uh power processing power to uh run PS2 games, uh GameCube games, no problem. Um I don't really I've never really dabbled with original Xbox, couldn't really speak to that. The the thing um that is illegal is you know is I think in the case of PlayStation it's you need I believe you need something uh the original firmware of the hardware, like the actual operating system by copying that. Um if it's not your road from your own hardware or something, or you it's not a backup from your own hardware and it's illegal to take that. Then obviously if you're downloading ROMs instead of um let's say burning the disks that you own um and making backups that way Um it is also illegal, obviously it's it obviously it's illegal to share um ROMs as well. Um so yeah, it's a bit It's a bit ambiguous because some companies are are sort of cracking down on this more than others. Um and the nice thing about the um flip t the flip two is it's so it's like a clamshell sort of design. And it's got a GameCube kind of colourway to it, the one I've bought. Um so it's sort of like that bluish purple um colour of the GameCube and the button colours are similar. And even the triggers feel a little bit similar and it's got the but it's got a kind of DS style um look to it because you're you know it's even though it hasn't got two screens, you are it is like a clamshell um design. Um and s but it does loads of other stuff as well. Like it because it's an Android device, you can download Netflix on there, you can uh put Slay the Spire on there, which I did, you know, and you can play uh normal games on there. Once you add your Netflix subscription you can download the shrinking array of games um that are available to you um via that service on your phone. So it's quite a they're quite versatile devices and I'd say to a large extent. They they are what you make them um or make of them, but I would say that it makes sense to me that this is not something of interest to you. They're not things I'm hugely passionate about. They are Coldly functional to me.

Matthew
13:13
Um Is this more that you know, I I I I like to sort of research purchases before I make them and you definitely can research these and I know that there is a there's a huge sort of fan community and and specialist sites covering these devices but If you are quite square like me and and, you know, have traditional routes by which you research consumer electronics, this just isn't in that world at all. It's not like fucking which magazine has like a which of these dubious Android devices should you be buying. You know, I want a I'd want a nice clean stamp on one of them, going, yeah, this is this is the good legit one. Even down to like I never really know what to expect or to go looking for in terms of at what power level are these things? You know, like you said they're your PS2 and GameCube and that's you know, that's helpful. Obviously I can visualize that, but you know, what is acceptable? How well are these things actually gonna run? Uh you know, i is it doing PS2 and GameCube acceptably or is it like a little bit you know, rough around the edges. Like that I I just can't even kind of picture it if that makes sense.

Samuel
14:25
Well, I mean I I think that maybe that shows it's been a while since you've done a deep dive on this, because if you did look up the handheld I've bought and and the word review, you'd get Polygon on the first page of Google.

Matthew
14:35
Oh really? So they they are okay.

Samuel
14:37
And then um they also review the Retroid Pocket Pocket 5, which is more of a um PSP or PS Vita style um form factor, so that kind of like, you know, the the switch form factor but smaller basically. Um so it's uh it's definitely out there. I agree that it's not widely talked about. You won't find reviews on all of the major gaming sites for this stuff. Um and it is a bit more hushed whispers because I think people are just a bit nervous about operating in that uh, you know, um gas space of and you know you it when you read these reviews you won't find them talking about all of the different um games they've downloaded off of w whatever, um, kazar or wherever they might get them. But um they are they do talk about the functionality of them because like I say they have become more more professional. The you know the buttons and the D pads and stuff like that are pretty Feel pretty solid. I think it's become a competitive market as well because quite a lot of these companies that have moved into this space and are trying to get people's dollar. Um they I think a lot of them are caught up in some of the tariff nonsense that's going on at the moment. F Um that whole um American main character syndrome pants shitting that's going on. I think they're caught up in in that whole nonsense. Um so You know, it's it it's a bit of a weird space. The other thing is it's happening probably on Steam Deck more than anywhere else, because those are Linux-based devices, but those can run emulators as well. Um and you can download things like emudeck straight onto um a Steam Deck from um the Linux store I believe. I think that's the case. But basically a lot these these things are out there. And so yeah, I'm certainly not s endorsing um doing downloading anything illegal but um it's just become more professional because there's clearly more there's clearly some money in it um but yes I think Steam Deck is where a lot of the stuff is happening because uh you know, they that can obviously handily a ru run games up to and including, you know, PS2, GameCube, etcetera. Right, right. Um the Retroid Flip 2, um, you know, uh were I to have played a GameCube or PS2 game in it, Matthew, um, and obviously I'm not saying that. Um It runs runs very, very well. And certainly if you look at videos on YouTube, you th you see things like um Burnout 3 just running at the crisp 60 FPS it was supposed to on PS2 and Looking like mega mega sharp. Some games that were running at 30 are just amped up massively. It's very it's very it's kind of crazy how much power is packed into that these l devices are just so little now. Um they do make quite a lot of noise 'cause they got a fan in them and stuff and there's quite a lot of processing power in there. But yeah, it's I mean it's night and day from the and burn it device I got during the pandemic. which was metal and not very appealing and quite looked a bit more even by the standards of then it looked nicer than some of the ones that preceded it, but by by today's standards it looks very, very out of date. And these devices now still look knockoff, but they are like high-end knockoff. I would say that's the that's the distinction, you know?

Matthew
17:35
I think that's when I w was looking at this stuff when you got your first one and were talking about it and so it's yeah, it's interesting that even in that time things have become a bit sort of neater. I think th the other part of it is there are some Ur like retro devices which are sort of mired in endless like pre-order woes for certain people And I kind of fold that into it. Like off the like I'm all I'm always uh it was more of a Twitter thing. I don't know if I'm following the same people on Blues Sky. But there were always people complaining about like this thing's four years overdue. I paid for this thing four years ago and it hasn't arrived yet and y l just sort of slightly more dubious things happening around the edges than than would ever happen with like, you know, a traditional console manufacturer. Um which kind of scared me off a bit. I'm very easily scared off at the hint of the slightest hint of trouble or danger. I'm like, uh probably not for me. Uh and that might just be a tweet going this battletoades cartridge is a year uh late and I'm like, uh oh. S sounds like sounds like trouble.

Samuel
18:46
I but I believe someone got arrested for reviewing these devices with using Nintendo games on a stream as well. or on a video.

Matthew
18:55
Um I think I wouldn't even watch the stream. I'm so scared.

Samuel
18:59
I think it's happened somewhere in Europe. So I I don't think you'd like them for the simple reason that they're mega mega fiddly. It's like I would say I would compare it to something like You know where you're trying to mod a game on PC and shit just breaks over and over again and you don't know why and you're like, okay, I'll reorder the mods at how they're loading, the load order, to see if that stops it from fucking up and it doesn't. And it keeps fucking up. It's got it's got a bit of that vibe to it. It can be very particular. Like the library functions on these things can be very, very specific. Um the actual settings you need to do in the in the sort of hardware options. also fiddly and the navigation of those menus is also quite fraught. Um there's an absolute ton of options and you don't know what buttons you're pressing all the time. You're like, oh four times speed. I'll see what that does. And oh yes I do want. texture filtering four times, not really knowing what that'll do. And I think that's the the space you step into. This isn't related to modding, but um I was sort of looking up the steps you need to install The um there's a mod for Final Fantasy IX that does like a HD touch-up on every single bit of the game, every single character background, and makes it basically a HD version of that game. But I was just looking at it and just sighing and I was like, I'm ma man, I don't think I've got another emulation handheld in me. Like if if this one Breaks, that's it. I'm noping out on the scene. Or I'll just like pay a nephew. I I'm gonna assume that I've got nephews at that point. I'll pay a nephew to just do that for me. Um I mean nephew Yeah yeah yeah not just not just a nephew. I mean like in this scenario I have a nephew. I don't currently have a nephew, but let's say I let's say one of my Cousins gets it together and you know does that. Oh wait, no, that wouldn't count, would it? Yeah, sorry. Um it'd have to be my brother. That's not gonna happen either. Okay, there will be no nephew. The nephew is completely figurative, but Let's say someone else would have to sort this out because it's more faff than I like. So I know that for you you'd you'd hate it, and I don't think it's a good fit at all. The play date, in theory, makes much more sense because it's sorta like It's I don't want to say it's Nintendo like, but the idea of a novel control scheme is quite Nintendo like. And so I wondered if that was behind why you were at least curious about the play date, even if it's not completely won you over, you know?

Matthew
21:24
Yeah, I think it it was clearly made by Nintendo fans and slight slightly kind of more kind of hipstery Nintendo fans, I think, but the idea of like quite a strange form factor bespoke control scheme. I mean this thing's got you know it's got the buttons, it's got the crank, but it also has accelerometers and microphones as well. So it's it's quite kind of all singing, all dancing. The interface is is very Nintendo-ish. The st all the stuff people complain about with the Switch and the Switch 2 having kind of lost that creative spirit that even existed in like the Wii U and 3DS and then they basically stopped doing i you know, it's i it's like people had that thought, but then were able to to kind of put it to some use in designing the interface of this thing. So like You know, when you wake it up, for example, you know, when you press the power button, it's got like a pair of eyes on the screen and you have to press the power button twice and it kind of opens one eye and then the other eye and it's like the console, you know, literally waking up. And uh another thing about the play date, if people don't know this, is that y uh you can subscribe to a season of content, so it would uh download games on a weekly basis, and when those arrive they arrive in like wrapping paper on your uh like main menu screen and the wrapping paper is like uh bespoke design for that game, I think. They seem to have some thematic connection. And when you open it, you know, a pair of robotic arms come in and uh uh you know, undo a bow and it it plays like a little kind of bada bada kind of sound and you know it's it's all that stuff that people kind of took for granted a bit on Nintendo platforms but are are now quite affectionate of you know about and sad that it's not there so you know the the 3DS e shop with the the little shopping line of like download data kind of dropping into the box and all all that kind of stuff. Like it it feels like it was made by people who are Who are hugely into that. I do like that stuff. I mean, I don't think it's ever like the sole reason to buy a handheld device is that every once in a while it does one second of cute thing. Which is what that like unwrapping thing is. Uh it's kinda it's kinda like a nice extra touch. It sort of goes above and beyond. But at the end of the day, like it it does kinda come down to How good are the games and experiences and and that's why for my money, like I don't mourn that stuff as much as some of my other Nintendo fan uh uh you know, Nintendo peers, for example. Because, you know, for my money, like Switch and Switch 2, as long as they give me the good games, I don't really care. You know, like that's that's really what I need. But i y you know, I know some people it's more of a thing, so that stuff's gonna hit better, I think.

Samuel
24:22
Yeah, I mean, I can't I I don't know if the Switch experience would be greatly improved by unwrapping, you know, the calculator app or, you know, um one of those or or like the clock app or whatever. Um but I definitely um I take your point. Like I like those things too because Generally speaking, if you were buying something on 3DS and you got that little parcel, you knew it was gonna be a treat inside. You know, it was gonna be a virtual console game, it was gonna be you know, something that mostly felt like it was sort of you know, chosen by Nintendo or Nintendo approved or whatever. Um because I don't think many people bought shovelware on 3DS. I think they did buy old games and they bought the digital exclusive games and You know, yeah, it was a it was a nice thing. Um yeah, those are those are nice touches and it's interesting to hear that that's what they've kind of like um they've done with the with the interface side of things because I I didn't really know anything about that. I knew about the seasons of games. And I knew that they'd had a first season when uh just after they launched and then they've had a a second season recently, right? And so that's where it finds itself now. Um can I ask Well, I was gonna ask you First of all, I want to ask about the size of the hardware, because you've alluded to this a lot, that you have gigantic hands, and we are large men, as documented many times in this podcast. How fucking tiny is this thing? Because I think I expected it to be game not Game Boy colour size, but maybe like a size down from that. Um like GBA SP size or something like that, but it's not. It's apparently much smaller.

Matthew
25:56
Uh yeah, I mean I I guess it is yeah, it is smaller. I don't have them to hand, so um it's bigger than a c uh than a Game Boy Micro. Uh the screen. I m in my head anyway, uh that it it is. It's like yeah, the GBA SP, the s the s the the the flip screen one. It's like the without the flip, it's like one half of that and it's got the controls and the screen on it. Fucking hell, that is tiny. Yeah, right. Yeah. And it and it it's properly like it makes me f Like genuinely, this is what I feel whenever I'm playing it is I f I feel like I I look like Shrek. Like I I feel like a real Shrek hunching over some dirt you know like a bit in one of the Shrek films where he's given like some fine China and he's pretend to not be a Shrek. Like that's how I feel with this thing is like look at that idiot Shrek over there who's got that piece of technology that isn't for him. That idiot Shrek That's that's how I feel. So it's two things. It's really, really small. So actually like holding it and getting a comfortable grip on it. Like the buttons are very, very small to press. So you feel like your thumbs are are really having to sort of um negotiate purchase on the buttons for for starters. But the the double whammy and the thing that makes it extra hard is because obviously because the screen's not backlit It's very, very hard to see unless you have a very bright light on the screen. Oh no. Like the original GPA. Oh, yeah, I'm that's the thing. It's like emulated those Nintendo things right down to like all the fucking horrible bits as well. As if to s I I don't know if that's deliberate, like a well we we missed that stuff too. And it's like, I really didn't miss that stuff No one missed that. So like playing it is you know, the first bit of any game is I have to angle it to try and get the most light like The in the in my house I play it uh sitting up on my bed and I've got a side table lamp which I direct straight at the screen. In the office there's a chair in the corner next to a window and I have to I have to sort of angle it forty-five degrees in my hand in order to catch the sun. Like you're really doing manoeuvres like that. It's uh you have to angle I pr and then hold it very still because you've got the one angle where you can actually see the motherfucker. Right. That combined with how small it is, it just makes it feel like this tiny weird little thing that just kind of like owns you. Like you have to you have to bend over backwards to accommodate it. And that to me is very frustrating. Like no matter how much I like some of the games I'm always aware of like I kind of fucking hate the form factor of this. Like it just f it feels terrible to me. And I can't like and I know smaller people with smaller hands probably didn't have that, but like it's It's it's really tough. Um and uh I kind of wish I'd known that before I committed to this episode.

Samuel
28:53
Well at least they have to

Matthew
28:58
Yeah.

Samuel
28:58
Isn't it s it's like two hundred and I should get the exact price here, but I think it's something like two hundred and twenty-five dollars or something like that. Um playdate price. Let me just get that so I'm not just fucking Two hundred and twenty nine dollars. Um I think that price went up um because of uh the you know two nightmare world that we live in now where everything's going up in price. And so um if you import that and you're s and you're you know you pay the import charges, that's like about two hundred quid. Right. And so You're going to be paying 200 quid for a device with no backlight, which I actually don't think is okay personally. Like I want to be able to see that fucking screen. You know, is that Is that too much to ask? I think for the cost, that's fair enough. What do you think?

Matthew
29:41
Yeah, I'm gonna assume the decisions that were made were to get it that small and get it into that very precise form factor. you know, it feels quite dense. Like it it feels quite luxury. I don't think they've like s you know skimps on anything. But you know, if they were like uh you know, it would have a backlight, but it'd be twenty percent bigger than it currently is. I'd be like one hundred percent, you know, let's let's do that. If anything, it getting bigger to accommodate more feature would just make the whole thing more usable. Like if it was the size or had the f the shape of like the original Game Boy or something, I'd be much happier. Cause it's so thin as well. You know, it's like playing on a piece of toast or something. Like it's yeah, it's it's really strange. I'm like a a I I don't know if people have just like forced their hands to like adapt to it or they had smaller hands to begin with. Or I I don't really know what's going on because you can't find many play date reviews online where the person's just like This thing is really compromised because of its size. But I so I yeah, I d I just don't I just don't think it's it's giant man friendly at all.

Samuel
30:51
Oh, interesting.

Matthew
30:52
And and and I think the thing about it as well is What leans into that is that certain games end up making more sense on it than others. Just because like If it becomes quite painful to play after a certain amount of time, that's gonna push you towards like shorter arcadia experiences. So I don't know, like you know, when when we talk about the games, if the ones I enjoyed more are like the consensus games or just the ones which sort of fitted in my slightly balked use of the things because it has, I would say, some more traditional genres on there. Um so like occasionally uh you know that people will try like like point and clip games and visual novels, but it's like a visual novel where the font size is like font size three on a Google Doc because it's the screen's that small. And that's that's the other crazy thing. If you play this thing for more than fifteen minutes, when you look away from it the and look at your phone, your phone looks giant. compared to it because your eyes have adapted to looking at like the ant game console. Um 'cause this happened at the airport on holiday. I was playing it in the thing and I looked at my phone and I genuinely my phone felt like an eye iPad in my hands. I was like, oh my god, the font is so blown out and broken. What's happened to my phone? You're like, oh no, it's it's this little games console's broken my eyes. I and again that makes it sound worse than it probably is. Well it's i you know, I'm a big guy and it's small. You know, it's not a it's not a shocker that this is the outcome.

Samuel
32:20
Yeah, I know, but it it is interesting because I think that In theory, I mean I get why no one's mega critical of this, because you know, it is trying to do something novel by creating a set of limitations. and a particular interface. It's trying to invite developers to do something quite particular. And so on that level, the idea of like an indie game console that's doing that, a game handheld that's doing that. It is like a you know, it is a great principle, uh the great a great set of principles to build something, but if it's the if the if it's not nice to use, then I that kind of makes it an automatic veil for me. I mean So I I've not bought one, right? And I b as listeners to this podcast will know, um, I buy all kinds of nonsense in service of this podcast. You know, that's like what I do. That's been the thing I've done for a long time. Even I wouldn't pull the trigger on this though, because I just felt like I would buy it, I would play it once, and then I would not touch it again. Um even even with like the the sexiest games in the world coming out on this thing or coming from developers who I find genuinely interesting and there are there are some making games for this thing but I still just felt like it's got the slight whiff of a novelty device about it. Um and so uh yeah.

Matthew
33:40
Yeah, I uh I'd say from afar I I de I I definitely thought that, but actually the the kind of The commitment to the hardware and like what people have actually made on it, you know, the range of games is quite impressive. The general like production quality of them is quite impressive. Like in my in my head I thought this was gonna be like kind of like a purely hobbyist thing. Like I don't think anyone in their right mind is like betting their financial future on being a play date developer. Um, you know, I d I just don't think it necessarily has like the install base for that. But I thought it was gonna be quite kind of throwaway things. But actually, you know, the you know, the meat of what I've played uh has been you know, pretty flashy and and uh you're I'm often struck by kind of how advanced the the graphics are or the 2D animations are and the screen while very very hard to see Um, it is incredibly sharp and it that there is something quite kind of like high definition about it, like when you can see it and you get it right, and the graphics are so small on it, but they're so ornate and detailed that it it does end up looking quite kind of sleek and polished and things feel very uh sort of expensive on it. So uh yeah it's it's just weird because In like I was saying, how certain things fit it better. Like it is capable of doing like, you know, there are like some four hour narrative experiences on there and, you know, you know, some quite kind of ambitious productions in that sense. But I think it definitely suits kind of little snacky kind of five minute, ten-minute ideas that you kind of come back to. Um and it's just interesting seeing like where different people have landed and and what they've made and uh you know, through the seasons, which is obviously the content that Panic themselves are pushing through their subscriptions, like Is that meant to be the the highlight of the console? Is that them going, this is everything we see playdate being, or is it just like here's ten cool things? you know, I'm not entirely sure of what their philosophy is behind it, you know, if you try and reverse engineer what play date is by the the playdate that they push. Um 'cause you know, and then at the other end of the scale there's this y uh, you know, every play date they say is a play date dev kit and it has uh you know, quite a user-friendly um game software that you can get on your PC called pulp, which lets you make playdate games quite quickly and on it, you know, it's definitely uh in i i you know, y user friendly in the kind of the hobbyist space. You know, I was looking at it online and looking at some of the tutorials and thought, oh you know what, with a bit of time I could probably make something for that. Like that that seems very doable. It's called pulp as well. Judge Castle would approve of that I think, you know? Yeah. Well I d uh but there is something quite cool about oh here's something that does feel you know, quite legit. You know, it's this branded thing, it's made by quite a big company, it gets quite a big push, but like anyone who has one can make a game that plays on it. I mean that isn't true of a Nintendo console. There's like a bit of magic in that idea, I guess. Like how kind of open it is. That's probably the more interesting like indie side of it. Sorry, that was a rambling question. I've lost sight of what the original question was.

Samuel
37:05
Um it's been so I so long I've forgotten as well, to be honest. But um I mean I will give some context on how it's um well I guess I was asking you what you thought of my take on it. And so You know, I I guess like one thing I would say is that it's for for how relatively uh successful it is, it I would say that the Discussion around it is but it's a little bit devil's advocate-ish, right? But let's say disproportionate to how much it's generated. I feel like I hear quite a lot about playdate from press. Um and it has generated as of April um this year over one million power uh one million dollars to developers. Developers have made that from it. Which is not really much, you know. w one moderately successful indie game on Steam, right? Exactly. And you know, they have sold a h uh as of last last April they were saying that 150,000 games had been sold on there, but obviously you know the games are not sold for very much money. And at that point they said that they'd made um they'd there was like 544,000 in revenue made. So it's consistently made the same. each year, which suggests that the people who are engaged with it are engaged with it. But in April um twenty twenty four, th or no the beginning of twenty twenty four, they said that it had sold seventy thousand units of the thing. And I think we can probably draw the conclusion that it's still must have sold under about un probably under a quarter of a million units. Right. And remains a very niche thing. So I guess what I'm saying is I don't think it's the only measure of whether something's important is whether it sell sells well. I definitely don't believe that. But it's interesting that I think press are quite behind this and find it interesting. But I wonder if it really is discovering all the people it either needs to or deserves to, or like all the people who would be engaged with it, or whether it's finding its place, I guess. Um, just because that seems like such a low amount. Um, but that's again, I'm not saying that's the only sort of barometer, but I was curious what you you made of that. The fact that, you know, when they announced that second season of games, quite a lot of coverage for it. You know, I think um everyone knew at least one of the developers who was involved with the season of games. So there was that factor to it as well. But, you know, it's Yeah yeah, it it's sort of almost outsized to how much money it's made, you know?

Matthew
39:22
Yeah, it's it's definitely been like legitimized by some of the developers involved with it. Like there's always someone cool you know, who you've heard of and who you've liked their other work making a game for it at any given time. Like for ages it was, oh, Lucas Pope's making Mars After Midnight, so if you loved uh Oberdin and you loved Papers Please. Like, his next exclusive game is on Play Day. And that's like originally that was the thing that made me thought, oh maybe I should get one of those. 'Cause, you know, of course I want to play the next game from Mr. Oberdin, and I guess with season two it was probably um I think it's one of the people from subset games. um made Fulk Fulcrum Defender and you're like, oh that's cool, you know, the next yeah we haven't had a game, you know, FTL and Into the Breach. Like what's what what have they been up to? Um so that's that's definitely part of it. Um I think for the same reason that that that thing I was saying about like that it taps into this quite kind of like oddborn Nintendo energy. You know, that definitely has a lot of fans like within games media and people who kind of lament the lack of that. So you know, those people feel like kind of natural kind of allies to it. uh and will promote it. Like a lot of sites seem to have like a big playdate head on there. You know, you can find quite a lot of review coverage for it. Um, you know, definitely people were reviewing the the seasons. Um I think it was N Gadget, has like loads of playdate coverage, you know, both within the seasons and outside it. Um so you know that's just someone whose personal taste it it connects with. I imagine it appeals to people that the games are quite short, like even the the longer experiences are like two, three hours, um, which is quite good for like, well I have to get a piece of work up so I can play through that and get it up there. You know, that may sound cynical, but I think that factors into some people's workloads. Um Yeah, uh you know, and I think, you know, at a time when there is a lot of chat about discoverability issues and just how many games there are, there is something quite attractive about you know, something that through its seasons feels a bit more curated, or or maybe just through like the relative size of the library, big but not like overwhelming. that it feels kind of like manageable and it feels quite self-contained and it feels like you can kind of get a grip on it. Um and I I'd say both for people making games I would imagine that would appeal as like, well why not why not take a little punt on this. and people writing about games, you know, it feels like it's a beat. You can kind of get your head around quite easily. Uh I think that th th th I mean it those were definitely things that jump out to me as like factors in why it's quite talked about. I think panic are quite good cheerleaders for it. Um you know they treat it like it is a a big platform, you know, they do like playdate directs and they send out fucking tons of press releases, I know 'cause I get them. You know, and and all that stuff kind of helps and it feels like they're in the corner of the people making games. They're very like they're very good champions of of the games themselves. You know, they seem to understand that like That is like the only show in town, so kind of pushing that stuff makes sense. It it does f it it maybe feels overblown in our particular like sphere that we exist in.

Samuel
42:54
Uh but Yeah, uh it's not even it's not even overblown, but I was kind of curious to dissect the, you know, what the fascination is. And I think all those factors do make sense. Um but yeah, it's just it's just interesting 'cause when you really look at the numbers, it is tiny. And so I think even I would say that even if you asked s someone who didn't know the numbers but knows what the playdate is, how many do you think the playdate is sold? I don't think anyone would go as low as 70,000, for example. Or like a you know, it just seems so tiny. And yeah, it's um it's just interesting because I think I th I think I thought It might be a bigger deal than that, you know? It might be a sell one million units kind of thing. There might be enough fascination with indie games or the idea of a platform that is indie game centric. But it just seems like it's such a small deal, relatively speaking, to the rest of games, which surprised me a little bit, you know.

Matthew
43:50
Um Yeah, I mean then you've got you know, it it seems like more of a triumph for you know however p panic have chosen to talk about it. Um because it you know, they have kind of punched above their weight and Yeah, like it's fun I you know, you keep thinking like, you know, you got the edge cover or you know, a while back. Actually that could've that would've you know, based on how many they've sold, that would have made like a decent dent, you know, that could have bumped those numbers up like quite a quite a nice amount. Like it's It's quite a good like print-sized endeavor, this. Um Yeah. Yeah.

Samuel
44:24
Print is print is kind of perfect for in that respect. But I sort of wonder, like, I think that like The the podcast in a given year, for us, I think would pay out about 10% of what you know the play date has to developers, which is when you think of it like that It just seems so small time, you know. I you know what? I'm gonna stop banging on about this because it seems like I've got a beer in my bonnet. I really don't. I'm just like I think I thought this was a much bigger deal until I looked at the numbers and I was like it's wow, it is so niche this, you know.

Matthew
44:57
Just from like a cursory glance of reading kind of, you know, Reddit forums and and um Reddit forums, Reddit pages about about playdate and just trying to get a sense of like what I should be playing on it. A lot of people haven't really ventured too much outside of the seasons, like season one and season two, and there's a big gap between them. I so I wonder if there is a you know, I wonder if that's not harmed it as such, but has like limited how people interact with it, that they think of it as as like a subscribe you know, I subscribe to this thing, I give it thirty quid every so often, and it gives me all these games, but I don't really go shopping for games in between. Like th there are there is a catalogue of games that you can buy individual titles from. Uh you know, and it's seems to be growing quite well and it seems to have quite a lot of editorial support from Panic. Like there are sort of like Games of the Month and Games of the Year. I think they have their own internal sort of awards ceremony. Actually it reminds me a little bit of like how media molecule treated dreams, for example. Like a similar similar level, clearly championed by some very very smart people who were supporting it behind the scenes. But, you know, you also go into those Reddit threads, if they're not talking about the games that are in the seasons, a lot of the recommendations still centre on like the same handful of games. So I feel I feel like that's probably not helping things. Like maybe it already has its own discoverability problems in that everyone's circling, you know, like Everyone went for the Lucas Pope one 'cause it's made by Lucas Pope. Yeah, you know, regardless of whether it's necessarily the best game on play date. So You know, maybe maybe it's also a little bit it is as it ever was.

Samuel
46:35
Yeah, I mean uh so the thing that I've been most interested to ask you Um in a sort of run up to this, is that the second season of these games has basically been rolling out why you've been preparing for this episode. Yeah. And so I'd really love to know where you started with your perception of playdate and and how the release of that second season of games affected your perception of it if it if it did at all.

Matthew
47:01
Uh before I even went into the second season, like I I most of the things that were downloaded on it were the first season of games. And I dipped into a lot of those and found them quite kind of th throwaway and they almost felt m more like sort of early prototypes. There are a couple of bigger ideas in there, but I was like, uh, is season two gonna be more of this? I mean season two is notably smaller than season one and I think what that brings with it is maybe like a s a s I would say a slightly higher quality bar on season two. And as it went along, I thought it was quite a good Quite a good advert for play day, actually. You know, lo and behold, the the best advert for play day is playing some good games on play day and y you become willing to kind of push through some of the technical limitations. Um I think the games they selected were Um quite well judged in terms of like genre mix, control mix. Some of them were like very crank heavy, some of them were a bit more like trad Game Boy buttons, uh a lot of them mix the two together. But like you can't I think you come out the end of like s of a shorter season two with a much better idea of what playdate's about than I think you would with the season one, which was like longer but also kind of messier and more confusing. That's interesting. Okay, so yeah. Um wow the one the the w so the one thing I will say about season two is it came with this bonus th thing. I don't know if you call it a game called Blippo Plus. Have you heard about Blippo? I do not I've not heard about Blippo. I'm not aware of the works of Blippo. It's a bit like Hit in the Space Outlaw. And it's like a f it's like a fake t it's like a load of fake TV channels, but it's kind of got a similar kind of like slightly cursed sort of nineties vibe as Hit in the Space Outlaw. They're rendered with some kind of like dithering effect. So it's like FMV, but in monochrome and dithering. So obviously get the the file sizes right down. So it's about as like low resolution videos as you can get, but they are like human actors in them So they've wanna see filmed loads of material and it's just like a fake TVing network that you watch.

Samuel
49:18
Oh, like the Rick and Morty interdimensional cable. thing that sort of vibe to it.

Matthew
49:22
Uh I don't know what that is. So

Samuel
49:24
Well I c I can imagine what that is. Well it's it's basically they're watching TV but they got a cable box that goes across different dimensions and so every time they change the channel something random comes on that's got the whiff of like someone in the writer's room suggesting really silly ideas in a row.

Matthew
49:39
That sounds quite spot on, but like that had its almost that had its own season that like ran alongside season two, so each week the channels would update and there'd be like new episodes of things. I quite like the sound of that To be honest.

Samuel
49:55
But it depends on how good the actual video content is, right?

Matthew
49:58
I I wasn't into it.

Samuel
50:01
I was getting that idea, yeah.

Matthew
50:02
I to me it it it it felt like terminally online. Like it it felt like a real kind of post Tim and Eric, sort of I think I think you should leave kind of thing. You know, it it was uh n just not my cup of tea at all And people seem to have gone nuts for it. Like in across all the reviews, people are like, well, whatever you think about season two, you know, at least Blipo Plus, am I right? And I'm like, oh man. I found that really hard work. I I dipped into it like three or four times and noped out every time and maybe that's just cause I you know, it's humor very very uh subjective um but it did make me feel like a bit of a misery guts that I wasn't like all in on this thing. Like I was I was thinking oh if this really landed, if this was like as funny as Tim and Eric, which is very similar to that in tone. Um like this would be great, like a load of sketches that I update every week. Um I think of I think there's like a f a full priced version of this coming out on Steam. But I uh yeah, that was that was just constantly there kind of I don't know. My playdate seemed to be constantly updating with new stuff and it was always like more blip o plus nonsense.

Samuel
51:15
Eleven weeks of blippo plus is tough if you don't like week one of blip okay.

Matthew
51:26
If you were into it, it would it would probably be really Exciting.

Samuel
51:36
In some ways that doesn't that communicate the niche nature of the handheld more generally? The idea that We're gonna have a flagship TV show with this and the humour is gonna be so online it will only speak to a subset of people. That almost tells me that like A a lot about how niche the platform is designed to be, you know what I mean?

Matthew
51:56
Yeah, it's just a lot of people who spend too much time on weird Twitter, which like isn't for me. I'm like dad jokes Twitter. You know this about me. You've seen my tweets.

Samuel
52:06
Yeah, but I think you've got a really good sense of humour. I think you you laugh at things that are genuinely funny. And I think that Even when like weird Twitter like thing is I I I wasn't a huge I think you should leave person, but I saw that film Friendship as we discussed in the XXL. I thought it was amazing. And I think you still know what a good version of a a a joke from a certain type of humor is, you know, or of a certain type of humor. Yeah. And so yeah, I think that you can still it's a bit like how I don't really get on with those devolver directs. You know it's a similar I imagine Blipo Plus is like watching those, you know. It's quite it's quite like that.

Matthew
52:42
It's yes, it's it's like that except yeah, deal uh served up in little doses over two months. And also you're watching it on a games console the size of a postage stamp, which you have to angle just right in order to even see what's happening on screen. That is terrifying. Like that's the best thing. You're not in the the right mind to be entertained when you're already struggling like that. Make me laugh, funny people, and Yeah, I've climbed into bed.

Samuel
53:13
Yeah, I've climbed into bed. I've got my bedside lamp pointed at this thing. Let's la I'm ready to laugh. Let's go, Blipho Plus. And then just silence um for eleven consecutive weeks. Okay, so well that's inter it's interesting they did that. Like I like the I admire the swing of doing that. You know, even if it didn't if it even it didn't work out. But I suppose Matthew, let's I think let's get to discussing the games. So you've kind of talked top line there that maybe there's a bit of feeling out what the platform was with season one and then a bit more confidence of what they should be doing going into season two. And like you say, they've got this, you know, they've they've worked with developers who people have have heard of. um and you know and have got them making exciting new projects for for this um platform with the the limitations that that platform has so You know, I'd love to just hear about what you've been playing, what you recommend, and what you think isn't worth playing at all. Like uh sort of what's your your assessment of the actual catalogue? Yeah. Um big question, I know.

Matthew
54:14
Yeah, it it is. And obviously I've only played like a fraction of this. There's there's hundreds of these things, if if not thousands. Um Uh so I'll I'll start with some of the season two stuff as that's I would imagine if you're picking one of these up you probably feel tempted to sort to drop the coin on a season and get that kind of curated content. So I really liked Fulcrum Defender, which like I say is uh from Jane Maher of Subset Games. Uh basically You control a gun turret in the middle of the screen, uh which you aim by spinning the crank. Rotating the crank spins the gun turret uh uh 360 degrees. Little s ob uh squares and triangles and circles are kind of moving towards the center of the screen. If they reach you, that hurts your shields. Um you shoot. your gun turret with the D pad, so yeah. You're kind of shooting with the D pad, but rotating the crank to aim your gun turret I was about to say it's very minimalist. They're all very minimalist. It's on this like monochrome scream, so it's quite abstract. I don't need to say that for each of these games. It's got an amazing soundtrack um by Aaron Cheroff who made the the music to Cobalt Core. Oh I mean now we're talking. I think I might like Tick, just 'cause it's like more music from him and it's something to do while listening to his music. Uh but it's also quite neat in that, you know, after every wave of enemies you get to buy a little upgrade. It's kind of got that sort of roguelike structure of like, you know It serves up different things you can buy so you can improve your base turret, but then you can also start buying weapons that you put on like left and right on the D-pad. And some of them are kind of got their own crank controls. You can get this second like little drone which you pilot by using the crank. Um I'm terrible at that thing just fucking crashes and does nothing for me. But uh yeah, it's it's you know very simple, lasts for ten minutes, high score challenge, then goes into like an endless mode, but That's exactly what I want from it. It's like ten minutes of fun from this thing. It's about it's it's it's probably like the the m the the mood it puts me in. Yeah, just mechanically tight, the upgrades are interesting as you would expect from um one of the makers of FTL and Into the Breach. It's it's a good it's it's uh it's a banger, that one.

Samuel
56:35
That's good to hear. You want the ones with the big names to land because if they feel like they're wrong for the platform, it just seems like a waste of getting that talent to to even make games for it, you know?

Matthew
56:46
But also like the idea that someone 'cause I don't think I got the impression this was like a s little like side project that they worked on. I kinda like the idea of like You know, I don't need to make something m massive and complicated. I can just make I can have a little fun idea but explore it with my good eye for design and and just really like land it. Um yeah, it's good. More of that please Um the other one I really liked was from season two was Otto's Galactic Groove, which is a rhythm game where the crank controls like a little tab on the right side of the screen that goes up and down as you move the crank and then as notes they come from the left, as they hit that hit it, um you press the D pad to play the notes. Um sometimes they're just individual notes so you're just tapping them out. Sometimes they're long and they've got like bendy trails on them and you have to move the cranks so that you kind of trace the line of it. Um but the the music's very nicely matched to uh like the movement of it, you know, like as as the notes change and warp. It it fits the kind of notation really well. Also the music itself Quite high quality, loads of light bangers in there. Um I would say a little bit like um jet set radio-e. Kinda like like fun kind of remixes use lots of weird samples. Just very lots of little like jolly bops Hmm, that one's good. I like a little rhythm game. That one feels quite highly produced. It's got like quite a nice story mode. One of the weird things that happens playing Play Day is Even in the limited time I played it, you can see that there are certain genre conventions emerging across the whole library of like accepted ways to do certain things. So one of them is loads of people do scrolling comic book panels, storytelling cutscenes where you move the crank to like move along a comic book.

Samuel
58:40
Oh that's interesting.

Matthew
58:41
Yeah that happens in that happened in like yeah six or seven different games they played and you're like, oh everyone just agrees this is a thing, right? Yeah yeah yeah. Uh so that's yeah that's that's kind of that's kind of interesting. There was a quite cool little Metroidvania in season two called Tiny Turnip where the crank sort of rotates these mechanical arms attached to a turnip. and then pressing the button kind of like grips on and then you use the crank to move the other hand and you grip on. So you end up climbing. I guess a bit like the monkey suit in Astrobot. One hand goes up and you grip and then the other hand goes up and you grip. It's like that, but with a crank. And as the game goes on, you get new powers which give you new forms. So there's like a form where the arms vanish and you just become just a turnip and then you roll it along the floor uh with the crank and what I liked about it is like I'm pretty sure it saves your progress on like every screen. that you you know it's it's a big Metrovania like backtracking map. But any progress you made is banked as like permanent progress. Which actually fits the I may only want to play five minutes of this. You know, I'll go in there, I'll puzzle my way through a couple of screens, and then we'll get out. Um there's a lot of like screen by screen design. There's not a lot of things where things like flow neatly across. It's very like self-contained. I don't know if that's like a technical limitation or like part of the engine that everyone's, you know, using, but it but i an accidental after effect of that or side effect is that There are some genres that you might think are a bit too chewy for this kind of device that actually get turned into quite sort of snackable versions of themselves. Hmm. Tiny turnip. That's a winner. Interesting. It doesn't have much writing in it either, which that's always a win. Because it it's gonna kill my eyes.

Samuel
01:00:36
Oh, I can imagine it's got the kind of development community who like a bit of narrative. Am I am I wrong there, Matthew?

Matthew
01:00:43
It's yeah. There's a little bit of gabbin between like do we really need to talk between these like fucking motorbike stunts or whatever But what if you what if you could talk to the turnips, Matthew? You know? It's uh I quite like the tiny turnip. It's quite characterful f as turnips go. Like it hasn't got eyes or anything. It's just the turnip attached to two arms.

Samuel
01:01:14
A bit sort of 90s Capcom ish is uh one comparison I saw. Um I can sort of see it. It looks like it could be a Game Boy game, were it not for the the actual climbing animations being quite smooth, you know? Yeah.

Matthew
01:01:27
Yeah, and the the motion of it as well. It's quite similar to um there was Donkey Kong's King of Swing, which I think was the GBA and DS Donkey Kong's um which had that kind of like one arm up the other arm up. If it was quite well judged for a portable. Some other things I liked th I'd say those were the three that I really liked in season two There were other things which I thought were like fine. There are a couple which I thought were quite bad. There's one in season 2 called The White Out. Which is like a point and click game, sort of post-apocalyptic, but a bit like Cormac McCarthy's The Road, down and dirty sort of abandoned somewhere in America, i you know, nothing too out out there, but I felt very, very overwritten. Lots of like plodding text just felt a bit angsty and bad and not a very interesting point and click game because it just felt like the puzzle was finding like the hotspots where objects were hidden rather than doing anything particularly interesting with them. Graphically impressive, like it looks quite neat in motion. But this sort of slightly sad man trudging around the snow trying to find fucking screwdrivers or whatever, I like it was a bit of a it was a no from me dog

Samuel
01:02:43
I s it just sounds a bit ambitious for the canvas you've got, you know? Whereas something like Tidy Turnip looks like it's really like make use the canvas as a strength as opposed to trying to fight it by doing Yeah doing narrative in other bits, you know?

Matthew
01:02:59
I mean this is this is It's gonna sound like a huge generalization, but I I I didn't really play anything that was too narrative focused that I did like. Like my least favorite games on it were Yeah, probably that white out. There's our visual novel called Echoes of the Emergent, which is just like static images and very tiny text, and sitting there reading that for like you know, four hours or whatever. I mean I didn't do that. I gave up after like ten hours uh ten minutes 'cause it was it was c clear that's where it was going. But like just trying to angle text that I couldn't read uh reading slightly dower prose. Uh that was that was a huge, huge turn off for me.

Samuel
01:03:40
Can I ask, how many how many games do you get with season two?

Matthew
01:03:42
I think it's ten.

Samuel
01:03:44
Ten or twelve? And it's thirty quid you say or about That's I mean that's not bad, is it? That's do you think I was gonna ask if you think that the advent calendar nature of that makes it like does that m mitigate it when you find a game that you don't like?

Matthew
01:04:00
This this thing had was loaded up with loads of games that like Catherine had put on it. Um which slightly skewed my like idea of like worth, I think, because It's interesting you said UFO fifty, like it picking it up full of all these little games, it was quite like that. I didn't really know what to commit to. I was just playing like five minutes of loads of stuff and if it gripped me enough then I'd give it like half hour and then if I really liked it I'd carry on playing it. And so it all felt quite kinda bitty. From what I've played of those games There's there's probably like thirty quids worth of interesting stuff there.

Samuel
01:04:39
I guess then uh I'd uh do you have any more sort of like games that you didn't think worked, um that you wanted to to mention in the mix here.

Matthew
01:04:46
Well not from season two. Oh there was this awful thing called Resident Tale, which I think is quite celebrated, but like Imagine there are lots of like Lynx Awakening style top-down monochrome games, you know, walking around those kind of maps. Um this one is probably the closest to Wink Link's Awakening in that you wake up on a beach and then the island you're on seems very very similar to to Colin Island and except it's already on that tiny screen. But also imagine if Link's Awakening was zoomed out by maybe like a factor of ten. Oh, imagine if you think was it was a pixel.

Samuel
01:05:26
It's funny you said that, because the second you said that, I opened a page that um on the Playdate website that had the 2023 Playdate Community Awards, Best Adventure Game, Outstanding Technical Inner Pulp Um Game and Outstanding Pulp Game of the Year winner. And then I looked right at the screenshots and I thought How fuck it I need my glasses to even look at these screenshots. Where is the main character? I can't see them. Um but you're right, so like even the text is very Lynx Awakening, but It looks like someone turned Link's Awakening into an RTS at first glimpse, you know Yeah, that was that was tough.

Matthew
01:06:03
Um the really annoying thing with that is every time you walk up to the signposts, if you don't approach them from the front, it goes, Oh, you can't read it because you didn't approach it from the front. It's like dude I can't even see that that's a signpost that's so small. That's just another door. I thought that was a person. That's a signpost. I thought that was my love interest.

Samuel
01:06:21
Hahaha Amazing Uh that's uh that's interesting then to see that there are like consensus games that people like, but if like you know, like you you're you're struggling a bit with the form factor. You just totally fucking bounce on it, you know? Um Yeah, but that was one where I was like, I can't believe people think this is is this is good, like this.

Matthew
01:06:42
I mean unless something crazy happens and like there's a gimmick where you can zoom in later. I don't know, but I was I I really no doubt. And 'cause that like there are there are a couple other games I really liked that are, you know, much more you know, li like Link's Awakening and to the proportions. I think there was one which was from season one called Ratch Ratcheteer where it's basically Link's Awakening, except you've got a big wrench and you can use it to like spin nuts and bolts to kind of like change the layouts of certain dungeons. So But that that is like very, very zeldery in in its like visual density, but I f I found it like just about readable compared to yeah that that other one. The weirdest thing, my so my favourite game on Playdate I don't think needs to be on there at all. I think it would be a banger wherever it was. Which is there's a card game on there called Spilled Mushrooms Okay. You have like a deck of animal cards and you have to send them to these these locations to collect mushrooms. and you have like a week to collect all the mushrooms from these location cards, so seven turns basically. But all the animals have different behaviors, all the locations have different modifiers on them. And it ch it was just incredibly compelling. Like that's the one I played the most of. Like it was yeah, very, very Moorish. The rules were super tight. Had it reminded me a little bit of like the puzzle stages in um The Witcher Thronebreaker when they did like the puzzle variations on Gwent. Yeah, that was It does look good. Yeah, it was just great. And you're like, oh that's just but also there was nothing about that that meant it was better on play date. Like if anything, having to use the crank To like read the information on the card. I think you move the crank to like zoom in on the cards or something like that. That's like a bigger pain in the ass. You're like just get that fucking thing on Steam. That game would be huge, you know? So yeah, like that that's a weird one 'cause it's just like a so just someone made a good button controlled game and happened to put it only on play date? Um I don't know what what it was about Playdate that inspired them. Maybe it was just like the visual style, like the arts easier to pull off for them, or I don't know. What whatever, but Spilled mushrooms, that's an absolute banger. I c I liked the Lucas Pope one. I didn't love it. Oh interesting. So what's the deal with this one? So this is Mars After Midnight. It's much more like Papers please, Lucas Pope, than Oberdin. You are like the you're kind of running like a monster sort of therapy group. And you live in this city of monsters, and the first phase of it is that you look through the kind of door slot at the monster, and you have to decide whether they're the right kind of monster to come in for that night's therapy group. So it'd be like tonight cyclops night or whatever. And so you have to look through the slot and like move the camera around to see like, oh, this guy's got two eyes, he's not a cyclops, he's not coming in. So that's quite papers please, the do they kind of like have the credentials to get in. And then once they're in, it's like a Like this weird efficiency exercise where you're running the kind of food and drink for the therapy group. And you just have to like clean plates and make sure everyone gets fed properly and that everyone has a good time and then you get money from that. Like the better job you do, you get better money, and then you use that money to like advertise the next night's therapy group and so on and so forth. It's quite like a mechanical kind of cold planning exercise, which is why I say it's more papers please than like Oberdin. I kinda like, but I'm not like in love with that that idea. Yeah, it's sort of this isn't included in a season, right? No, this is one yeah, they sold this one separately and Like beautifully made absolutely amazing animation like it uses every feature of the device like it's a it is a proper like you know, if there is a triple A playdate game there's a a Wii Sports of uh of the of the PlayStation. But the actual I don't know, I wasn't particularly uh sort of entranced by the the kind of core idea of like which are these monsters to help.

Samuel
01:11:06
I will say that the things I've discovered in the background while you've been talking about these games I've been looking them up, right? Is that You're right, you're right that I they are very good at editorializing the games. Like there's a staff note on almost every single store page for s for play day. They explain what the game is and they give it a little bit of a push and they say why it's good and um and you're right, like M Gadget are so in. They're so all in on the on the playdate. They're so playdate pill this kind of out of control. Like that it's nice, but like Every single game I've looked up, I feel like I've seen an article or video about it from an NGT. And I'm like, they are so it's nice that they're like so into it. They're like, this is our beat, but it's just it's just funny because you don't see the same you know, level of support from elsewhere in that very granular detail. It's just it just made me laugh. So and there's also a guy who's called like playdate bloke or something like that on YouTube who just looks at all of these games. And he's got like two and a half thousand followers and I really wish him well in the genuine sense. But it just it underlines the extent to which the community is quite modest, you know? And so every little push that they give it, that panic gives it, is a is a good thing. It's just it's a really interesting little parallel thing going on in games that I don't if you don't investigate in re real detail it's quite interesting objectively, you know? Yeah. Okay. Any any other games though Matthew that you um you recommend or want to shout out?

Matthew
01:12:31
Yeah, I one that gets recommended loads of places is Echo the Oracle Scroll, which is like a combat-free 2D Metroidvania. Very small graphics which I'm obviously down on in most C's games, but it is quite beautifully made. I really like the movement in it. Uh I haven't played loads of it, but like what I have played was throwing this little dude off quite bouncy mushrooms, had some quite fun secrets hidden away. I just like the look and the tone and the feel of the thing. You know, well placed save points that acknowledge that you may only want to play this thing for like a couple of minutes at a go. Yeah, just sort of smart. Smartly refigured for um reconfigured for for the platform. Uh there was also one I really liked called Under the Castle, which uh I just realized is like that's what the play day is. It's like literally under my hulking Shrek like body. Um but also the game under the castle Uh which is like uh almost like micro doses of Sheer and the Wanderer, where you dip into these little dungeons with randomly assigned enemies, everything moves on a turn based turn s you know, turn-based style on tiles. Um there's like random assortment of objects. You know, you can pick up various objects and you have to be quite clever in how you use them, which is the the Shear and the Wanderer kind of element of it. Except that, you know, the dungeons of what I've played so far have been like a couple of floors deep each, and then you're back to the hub, you kinda bank that progress and then you dip in again. So it's like little two, three minute bursts of Solving out these sort of spatial combat puzzles. That's quite good. Yeah, basically all the ones where I felt like I could do something in like three minutes got a big thumbs up. Anything where it was like, oh, sit down while I tell you this tale, I was like, nope. Anytime you were cranking it through comic books, you were like, I'm out dog. This is not for me I I can't say there was anything I played where I was like, oh this crank is pure magic, you know? Oh, that's interesting.

Samuel
01:14:34
Yeah, yeah.

Matthew
01:14:35
It's just is it is it just novel? Like there were lots where I was like, oh that's quite neat Or like that makes sense that that's on that they've put that on the crank. But I I I'm yet to play the oh yeah, this is I've yet to play the cranks we sports moment, you know?

Samuel
01:14:51
Yeah, it's uh yeah that's that's interesting. So yeah, you've not mentioned the crank that much in the convert in discussing the games here. Um a lot of the time it just comes down to how they've paired down a genre for a kind of a micro game type experience. Um that almost sounds like it's the most interesting thing about the games that are being designed for this thing as opposed to the actual ways in which you interact with the game um using the console.

Matthew
01:15:15
When the crank does turn up, like you have to obviously take your fingers off buttons to to use it and like You know, there's there's quite a few where it's like, oh, there's this one bit of level furniture which you have to control with the crank. So it's a you know the rest of the time it's a Trad 2D platformer with the pad and button controls. But every once in a while you have to remove your whole hand to crank open a lever and you're like, is that fun? Is that good? I don't know.

Samuel
01:15:39
That's tough. Um here's my question. Will any of the games you've played in season two threaten your top ten list for the year? In in a weaker year, maybe like Falcrum Defender. Yeah. Um I could uh if that had come out last year, I think you'd have gone no astro bot Volcrum Defender I think I think you'd have relished it.

Matthew
01:16:03
Faultboard Defender would have had the mini shoot adventure slot. Matthew, so um Yeah, I no I don't think so. Like I I am pleased I've played it. Like there's there are there are good games and I just keep thinking oh my you know I just I wish I was having the experience that other people seem to be having. Like everyone else seems to be a completely happy customer. Um yeah, but I don't I don't know. I I think I'm quite good at meeting weird hardware halfway. Like that's what it was to be a Nintendo journalist. You know? It's like you're basically the defense force for the w you know, all kinds of bullshit you know, waggle I could deal with. And so I don't feel like I am cloth you know, I feel like I really do give things as as good a try as I can. Definitely.

Samuel
01:16:57
It is just beyond me. I I gotta say, I I do think that some of the games you discussed are genuinely interesting, but It's still not enough to make me buy one. I still know that I will play all these things, leave it, and then maybe if they do another season in a year or two I'll download those games and then the same thing will happen. I can just see it not slotting into my my already busy lifestyle of games.

Matthew
01:17:21
Um I can see it slotting between the gaps in the pillows on my couch and then being forgotten about forever.

Samuel
01:17:27
Okay, so you wouldn't necessarily recommend getting one in these days, Matthew, or like that. Well no, I uh but I suppose like the question I want to ask is, who would you recommend it to if you were to recommend it? Like do you think it can be recommended to anyone based on your experience? Is there Do you think that type of person exists? And I'd just love to know what you th who you think it's it's for, if it's not for you.

Matthew
01:17:51
I'd say if like a cornerstone of your personality is I'm sad that Nintendo don't make characterful hardware, then this is definitely for you. And those people do exist because they're on on social media being boring all the time. They're they're taking their three DSs to um industry events open to get street passing. That it's it's for them. I you know, I would say if you if you liked the variety and weirdness and tone of UFO fifty This is like UFO 50 if it was a real a real console, you know? Like it it actually exists and it has you can see the evolution of ideas happening in real time on it. Uh that is quite interesting. Um, I just I just don't think I would and I don't think it's intended as this, so it doesn't really matter, but like I don't I don't think it's like a necessarily like a serious platform of like, oh you know, I'm gonna be a playdate gaming guy, you know. I d I s I don't really see how like the the di the difficulty of using it and the nature of the games. I think it's quite a weird side like wherever it fits in your life, it will only ever be like a weird side dish. Like no matter who you are, that's gonna be true. But

Samuel
01:19:04
Because we are we are the type of people who should be all in on something like this, right? Because you you know, you say that you you're not massively into the Nintendo hardware quirks. But I think you like you say, you are open to this stuff. And I think you do get excited about these things. Um, you know, still. I just don't think I just don't think you make it the foundation of your entire personality. That's the difference. But I think if you if that the magic of that was combined with the system feeling a bit more usable to you and it the kind of the games as a whole making more sense in your life, I think you'd be right behind it. But I can just see there's a few too many many barriers for you to get truly excited about it, you know?

Matthew
01:19:45
Yeah, like if you know, if Nintendo turned around tomorrow and said, Oh, we're making another bespoke, you know, D S or three D S style piece of hardware, I'd be over the moon. I'd be first in line for it, you know. I I like I like hardware that's aimed at a a more general, like, user in terms of like pure function. Nintendo would never make Playdate because it's too small and awkward. They just wouldn't do that to you. Oh then they made the micro, which I also find quite small and awkward, so Yeah, I guess that's not true.

Samuel
01:20:14
Um Well, no, but I mean it's I think it's a good point that Nintendo hardware's gotten pretty handheld hardware's gotten pretty refined, you know, when they did the it's not like when they did the the the th the new versions of the 3DS there's anything wrong with the original three DS really. You know they the 3D s I I you know it was all great in terms of presentation. It felt like across the GBA and the DS that they learned how to iterate their hardware very quickly and make the best version of it really quickly and then when you got to the Switch and the 3DS launches they already had handheld hardware that felt very complete. I think Something that's this small without the backlight is uh it's just very particular as a thing. Yeah. Um and so yeah, that's I think that's true that it doesn't seem like something Nintendo would make. What if they did do the um The the crankmatic Joy-Con, Matthew, and they just stuck a stuck a crank on the old right Joy-Con for your Switch 2.

Matthew
01:21:10
Would you would you I know like I say, I I've I've yet to play a like Like the cranking masterpiece. I've yet to play something where I'm like, oh man, I'd be really sad if that didn't exist.

Samuel
01:21:22
Yeah, this needs its own version of WarioWare. That's what the playdate needs, you know? That's what Nintendo how where Nintendo would use a feature like that to its most potential, you know?

Matthew
01:21:32
Yeah, but I at the same time I am very open to the suggestion that that game does exist and I just I just didn't happen to play it in my uh limited time of playdate. So if you feel like I have missed uh a crucial playdate game, please do tell me on Discord or Tw social media or whatever and I I will try and track it down and give it a go 'cause you know, I wanna I wanna be as thorough as I can but um Yeah, I prefer the button ones for sure.

Samuel
01:21:59
Well how many games do you think you played in total now across the you know, because you like you say Catherine I'll load them downloaded. Yeah. Uh uh so how many how many do you think you've played in total across the library? I don't know, f forty? That's pretty impressive.

Matthew
01:22:12
Yeah, but like something I played for like two minutes and like noped out instantly. Um one of the very first season one games was um like a s a surfing game that I think was made by Chuhei Labs, which is Giles Goddard's lot, who was obviously m I think he was Mr. 1080 snowboarding. So I'd quite high hopes for that and that fucking thing, I just tr that that's uh me drowning a guy simulator. Um That is not a surf that is not a surfing game in my hands. That sold fucking Derek Jacobson's wakeboarding.

Samuel
01:22:48
It's Donald Jacobson's wakeboarding. That's uh it's I mean it's not a real game, first of all, but amazing. Um yeah it's uh yeah, wow, interesting. But that's the other thing is if I want to play these games, I think I could just come to your house and borrow this because I don't think you I don't think you and Kathleen would be like, oh, we're gonna need that back in two weeks because you know, they're bringing out How are the light bulbs in your apartment? You know what actually? I don't know if I have a good setup for this. I've got a very like low light sort of E-lamp thing by my bed. I might need to like basically strap the um my phone to my head somehow and then whack on the torch on that thing. Basically, and then make it out of that.

Matthew
01:23:30
The only way that you can ever truly see a play date is if you're fucking Metamorpho from Superman and can create a sun between your own hands.

Samuel
01:23:39
Oh, I just know the world of comic book movies has gone too far when you know who Metamorpho is. And I think it was a I think it was a better world where you didn't know who he was. And I'm actually disappointed that you do know who he is.

Matthew
01:23:50
It's very fucking his name and that he can make a son which is relevant for this uh the conversation.

Samuel
01:23:56
When HBO's lanterns comes out, you're gonna you're gonna know the name of three different Green Lanterns. And that's gonna be information. That's information you're gonna want to scoop out of your brain with a spoon. That's gonna drive you completely mad one day. Well Well, do you know what, Matthew? That was a brisk chat, but I think we kind of covered everything there that we wanted to discuss. Like it's a br like I say, it's uh for us a 90-minute episode is brisk, but That is the that is the play there. That is your take on it. I appreciate your very honest take on it. And I also I appreciate that there are people out there who are so enthusiastic about this thing they really want to cheer it on. Yeah.

Matthew
01:24:30
But I also like it's nothing personal.

Samuel
01:24:34
Well no, but you but I don't think you were m overtly negative. It sounded like you played four to five things you thought were really good. And let's face it, it's a platform that's been around for Three years, you know, two years commercially I think. And so, you know, for most people, and so having a few games that are really good in the midst of that, but not loads of them is par for the course of any hardware launch these days. So Let alone one that's been bought by probably about 150,000 people. So yes. Well I appreciate um the time you put into that, Matthew. And so yes, let's uh I think we'll I think we'll wrap up there Um but I will I will list um some of the names of the games that Matthew mentioned in the um in the description of the episode in case you do want to go check those out because you I don't think I think like me You might not necessarily want to play those games or like go and buy the a play date just to play those games, but they are like interesting to read about and you can see just how fucking tiny the Zelda game is that Matthew mentioned was, and then you'll be like Okay, I'll go play Oracle of Seasons on my um on my Switch instead where I could actually see Link and My fucking Ann Bernik. Yeah, exactly. You could just go see that on an actual screen and be like, yep, good. Um I can pass what's going on. Okay, Matthew. Well people know where they can get us on social media. This month's XXL episode. is uh a film club episode about uh the films Tropic Thunder and Galaxy Quest. Um seems random, but we thought we'd do something that is about About comedies, we didn't want to do something as heavy as um threads again, um, you know, or speak no evil. Um, so we have definitely focused it on, yeah, like uh something a bit lighter, um a bit more fun. Um that should be enjoyable And next month's XXL episode, if you'd like a bit of notice, by the way, is gonna be um two giant men rewatch Mad Men Season One, which is on Netflix in the UK. I don't know where you can get it in the US, um, but I imagine it's on AMC Plus and probably some some other service. But yes. Matthew, this is fun. They don't need to watch it. They're living it. Yeah. Don't know about these days, but you know. Um certainly um yeah, so that'll be that'll be something um fun to discuss next month. It's uh we can sort of dig deep into a show that we both like and I think get a bit particular with the characters. It's something a lot of people have seen, but If you did want to sort of join in, it's it's it's like about it'll be about 10 hours of your time, give or take, 40-minute episodes. It's I find it's a very, very pleasurable season that season of TV to to get through. Um, don't know what the Excel is next month, Matthew. I guess we can talk about that and figure something out, but um I'm sure we'll come up with something and that'll be good. Um so yeah, let's get out of here. Catch you later. Bye bye. Bye-bye.
