Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. We have a familiar special guest back on the podcast this week. So, Katharine Castle, her first appearance is 2022.
Katharine, currently on Eurogamer, previously of Rock Paper Shotgun. Great to have you again, Katharine. How's it going?
Yeah, very well, thank you. Thanks again for having me.
Yeah, your first time on a draft episode. How are you feeling about that?
A little nervous, but I think, I don't know, I feel like I've listened to enough drafts to have a rough idea of both what makes a good draft pick and the general dynamics of the mind games. I'm looking forward to basically turning the mind games on Matthew.
Unbelievable. This is some unbelievable bullshit.
Great betrayal already.
Yeah, if anyone can psychologically dismantle Matthew, surely it's his wife. Yeah, I mean, I'm looking forward to that alone. So yeah, really, really always excited to get a guest in who's not done a draft before to see what the deal is.
And yeah, it's the Nintendo Switch Draft this week. So obviously we are near the end of the Nintendo Switch's lifespan. Finally, obviously, we'll keep making games for it, releasing games for it probably for another couple of years.
But, you know, it is going to wind down because the Switch 2 will be upon us at some point this year. So felt like a good time to do this draft. Three person draft should be, yeah, it should be quite spicy as we try and grab some of the hot stuff off the board.
I think we've got some good categories for it as well. But yeah, Katharine, I do want to ask how things are going. You are apparently leaving Eurogamer soon.
So any reflections on escaping games journalism? I've done it myself.
Yeah, I think when this goes out, I will have maybe two days left. My last day is next week as we're recording. Yeah, I mean, in many ways, I wish I didn't have to escape.
I don't want it to necessarily be escaping, but I still really love writing about games and the people that I work with. And I think this last year, I've only joined Eurogamer around this time last year, but it probably has been one of the best and probably most fulfilling years of my entire career. I'm really sad to leave such a great team of people behind.
But yeah, I feel like it's time to do something a bit different. It's really tough for websites these days. Search is a trash fire.
Everyone is not reading websites anymore. I'm just not built for, I think, whatever the future holds for games media in many respects. A mixture of mild relief that I can just kind of enjoy games as a regular human being again.
But also just regret that the general state of online media has sort of created this situation in the first place. Everyone at Eurogamer and every games publication out there just continues to do incredibly hard work and work very hard under really increasingly difficult circumstances. So if you are a regular website reader of any kind, go gently as a sort of parting plea to people.
Just be kind, compliment the work that you like, because you probably will miss it when it's gone, as bleak as that sounds.
But you simply can't be in that arena anymore without working your ass off all the time. So that's kind of the way it is. So I get it.
I think you'll be missed by the readers of Eurogamer, but also PRs because you're one of the journalists who answers their emails. So that's tough for them. I speak on behalf of that profession, I think, when morning you're moving out of games journalism.
So yeah, it's great to have you back on. And yeah, sorry to hear that you're leaving Eurogamer, I guess, based on what you just said. But yeah, whatever comes next, I'm sure will be very exciting as well.
So yeah, pleasure to have you back on because it has been a while, Katharine. And I'm really curious, Matthew, for you, what's it like having Katharine in this draft? And what's the build up to this draft been like in terms of, you know, you not sharing tactics, kind of like going through the game collection, sort of trying to, you know, outmaneuver each other?
What's the whole situation been like?
It hasn't been too tricky. I sometimes forget that Katharine is an avid listener of the podcast. So I found myself sort of mansplaining some real draft basics and having to stop doing that.
Yeah. Try, try. I mean, that's the thing.
If you listen to it, you know, you know what the deal is, but I was, I was trying to sort of point out some pitfalls and learnings that I'd amassed over all these years, but she doesn't need them. She's sharper than I am. So it'll be, it'll be fine, by which I mean terrible for me.
It's definitely been a little bit of like, I won't reveal my game choices or like, hmm, I wonder what things you're going to pick. Yeah. I think, I think, you know, we've been trying to keep relative, relative secrecy over.
Yeah.
I closed some tabs earlier when you came into the room to make sure you didn't.
I knocked on the door to make sure I wouldn't, you know, I suddenly walk in on him preparing his game plans.
So yes, it's like, hmm, why is he watching a trailer for House in Fata Morgana?
That was the game I was about to make a joke about, Matthew. I was about to say, she left open like a Google Doc tab, but at the top it just said, number one, House of Fata Morgana. I mean, yeah, spot on really.
So yeah, I think that's good for you to listen to the podcast and kind of come into it sort of fresh, Katharine. I think that's the best way. You know exactly what the dynamic you're stepping into.
So I think that puts you in a good position and you know about Matthew better than anyone. So wherever he picks first, second, third, your best position to figure out that more than anyone.
Or does she?
Yeah.
Fingers crossed.
Yeah. Well, that's it. I guess we'll see how it goes as Matthew tries to pick 10 visual novels across different categories and secure that audience, that 1% of the audience, but no, I'm excited to get into it.
So a little bit of background in the old preamble, not too much because we've got 30 picks to get through. We want to give those a fair chunk of time. So the important context of the Nintendo Switch of course, is describing the environment that it launched into, and where sentiment was around Nintendo circa the mid 2010s, because things were no bueno, Matthew.
You were there in the dying days of O&M. The 3DS was successful, but not as successful as the DS, not even close. And the Wii U of course, was a disaster.
And so while you had Nintendo at this commercial peak in 2009, in terms of revenue, they'd never made that much money in a single year before, things start to slide quite quickly after that. So Matthew, do you want to kick us off with how things were going before the Switch came along?
You've captured a lot of it there. Home console disaster, you know, Wii U, which eventually sells about 15 million or something by the time the Switch comes out. They were having a few successes in like mobile games.
You see the year before Switch comes out, Pokemon Go is absolutely enormous for them. They're trying to make Miitomo, their Mi social network happen. There's Super Mario Run doing good numbers, but no one's buying it because it's like a 15 quid iPhone game or something, which is obviously mad.
There's just a general sense of something's gone horribly wrong in the home console department. When I say that, one of the interesting things is that's what's happening in public and then what's happening behind the scenes in terms of them restructuring and recalibrating some of their teams, some of their thought processes, which allows Switch to happen. So I wouldn't say it's like wasted years, sad years, but kind of important years.
Yeah, I think that's right. Katharine, what was your relationship with Nintendo at this time? I think you were a lifelong Nintendo diehard, right?
So what do you remember about this period?
Yeah, so I mean, I was actually working for MCV at the time, which for people who either don't know what that is or have forgotten, it was basically kind of the UK's kind of trade magazine for games. So business journalism, talking to retailers or a magazine thought for retailers in many respects. And I was just going back through some of the old issues that I've got.
And in December 2016, there was a piece about how Xbox had got its mojo back with the Series S massively boosting sales, and the PS4 Pro had just come out. So everyone was really excited about these consoles, the next version of and the next version of these consoles. The Xbox One X, I think, was still Project Scorpio at this point.
I think everyone's basically in the mood to buy a 4K TV with HDR and to really prepare for this next hardware refresh. I think we even bought an OLED TV at the end of 2017, I think probably around the time that the Xbox One.
Katharine, don't reveal our big purchases to the readers.
But it's in the general mood of where the other consoles were at. We had a retail survey in December where 55 percent of retailers were predicting that basically the PS4 would rule 2017, compared to just 9 percent for the Switch and Xbox One was at 27 or something. PS4, that was really the only going concern.
As a fan on the Nintendo side, it was just a real disaster. As Matthew said, just a really sad time that it just seemed so forgotten and unloved and so behind the times. Especially with the PS4 Pro having just come out, Scorpio on the horizon.
I think it felt like could Nintendo ever catch up to this? It just felt like really out of step, I think, with everything else going on.
I think it did trigger a proper existential crisis at Nintendo, and the Switch would be seen as a make or break product according to Reggie. It's really interesting because the announcement that led to the, well, that kind of first heralded the Switch, I guess, was in March 2015, where Nintendo announced a change in strategy after the failure of the Wii U. They were going to make mobile games for the first time, forging this partnership with DNA.
But announcing at the same time, it would be making games for a new system called the NX. And the creation of the console began in 2012. By 2013, they decided on two core concepts of the console, the detachable Joy-Cons and the fact it would be both a hybrid console and a home console.
There was an interview that was translated by one of the Rolling Stones gaming channels, but it closed down, Glicsil, a few years ago. This quote comes from Deputy General Manager of Entertainment in Nintendo, Yoshiaki Koizumi, who is speaking to Toyo Keizai Online. I really fucking struggle with the pronunciation there, so forgive me.
What we're conscious about is that the gaming population is getting polarized into two. In the recent years, we are in a situation where people who want to play leisurely choose smartphone games, and people who play games deeply would play with PlayStation 4 and PC. The idea of combining the good points of smartphones and home consoles became the results of thinking of a game that can be enjoyed by both audiences.
The challenge of Nintendo at this time was one of balance between processing power and battery life. Another thing that Koizumi said is we tested a number of variations for just the method of attaching the Joy-Cons to the console. Ultimately, we settled with the method of sliding them into the rails on the console, but at the prototyping phases, we tried a lot of methods like sticking them with magnets, which they're going to do in the Switch too, of course, and putting them on dish shaped parts.
I don't know what that means. Maybe that's a Google translation thing. I don't know.
They had five different prototypes of the console. Miyamoto emphasized at a January 2017 press event for the Switch that the hardware and software are made in the same building in Nintendo. This is a quote, so people that work on the graphics engine, the physics engine, the CPU, they can all communicate with each other.
Specifically speaking about the Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild, people working on the basic programming language are in close proximity with people who are building the system and producers had opportunities to really check out and test some of the interface. So an interesting thing is that apparently younger staff within the company helped to craft the hardware. They were behind what it is.
I think you feel that there's a difference in thinking between the Wii U and the Switch, even though the Wii U feels like a necessary step towards what the Switch would be in an age before they really had the mobile chipset to be able to do this sort of thing. The console used Nvidia's Tegra mobile chipset. Don't ask me any questions about that.
I only vaguely understand that whole area, obviously. Analysts considered the system risky and Nintendo's stock dropped 7% after its reveal. Analysts estimated it could sell 40 million units by 2020.
To date it has shipped 150 million units. Is that right? Actually that might be too high.
Let me just double check that. I might have got the wrong number there.
Come on, Analysts.
Fucking terrible form by me. Let me see. No, that is right.
150 million units of December 2024. Nintendo's best-selling home console and the third best-selling console of all time behind the PS2 and Nintendo DS. So that is the sort of a very brief making of.
Obviously, there are more moving parts there. The fact that Zelda launches on both the Wii U and Switch makes it feel like it was an expedited end to that generation. And with the Switch, they did want to create longer life cycles, extending it beyond the usual five-year lifespan and trying to get it more into that seven-
and eight-year range. And obviously, they've succeeded based on where we are now. So I will ask Matthew, off the back of that, what do you remember about the Switch's reveal?
And do you have any kind of ruminations on the process that led to the console's creation?
The tricky thing with this is that actually there isn't a huge amount of good access to Nintendo at this time because Iwata had obviously led quite a kind of transparent open era with Iwata Asks. So if you wanted to know about anything Nintendo are doing in the format of quite a curated interview, you had a huge amount of insight and I feel like they've powered that back up like halfway through the Switch generation. But if you go back and just try and find conversations about how this thing works or why they've done it, it is quite hard to pin them down.
So it's a bit of a mysterious period. So some of that stuff you just said I actually hadn't heard. So that was interesting.
I mainly remember thinking, oh, that looks cool. Hope it has the games. Feeling a bit more confident when they then showed it off a bit more at the beginning of the year because it had a lot of first party games.
We were just flipping through the presentation earlier and it was surprisingly stacked at that point. So that bowed well. I remember that I still think people were a little cool on it.
I think people needed to start playing the games before it necessarily made a huge amount of sense so they needed to get their hands on it. The conversation at the time was probably that it was going to be a little bit too expensive and probably attached to that, like the fear that Nintendo were going to make the same Wii U mistakes or just not have the volume of games that kind of did for the Wii U early on as well. I do think those two things are connected because I think, you know, once Nintendo kind of hit their stride quite early on in terms of game quality and the number of games they're making, I feel like the conversation about the price kind of quietens down pretty quickly, like people aren't really talking about that anymore, because you're like, well, this is the thing I've got to have to play all these great games.
Nintendo are sort of showing their stuff, they're showing us that they can make these games. They've obviously done something to kind of uncork the game production process, which had slowed during the Wii U. That sorted itself pretty quickly, but definitely if you go back, there's a lot of chat about it isn't a 4K machine, it isn't this graphical powerhouse, is it too expensive, does anyone really want this hybrid?
So it's quite nice to be where we are now and for it to have the reputation it has now.
Yeah, for sure. One thing I had forgotten was that in my head I thought that the reveal of the Switch was on the Jimmy Fallon show, but it wasn't, it occurred before that, but the Jimmy Fallon show was a key stop along the way. Yeah, definitely.
Yeah, and the interesting thing is, again, I mentioned that they announced the mobile strategy and the Switch at the same time. This was a time where Nintendo was a little bit like, we're spreading our bets out a bit. You know, they presented Mario Run and had Fallon playing that before they actually had him playing Breath of the Wild.
And, you know, I think that just speaks to the fact that they saw it as a hand in hand. This is what saves the company when it's really the Switch that saves the company. So it's interesting to go back to that stuff, for sure.
Yeah, Katharine, how about you? What do you remember about this reveal? Were you buzzed about the Switch as soon as you saw it?
Can you go back that far in your memory?
Sort of. I'd actually forgotten that they... In my head, everything happened during that January big blowout presentation.
I'd forgotten that they'd released that kind of three-minute trailer in October just before the Jimmy Fallon show, which was basically just showing off the portable aspect of it, with that bloke playing Breath of the World on his TV and then going out to play in the park. I'd also, again, rewatching that trailer just a little bit earlier, like it had Skyrim in there, lots of sports games, a weird e-sports section with Splatoon and stuff.
Oh yeah, remember we all went to that huge arena to watch the Splatoon finals? Or 10 million of us?
Definitely an event that happened. But yeah, I'd sort of completely forgotten that that had happened. But I think rewatching that trailer, like what was impressive, I think, at that moment, before we really knew anything, which is obviously a strategy that they're adopting for the Switch 2 as well, in that we've seen a tiny glimpse of something, which they're then going to explain in more detail in a little while.
But just in that initial Switch trailer, that instant switch from just picking it out from the dock, and it disappearing from your TV, and seemingly just appearing on that handheld screen, was just like, what? I think that felt genuinely game changing as a first impression. But it was really that big January hardware reveal, where everything just sort of like, everything fell into place.
I was so excited. We got a proper look at the Joy-Cons. There were loads of games in that presentation.
You had Super Mario Odyssey, you had Xenoblade 2, a little bit about Skyrim again.
Splatoon, ARMS, Splatoon, yeah.
Just like absolutely stacked full of games that if not kind of, even though they weren't launch games. Admittedly, the launch line up was pretty bad outside of Breath of the Wild. But the fact that we were still getting a Mario within launch year, it just seemed like a really, really compelling line up.
And I think they closed out that presentation with just, I think probably still my favorite trailer of all time, that amazing Breath of the Wild trailer. That music is just such exactly the right thing to get you really pumped for a console. Just like the Legend of Zelda theme being played at full orchestral pelt.
It was just like, yes, this is it. I was so desperate for Nintendo to be great again. I was absolutely like all in on Zelda.
That was really all that mattered to me. The Breath of the Wild would be brilliant. I didn't really care that the rest of the launch line up was a bit pants.
Zelda was enough for me and this is like, yes, this just looks like everything that I want it to be. But yeah, I think certainly there was a big like UK event where they were sort of showing it off to the press just after that hardware reveal presentation. And I remember, yeah, like there was definitely a loss of talk about like the price.
It's like, oh, £280 is, you know, a lot of people saying it should have been £200. On the, certainly on the MCV sort of side of things from a work perspective, there was one retailer, because we sort of, you know, MCV at that point, I think was still fortnightly. So like, putting together a fortnightly magazine was tough, but like, you know, we'd always be emailing retailers for like, comment and, you know, kind of analysis and their thoughts on everything that was going on.
And there was one retailer who, every time that we spoke to them, they only ever had one thing to say, that they hated the price. And this was because, you know, it should have been £200, should have been, you know, or had a packing game at 280. That was because they had set their pre-order prices before any of the pricing had been confirmed at like £198.
Which is just like, that's about £80 short of like, you know, what the actual price was. And, you know, I mean, good on them in some sense for honouring that pre-order price, but like they just complained about it constantly. I mean, admittedly, that company did later go into liquidation, like a year later.
That's tough. Unsurprisingly. But yeah, that price conversation seemed to be the big sticking point, I remember.
I think people were maybe expecting that 1-2 Switch should have been a pack-in game. Like Wii Sports and Nintendo Land, it definitely sort of felt of that sort of, you know, in the same vein as those games. So the fact that it wasn't maybe felt a little bit kind of like stingy.
But yeah, I think certainly from my point of view, both on the work side and just as a general fan of Nintendo, just like yeah, it was like all in on Zelda. That was the only thing I really cared about.
Yeah. So it was funny because in my head, I still think of Breath of the World as a Wii U game, because that's how I played it, which is obviously deranged. But you know, that's what I did because it was £280, and I bought a Wii U and I was like, well, this is the Wii U's killer app, so god damn it, I'm going to play it on this thing.
I found it very convincing. I think that first video they put out, I just thought this is really confident marketing. And it was the fact that even if you thought that the launch line up was thin, it's like you say, there was such an obviously stacked slate of games that were coming out, and they'd learn the lesson of stagger the game, so you have something every few months for people to buy and play on that system.
And that's such a key learning to take away from the Wii U and 3DS eras. And you know, obviously, only having one platform to service helps with that as well. So, yeah, it certainly felt...
I feel... Something I was even going to ask was, is the Switch even slightly too stacked in its opening few years versus maybe some of the later years? It feels like maybe the first half of the console's lifespan is where a lot of the key things happen, but nonetheless, it's exactly what the system needed at the time.
So it feels like the Switch changed handheld gaming forever. Every handheld now does a similar thing of bridging the gap between home and handheld consoles. They're homogenized to a large extent.
Why does the Switch still stand out in the landscape of imitators, Matthew?
I think it's a really clean experience. It's not just the idea. It's the Nintendo version of the idea, which is just very clean, very simplified.
You pick it up, it moves from the TV to the screen. The thought they put into the controllers disconnecting from it so that you could play them on TV or then attach them again. While there are other home console powered hand helds, I don't think any of them have that duality at their heart.
Particularly the TV element. I know you can plug a Steam Deck into a monitor and turn it into a thing, but like, come on, that is not the same thing and it's not the same experience. You have to buy something extra to make that happen.
That kind of clarity of vision marks it out. I think the simple fact that there is this constant talk in anything you read about the development, about the balance of power and battery life, and with that power question comes how will games look. I just think that when Nintendo were at, technology wise, what their games do look like and what they aim for means that they were a company perfectly placed to make a device which you could play handheld or on TV.
You know, it would be much harder for PlayStation or Xbox to pivot and start crushing their very graphically advanced games into a handheld playable format. But you know, the Nintendo first party games in particular are just so sort of universally sort of clean across both versions. So I don't know if a company with bigger technical ambitions could maybe have pulled this off.
I think maybe you had to be a generation or two behind for it to feel really smart.
Yeah, I'm curious to see if the rumored Xbox handhelds is going to feel like having a Series S in your hands, which is just not that compelling proposition to me. Whereas like you say, it's having the identical power across. Yeah, you might have to get a resolution change or two.
But generally speaking, the performance has a lot of parity, right? So yeah, that clean idea of just plugging it into the dock and it just works is, yeah, it's definitely, definitely, definitely true. Katharine, do you think that's it?
It's just the simplicity and the elegance with which Nintendo puts these things together?
Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think it's also still got everybody beat on like form factor. Like it is much easier to take my Switch somewhere than it is like my Steam Deck.
My Steam Deck, like with the case, it's like probably double the size of my Switch. I think like all sort of Steam Deck alikes still fall into that, you know, into that kind of problem of, yes, that they're chasing graphics and horsepower rather than, you know, using that kind of older technology that's a bit cheaper, a bit more efficient. And yeah, not, maybe not quite as shiny.
But, you know, I sort of was thinking, you know, the Steam Decks and the other sort of portable PCs are basically like, you know, what the Sega Game Gear was to the Game Boy. You know, they're selling that portable PC console experience, it's a bit flashier, but yeah, the Switch is just something else. It's still in its own, its own lane, doing what it does very, very well.
Steam Deck is really nice to hold, though.
It is very nice to hold, yeah.
It's not a bad form factor in that sense.
No, that is true. And I think, you know, probably like, I'd say that I probably have done more, more, more gaming on the Steam Deck than my Switch. Certainly like in recent years.
Wow.
Okay, interesting.
But, you know, I mean, part of that is, for a lot of the Switch's lifetime, I have worked on a PC website with Rock Paper Shotgun, which obviously, you know, that will definitely do it. So yeah, I sort of, I think it probably has maybe cornered, like I felt like the Switch certainly, I do think the games are a large part of it, that, you know, it has games that you cannot play anywhere else. You know, obviously with that swell of indie support right at the start of the Switch's life cycle, I think, yeah, maybe the Steam Deck has now sort of cornered that slightly.
But again, yeah, you know, maybe that's just because I generally have been more PC focused myself. It's sort of hard to really gauge whether that's really, you know, a wider thing, whether that's just a me thing, especially, you know, like with the eShop being a bit of a mess.
But I suppose like also the fact that some indie games, more demanding ones, are going to just perform better on a Steam Deck than a Switch as well, right? So that's not totally unexpected. I mean, that was going to be my next question really was indie games became synonymous with Switch.
Nintendo made an extra special effort to reach out and make sure that they had as many developers making games for this thing as possible. It was just too many generations had passed where third party support had collapsed almost immediately, or was never there at all. And that just needed to stop.
And yes, it was a very different generation in that respect. Was that reputation still earned as the eShop was left to fester in terms of discoverability? Obviously, we all know now that the performance of the eShop, the games it services, unless you go to the charts pages, just terrible.
Feels like it needs a bit of editorial curation. And it's a dumpster fire. And if they don't sort it out for the Switch 2, what the fuck are they doing?
But nonetheless, to play indie games on there, it just felt like the... What people were saying about the Vita was turbocharged with the Switch. There are just so many more indie games.
And just became the de facto home for indie games. So I would say about three or four years there at the start of its lifespan. What do you think, Katharine?
Yeah, I mean, definitely like at the start of the Switch's life cycle. Again, like while I was still on MCV, I remember speaking to a lot of indie developers and they were just singing his praises. You know, like, especially obviously, I mean, it's probably the same across most digital storefronts.
You know, the people who got in early and didn't have to, you know, deal with all the sways of shovelware, found some great successes there and, you know, everyone was really pumped about it. You know, yeah, they just didn't have a bad thing to say about it at all. Most of them.
And so like, yeah, I definitely think it was earned to start off with. And as you say, like absolutely essential to have that. But just after, you know, after the Wii U was sort of, yeah, basically kind of a bit of a disaster on that front.
But yeah, I think, like, as you say, as things have gone on, I mean, I don't know. I think it's true across all Xbox and PlayStation to a certain extent. Nobody's storefront is like really that good at highlighting stuff.
Nintendo's is arguably, you know, just from the performance of it and the general usability of it is probably certainly on the on the worse end of the scale. But yeah, I think I think everyone could probably do with a touch more curation and a bit more like thought gone into, you know, how things are shown on those on the stores and how things are promoted, I think.
I think that's true. The one thing I I'd say that for Xbox is that they've got that recently added to Game Pass button, which is like, fuck yeah, this is what I'm looking for when I turn this thing on. Yeah.
And then I feel like on PlayStation, they're really good at surfacing the two or three big games on the system, but also dividing all of the different sales pages into, you know, like just easy to browse kind of areas. I know those are the only things I would say that there is nothing about the PlayStation Store that's good at surfacing indie games at all. Like no way.
It's basically pointless for that. But yeah, like it's that thing of they at least do a couple of things well, whereas in recent years, going into the sales page of the Nintendo Switch is just, the eShop is just, it's tough in there. So yeah.
Yeah. So Matthew, what do you think of indie games? Do you think that that reputation has faded a little bit in recent years?
Yeah, I just think they overcompensated for being incredibly controlling in the Wii and Wii U years. And so they just let anything go. People have written about there are weird algorithm hacks almost that people can do to get up the chart and sort of manipulate the behavior of the store.
And then that drew all the kind of vultures making all these sort of like 99p sort of slop games. I think on top of that, there is like a sort of tier of the actually good indie games. I think Nintendo know what they are.
I say the actually good, obviously some are going to slip through the cracks. But they can anoint things as being credible by putting it in like an indie showcase and making sure that they do those more regularly. And that does create kind of two tiers.
It's like, here's a big old mess, but we can pick 10 things to save in this life for the Draft every so often. And those 10 things tend to be pretty great and they can still draw good games to it. I mean, definitely as we've gone on, there have been some games which have begun to sort of run a little bit ropely or chug or whatever on the, you know, they've just got ambitions that are slightly beyond the Switch.
But yeah, I think the Vita thing is absolutely fair. You know, it definitely had that sort of exciting, just felt like the place to be very, very easy to kind of get into it and build a good library of games. The Switch is just so paired back to only be a gaming device, really.
And that definitely helped with that. So, yes, it's just fucking rotten when you go on there. Like, I shouldn't really be seeing like fucking hentai games, you know, in a Nintendo store.
Yeah, it's a thing as well where there was that unpacking clone on there, and it took the developer actually posting about it for Nintendo to go in and do something about it. And it's like, why aren't you, why don't you have your own moderation tools for this? Didn't you have to, you used to get Wii Plaza stuff, like actually, you know, approved by moderators and stuff.
How did it get to the point where these crap games were getting on there? It's kind of bizarre. Yeah, so the story with indie games on Switch to me was that at first it was a gold rush because there weren't that many of them on there.
And so it was like a surmountable number to sort of like collect and keep on top of. And then I felt like there was a massive like rush after the first year, where just loads of them got on there. And then the curation starts to get a bit dicey and it goes from being, oh, you know, indie games on Switch are a massive percentage of our market share, to it becoming a bit more of a, you know, like a PC taking over again sort of thing.
And then in recent years, I think, yeah, like you say, if you get annoying to them, maybe it moves the dial a bit. If it's a game like Little Kitty Big City, which was in their Indie World Showcase and like is, you know, seemed like it was a big hit on Switch. And otherwise, yeah, like you just sort of seem to miss out.
Or like you say, the performance can be a little bit ropey. Is the volume of Wii U ports on Switch a mark for or against the console, Matthew?
I'm fine with it. I do wish there had been a way to reward loyal fans with cheaper upgrades for those of us that had bought them on Wii U. It's undeniable that it made sense to resurface all this amazing work that just hadn't been seen or appreciated.
When you've got a console that sells sub 20 million copies units and then you have a console which is speeding towards 100 million in those sort of middle years, it's probably like cutting off the nose to spite the face to not bring them to Wii U. You didn't have to engage with it. They used it to fill the gaps between newer games.
I think they were quite careful with them. A lot of them are quite nice ports. They tried to add extra things, the extra campaigns or add-ons where they could add multiplayer modes.
I'd say recently there's been a bit of barrel scraping. When they got into porting Wii and 3DS games, I'm like, fuck that. If you pay 50 quid for Donkey Kong Country Returns, you're a fool.
You know, that's crazy. They resold that game on Wii Virtual Console, on Wii U, for like 20 quid. Paying more for that now, absolutely bonkers.
And Luigi's Mansion 2 should never have been on there. Like that is such a 3D ass game. But that's, you know, that's fine.
I own plenty of these ports and, and, you know, they are the definitive versions of a lot of great games that I already liked, so.
You'll change your tune when it gets to Kid Icarus Uprising, Matthew. That's the thing.
Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that is true. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's been expected.
Was that going to be a Switch 2 thing? Who knows?
I mean, that's, that's got to have been finished by now, right?
Yeah.
I feel like three years ago that was being teased.
Having just rewatched that Switch announcement, you know, hour long conference, you know, there were maybe ten plus, not quite twenty, but like first party things that were happening. Like I want that volume for whatever they do on April the 2nd for Switch 2. I want them to go, here's a year of Nintendo first party games.
And if Kid Icarus is one of those, not a problem. If Kid Icarus is the only launch game, maybe a problem.
Well, we still haven't got the Star Fox Zero port, Matthew.
So, yeah, did you see that complete side note that Chuhei Labs, which is Jaws Goddard's outfit, who was obviously one of the programmers on Star Fox. Their next game is they're doing a Star Fox alike, but it's got like nice looking graphics.
Yeah, it does look, I was quite pleased to see that. Yeah. Star Fox is one of my favorite Nintendo series, but, you know, it's so cool.
I like seeing anything in that mold. So, yeah, I was quite excited to see that. That'd be kind of a cool kind of guest for us, Matthew, if you could try and get Jaws on.
But, yeah, I thought that looked cool as well. I agree that seeing a year of stuff would be cool. And even if there's a couple of remasters in there for Switch 2, I think that would be fine because, you know, we've only still just got to Xenoblade Chronicles X somehow.
They're still going with that very thin library that's really stretched out this entire generation. Katharine, what about you and Wii U ports on Switch? Do you think that's yielded some sort of like good gains for Nintendo?
Yeah, absolutely. I probably feel exactly the same way as Matthew did. Like, you know, no one really bought a Wii U.
You know, maybe two other people outside us three bought a Wii U. And so, like, you know, it's a bummer for us who has, you know, who've already obviously bought these games. But the fact that, yeah, they get a second wind often in, you know, yeah, shinier, better versions, I think it's just, yeah, it's just great.
You know, it is proof for those of us who owned a Wii U that it actually did have some really good games. Just everyone was wrong. But, yeah, I think that they've been, you know, just a net bonus for the Switch, definitely.
Yeah, for sure. So, yeah, I still love the Switch. I just, if the new unit doesn't have the OLED screen, then I think that would be a real tragedy, because I love that the Switch OLED is such a premium feeling thing.
And, you know, they did the Switch Lite, so you had that extra portability factor if you didn't want to plug into, you know, a TV as well. And that's, it's cool that they've extended the life of it that way. It's just great hardware.
I was curious if, Katharine, you thought the lack of power has been a problem in the past couple of years, because it has come up repeatedly as a drawback of the console, you know, just in terms of the games you can port to it and, you know, make just performance more generally. Do you think that we're unlikely to remember that once the Switch 2 hits and we're just reflecting on the strength of its library, or, you know, how much has that sort of lack of performance power overshadowed the console?
Um, I mean, I think, like, it's definitely felt like, oh, yes, this is starting to creak a bit. I think we're now ready for, like, whatever the next step is. Equally, though, I mean, we haven't really seen, what, you know, how much of a step up Switch 2 is going to be at the moment.
And in, you know, hopefully it will be, you know, will be a bit more powerful. But I don't know. I mean, in many respects, like, you know, with so much conversation around, how about games are getting more expensive to make, you know, development times are increasing, everything just is becoming increasingly less sustainable.
I kind of do think that there is a case to be made for actually, like, this is all right, like, this is fine. You know, let's just, let's stay here and just make games that are still, you know, deliver great experiences and they look perfectly fine. Yes, maybe like a little extra graphical grunt, you know, and heft would be nice, but I don't think that it would be the end of the world necessarily, if it was only like a marginal bump.
Like, I don't really care about it being or being able to do 4K, like, that's just, it's...
Who gives a shit?
Exactly, you know, I think like, if the PS5 Pro has sort of shown anything, it's just like, ah, is this really the right direction? You know, I can't really see what, you know, the benefits that this is offering, or if I can see it, I definitely don't want to pay £650 for it. And, you know, I think that if Nintendo can kind of, if they can get the price right, if they can strike the right balance between the power and what it offers, I think that there is definitely plenty of room at the lower end of the scale to still, like, you know, make a great console business and stuff.
You know, I do think chasing that power curve is going to see increasingly diminishing returns. And so, like, I don't know. I think maybe the Switch has felt more creaky in its, you know, in these latter years than maybe the Wii or the Wii U ever did.
There's definitely been some games where, you know, I mean, even halfway through this Switch's life cycle, like the Hyrule Warriors game, you know, it's like, ah, I would really love to see this at a better framerate. You know, like even back then, it's sort of, you could definitely feel it hitting its limits. So I think, like, I don't think we'll forget it as such, because, as I say, I do think that there's definitely been like a marked pushing up against the boundaries, you know, kind of compared to the previous consoles.
But at the same time, like, I don't know. I think that the importance that people place on this sort of thing is perhaps a little overblown.
I think that's true. I think there's just a couple of cases like Tunic where you see the Switch footage of it and it's a bit slower moving in Vaseline. And in my head, I'm like, this game is made for this system.
This is where Tunic should live. It's, you know, a Link's Awakening ass game. And yet, you know, it just, the hardware can't quite get there.
But I agree, there's something to be said for them holding the line with it as well. And it does mean that maybe it's missed out on a few Indies here and there. But we, I think, you know, just going back to Nintendo's overall hardware philosophy post-GameCube, just the idea of not directly competing with the graphics powerhouses is not an approach I have any kind of like any problem with.
And if you look at where game development is, particularly in AAA, is there anything wrong with Nintendo selling you £40 games and them maybe not, you know, being like 4K, you know, asset beast fucking 120 gigabyte downloads? Is there maybe something to be said for that? I think there honestly is.
So Matthew, what do you think?
Yeah, yeah, I get that. I mean, I would happily pay 300 quid for Switch 2, if it just gave me the Lost Woods in Breath of the Wild at 30 frames. I'd be like, you've done it, my man.
Yeah, the one thing I want them to announce or say is that it can do like here's Tears of the Kingdom, but it's, you know, 60 frames a second or something. And you can just enjoy that crazy one of the best looking game worlds of all time in a slightly smoother fashion. That would do it for me.
Don't need it in 4K, just need it smoother in handheld mode. That's all I want.
I agree with that. It's a it's a humble and reasonable dream if you ask me.
Yeah, and I'll give them 300 quid for that experience.
Fair enough. Well, we'll find out soon and we'll make a podcast about it probably. So we come to the actual draft process then.
So, Katharine, which genres do you think are best represented on Switch?
Especially because it's had that indie swirl. I think it's actually like most genres are pretty well represented. Certainly, yeah, like compared to the Wii U.
I mean, there are the obvious gaps like you don't have that many massive open world games. I'm struggling to think of many first-person shooters.
That's the only genre I could think of which is like nothing on Switch.
Yeah, like Doom, Doom Eternal, those kind of like miracle ports of it.
Yeah, Metro.
Kind of it. Yeah, Metro. I think Dusk is on Switch as well.
But yeah, apart from old ports of Quake games and Bioshock games, there's not loads in that vein, right? When I came to the process of our 10 categories and trying to make sure I had a backup pick and then a backup backup pick for each one, indie games will plug the gaps, but even then you don't have to dig that hard to find games to fit in all of those different categories. And yeah, just as a combination of indie games ports and Nintendo's own very steady library of stuff and Wii U ports as well, there's something of everything on this console.
It really is kind of like an everything machine, from Final Fantasy ports to FIFA or whatever the fuck. They've done old Assassin's Creed games. They've all made the journey onto the system in some form or another.
To The Witcher 3, for example, which Matthew, I assume you'll be drafting first in the RPG category. But yeah, really, it's just very kind of like packed out. Anything else you want to say about the genre mix here, Matthew?
Uh, no.
And on that note, let's take a bit break and we'll come back with the Switch Draft.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, Nintendo Switch Draft, 30 picks. There are three of us.
It's gonna be a fun one, I think. 10 different categories to choose from, which I will read out now. So category one is Platformer.
Category two, Action Adventure. Category three, Wii U Port. Category four, Indie Game.
Category five, Multiplayer. Category six, Metroidvania. Category seven, RPG.
Category eight, Port of a Game that's never been on a Nintendo platform before. Pretty self-explanatory. Category nine, Wild Card.
And category 10, Free Pick. So anything from the catalogue. So this is gonna be a Snake Draft.
So whoever picks first will have one pick. Second will have one pick and then will reach the turn. So the third person will pick twice and it will go back the other way.
The person picking second will always have one pick, but first and third will alternate between two picks each. I made that more complicated than it sounds as ever, but it will be fine.
I thought that was one of your more concise explanations of the drafting process.
Thanks buddy. I think I've done alright considering I've got a pretty rotten cold that I'm fighting back here. I'm looking like King Theoden pre-The Ousting of Wormtongue.
That's where I'm at physically at the moment, but it should be good. So let's find out where people are going in the order Matthew. You've been working on the little spinny thing.
I've got the Wheel of Names. Let's give it a spin. Yeah.
See if it should have a little sound effect. I don't know if people can hear this.
Going first. It's Katharine.
Oh, I don't know if that's good. I don't know if that's good. Interesting.
Going second.
I think going third might actually be the best place, Matthew. I suppose. Yeah.
Okay. Katharine, how are you feeling about going first?
All right. I think I sort of made a game plan of like, basically if I, yeah, what to sort of focus on if I go like wherever I ended up.
Nice. You can see all possible futures.
I knew it was a bad idea to get a mega brain on here. I normally only invite Walleys onto the draft episodes like Dave Scarborough.
Get they fuck.
A great dunk is expensed 50 minutes into the podcast. I hope you hear it. Okay, Katharine, go ahead then.
Pick your first game.
Oh man. All right. So my first pick, I'm going to go Wii U port and take Zelda Breath of the Wild.
Of course.
Apologies to taking that off the board so soon. But obviously, yeah, like as I sort of was mentioning earlier, this is definitely the game that I was just, I was so pumped about. I was, Zelda is one of my favourite things in games.
Everything that I'd seen in Breath of the Wild just looked amazing. That trailer in the January presentation was just like, just, you know, heart soaring. It's, and it was every, you know, it lived up to everything that I hoped and dreamed it would be.
You know, I love this game to bits. And even though, you know, I didn't, I didn't technically play it on the Wii U, I did play it on the Switch. But it felt like a good, a good solid pick for Wii U port.
There are so many good Wii U ports. But yeah, thought that this was a good pick to get that category out of the way first for me.
I was not expecting this to turn up as Wii U port.
Yeah, me neither.
That has really frightened me.
Yeah, same.
Let my games begin.
Oh no. Fuck. I mean, okay.
Well, interesting. That's interesting news for one category in particular that I have a diminishing number of picks for. Okay.
Good stuff. Wow. What a way to kick off.
Yeah, I can't dispute that. It would have been my first pick if I was picking first as well.
Now you've got to decide whether you're going to be a total fucking asshole or not.
Yeah. Okay. So my first pick, I don't think I am actually Matthew.
I think there's some sound logic to picking for category one platformer Super Mario Odyssey. I think this has to be the pick for the simple reason is there's only one of these on the system. There are two of what Katharine picked and I'm not going to pretend I think the other of those is the greatest game of all time because I don't believe it is.
However, you know, I wanted to hear you try.
I was really looking forward to that eventuality.
Well if I was on the turn, I would have probably taken it just for variety, but no, that's fine. So yeah, Super Mario Odyssey feels like the pick because it is the 3D Mario of this system. This always represents a high watermark of Nintendo in terms of ideas.
In this specific case, you're using these little hats to take, to embody other characters and building worlds and game design ideas around that. But also just being the first time you've seen a Mario game with this visual fidelity, where they've really challenged themselves in terms of the environments they take you to, in terms of the creativity of New Donk City or just all of the different worlds in this game are a cut above in terms of imagination from Mario 3D World on Wii U, which was the first time they did one of these games in HD. It's a bit closer to that galaxy, here's fucking loads of ideas back to back, as opposed to being 3D World's very high end version of quite simple 2D to 3D translation of Mario mechanics.
So it just has that high bar of ideas and looks fantastic, feels fantastic and like I say, the real reason I want to pick it is there's only one of these on the system, there's nothing else to really rival it. What do you think of this pick Matthew?
Yeah, it's absolutely fantastic. It's really, really difficult picking between this and Zelda for first pick because I think they're both, you know, in a way pinnacles of their individual things. Yeah, Odyssey doing the sandbox Mario to the kind of level of creativity of like a galaxy or something, you know, it's such a potent mix.
Yeah, I can't wait to see what this team does next. I'm just so excited. I really hope they don't do something weird.
I really don't want, I know you like it, I really don't want them to do like another like Super Mario 3D Land style thing.
Whoa, whoa, neither do I. They've done that now. I'm happy for them to move on too.
I'm not the conservative Mario guy.
No, no, but you are, I'm not dunking on it. I know that you're a bigger fan of that game, but like no one would have predicted them to have done that after Galaxy. So, I don't know, we'll wait and see.
Yeah, well, Mario Odyssey then feels like a better pick than what Matthew's about to take. But you've got two picks now, Matthew, so why don't you kick us off?
I've got two picks, which is difficult, because I've got three must haves. And I just don't try, I don't feel like I can leave one of them. No, I have to have one of these games.
I have to have one of the big three. So for Action Adventure, I'll take the Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. Yep, because I actually think Katharine might actually try and take both of those otherwise.
Correct.
I could see that being a thing, which would absolutely suck. You know, for a game that I think is a flat out, all time, a masterpiece of the games that I would call that, this is probably the most contentious of that group.
Only on this podcast.
Certainly on this podcast. But I think that captures a wider feeling around this game, that some people are like, yes, this properly elevated it. It is a true sequel.
It isn't just a glorified expansion of Breath of the Wild, that the ultra hand kind of construction element of it was transformative enough, that the sky and the depths were transformative enough. I obviously think all those things to be true. I also, I just really like that it is a sequel.
I really like coming back to this place and seeing how it's changed. I really like its narrative relationship with Breath of the Wild, you know, going back and seeing what's sort of befallen the same four outposts that you were saving in the first game I think is a really fun way of doing it. I think it's so beautifully made, incredible music.
I think it finds a bit more of that linear spectacle that maybe some of the older Zelda had in terms of some of its dungeons and certainly the approaches to them climbing up through the skies or riding all the minecarts around in the depths. So I just think this has got such a spirit of adventure and, you know, a game which really made me enjoy crafting systems, you know, after we were so badly burnt by Banjo and Kazooie, Nuts and Bolts, it took the true 10 out of 10 masterpiece to come along and go, you know what, this system can be not total ass and for that, I will forever be indebted to Enuma and Fujii Barashi.
Once again, apologies to the two staff at Rare who listened to this podcast. Matthew was once again besmirched here. Katharine, I really want to hear what you think of this pick as someone who picked Breath of the Wild first.
A, what do you think of this game? B, what do you think of? Why didn't you pick this?
And why did you pick Breath of the World instead?
I thought that, I mean, I definitely would have picked Tears of the Kingdom had it come back around to me and it was still available. Absolutely. This was definitely my first pick for action adventure category.
The reason I went with Breath of the World first is, as much as I do love Tears of the Kingdom, and I do think it is, like, you know, it is the better game. I think it's definitely the one that I would, you know, as Matthew said, like, the dungeons are more traditionally like Zelda dungeons. They are a lot more imaginative and, like, you know, I also love the different layers of that world and just how neatly it ends as well.
Like, it feels like such a nice kind of handshake with In Breath of the Wild, you know, it was Link that was asleep for a hundred years and then Zelda was off, you know, still doing her thing. And then in this, Zelda's, you know, got off and, you know, you sort of left behind. And it just, you know, those those two things meeting in the middle right at the end just felt like, it's like, oh, this is just like the perfect duology of games.
It really is. But yeah, I wanted to get Breath of the Wild off the table first, just because I felt that it fits or it fitted better in, you know, not the action adventure category. I wanted to kind of leave that open.
There are so many great action adventure games on the Switch that I wanted to put Breath of the Wild somewhere else. And yeah, even, I mean, equally, there are loads that, you know, I've sort of had a list of about, you know, five or six Wii U ports, because there are so many. But yeah, I just felt like, tactically, I thought the Breath of the World was definitely the one to get off the board first in that particular category.
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, well, I wouldn't have picked it, but I wish it well as ever. So Matthew, what is your next pick?
Yeah, so this is really hard, because I think I've got two games, and I'm willing to bet that whichever one I don't pick, you would pick the other. I don't want to say it just in case it gives you the idea. Maybe I'll pick the game and you'll be like, I would never have picked that next.
For Wii U port, I'll take Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Yeah, I would have taken that next.
Okay, well, then I think I know what you'll take next. Yeah, I mean, Mario Kart 8 was probably like probably the best game on Wii U. I'm discounting Breath of the Wild, which I sort of always think of as a Switch game, ironically compared to Sam.
But this came along and it just felt so like next gen Mario Kart. Like actually this was graphically amazing. The presentation is fantastic.
The music is simply incredible. Like if you just bought this game as like an album of incredible Mario Kart bops and hearing retro tunes kind of pumped through like a big band orchestra, that is just absolutely essential. I love the sort of, not necessarily like the zero, the zero G mechanic, you know, in and of itself, but the fact that it just lets them have these impossible kind of like inception like spaces, which are bending round on themselves, lets them do some like, you know, proper crazy rainbow roads.
I love the one lap tracks that just take you down like Mount Wario. I just think that the imagination of those courses, you know, this is, you know, I think we talked about it at the time of being, this is the Mario Galaxy of Mario Kart. It's like that level of like inventiveness and polish.
And after Mario Kart Wii, which was just so thin as a home experience, I thought, and like kind of ugly and basic, this was just like, wow. It's like the triple A, like billion dollar Mario Kart. And so loads more people got to play it and it sold what, like 50 million copies or something on Switch.
Like people truly love it. So yeah, I picked it for Wii U port because it's just, you know, the huge success story and you know, a nod to just what great work was being done on Wii U if people had actually paid attention.
Yeah. My memory of this game on Wii U was going to the Comedia in Bath and there was some kind of quote unquote Comic-Con, but it was the naffest thing I'd ever seen. It was like...
Really? Bath Comic-Con? Yeah.
Can you imagine such a thing? It was like eight trestle tables. Yeah.
Like eight trestle tables in the Comedia. And some very dweeby man had come in and set up the Wii U on the cinema screen. And it was that thing of like, oh, this is probably the most people who will be exposed to this game in the UK this year, because no one knows how great this is.
Like, if someone plays this today, they'll be like, wow, if only that was on a system that anyone owns. And that was always a thing. If you had a Wii U and you played this, you were like, god damn, the best of Mario Kart has been living on handhelds now for like two generations, the 3DS and the DS.
Well, Double Dash, which by the way, I played for an hour yesterday and thought was absolutely heinous, trying to play that with my brother and realizing we both had control over the steering. Absolute nightmare. And then like you say, the Wii one just being very paired back and it feeling like they'd lost their sort of mojo with it.
But sorry, Austin Powers podcast still stuck in my head clearly. Yeah. So this is just such a beautiful looking game.
And obviously, I'll let you have the DLC tracks as well, Matthew, because that's part of the DNA of the game too now. And you know, you just chucking in all those Mario Kart Go, whatever it's called, those tracks.
Oh yeah. I love to drive around Mario Kart's version of Bazing Stoke or whatever it is.
Yeah, it's a great pick. Yeah, Wii U port was interesting because you could arguably have taken this in multiplayer as well.
Yeah, I didn't think about that, but I wanted to put the squeeze on multiplayer.
Yeah, that's fair enough. Katharine, what do you think? Were you going to take this next if you're given the chance?
Yeah, probably. It was definitely up there. Yeah, as everyone said, it is the de facto racing game.
It's such a great version of Mario Kart 8, especially with all the add-on tracks and the expansions and all that sort of stuff. Yeah, the music is brilliant. The handling of the racing is just great.
Yeah, really one of the defining Switch games for sure. Whether you put it in multiplayer or Wii U port, it's a great game.
Indeed, okay, well, it comes back to me then, as we circle back around.
I'm sad, because I think the next four are going to be brutal.
Yeah, it's tough. It's a while now before you pick again, isn't it? Yes.
Okay, my next pick is going to be for Category 5 multiplayer, and I'm taking Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. This packs in every bit of content from all the Smash Bros.
games, every character, every stage, minus, I think, that weird Pokemon float stage. Do you know what I mean? Where all the big Pokemon are floating around.
Yeah, like the hot air balloons. Is that in this?
I don't think I ever played that level in this.
But I don't know. There's so many bits in this game that I didn't play just because there's so much of it that I'm not sure what is and isn't in there.
Yeah, this just gave people everything they wanted in terms of the roster, having a single player mode that wasn't completely fucking terrible. I'm not the biggest fan of it, but even I respect that it's a bit...
You know that I like it and I'm not going to argue against it.
Well, it's like it's a really solid way to learn the mechanics of the game. They do lots of inventive things with the properties, arguably, but in multiplayer where I've picked it, it just obviously really comes to life. It's, you know, the bones of it are in that we use Smash Bros.
game, but it's just the roster, the levels, it's just everything you want. In a series, it's all about fan service, just having on Switch like the best, you know, most confident Nintendo hardware in generations. It's just like, it's all here.
It was just such a great proposition. And then obviously what they add with the DLC as well. Finally giving people Sora, which is who is obviously Matthew's favorite video game character of all time.
And, you know, and some other more interesting choices too.
That's the only dud bit of this, that that's how the journey ended with fucking Kingdom Hearts, which is not a Nintendo property.
But a lot of the other choices I thought were really good. I mean, give or take like the 80,000 sword lads from Fire Emblem in this, obviously. But like, adding Joker from Persona and just the way they were just, they just gave all those characters their moment and really treated it kind of quite seriously.
It just, yeah, like they really delivered with it. And it was an exciting thing to be plugged into for so long, waiting for them to reveal all those characters. And just great, like a real success story for this generation, so complete as a proposition.
You're like, what the hell do they do with it next, really?
I love that there were so many online updates, which required videos, that it like accidentally turned Sakurai into like Nintendo's biggest influencer. Which was like, that is not a thing you would have predicted at the start of a generation.
No, that's it. So, you know, a beat-em-up, probably the only beat-em-up that's going to come up in this episode, I imagine. But in terms of unbeatable Nintendo multiplayer propositions, it feels like the right choice.
So there it is. And we come back around to Katharine for two picks.
Oh man, right. This is where this is where it starts to get a little bit hairy because yeah, there are still lots of really great games on the board, but it's just what order to tick them off in. I think for the first of my two picks, I'm going to go RPG with Fire Emblem Three Houses.
Just because it feels like there are loads of Fire Emblem games on the Switch, or it's definitely like the Switch has had a great helping of Fire Emblem games this generation, but Three Houses for me is still the best one of the lot. It's a great RPG strategy game. Arguably Fire Emblem had its big renaissance on the 3DS with Awakening.
I think that this feels most like the 3DS games. It just has great characters in it. I really liked the school setting.
I know that a lot of the community feeling around this game is just that it's one great big thirsty game. I don't play it for that. The characters are great, but it's the strategy that I'm here for.
And yeah, I just had a really great time with this one. And the fact that it basically comes with 360 hour sort of campaigns is just mad. You know, there's so much to this game.
And yeah, like I think, you know, possibly some other RPGs in there that I would have liked to have picked. But I think like Fire Emblem for me has...
I don't want Fortune to pick this.
No, I know. I feel like Fire Emblem has got the broadest appeal out of all of the ones I would have picked for this category.
There have maybe been like 10 games through Switch's lifespan where it felt like they just dominated the conversation for a couple of weeks and they just really broke out, you know, all for different reasons. This one, did it lead the charge for like this big sort of character thirst thing? Like what...
I think it was definitely one of the early ones that did that. Definitely.
It's in the water for sure.
It felt huge for... This is where it felt like the Switch can make anything feel absolutely ginormous.
Yeah. Yeah. So true.
It's a great pick. It was going to be my first pick for this category as well. So I think that's good.
Good drafting. Katharine, definitely done your homework here. What's your next pick?
Oh, the next pick. This is the tricky one.
Yeah. Because you got a while after this one.
Yep. I really do. I think I'm going to go for free pick and take Animal Crossing New Horizons.
Yeah. It's a good choice.
I was contemplating doing this for multiplayer, but I felt like it wasn't quite as, you know, it's borderline for multiplayer, I think, just because it is primarily a single player game. And I know that, yeah, it is, you know, the online part of it is certainly an element. It's not really how I play Animal Crossing.
I tend to just be, you know, a loner on my island with my animals. And so, yeah, free pick felt like a good place for this. But, yeah, I mean, you know, aside from the fact that it came out, obviously, you know, like just at the right time for everyone to not feel terrible about the pandemic.
You know, Animal Crossing has always been, you know, stellar on every single, well, nearly every single console. I'm not sure that I particularly had thought much of the Wii version, but like handheld, Animal Crossing is like where it's at for me. You know, played the heck out of Wild World, really loved New Leaf on the 3DS.
I even, you know, spent quite a long time playing the Happy Home Designer version of Animal Crossing and this, you know, New Horizons just sort of, you know, basically it's just all of that, but better. Yeah, really, really just love this game. And again, like I feel like a pivotal Switch game that, yeah, just, I needed to have it.
In what other game can potentially Elijah would turn up trying to get pairs or something?
Yeah, Astral Chain. I don't know. I mean, I was trying to answer the question.
Yeah, that's a great pick. It was definitely one of two picks I was weighing up for the next, my next one. So I think that's good.
It's like this is again another game where there's nothing else like it on the system you would pick in this draft. So I think that makes it a strong pick. Yeah, it definitely was definitely was a moment there that everyone was playing there.
So I was in the trenches on a website when people are trying to buy switches and they were all out of stock because the pandemic and any time there was stock anywhere with the Switch Lite, it would sell out and people were just buying this game in droves. That was truly like an unexpected kind of cultural moment that drove this game's success. So yep, that sure happened and now we just try and repress the memories as best we can and move on with our lives.
Nintendo have probably made the next one. They're just waiting for the next global disaster to kick off.
Any day now, judging by the BBC News home page. All right, my next pick then, good stuff Katharine, category six Metroidvania.
You fucking asshole!
This was the other one I was weighing up. If it wasn't going to be Animal Crossing, it was definitely going to be Metroid Dread.
The tricky thing with this category is, my other two picks for it are great, but it's just the one that Nintendo made. That's the thing, isn't it? That's what makes it the right pick for it.
It's because, yeah, it's Mercury Steam taking on this series, doing their best work with this genre they've been dabbling in for a while, making this phenomenal looking version of Metroid for the Switch with really athletic movement, a great world, the scale is just right, has this really nice breadcrumb design to it, where you don't really get lost in its world, but you still feel like you're exploring, and just feels set PC and exciting, but using that 3D camera to pull in, give you the right camera angles, doing particularly exciting dramatic moments. And it was just a real, it was the first Metroid game, my truly, Metroid Prime aside, that I truly got absorbed in and just loved. And I thought, oh my God, they've really resuscitated the original iteration of this series.
It doesn't need to be in 3D to be exciting. They can, there's still so much more mileage to go with it. A proper shot in the arm, and I think way better than anyone was expecting.
I think we're all here dying for a sequel. So definitely a Switch generation highlight for me. Matthew, how are you feeling about this one?
Yeah, really annoying. I thought this was going to go sooner. I've been nervously eyeing this, and every time someone didn't pick it, I was doing a little kind of fist bump, but it didn't quite make it back to me.
Yeah, I love this. I thought particularly the fact that they released this on the same day as the OLED, and it just looks so fucking good on that screen. This is one of the weirdest games in how much better it looks than it does in trailers.
Like, just something crazy happens in, I don't know, either inside the Switch or inside YouTube's compression. But yeah, I just loved it, the movement of it. It's just, what an absolute delight.
Yeah, sorry you weren't able to pick it, pal, but you know, so far it's been banger after banger. We're really sort of firing through the all-timers on this system. So you have two picks now with which to do some real damage.
Yeah, yeah. I think the true top tier is gone now.
I think, I agree.
As in like the top five, I think the top, I think amongst those games are the best five games on, so I don't think there's like a, oh, secretly this is one of them.
Minus indie games, yes.
Yes, that's true. Indie games are so many bangers, I'm not really worried about that.
Yeah, same, five picks where you get the wings for that one.
Yeah, just because I'm, I just want to lock it down and not like embarrass myself too much. For platformer, I'm going to take Super Mario Wonder.
A game you wouldn't put in your top ten for that, yeah?
Didn't I?
No, you didn't. Or did you put it low? I don't think you put it in your top ten.
I'll double just about the back of it.
Just about the back of it, obviously. You know, I'll be honest, yeah, I had a few problems with it in that I felt like it was a game of a million fun little ideas, but I don't know if any of them ever quite had the space to properly take flight. But then I guess the appeal of it is, here's just a shitload of ideas all executed in quite a fun way.
I think the surprise here was that the 2D Mario Strand, which had been not bad, but so conservative compared to the innovation in 3D Mario with the new Super Mario Bros. series, they absolutely have their defenders. I know there's some people who just really rate the simple paired back level design craft of those games, and I absolutely get that, and that's fine.
But when you are going to the crazy places that you go in Galaxy and Odyssey, those 2D games just felt so traditional and didn't have an idea beyond things we'd seen 30 years ago. So the idea of taking the creative leads of the Galaxy team and embedding them in the 2D Mario team to give them a bit of the 3D Mario juice, which is basically what Wonder is. And it pays off, it does have that Galaxy vibe in terms of every level's got a new mechanic or visual gimmick or weird twist.
I just don't think it ever quite escalates in the way it needs to. But I don't think anyone had on their bingo card 2D Mario being necessarily this good again and this polished again and this inventive again. And for that I will absolutely happily take it as my platformer.
I will confirm that you did not pick it in your top 10 list of games for 2023, Matthew. I did, I did, but you didn't.
Well there you go, then we're finally in agreement. I was obviously wrong. I probably picked some like real ass.
Well, Cobalt Core got in there.
Oh no, that was good.
And the DLC for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 got in there.
That was maybe, that was maybe me just doing some Xenoblade posturing.
Every year you've got to lock out one platform that everyone else likes. That's the thing you do with your top 10 picks.
So that's, that's my MO. Well, this is my way of apologizing. And you know, come on.
I mean, going up against Super Mario Odyssey is like a, that's just a tough break.
It is tough.
But that's fine. It's fine. I just, I didn't want something too middling in that one.
Here's a, here's a, here's a question. Just a category question. For multiplayer, do we, do we think multiplayer has to be at the core of the game or just has to have a multiplayer mode in it?
I think it has to have a multiplayer mode in it, but I'm curious to see what Katharine thinks because Katharine didn't consider Animal Crossing and I had that as one of my backups for multiplayer.
So it definitely like, in my initial list of things, I definitely had Animal Crossing in it as a multiplayer pick, but I just thought like, I don't know. As I say, for me at least, it wasn't really the way that I played it even though I do acknowledge that there's definitely a large part of it. I would definitely be okay with someone had, if Animal Crossing was still on the board, I definitely would have been okay with someone picking it as multiplayer.
So I think there is a substantial part of the game that is or can be paid in multiplayer. I think that's okay.
Okay. What have you got, Matthew?
I don't know if I'm going to go for multiplayer just yet then.
Intriguing.
For free pick, I'm going to take Pikmin 4.
Interesting.
Yeah, which I think is, like I say, it's not quite top five, top tier, but I think it's definitely in the top 20 games on Switch. Pikmin 3 was another game which really delivered on Wii U, but was underplayed. Gets quite a nice port.
But I think Pikmin 4, it's just like such a greedy Pikmin game. There's just so much of it. It's got all the kind of qualities of Pikmin 3.
The thrill of micromanaging, this little army of plant creatures in a kind of giant efficiency exercise as you try and achieve as much as you can in a single day. But it just goes above and beyond to like give you space to enjoy those games. Like a lot of Pikmin games for me are a little bit kind of one and done in that you kind of do the campaign thing.
Well, that's that done. And this gets around that by sort of having two campaigns and there's just so much stuff within them. The side dungeons, then the giant overworld itself, multiplayer battles against evil Ochi, our favorite.
It just went all out and it's something kind of I definitely associate with Nintendo of the last 10 years, something that started happening in 3DS where it just felt like certain teams were making games like as if it was your last. And they just really go for it and throw everything at it. But without sacrificing the actual kind of quality of the thing at the same time.
And Pitman 4, while a little bogged down with narrative, certainly I'll accept that as a criticism. I think once you kind of get through that, there's just a shit lot of Pikmin in it. Pikmin in it, you know?
Like you can just, this is just the biggest Pitman game, you know, it's all pretty great. You know, maybe that's a bit of a crude way of looking at it, but I think that's okay, just to enjoy Nintendo kind of giving you as much Pitman as they can.
It's a very leisurely game, it's not hard really at any point, but it's a nice journey to take. We both had it in our top 10 for that year, and I do like it. I think there's a bit of sort of Pikmin 3 versus 4 discourse that occurs, and I think some people prefer 3 having a little bit more sort of challenge to it, or just being a bit more in that, a bit closer to that original mold.
But yeah, I think Pikmin 4 eventually gets to where Pikmin 3 kind of is in terms of difficulty.
Well, like the sort of like the countdown element of it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think it's decent.
Katharine, what about you? Were you big into Pikmin 4? Did that take up 50 hours of your summer like it did for me?
I haven't actually played Pikmin 4. It was rude. It's on the list.
But I do like the Pikmin games. I've played one, two and three. I think I played one and two on the Wii versions that they did.
They were just really nice with the motion controls and played three on the Wii U with this amazing looking fruit. Yeah, my sole experience of Pikmin 4 is looking over Matthew Shoulder or watching him playing on the TV. I think it just still looks amazing.
Yeah, a game I would love to play and catch up on at some point.
I played it while we were at Joe Scribble's wedding. So that was nice. It's fused with happy memories from that.
During the service, Matthew, with the volume on, aren't you?
No, in the hotel on the morning of.
I'm only joking. Okay, right then. I think Matthew maybe gave his hand away a little bit with his multiplayer deliberation.
And so I'm going to have to take for category 10 free pick Luigi's Mansion 3. I think that's what you're in to get, Matthew.
That was definitely in the mix.
Yeah. So again, wanting to get things that don't have another comparison point on the platform. And so, you know, an extension of the Luigi's Mansion formula.
Don't know loads about this game, to be honest. It includes Gooigi, but, you know, a similar kind of like a base layer of capturing ghosts, but layers many more mechanics on it. Just a very steady kind of like game design evolution to this series in the hands of next level games and also just one of the nicest looking games on the system.
Don't have loads more to say Matthew, but what about you? Any thoughts on Luigi's Mansion?
Yeah. Luigi's Mansion, I was struggling to see a way to kind of cram it in there, but it is definitely excellent. It's like very cinematic.
It's very un-Nintendo. It's all about sort of production values and animation and a lot of can things. I think you can probably only ever play it once and it will always play the same way.
I don't want to say it's like Nintendo's Naughty Dog game, because that's obviously preposterous, but I think it has a lot more in common with like Western AAA values. And, you know, it turns out with Nintendo's money behind it, that means it's like absolutely gorgeous. So it's a real luxury game to play for 12 or 15 hours or whatever.
Another game as well that just by being on Switch, absolutely supercharged, it sold 14.25 million copies. Luigi's Mansion 3, that's just absurd, you know? That's just how big this platform was.
Katharine, much of a Luigi's Mansion fan?
Again, I haven't played 3. This is another one of the biggies that I've missed over the years, but I very much enjoyed both the first one on the GameCube and two on the 3DS. I seem to remember you playing this forever, Matthew, that it was like really long, longer than it should have been.
Every time you made any progress, this like fucking ghost, was it a cat or a dog? Some kind of ghost animal turned up and like stole all your shit, and then you had to run around the hotel getting it back, and it did it like five times or something. Really frustrating.
Well, yeah, it's like I say, trying to focus on things that have no other comparison point on the platform. So I think we just mentioned three dicks ticks that box. So it goes back to you, Katharine, for two picks.
Okay. Right. This is, yeah, we're definitely into the second tier of things now.
But I think to start with, I'm going to go action adventure and take Zelda Links Awakening.
I was sort of toying between this and basically Echoes of Wisdom as like a second Zelda game on here, because I think like, you know, that there are, this is definitely the category that I had, like, you know, there are so many good action adventure games. There are just great picks, like, across the board. But I think, like, Links Awakening, just having two Zeldas in there, I think was just like the, definitely a good option.
Yeah, definitely it was a toss up between this and Echoes of Wisdom. But I think that, like, Links Awakening, it sort of, you know, introduced that kind of very toy-like art style that obviously Echoes of Wisdom would then go on to use as well. I do think that, like, there's, I feel like people are less keen on Echoes of Wisdom.
Like, I really loved it, but I got the sense that I was maybe in the minority, that, you know, people didn't really dig its whole deal of using, you know, all the different items in weird and wonderful ways. Link's Awakening just felt like, you know, this is, this is the, just, well, it's a classic Zelda game for a start. Like, you know, I played the heck out of this on the Game Boy.
It was one of, like, the few games that, when, you know, when we were kids or not on a long car journey, this is the thing that we fought over to, to, to, to, to, you know, to have on our Game Boy. Is this, you know, this not only just has strong memories for me as a, as a game in general, but yeah, like this, this Switch version is just gorgeous. It looks really lovely.
The, the, the, you know, the re-scored music with the kind of, you know, kind of also, you know, very toy like, you know, sound to it. It's just, yeah, everything about it is just, it's just, it's just lovely. I really, really, really dig it.
I think it's, it was some of those things where if you, if the other two Zeldas are gone, you kind of have to, you have to take this one really. So I think that makes sense. Katharine, what's your next pick?
My next pick is, I think I'm going to go for Port of a Game that's never been on a Nintendo platform before and go for The Witcher 3. Interesting. I'm sort of, I mean, I'm basically parroting what my still current colleagues at Digital Foundry are going to say about this.
But I was, I was watching their, like, you know, their Impossible Ports third party port video to, sort of, you know, try and, try and get a sense of, like, as I say, a lot of my PC gaming, a lot of my gaming this generation has been on PC. And so, like, I sort of, like, my general knowledge of what games haven't been on Nintendo platforms before for the Switch is actually quite poor. So I was sort of, like, trying to refresh my memory.
And it kind of came down to sort of three games. And but I think The Witcher is, you know, probably the most impossible of all the impossible ports that people thought, you know, this game surely can't run on a Switch. And obviously, you know, it doesn't match the current gen.
But, you know, the lads at Digital Foundry, you know, say it's... it matches the last gen pretty well. It doesn't spoil the feel of the game.
It definitely holds up. You know, I think, like, they were saying that when you look at the list of all the stuff that they've cut, like, it looks like a lot. But actually, like, the end result, you know, the porting studio that did it...
Was it CD Projekt Red that did it? I can't remember if it was a different studio.
I can't look that up. It was a port by Saber Interactive developed in...
Saber. There you go. Yeah.
Yeah. So the porting studio, Saber Interactive, like, you know, despite all of the cuts and all of the, you know, the things that whatever things that is missing, it still looks great. And, you know, like I say, it doesn't spoil that feel of the game.
And, yeah, I think, you know, just just sort of I would agree that, like, you know, The Witcher 3 is is sort of like, you know, it is the type of game, you know, we were saying earlier that there were, you know, massive open world games is something that Switch is lacking, like, just because it just can't really do it. But, you know, thanks to the technical wizardry of the folks at Sabre, you know, such things are indeed possible, if rarely. So, yeah, I think I'll lock that one in as my port that's never been on a Nintendo platform before.
I didn't realize we were drafting against Katharine and Digital Foundry.
Katharine did the classic thing I do, which is, I don't understand how this works, but if I mentioned Digital Foundry said this, it sounds like I know exactly what I'm talking about with tech stuff. I mean, maybe, Katharine, you understand it better than I do, but that's how I lean on Digital Foundry, but I don't know.
More or less, yes, it's actually the same.
Yeah, that's interesting. I wasn't expecting to pivot there, but I think it's nice to have another category activated, so it becomes a bit more of a battleground. That's good.
Okay, back to me then. I'm very conscious about my Category 2 action adventure being absolutely fucked by everyone taking Zelda games, so better take Astral Chain before Matthew grabs it in Wild Card or something. You've said go.
Was I spot on, Matthew?
Well, not in that way, just get your mitts off it.
No, it's mine. Platinum Games, one of the more interesting exclusives on the system. Oddly large amount of story stuff for a Platinum Game, but has this sheen of detective-y cop stuff, and then goes into some sci-fi bullshit.
But you're really just playing it for some quite innovative spins on the Platinum hack and slash gameplay. I'll be honest with you, I played this six years ago now, and my brain has deleted most of that information from it. But certainly, it really demonstrated some potential for modern-day Platinum that has since not really...
But aside from this and Nier Automata, it's not really amounted to much. And there's Bayonetta 3 on this system as well, and I think everyone feels like that was a slightly lukewarm sequel. This feels like the Platinum game of choice to take for this draft to me.
It's just a really interesting game visually, and critics absolutely love this. It's just got huge scores across the board, and I think people were just well up for a slightly different spin on the thing Platinum does. And Matthew, I know you're a fan of the, one of the lead devs on this, come up on this podcast a few times, but one of the more interesting Switch exclusives, so what do you think of this, buddy?
Yeah, I really, really like this game. I don't really have a good grip on how the wider Nintendo fan community think of this, but certainly within Platinum, they always talked about the chap whose name I've forgotten, Tora, maybe, being the next innovator at Platinum, not like Kamiya's protégé, per se, but certainly a person they were really excited about has left Platinum, as have they all. Yeah, I just thought it was nothing else like it.
It has a really interesting Platinum action system at the heart of it. Like you say, a lot of weird detective stuff, kind of open world RPG story beats, one of the more successful Platinum storytelling exercises, not normally something they're particularly good at, but I thought they actually really landed it here. I always think Platinum plus Nintendo is quite an interesting combination, like Nintendo kind of having the final say on it, it kind of smooths off some of their like rougher edges.
It's kind of a shame that Platinum as they were are a little diminished and we won't necessarily get to see more of this kind of thing.
Well, that's OK, because I'll go off and make a Kami 2 instead.
Well, that's fine, yeah, that's fine, but I would, you know, they made a lot of games out of Platinum. I liked how many games they made.
Yeah, I also liked them being, I felt for a while they were going to be the Nintendo studio, that was going to be their whole deal, and then it just, you know, for whatever reason, it's not panned out that way.
But maybe that's what Kamiya doesn't like. He's just like, we're too chummy with Nintendo. Yeah, forget.
He's just too badass.
Forget the weird imagery of cops and chains and this. That aside, I think it holds up really well. So yes, Astral Chain wanted something a little bit left field.
This wasn't a mega hit on Switch, as Matthew notes. It was, I think it sold under 2 million copies, a smaller deal, but nonetheless, did better on Switch than it ever would have done on Wii U. So that is something at least, and it's out there if you want to go and check it out.
Something really interesting and different from the first party library. Okay, Matthew, we come back to you for two picks.
Two picks. I'm going to take co-op classic Super Mario 3D Land.
Fuck.
Bowsers Fury.
I was not expecting this. I will allow it though.
I think enough of that game is co-op focused.
Oh, yeah.
It all is. I will allow it.
Yeah, I mean, I feel like as it's this category, I should have to talk about the multiplayer element, which I've only played a little bit of with Katharine and got too cross because she kept winning the levels and getting to wear the crown and then lording it over me with that stupid crown. And so, you know, that wasn't like, that's not like a great marriage memory for me.
That's you being a baby, I will point out.
That is me being a big baby. But, you know, I know people who fully commit to the... I mean, we did commit to the kind of Tomfoolery and sort of shitted headedness that comes with such a mechanic, which is good fun.
Yeah, like I've spoken a lot about my problems with this as a 3D platformer to compare to a galaxy, but it is, you know, what if that galaxy variety plus something, you know, a little bit more traditional in terms of controls and iconography and whatnot. I think Bowser's Fury, the sort of extra campaign they added, mixes things up. It's quite weird how different it is to the campaign.
You know, it isn't this four player co-op thing. You know, it felt like a small 3D Mario game that they made in between that odyssey and whatever they're doing next, where you kind of go around sort of 3D land levels that are hanging in a giant open world and occasionally a giant giga Bowser turns up and sort of blasts the shit out of everything and you have to sort of manipulate this sort of Kaiju Bowser into sort of clearing obstacles for you. I did really, really like that.
That's the thing that excited me most about this, but it is also a really cool co-op thing. Yeah, apologies to Splatoon, which doesn't now get a look in.
Yeah, it doesn't get much love on this podcast. Katharine, I see a person is on the other side of the crown stealing. How do you feel about this game?
Yeah, I sort of, it was definitely going to be probably like, it was definitely in the contention for platformer. I hadn't, I hadn't actually considered it for...
Oh yeah, has it screwed you on platformer?
I now don't have a Mario game, which is what I'm slightly sad about. But yeah, I sort of had almost completely forgotten that this was a co-op game. But yeah, I did definitely have a good time with it.
And yeah, like even though it is, I would say it's, you know, the Bowser's Fury bit does definitely like elevate it in terms of like, you know, this is one of the Wii U ports that's like, I feel like I've played this, had a good time with it at the time. You know, the Bowser's Fury element definitely kind of like gives it a little bit of extra juice. But I feel like as Mario games go, it like for me, again, like Odyssey and Wonder are steps above it, I think, but it's still a great time.
And yeah, definitely the Crown adds a lot.
It does. A great multiplayer experience. I was playing with my brother today, in fact, and the expletives being yelled as we were playing this.
And a bit where I had died and he was, he'd gone up into one of those cloud bits where you get one of the green stars. And as he jumped off the cloud and missed the green star, I just turned to him and went, I think you're just going to have to kill yourself, Oscar. Sorry about that.
Which is, you know, dreadful. I was joking, I'll point out, but it was, that's the kind of thing, competitiveness, the kind of co-opetition aspect of this is not to be underestimated. Apologies again to my brother for that.
Okay, good stuff. Matthew, you have one more pick, right?
Yes. For Metroidvania, I'm going to take the, I think, probably the first non-Switch exclusive on this list. Well, apart from the Wii U ports, I could take Hollow Knight, which everyone knows I'm a huge fan of.
Lots of people who I do really respect, tell me that this is a, not life-defining game, but certainly one of their personal top tens. The way it keeps going and revealing these mad hidden depths. I wish that exploration wasn't as married to, I think, really difficult combat, but I don't know if I'm just, I can't be that much of a noob.
I think it is a difficult game, right?
Yeah, I mean, I think it's...
Yes and no.
Yeah, here we go.
Go on, Katharine.
Well, I mean, I don't know. It's definitely, I mean, I can't play Dark Souls games. Like, I just, I'm just no good at them.
They're my, you know, too difficult genre. I, even being bad at Dark Souls games, I did find Hollow Knight, like, actually fine. Like, it was something, it was manageable.
It was definitely, like, challenging, but it was in that, in that kind of range of, like, oh, this is actually, like, you know, a surmountable challenge. Like, I feel like, like, I can do this. Whereas, you know, actual Dark Souls games are just beyond me.
Yeah. I think, for a minute, I'm not to get too lost in the weeds on it. I just hate the distance between, like, where you respawn and the bosses.
Like, that making that journey back to fight the boss again, that just isn't, that isn't fun to me. Oh, great, I get to do this boring ass platforming. But anyway, let's not distract from that this is a masterpiece.
Many YouTubers have said this is a masterpiece.
Many YouTubers, you know, and former Edge staff who I respect. Cynically, I think this is the only chance I had of making any kind of dent against Metroid Dread. I'm just going to put my hands up and say that.
Well, I think I had another game that I love almost as much as Metroid Dread. I nearly picked in this category. But, you know, this is one of the defining Switch Indies.
So I think it's, you know.
Tell us part of that story as well. So, you know, it's a pretty good pick.
Loads of people played this on Switch for sure. So it's not probably more people play this on Switch than Metroid Dread. So there's that, Matthew.
Okay, good stuff. It comes back to me, right? I better get my Wii U port off of the table.
And in doing so, block Katharine from another platformer by taking Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze.
That's all right. You're more than welcome to that one.
Okay, well so be it. I think this is a really terrific, visually spectacular, set PC, tricky platformer that, you know, a lot of people would have discovered playing on Switch for the first time. And if we put the Funky Kong content to one side, I don't care about any of that.
It's just, this is actually one of the first games I played on the Switch OLED and thought it looked terrific. It's just so visually amazing. But like I say, I think it's the translation of that.
I guess a little bit of what you were saying with Luigi's Mansion 3, Matthew. It just feels like that kind of naughty dog-esque pacing and excitement and level design and just really fucking great set pieces come to life in 2D. But yeah, again, using the 3D visuals in spectacular fashion.
Yeah, just a great game that's been on shop shelves for years because it's one of those evergreen Switch games. And yeah, great to be able to find another audience. But also just, whenever you pick this up, I think it's emerged as a fairly timeless modern Nintendo game.
Thoughts on this one, Katharine?
Yeah, absolutely great game. It's kind of mad that they released this at the start of the Switch's life cycle, then right at the end are still charging the same amount of money for the worst prequel with just Donkey Kong Country Returns. The obvious choice is Tropical Freeze because it's a better platformer in every way.
It looks so much better and just handles brilliantly, more inventive. I really love this game. I don't think I actually played the Switch version.
I think my memory of it is locked away on the Wii U, but yeah, a really, really great platformer for sure, definitely.
Yeah, and it's markedly different to Mario Odyssey as well. So having two platformers in there, you want them to be a little bit further apart. So yeah, good stuff.
Katharine, it comes back to you for two picks.
Okay. I need to sort of like, a lot of play like, as you say, the best games are gone. It's now about securing.
I would say the most obvious games are gone, but not necessarily the best ones.
No, this is true. Would you accept Animal World as a platformer?
It's so firmly a Metroidvania, but you've not taken a Metroidvania.
I have not taken a Metroidvania, no.
I think I would insist it's a Metroidvania, but what do you think, Matthew? No, Matthew, what do you think? Because I'm willing to be lenient if you agree.
I don't know.
You do jump in it, but it's...
Yeah, that is true. I think maybe because we took all the Marios from you, maybe we should just let you have it. But it's only because you haven't picked a Metroidvania where it feels like tactical in some way.
There's probably an element to that. Yeah, I've got a very sure pick for what I would like as Metroidvania. But yeah, I'm happy to not have Animal World as a platform.
I'll pick something else if it's deemed too much of a Metroidvania.
I'll let Matthew have the tie-breaking vote on this.
Is it okay to say no?
I'm okay with it.
Yeah, okay. Then go ahead, Katharine.
Okay, all right.
It's not just because of the whole marriage thing.
Thank you.
Before anyone writes anything on Discord.
Okay. Yeah, I'll take Animal World as my platformer. Just I've really got stuck into this over Christmas, and just absolutely fell in love with it.
Just really smart design. I love all the different, that it gives you all these weird powers in order to do the very challenging platforming.
That is definitely the platforming in a metro train in vain, shall we say. But yeah, it's just a super challenging game, but super interesting. I love searching for all the eggs.
You do have to do some mad platforming to get all of those eggs, which is sort of like... I guess people sort of describe Animal World as having three layers, don't they? They sort of like, you reach the end of the campaign, then like the second layer is the egg hunt, and then like the third layer, which I think I'm perfectly okay with not doing.
I'm, you know, happy leaving it at the eggs. But yeah, that's like all the like super deep level secret stuff.
That's the meta layer for wankers.
Yeah, the meta layer and the, you know, new game plus speed running and all that sort of stuff. I'm happy at the egg stage. But yeah, absolutely loved Animal World.
I thought it was super smart. And yeah, just certainly one of the better games that I've played in recent memory. And yeah, just, you know, perfect, perfect handheld game on the Switch as well.
So for my Metroidvania pick, I'm going to go Prince of Persia The Lost Crown, because I think that that is the second best Metroidvania on the system after Metroid Dread. Just, just another great game. You know, it was, it was made with the Switch in mind.
Like, you know, before it was announced, it sort of, you know, was, you know, went over to Ubisoft Montpellier to like, to preview it and sort of see what it was all about, talk to the devs and, you know, they, they were very clear that like, yeah, we made this game for the Switch to run at 60 FPS on the Switch. It's a Switch first game, you know, but, you know, it's kind of first and foremost. And I think you can just, you can definitely see that in the way that it runs.
And, you know, it just feels just so smooth and great to, you know, to bounce Sargon around all of these, you know, mad gauntlets of death traps and spikes. And, you know, again, this is, I mean, it's a very platforming, heavy Metroidvania.
Yeah, I love this game. I think it's a great pick. I was, yeah, if I didn't get Metroid Dread, I wouldn't have been too sore about picking this instead.
Phenomenal and also arguably the last great Switch technical showcase as well. Just it running at 60 FPS is like magic in your hands. Didn't sell well enough.
Actually really fucking sucks that people didn't buy this, but seem to buy other Metroidvanias in bulk. I actually wonder if... Yeah, it feels like being a Ubisoft game worked against it somehow.
This is way better than Hollow Knight for me. I completely forgot about its existence because I didn't play it on Switch back then.
Oh really? Oh wow. Okay, I thought you were joking then, but no.
No, no, no. I played it on PS5, so...
Yeah, I love this game and you know, it feels like one of those games that should chug on Switch and yet they just, yeah. Them building it, the game around this system is perfect. I mean, the theory I shared on this, Katharine, the podcast before is that if this was a Switch 2 launch title, I think it would have done really well, but it was just allowed to be ignored at the end of the generation.
Just a bummer, really.
It still has a chance to be that.
Yeah, that's true. That's true. I mean, I hope, but the problem is they've been selling it for about 10 quid in the last year.
So it sort of like devalues it a little bit. But nonetheless, okay, comes back around to me. In my ongoing attempts to wage psychological warfare on Matthew Castle, for category 9 Wild Card, I'm going to be taking the Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
What?
You picked some wild games?
This is an astral chain.
I mean, I actually did struggle with Wild Card because you can pick loads of different stuff here. There's a lot in the library. But I thought, what's something that's kind of Switch synonymous?
I know this is a multi-platform game. But the Ace Attorney became, the Switch became Ace Attorney's de facto home over the course of this generation. So, the fact that they did finally port these 3DS games over, translated them and brought them to the West, this prequel Sherlock Holmes, Herlock Sholmes preposterous setting.
I know the first game takes a bit of time to get going, Matthew, and the second game is better. But it was like a lost treasure they brought back. And the fact that Ace Attorney fans like yourselves, could gorge on two massive games at once.
Really, really cool. Lost Shooter Kumi Classics. I am the Shooter Kumi guy on this podcast, as previously established.
Well, yeah, the other game I had for this was Box Boy and Box Girl, a game I like a lot, but I enjoyed playing in cop during the pandemic. But this is just a proper sort of Switch synonymous, not totally obvious pick. Thoughts on this, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, I obviously I think this is absolutely brilliant. I think the Switch has been such a good home to Shooter Kumi's games, like they're pretty much all on there now, apart from Ace Attorney versus Professor Layton, which is great. You know, what a wild thing.
But it is the portability. They just don't make sense on the TV. His adventure games and having these quite handsomely drawn ones.
This one especially just because it's got the 3D character models, it's a bit more elaborate than just the HD version of Ace Attorney. Yeah, it's really good. We've been really lucky with this and Ghost Trick.
I feel like Shooter Kumi's finally done the business he always deserved to do.
Yeah, I agree. It's cool that this happened, and I just don't think it ever seemed like it was going to happen for a while there. It just seemed like these games were going to be a fan translation joint for all of time.
Katharine, did you play these?
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely rinsed through them. I think I played them on PC because I ended up reviewing them for RPS.
But yeah, absolutely great games, both of them. The escalation in the second game in particular, it's just like, yeah, goes to some wild places. But like, yeah, just the animation is beautiful.
Like all of their idle animations, just they feel like... I think these set the template for the trilogy, you know, the two trilogy remasters that we've just seen recently with Apollo Justice and the, I suppose technically two games, Mars Edgeworth collection as well. You know, I think off the back of Great Ace Attorney, that like, oh yeah, people actually do really like and care about these games.
Let's remake all of them and do it to the same, like high standard that we did with these. So yeah, I think they definitely opened doors for the rest of the series on the Switch for sure.
That's awesome. Matthew, were you going to pick this out of interest?
No, I was more surprised that you did. I must admit, my wild card category is a bit of a mess.
It is hard that one.
It is hard because you want to push it to as close to mainstream without it not being a wild card.
Yeah.
And actually, all the ones I've got are just so niche that I may as well just pick them last. I don't think they're going to have any swing on people, annoyingly.
Well, it's possible the Great Ace of Turtles Chronicles won't either, but it's, I don't know, it feels like, I think it fulfills the wild card brief just about, so certainly me picking it makes it a wild card.
Yes, that is a wild card for you, for sure.
Yeah. All right. Well, you've got two picks now Matthew.
I got two picks. Let's go indie game. Let's crack open that bad boy.
And there's two for me which are like, just in-credi games, which, I wouldn't say like necessary synonymous with Wii, but like if you, with Switch, but if you play that, you know, loads of people have played them there. Which one to go for though?
I thought this category would be the next battleground.
Yeah, I don't know if this is quite right, but I think it's right for me. I'm going to take Hades.
Yeah, that was my number one pick for this.
Oh, okay. Interesting. Yeah.
I mean, there's another game which I'm sure will come up, which is just so good and so playable on Switch. Dangerously playable. But yeah, I mean, Hades obviously has this incredibly compelling loop.
It's one of the few rogue lights I think really, really nails the narrative aspect of it in randomizing story encounters along the way and the idea that this repeat trip that you're trying to make through the underworld, that things are changing and your relationship with that world is changing, even though mechanically it feels like you're back to step one every single time. I like the rogue-like structure anyway. I like the idea of going in, seeing what you've got and mixing it up.
But I think that that narrative character level with this is, that isn't a hot take. So that's what everyone takes away from Hades. And hopefully we'll see its influence more on other games.
Just a really great, great action game. Plays incredibly smoothly on Switch. Looks really, really nice on the OLED.
Yeah, everyone loves this on whatever platform they play it. Yeah, I just think the portability of the Switch makes it quite a natural home.
Yeah, didn't Team17 just do a game that's almost this game, but with a different skin? Yeah, I mean, they are beginning to kick off. Yeah, I can't remember what it's called, but it was instantly a success on Steam, I think, because it's still something that's not been so widely cloned that people have burnt out on it.
So, yeah, I mean, like you say, a defining Switch Indie. Yeah, just great, great rogue-like spin on that Diablo hack-and-slash formula with great story telling. I mean, it's got everything in this game.
It's a proper 10, and it's not the only Switch Indie 10, but it's certainly one of them. That's a good choice. Indie game is now a battleground, so let's see what happens.
What's your next pick, Matthew?
My next pick is... You're not going to take it. I don't think Katharine's can take it.
I don't know if it will swing anything, but I've got to have Xenoblade in my draft. For RPG, I think I am going to take Xenoblade Chronicles 3 over 2. Mechanics-wise, I think it's a slightly more interesting game.
I really love the kind of micro classes that you're developing in this. I love the 6 characters and the kind of interplay of all of them. Narratively, I love that it is a stand-alone thing with its own stakes, but also kind of wraps up this trilogy of Xenoblade games.
It looks absolutely amazing. Xenoblade 2 is a phenomenal JRPG. I really, really love that game, but it is a little rough around the edges, like visually, like this, whether on TV or handheld, it never looks quite right.
And I think Xenoblade Chronicles 3 does smooth over some of those kind of harsher elements. You know, that may be a shallow reason to pick it over to amazing music. Just I just love this giant open world thing he has going on.
I would love it. Like, my, you know, more... I'd say after the next 3D Mario reveal, you know, I just want to be told, you know, Monolith have got you covered on Switch 2 at that launch event.
Because Xenoblade 2 was announced when they showed off the Switch for the first time. And that was like, what the fuck? They've already made another one.
And that is a team that, like, they make games. You know, they've got a production level. However they're doing it, it works for them.
And I just, I just don't want to fuck them up. So more of this.
As we all know as well, Matthew values productivity above all else.
That's one of my favorite developers are the AI Slop developers in the e-store. A game a week.
Katharine, you are the other big Xenoblade fan I know. Do you think 3 is the pick of the series in this draft?
I personally probably would have gone for 2. Just partly because again, I think as much as I love Xenoblade, I'm very ashamed to admit that I haven't played a huge amount of 3 just because of working for a PC site. I never really found the time to justify playing it and not another PC game that could have helped me for work.
So this is sitting on my pile of unfinished shame. I did play a big chunk of it and did like what I played of it, but for me too, it's just a more complete and happier memory of just like, oh yeah, this is the good stuff. You know, still, I don't really have a problem with how it too looks.
I still think it looks amazing. The music is also still great. But yeah, I think, you know, it's a fine line between which one you go for.
I am very sad actually that like, I don't think in the categories that I've got left, I could feasibly pick Senate Blade 2. So yeah, I'm sad that that's not on my draft list because yeah, I would have loved to have had one there. But, alas.
Free pick, all our free picks went fast because there's a lot of games that don't really fit wider genre labels on the Switch. So that's, yeah, it does, it did happen that way a little bit for sure. Okay, all right, well, my next pick then, I'm gonna take Indie Game, one of life's great questions.
Bellatro or Into the Breach? Bellatro or Into the Breach? Bellatro or Into the Breach?
Bellatro, taking fucking Bellatro. For the simple reason that I think it's going to get more votes out of those two, because it's fresher in people's minds, it's still taking over people's lives. For those who have not tried to get gold steak on every single deck and have driven themselves completely fucking mad since Christmas, which does describe some people, I think, who listen to this podcast, including Nathan Brown.
So I wish him well and genuinely in trying to accomplish, get over that, finish all the challenges and move on with his life. Bellatro, then, roguelike card game, use poker hands to progress, get increasingly deranged jokers and get the 8th anti, finish it, and feel fucking amazing inside and then do it all over again with a different deck. Just phenomenal stuff.
And, you know, sure, I'm playing it on my phone now, but I did chuck about 30 hours at this on Switch and felt like the last great indie event that happened on Switch, you know, just the last great phenomenon. And, yeah, it was so hot, it had to be taken off sale because, I don't know, something about Peggy being fine with FIFA Ultimate Team, but not cards in Bellatro, which feels like some, with my tin-haut full hat on, feels like some lobbyist nonsense to me, but what do I know? So, yes, Bellatro, you know, one of the kings of modern indie games.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, just crazy good, Bellatro, even though I wasn't absolutely sicker who mostly played this on PS5.
That's so wrong.
It is so wrong. And, like, just pumping that theme tune out of the living room into the house.
That's abuse. That's domestic abuse, literally.
But, yeah, I mean, I've got it on Switch now. I have sort of weaned myself off, Well, that's true, which is good. But it's always there, the siren call.
The second I see a card in like a tweet or anything, I just, you just want to play it again? Cause you're like, oh yeah, I love those guys. I love those jokers.
Yeah, they got my back, those guys. Those are, those are my people. Katharine, Bellatro, did that happen to you last year?
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'm not going to lie. It was between Bellatro and Into the Breach for me.
I was sort of hoping that you'd pick Into the Breach so I could pick Bellatro. Yeah. What more can you say about Bellatro?
It's great. An absolute classic.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gutted.
Yeah, it's really interesting that we both thought about the same two games. There's so many indies on this system and yet, yeah, for some reason it comes down to, yeah, those three, Hades, Bellatro, Into the Breach. Nonetheless, you have two picks, Katharine.
Yeah, I think I probably will take into the breach for indie, just because, yeah, it's a great strategy game. One of the all-time great strategy games. You know, this is the refreshing mini, you know, brain puzzle after like just binging on three houses, basically.
Like just super tight. I love the fact that it's, you know, all of these ultra difficult scenarios are all contained within these tiny little grids. You know, I love that you can see all the moves in advance.
It's just a, it's a real kind of like cerebral exercise, while also just sort of, you know, all the pilots and the mechs feel great and have really interesting abilities. Everything it throws at you is just, it just, yeah, just pushes you to think differently about how to move your, your, your, your little men around the, around the board. Yeah, a great game.
Definitely just, you know, the, the fact that one of the all-time strategy games can be played, you know, it doesn't require a mouse, it can be played, you know, isn't confined to PC.
Okay. Good stuff. So you got another pick here, right?
Yes. I think I've only got multiplayer and wildcard left, and I think I'm probably going to go multiplayer, even though all the good ones are probably gone.
Unless you get the platoon is good.
Champion it. Yeah. You got to make your case champion it.
Don't give in.
No, no, no, no. I'm going to go for Monster Hunter Rise for multiplayer. You know, this is like the weird strand of Monster Hunter that, you know, after World kind of like just convinced everyone that, hey, Monster Hunter is pretty good, isn't it?
You know, and the big shiny home console version, Rise was the weird sort of Switch follow up that, you know, wasn't quite as flashy, wasn't, you know, had some like weird, interesting ideas. I think that like this actually laid the template or, you know, laid a lot of the foundations that you now see in Wilds, you know, that you have a, you had a mount in this that you can ride around that just makes getting around these enormous maps like so much easier. Getting on top of a monster and like, I don't think you can do this in Wilds.
I think in, in Wilds, you're just limited to kind of like whacking it on the head and moving up and down its body when, once you're on its back. But in Rise, you could actually like almost take control of them and like steer them, you know, like round them into walls to do like mega damage or like, you know, basically use them to fight other monsters if, if, if, you know, if, if they kind of came into, into contact. There was just like so much going on in this game and, you know, it still kind of delivers that classic kind of monster hunter experience of just like really, you know, incredible looking monsters even on the Switch.
You know, they, they, they did later do a fancier version for PC and, and home consoles eventually, which, you know, obviously does look a lot better than the Switch version did. But like even within those confines, like this is, yeah, it's still, you know, secretly kind of like one of my favorite monster hunter games of, of recent, you know, of the recent kind of newer batch. It also has like your, your home village has cats that make, you know, mochi balls for you to eat, which is, it's just adorable.
And, you know, a very sort of stern looking cat chef, which wild does not have, which is therefore why Rise is better. And yeah, obviously like, you know, great with friends, this, this, this game. Yeah, I think like I did, I did sort of toy with obviously, you know, RIP Splatoon 3 for multiplayer, but I just, yeah, for me personally, I think I just have a stronger connection to Rise.
I never really kind of really got on the Splatoon train.
Yeah, I think those are two really good picks, considering we're pretty deep into the draft at this point, into The Breach and Monster Hunter Rise. So I think that's a smart multiplayer sort of counter-programming pick.
This is more of a watching over Katharine's shoulders and being equally jealous of the digital mochis and depressed or cross the hour real life cats cannot produce them.
I thought they wouldn't cook us. Wouldn't pound mochi for us.
Yeah, common issue for pet owners, alas. Okay. Right.
Well, good stuff. Comes back to me then for my penultimate pick. I've got RPG and port of a game that's never been a Nintendo platform before.
Let's go with RPG and I'm going to take 13 Sentinels, Aegis Rim, a game that has not been ported to all platforms yet still. I think, is it still locked to PS4 and Switch or did it go somewhere else? Yeah, so this feels like a bit of a breakout game for Vanillaware after producing lots of cultish RPG adjacent games with gorgeous art, gorgeous if horny and slightly problematic arts.
And I feel like this was a bit of a breakthrough moment for them because the idea of having this sci-fi mystery told through all these interconnecting stories was just something like this, very much a kind of mix of like visual novel and RPG, side-scrolling kind of adventure, I guess, with a bunch of sort of like kaiju fighting combat in this almost completely different visual paradigm. Like that combo was just very sort of like particular and exciting to people and just a bit different as an RPG choice on the system and feels like a game where its reputation sort of grew over time as more and more people discovered it. Just the storytelling just really struck a nerve.
And yeah, I think for a lot of people it's still associated as a Switch game, a game they played on this system and like a little bit of a hidden gem, I guess, but I feel like they've discounted it enough times now that people have had plenty of opportunities to pick it up. Matthew, you got deep into this one, didn't you?
Yeah, yeah, this is really, really good. Did you say you were taking it for RPG?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, weirdly, the bit I'm like less into is the like strategy game bit of it, which is the, you know, more traditional game element of it. You know, the rest of it is more of a light adventure game, you know, like amazing interactive stories or visual novel type thing almost.
But, you know, you have to kind of eat the vegetables, which is the tower defense bits, in order to get to the pudding, which is, I mean, yeah, great story telling. I love all the different arcs and seeing how they're all going to kind of collide and all the different sort of genre tropes it plays with.
Yeah, I suppose that is the question. Do you count this as an RPG, Matthew?
Because of the strategy element and like there is a like leveling up to the characters and things like. Like it's not really that different structurally to almost like Fire Emblem in terms of its balance of like story and then here's here's some battles you have to do. I mean, yeah, I thought I've not got a problem with it.
That's probably true for the combat just being like a bit more of an acquired taste and the story being the thing that really resonated with people. I feel like people have the same relationship to this so you have with something like Evangelion where it's like really intense and emotional and sad in places, but it really just sort of sinks its claws into you. There it is then.
That's my penultimate pick. One more to go. And we come back to you, Matthew.
Yes. My last two. Yeah.
Port of a game that's never been on a Nintendo platform before. I thought this was a good category in that it's kind of a big part of the Switch story, but it's also the category in which I'm least invested in.
They feel quite lukewarm, don't they, the picks and this?
Yeah, cos there's loads which are great. And often the miracle is that they managed to make them work, or that Switch was big enough that people felt like they had to make it work. A lot of these games I think people love, but not necessarily on Switch.
They probably tolerate it on Switch and love it elsewhere.
Baladeer loves these games on Switch.
Yeah, so it's trying to get the balance of something which is legit good. I am going to take, only because it's been vouched for by one of our most trusted guests, I'm going to take Alien Isolation.
Yeah, okay, interesting.
Which is a game, you wouldn't necessarily think, oh, this is going to work brilliantly well, but by all accounts, an incredible poor Andy Kelly, Mr. Alien Isolation, literally wrote the book on the subject, vouches for it. The inky darks of the OLED screen, in the same way that Katharine is poaching from Digital Foundry, I'm happy to take Andy Kelly's observations as my own. Alien Isolation, I don't think you have to vouch for as a game.
A survival horror masterpiece, one of the defining games of that genre. I wouldn't say that horror is brilliantly represented on Switch. There's not loads there.
So yeah, along with all my cute giant fruit platformers, let's have something that will really fuck you up in space.
You've picked that for a draft in the last like six months. I think I might end up doing something similar here. So yeah, that makes sense.
What's your next pick?
My final pick is we've got to have a little bit of Castle Bullshit in, and that's what I still see Wildcard as. Sorry, I should be more specific. Matthew Castle Bullshit.
I think one of the great success stories on Switch, third party Square Enix, I think they've treated the platform with incredible respect, put some amazing, amazing games on there, like the RPGs. I mean, you could fill a whole category with just Square Enix games, but I've got to go for the brilliant weirdo adventure that they decided to make. Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo.
Fuck yeah, he's cooking.
It was, you know, obviously Centennial Case, also on Switch. Don't think it's the optimal place to necessarily play that game. I actually really like watching that on TV, as it has an interactive movie element.
But Paranormal Sight, as this spooky visual novel adventure set over a small window of time, as you hop between characters who've all been affected by a series of strange curses, or carry the means to spread strange curses. And part of the game is just about navigating all these lives, getting through the day in one piece, while also working out who can curse who. And it's that, you know, even though it is this very linear, you know, visual novel, I think the actual, the setup of it really caught my imagination.
And you know, you're invested in it as an intellectual exercise of trying to work out, you know, who has what curse, what do all these different curses do, and the way it kind of plays with urban legend. It's just a really spooky, neat little game that Square Enix absolutely didn't have to make. Probably will never make anything like this again.
Yeah, a couple of very cool meta, sort of almost Kojima-like twists in the mix. Super playful. If you've got a Switch, definitely give it a go.
Yeah, I mean, it's a Castle classic. I've never played it, but it's sort of, out of the games you've talked about in this podcast, maybe one of the more visually appealing of these kinds of games that I've sort of put on my wishlist. In fact, just today, I got an email from a deal site saying it's dropped in price on the Switch, so I've definitely, like, you know, sort of, I've not ignored your recommendation here, Matthew.
Well, that's good. I think that the whole bit doesn't work, like, if you have played it. I like, you know, I like that it is just this thing that only exists as a funny name to you.
It's one of the better podcast bits.
Thank you.
I also thought, I'll say for this, because I don't think anyone else will pick them, I was also toying with Sheeran the Wanderer, the Mystery Dungeon of Serpent Coil Island, which I played a chunk of last year. I'm just really, really bad at it. And I just wanted to say, because I know a few people who listen to this podcast are like super into that game and, and, you know, I get it and I respect it, but paranormal sight is more my speed.
Yeah, I think that's, that's, that's fair. This category should be used for good, I think. So yeah, that, that makes sense to, to, to take that here.
Okay. Well, good choices, Matthew. Comes back around to me for my final pick.
That is Port of a Game that's never been a Nintendo platform before. Let me tell you some of the mental gymnastics I did here. Matthew picked Alien Isolation.
Thought about that. Thought about Skyrim, but I think any self-respecting player in 2025 is going to want to mod Skyrim, so won't be playing on Switch. They'll play it on a platform where you can mod it visually, make it look a bit nicer, give it some quality of life stuff.
Portal Companion Collection. I don't actually believe anyone wants to replay Portal, because I think once you've done this, it was once you've kind of done. Nier Automata I thought about, but I don't really think of this as a Switch game.
I think it still needs a little bit more graphical oomph. So I played on PC and I know that it's flawed wherever you play it, but again, couldn't quite get there. But what I did settle on is a game where I feel like the visual style matches the Switch well, and where I feel like I heard the most cries to bring it to Switch while it wasn't on Switch, and that's Persona 5 Royal, which a game that you want to play for, if you're going to play it for 100 hours, you want to be able to take it with you on some train journeys, some commuting, get some funny looks for people as you're equipping some of the alternate costumes in the game perhaps.
But again, we talked about many times in this podcast, obviously part live sim, part dungeon crawling turn-based RPG, and the live sim stuff really gives it its power, just the variety of locations you go to, how invested you get in the different friends you make in school, how much you despise all the different villains whose mind palaces you're invading. A true modern classic and at home on Switch for sure. Obviously, this is originally made for PS3 and PS4, so well within the Switch's capabilities.
Thoughts on this pick, Katharine?
Yeah, I also had like Nier Automata down as one of the things, but yeah, it sort of felt a little bit kind of compromised in terms of like being a good pick, but yeah, I think like definitely this is, as you say, I would love to play a Persona game on not a television. It feels like a really good... I actually hadn't considered this as an option.
I sort of had forgotten that, I don't know, did the Persona 4 port that they did, was that only PC?
Persona, as in the Persona 4 Golden?
Golden was on Switch as well.
Yeah, Golden was on Switch as well. I think they did it all at the same time. Yeah.
They did that thing where basically 3, 4 and 5 came out on everything.
Yeah. And so, yeah, so, you know, they, yeah, and 5 is obviously the most recent one. I think the most sought after one.
But Matthew, Matthew, what do you think of this pick?
Yeah, kind of an annoying pick because I also forgot about it. Yeah, I was, yeah, I was trying to think of like, I was thinking more along the lines of The Miracle Ports, which Persona 5 doesn't necessarily screen that because of its visual style. But that is probably the most popular of these three games.
So that's good draft and annoying.
Okay, that's what I wanted to hear. So Katharine, it's your final pick.
Yeah, it's Wildcard. I sort of had quite a niche indie for this just because I really like it. I probably could pick something a bit more mainstream or verging more on the mainstream, but I think I'm going to just go with my original pick, which is Ender Lily's Quietus of the Nights, Nights spelt with a K.
This is just... I played this for the first time last year. It's a Metroidvania, you know, quite sort of fairly traditional sort of 2D Metroidvania made by two developers, weirdly, both Japanese of Adglobe and Livewire, published by Binary Haze Interactive.
All names that you will not be familiar with, because I think that they haven't really made a huge amount else, but it's yeah, this it's it's the platforming or like the the Metroidvania of it is just, you know, the controls really are really satisfying. It has this very interesting kind of hook of you play as this kind of quite defenseless, like young girl, but in defeating the monsters around you, you kind of like absorb their powers, or like they appear as like spectral sort of companions that you kind of assign to the buttons to you know, basically have a whole bunch of different attacks, you know, to kind of to fight your way through this kind of like slightly kind of rotten land. You know, you're sort of trying to find the source of this of this kind of like evil rain or blight that's, you know, kind of done for everyone else around you apart from you.
Yeah, just just like it has amazing music. I really love like the soundtrack by I think that they are the group is called like Milly. But just very sort of like soft and a little kind of like it really reminds me of like a particular anime composer that I was really into when I was a teenager called Yuki Keshira.
I think did a lot of the hack the dot hack sign games or anime rather. But that's a complete side note. But yeah, absolutely fell in love with this last year.
They've just the same sort of team of developers has just done like a sequel called Ender Magnolia, Bloom in the Mist. That's kind of slightly ridiculous names, but they are really, really good. And yeah, like Ender Magnolia is a really interesting kind of evolution of that sort of formula.
But I think for me, Ender Lily's just sort of picked it in terms of like just a more interesting mix of powers. Yeah, just sort of like a slightly more sort of traditional, clearer Metroidvania sort of structure in the way that you get around this place. And yeah, lots of secrets to find.
Yeah, just I think, you know, if you haven't played this game, it is really, it is probably one of the, after Metroid Dread, Prince of Persia and Hollow Knight, probably one of the, you know, and Animal World. And Animal World. You know, the premier hidden gems of the Metroidvania genre on Switch, or in any platform really.
But yeah, seek it out. It's really good.
It's a real nice looking game. I definitely, when the sequel came around, I feel like I saw like three or four diehard sort of Switch heads talking about this game. Maybe Ashley Day was one of them.
Just sort of, yeah, going to bat for this. I think it's good to use this category for something that, you know, is interesting and unusual. And not just using the category to piss off Matt Castle, which is what I did.
So I applaud that. That's a good final pick, Katharine, Ender Lilies. Yeah, that's really cool.

You should be taking up a platformer, Katharine.
Yeah. Not a fan. Too easy, Katharine.
I actually had this down for our action adventure. It's one of those kind of weird crossover games, isn't it?
Yeah.
I'd have accepted that, actually.
I wonder if Prince of Persia Lost Crown is actually more of a platformer. I could easily swap the round, couldn't I? You've made your genre a bed and must sleep in it.
I have, and I will.
