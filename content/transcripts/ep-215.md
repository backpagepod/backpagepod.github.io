Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, I watched the harrowing film Red Rooms last night, which you had previously rated. And I'm pleased to say that this is the third film that should have been in our very cursed Patreon episode with threads and Speak No Evil. It is like perfectly complimentary to those.
It's like a cursed artifact, but messed me up quite a lot. I wanted to give it a quick shout out. I'm sure a lot of our listeners have seen it by now.
It's on BFI player in the UK, but it's a Canadian film entirely in French. It was the good shit. What did you make of that one?
Yeah, I liked it. As I was watching it, something I liked about it was thinking, oh, I wonder if this is gonna pass as a film that would mess you up, which I know you always rate. It was like, oh, good, this will be a good recommendation for Sam.
Definitely played into my thinking. Yeah, just incredibly sinister without really showing you anything. Very good on the subject of, I guess, the sort of the pull of things that you shouldn't see or you know are gonna be awful.
Yeah.
But that does exist in people. Like when someone tells you you shouldn't see something, you want to see it to see why you shouldn't see it. And that is what this film is about.
Yeah. It's one of those things where I think it's better to just go watch it rather than read too much about it because I knew very little about it. I thought from the first 20 minutes it was going to be like Anatomy of a Fall or something.
There's a lot of courtroom stuff, but it is not that. But yeah, it is very, very good. It is quite disturbing.
I've never shouted Jesus Christ and Good Lord at the TV more when watching something. And it's a few bits in the last hour that I had to actually pause it and go, right, I need a moment to breathe before I watch this next thing. So it did pass the past muster with me, Matthew, as one of those films.
So thank you for your hard work there and watching that and recommending that. I appreciate it. So this episode, The Best Games of 2004, one of our oldest podcast formats, just going back over the years.
We primarily started with years we worked in games media, ran out of those. In fact, that's not true. We got to 2017, it all got a bit too depressing and recent.
So we decided to rewind the clock last year. I think it was last year we did 0102, 03. So I don't think we have done one of these since maybe spring last year, Matthew.
So it's been a little while. I think so. I think Best Games of 2003 was last spring.
Let me have a quick look. Best Games 2003, Back Page Pod. See if Graham's website's got our back.
Episode 172, that does sound like a while ago. Yeah, last April. So that's how long it's been.
I mean, I guess we did the Best Games of 2024, right? So it's not like we haven't revisited this format in any form. But yeah, this more retrospective looking format, a bit of a mix of memories of the time, and then two top 10 lists.
I do enjoy them, but they are undertaking. So we do need to space them out a little bit, which is why we've waited a while. So we're almost done with this period of history too.
We've only got 2005 left, and then we can either go to 2017 onwards from there, or we can, I don't know, rewind further to 1999, 1998, something like that. I don't know if I have 10 games for those years though, Matthew.
I don't know if I've got memories of those years.
No, I don't really remember. I remember the World Cup in 1998, and I remember Britney Spears in 1999. That's about it.
I remember Princess Diana dying.
Yeah, I remember Kevin Keegan leaving the England team. I think that was 2001, 2002. We haven't really done those.
Yeah, I do remember Princess Diana as well. Clearly, as important in an event in British history as Kevin Keegan being humiliated at Old Wembley before they shut it down.
Yeah, and me getting Discord 2 for Christmas on PC.
It will probably be that we won't do any earlier than this. We might find other ways to talk about 90s games though, so we'll circle back to that. But 05 is still to go, and yes, 17 onwards should we wish to do it.
We will see, but pleased to do it 04, Matthew. This is quite an important year for me personally. I was curious what you remember of 2004.
What was Matthew Castle up to this year?
So this was the remainder of my first year at university, and then the first term of my second year. Probably one of the most gaming-like years of my life, in terms of being at university, not having much money to buy new games. The money that I did have, I was spending on films and cinema instead.
I was going through a big, big, big film phase all the time I was at university. I think I stopped reading games magazines for chunks of this. I definitely wasn't buying Games Master and the like when I was at university.
I don't know how that would have sat with my peers. Not that I was embarrassed by them or anything. I just wasn't spending money on much stuff at all.
That said, I played a lot of one game this year. I played loads of Mario Kart Double Dash, which was a game from the year before. This was like our multiplayer game of choice.
And my real lasting memory of 2004 is pretty much every day doing an hour of Mario Kart after dinner in my friend Dave's room. He had a TV. I didn't actually bring a TV with me to university, so my GameCube was set up in his room permanently.
Just to play Double Dash. Whenever we played in there, he would play his own music. Like that was, that was like, not a rule as such, but we weren't listening to Double Dash.
We were listening to his quite heavy indie music that I didn't like. So it's, yeah, it's like the rainbow silliness of Mario Kart combined with some, probably some sort of subgenre of rock that I don't really know what it is. You know, some kind of, you know, post-rock or maths rock or whatever the fuck they call it.
Yeah, he was into some quite funky stuff. So that was fun. And getting really tied up in who was winning.
I think we had a series of bets over the year in Mario Kart. It was like the first person to win 50 days of Mario Kart would have to do X or Y. One of them definitely involved having, I, you know, this will not surprise our listeners.
I'm not a clubbing person. That isn't my natural habitat. And I definitely had to go to some godawful nightclub because I was shit at Mario Kart.
That's, you know, I paid the price for my lack of skills, specifically balloon battle. That was the mode we played. We weren't even racing in Mario Kart.
We were just playing like the battle arenas over and over again while fucking Kraftwerk droned on in the background. Kraftwerk and good speed, you black emperor. That's what we played Mario Kart to.
60 days of Mario Kart. I think that would pair well with 500 days of summer or 100 years of solitude, Matthew. That's kind of perfect, I think.
So yeah.
Yeah. So that was like the thrust of my gaming life and the social life I remember. Obviously, I've got a lot of very specific memories of university, but I was just more interested in my friendships at university and getting to know people and hanging out with people rather than my hobbies this year.
Yeah, I think that makes sense. I mean, I have a very similar story of this year, really. It's sort of like-
So, how old are you in 2005?
2004, I was 16 or 15 turning 16. So, this was the end of my time at school, as in year 11 of GCSE, and then it was the start of my first year at college in the second half of the year. So, quite a pivotal year in some ways.
I'm trying to remember what I talked about on the Bully Patreon episode we did, which had some of my memories of leaving school in it.
A boy got punched on a beach and he got hit so hard his cap flew off his head and landed on your head, or you picked it up and something happened.
Landed in my hands, it didn't land on my head, but I can see now why your family pull you up on details you've changed in stories about you.
Listen, my version is better. A boy got punched so hard that his cap landed on your own head.
This is exactly how you end up with a line up of consoles. An identity parade of consoles after a robbery. This was, it felt significant.
I didn't play many games this year either, even though this, we'll talk about the profile of the year, it's a bit stranger for that, but this is probably the only year of my teenage years where I didn't really engage with games that much. The only games I really remember picking up this year were actually from previous years in sales and stuff, so that's not true, actually, it's one game I bought at full price from this year that we'll talk about in the top 10 list, but otherwise, everything I picked up was, this was the year I got a Visa or Electron card, I just started buying random bullshit on Amazon and play.com, so I bought Buffy Chaos Bleeds, I bought Shenmue 2 on Xbox, I bought Deus Ex, Invisible War, I think they all came from play.com, and they're all about 12 quid each, basically, so that was a key thing that happened.
When you unlocked online shopping for the first time, that is just incredible, the power.
It is so exciting. So it was also a thing where I just realized I could buy games that were, I was 16, but for whatever reason, Amazon would sell you an 18 rated game if you had a Visa or Electron card, it just took it as a mode of payment. So I was like, yeah, fuck yeah, I'll just buy, this is how I'll buy the GTA game that came out this year, for example.
So yeah, that was significant. It was very kind of emotional and weird. I remember I went out more at this age too, because this was definitely like there was an undercurrents the year before of, oh, kids in your year are going to the beach and drinking alcohol, even though they're not supposed to.
And I think I was a little bit too cautious to really engage with that. I thought, oh shit, I'll get arrested because I always fucking think the worst about everything. I'm always fearing the worst-case scenario.
But this year I actually did go. I remember taking, my dad led me some cans of Carling to take to the beach with me. And then Stokes...
Was that good or is that mortifying?
It's probably, I think it was actually a kind gesture. Their thinking was, if we just give him some of the weak alcohol we have here, it'll stop him from drinking anything like just having a litre of vodka and then passing out on the beach or something.
As long as it didn't have an undercurrent of like, go and be a proper lad, you know?
I think...
Embarrassment of like, we don't want to dweep, son.
It was maybe a tiny bit of that. I think they just thought, oh wow, he's actually going out and doing this, so we want to encourage him a little bit. Which seems twisted, but I think they had the right idea because I remember like one Saturday I also started working in One Stop Convenience Store this year.
I transitioned out of the paper round and into that. It's like graduation except at a fucking One Stop Convenience Store. So that happened this year and then I basically just remember going in like hungover.
My parents were like coaching me through my first hangover. They were like, it's okay son, just drink like two liters of water and then like breathe a little bit and then like, you know, just take your time walking to the shop and you'll be all right, don't worry about it. And it was that kind of stuff, which probably is a bit embarrassing in retrospect.
But at the time, my friends were very grateful that I had like parents who were providing alcohol because theirs weren't. But I remember going into a co-op and buying, I had no idea, and this very scared looking young woman served me like White Lightning cider and then I took that to like the Stanley Park in Gosport where I grew up. And we just drank this horrible, horrible cider.
But I remember my friends being like, yeah, Samuel got served and I did not look 18 at all. I really did look like a little boy, if you see photos of me from this time now. But that was significant.
So there's a few, a few occasions where we were going out and drinking. And it was weirdly part of the culture. And I guess that's kind of the sort of thing that TV shows like Skins would address.
There is a youth drinking culture. I don't know if it still exists, but it certainly was for millennials. That was a thing.
You were living the true Skins existence.
Yeah, except, you know, no sex and no cool friends. So that was good. And didn't look as handsome as Nicholas Holt.
So that's good. Yeah, otherwise exactly the same. Yeah, it was I had this like, it's weird, though, this seemed like a really pivotal year at the time.
And I remember loads from it because it seemed important. But in retrospect, obviously, it was it was not at all because all the things that happened to you when you were 16, they're generally speaking, you know, it's like you're really about two to five years away from the really important memories you have from from occurring, basically, or starting. And so there was this time that like a kid who was at our school like left and went to Canada.
It was like during the summer. I remember this really sort of like beautiful evening and like walking to this. This is like this big fort on the beach in Gosport where I grew up.
This is called Fort Gilkega. I think they've knocked it down to build some shitty houses or something recently, but it was it was like this abandoned military fort, very like Stranger Things-esque. It's got this big sort of like spinning radar thing with this light that was blinking.
And like these it's like it must be from before World War II. It's like these massive wooden gates and this huge hill. And it had like a bomb shelter on the side of it.
And it was it was quite a space. And so all the kids would go drinking at this big fort basically. And it was I just remember it seemed like it was a really important evening that this guy had known for like six years was moving on or whatever.
But obviously it wasn't that important.
But you know, that sounds like the plot to that that indie game where they go to the beach with the radio. What the fuck is that called?
Oxenfree.
Oxenfree. Are you sure you're not talking about Oxenfree?
The same events did then transpire 30 times over until I eventually broke the cycle, Matthew. But no, this did happen. It's like me and my little mates, Donald and Ryan, and we went to the beach and we just got drunk.
And it was like we attempted to sleep out on the beach and then realized that was preposterous. And we all woke up at 3am just incredibly hungover and angry and then went back to my parents' house and everyone just crashed in different rooms basically. This all happened.
For a brief moment there it seemed like I was a cool teenager, but I wasn't really. That was yeah. And I remember just I remember these like these like Russell and my mates and this girl, these girls watching me play Buffy Chaos Bleeds on my TV.
Very cursed memory. But then and I will stop talking about myself shortly, Matthew. But this is all like foundational stuff.
I leave school and then the next obviously the rest of the year is going to the sixth form, which is at the same school. But it was like I don't know what your college based experience was like. But in my town where I grew up, you could go to like one of two colleges basically.
There was St. Vincent across the across town, which was like not nearly as successful in terms of like grades for the different students. But they did let you behave like an adult. They let you take your free time.
They let you use your free time as you wish. At my school, they treated you like you were still at school. And so your free periods had to spend in basically detention inside like the IT rooms or something doing work in silence.
And it was so shit. But you could tell that all of the people who were running the college thought that that was their competitive advantage because they were treating you like children. And I hated it.
I hated being there. I really, funny, I really like going, I like the last couple of years of school, but I hated this place. I hated the people who ran the college.
You thought they were so brilliant. Honestly, just crap experience, like all time, bad experience. It culminates with me flopping grades-wise the next year.
And this was like a really foundational moment for my sort of like feelings of success and failure, basically. So it all kind of happens here. And it was like, I'll stop talking about it now.
But that was, it seemed like quite an important year at the time. But obviously, in the grand scheme of things, it's not. But yeah, that was me at 16.
Any thoughts, Matthew?
Well, I mean, I've pieced together some of this picture from your bully anecdotes before. That seems pretty standard and normal behavior and things to kind of go through. I was so boring as a 16-year-old.
And if you remember, if you go back a couple of these episodes, you know, having no misadventure ever, it all kind of sort of sounds good to me.
Yeah, I mean, you know, that's basically it. It was like standard teenage years, but kind of fun, you know, seemed like eventful. And I remember being really hung over after my semi-formal, the prom thing, and going to watch Troy on the big screen, which was a turd, but did have that one really good fight sequence in it between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, Matthew.
So yes, that was my 2004. Good stuff.
Usain Troy there reminded me that I was ramping up reviewing films for the student paper for the rest of 2004. Did I review Troy? I definitely reviewed that one with all the old monsters.
It was like Dracula and Frankenstein.
Van Helsing.
Van Helsing, yeah.
Shite.
I reviewed that and enduring love with Reese Ifens or someone falling out of a hot air balloon and falling in love with Daniel Craig.
All right.
That was weird. I think I was just trying to clearly establish myself as a film guy, if not the film guy, because there weren't loads of people in our year, so it's quite easy to become known as the person who knew a lot about films. I was in my first year of uni still in 2004.
There was a guy in the third year called Nigel, who used to see me and he's just, the only thing he knew about me was that I liked films. And he used to say, how are the films? Whenever he saw me, as if like I, you know, I was the barometer for like the health of the entire global film industry and be like, yep, they're good, thank you.
There have been some good films, films continue to be good. There was a chap who lived upstairs who had loads of pirate DVDs of things which hadn't come out in the UK yet. And I remember doing an all nighter, trying to get an essay done for a tutorial the next day.
And then deciding at about three in the morning to take a break and stop to watch Hero, the Chinese action film, on my laptop, off this pirate DVD someone had lent me because it hadn't come out in the cinema yet in the UK. I remember sitting there and having like my mind blown by how good it was. And then coming to breakfast the next day all bleary-eyed as if I'd had some kind of cultural epiphany about, you know, oh, this might be the best film I've ever seen in my life.
But I think it's because I watched it at three in the morning and was really, really tired. Had drunk lots of coffee because I was drinking coffee back then, which, you know, I definitely don't do now.
Yeah. So that was kind of a bit of a reflection of your pop culture consumption of that year then. So we've got Van Helsing, Enduring Love and Hero.
What a multi-faceted cultural year. Mine was far more basic than that. I do always like to talk about what we were watching at that time.
So sometimes I think this helps conjure a sense of place to the listeners, Matthew, when they can remember a chunk of time where stuff that was meaningful came out. So Spider-Man 2, obviously, that was this year, probably the best sort of modern superhero film still. If you don't count The Dark Knight, I don't know.
We don't need to get into that now. The OC started in the UK this year, that was significant to me. Big into that show at the time, teen drama, quite well written, nicely shot.
Doug Liman directed the pilot, so it was always a bit of an elevated version of the kind of sort of Dawson's Creek teen drama thing that was big on the WB in the US at this time. Dodgeball, that was this year, that was a big comedy for my generation, Matthew, I'm sure you watched that too. Anchorman, that came out this year, I didn't watch that this year, but that did come out this year as well.
Yeah, we mentioned Troy Van Helsing, the TV show Angel ended this year. Yeah, the TV show Angel ended this year, the series finale of that absolutely broke my brain, cliffhanger ending, genuinely probably ruined about the next 10 months for me trying to get over that, so that's rational sort of teenager stuff. I think they added Lois to Smallville this year, Matthew, significant Erika Gerrads, in favour of yours.
My Smallville years came much later, I watched it all in about 2006, so.
That makes sense, I mean, I was watching Alias this year, this is also the year that I think they brought out Firefly on DVD in the UK, and that started to become a bit of a thing.
Yeah, I had that at uni, that Alias, Firefly, maybe season one of Veronica Mars?
Oh yeah, that was, I think I got that in 06, I got those DVDs, but I did note that, I think Battlestar started properly this year, or was definitely on this year, and then Veronica Mars, yep, that was, that started in late 04 in the US, and Eternal Sunshine was this year, Collateral was this year, the Michael Mann film with Tom Cruise, which fucking rules, great film.
Oh, Eternal Sunshine reminds me of something actually. This was the year that me and a couple of friends got into, I don't want to say student politics, it was like the JCR, which was like the kind of committee that ran the student body, I guess. And there were certain positions on the JCR, if you got them, you got a room in college guaranteed in third year, rather than having to live in one of the dormitory blocks about 20 minutes away, which I thought would suck.
So we kind of campaigned quite hard for various positions. I became JCR secretary, so just like writing up the minutes. But my friend Cyrus, who you've met, he ran for treasurer, and we made him like a promotional party political broadcast type thing.
That only because, this is the Eternal Sunshine connection, I had the Eternal Sunshine soundtrack, which obviously had Mr. Blue Sky on it, which was incredibly popular at the time, because of Eternal Sunshine. Like it was always playing in trailers and whatnot. And the little party political video was set to that.
So it seemed really fun. He seemed like a very fun and energetic candidate. And he absolutely destroyed and did win.
It seems dumb calling it the election. Makes it sound more important than it is. He won the vote and became the treasurer.
But I always look back on it fondly. So if you remember when I got married, he was my best man. And the bit of his best man speech that I really remember was describing me as the Steve Bannon to his Trump, because we'd made this stupid video with Mr. Blue Sky to kind of like win, just win everyone over because they liked the song.
Yeah, that this was my introduction to political scheming also.
A very rich, rich year. I feel like a lot happened to you.
It was a rich year than I remembered making my notes.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, I mean, wow, that's that's quite the thing. Eternal Sunshine is a film I watched much later.
If I'd have seen it at the time, there's no way I would have appreciated it on the level that you're supposed to. But it's obviously a very significant film for our generation, Matthew. So that happened.
Was Firefly a big thing for you?
I loved Firefly. Yeah, I bought that on DVD. Yeah, I was just absolutely obsessed with that, watching that on my laptop.
I watched so many things sitting at my desk on my laptop. And to anyone walking past, it must have looked like I was always working. Yeah, because I was sitting at my desk with my laptop open.
But actually, I was just watching just endless seasons of TV. Yeah, Firefly, that was really good. Though Firefly, you fall in love with it and have your heart broken because, you know, obviously it ends after whatever, 13 episodes.
So it's a sense of, oh, well, you know, I'm so all in on this bunch of people, but that's all I'm ever going to get. Yeah. So it was a bummer.
But you kind of knew that going in. Everyone knew what the deal was.
Yeah, it was still, you know, worth watching. But I definitely feel like I learned some lessons with Firefly about TV shows that would get canceled and not to bother with them because, like you say, to avoid the heartbreak that you described there. That's definitely true.
I bought... Oh, sorry.
No, go ahead.
I bought Season 1 of The Wire on DVD and it was like fucking 70 quid. Because it was like, that's what HBO seasons cost back then. But I was so desperate to watch it.
Yeah, because this was like all the HBO shows were taking off. I really wanted to see Deadwood, but it was only on Sky. Had to wait another year, I think, for that on DVD.
But yeah, I can remember watching The Wire and being very ahead of the game on that one, I thought.
Yeah, I think you were. Did it start in 0102, The Wire, something like that? And then did it go from there?
I think it was something like that, wasn't it? It was definitely, yeah.
Yeah, it might have even been like late 03 or something.
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, definitely ahead of the curve on that one. I can't believe how old that show is.
That makes sense, but I think it was ending, as I started to imagine, which is grim to consider. Yeah, so the only other thing I was going to note pop culture-wise from this year on my side, Matthew, was this is the year that the Ozone's Dragostea Dinte comes out, which is the Maya He, Maya Ha Ha song that became a meme. I had a friend who had the single of that, was fucking obsessed with it, and that was definitely an 04 summer anthem for your boy.
So I wanted to mention that. Anything else you wanted to note pop culture-wise?
I got, I opened some kind of special bank account for like aimed at students when I joined university. And as part of that, I got sent some free CDs, which I assume were CDs which were popular enough that people would be encouraged to sign up with Nat West for them. So because I banked with Nat West, like this year I owned a Skunk and Nancy CD that I never listened to.
That's so good. Amazing.
It's like imagine a CD collection, which is just like just the Divine Comedy, a couple of Randy Newburn albums, maybe a bit of the Pet Shop Boys and Skunk and Nancy.
I would consider you incredibly hard to profile from that. I'd be like, who is this man? That's what I think.
It may even create intrigue amongst the lady folk of Oxford.
No, not at all. And a copy of The Best of Queen, which I had to hide after a person I befriended was very, very sneery about people who had best of albums. So I thought I'd hide it so I didn't lose cool points.
Hey, I mean, fuck them. The album I listened to most this year was In Time, The Best of REM., which is a best of album, and it fucking ruled, frankly.
So I was assisting to the great beyond over and over again because I was a miserable teenager. Good stuff. Well, obviously, your love of Skunk and Nancy lives on to this day, so that was important that that happened.
I mean, this year, also, I guess, like, something that is super important goes on to be super important is Oldboy came out and I saw Oldboy, first Korean film I ever saw and instantly began this, well, I'm now obsessed with this thing, you know? I'd just never seen anything like it before in terms of the violent sort of genre mashup, the crazy pristine visuals, just the style of the thing. That was like a proper exciting like 18 rated film to go and see at the cinema.
That and Saw as well, Saw was quite a big one from late this year and just this sense of like, oh yeah, we are of a perfect age to go and see these gnarly films, which they sort of sold themselves on like, are you bold enough to come and watch this incredibly harrowing thing? And we were like all in on that. So they were some good times.
That has dislodged another memory actually, which is that this is the year that I bought all of the available Futurama and Simpsons DVDs and the power I felt in my hands as I like bought season 4 of The Simpsons. And remembering it turning up, like in the summer of this year when I was off for 10 weeks between year 11 and sixth form. And just being like, I can watch this whenever I want.
The BBC and Sky no longer have power over me. That was like palpably how I felt every time one of those DVD box sets came out, Matthew. Embarrassing shit, but hugely important.
Simpsons on DVD, like the entire season for the first time, it seemed like a massive deal. And I remember specifically the buy one, get one free deal at Woolworths that I used to buy them all, to hoard them all.
We had one Simpsons VHS, which we had for years and years and years. And it had four episodes on it. The only one I remember is I think the first episode on it was Stonecutters.
So, I've seen Stonecutters an abnormal number of times, you know?
Yeah, I hated that so much. That was the only way you could get them for so many years. It was just so shit.
What a bad... Yeah, like 20 quid for four episodes. I mean, the worst thing in the world.
I was like a habitual... I had like a TV video conbie and I had so many Simpsons episodes recorded. So yes, this was a key coming of age moment for me to own these on DVD.
Important stuff. So, that's pop culture, Matthew. I think that creates a good time and place for people.
Certainly was entertained by your stories. So, how do you think this year compares to 0102 and 03 in terms of games? Because we have both said that this is not a huge year for us games-wise.
I've got a pretty strong idea of the profile of the year after prepping for this episode, but I was curious what you thought as a conversation starter.
I didn't prep as thoroughly. My sense of the year was, as a Nintendo fan, quite a good year for Game Boy Advance, quite a rancid year for GameCube. I think I bought one GameCube game this year, maybe two?
No, two. I felt like a lot of the big hitters had happened in the last couple of years, so in that awkward period where the Zelda team are now working on the next Zelda and Mario team working on the next Mario and whatnot. So it becomes a little thin, which maybe also factors into the fact that I didn't play as much.
Obviously, I know that there's some mega big hitters this year and some absolutely era-defining games come out. Probably had a better perception of PC. In my head, this is the era of Far Cry, Half-Life 2, Doom 3, I think.
And so, a year of three mega graphics games. And, maybe the last time in my head, I can picture a moment where PC is just so far ahead of the game in terms of graphics power and the console PC Golf felt pretty big in that moment. It's sort of how I remember it.
Is this where you tell me I'm completely wrong and all that?
No, I think that's, actually, it's good to hear your perspective on it because you were thinking of it directly from, you know, these are the consoles I had at the time, this is how it felt at the time, which is the right way to think about it. I think by this time I had both an Xbox and a PS2, but I don't think I didn't have a gaming PC anymore. I didn't have access to a powerful enough gaming PC.
So, I have a slightly skewed sort of like way of perceiving this year. But to me, it seems like a year of about five or so mega hitters, just like monstrously huge games. And then everything else is like a kind of a tier below it, you know?
It's sort of like this, a real elite tier from this year, hugely anticipated things that have been like, you know, years in the making that were, were hyped even, you know, like one to two to three years before, and finally came along this year. I think they defined the year to a large extent. And then I actually don't think it's like a hugely deep bench when you, when it comes down to it.
Or at least I certainly didn't find it to be a hugely deep bench. It's a little bit of a kind of like we're getting later in the generation. And yeah, it's no key things, key things definitely happened this year.
But I think it is defined by that handful of huge games, as opposed to it being wall to wall amazing games on all formats, if that makes sense.
It's also a year where a lot of the really big games aren't ones that I necessarily played at the time. And like when I did come back to them, they couldn't possibly have the same impact on me because things had moved on or they'd gone on to inspire a different generation of games which I had then played. So yeah, there's a chance my top 10 may sound contrarian in places, but it's hopefully an accurate reflection of just how I interacted with 2004.
Yeah, same. So I decided to stick to personal picks above objective picks basically. So my top five might sound a bit weird, I think, actually.
But I've definitely got some of the big hitters in there to discuss those because I like those two. But I agree, it's a slightly strange year for me. I do think that 010, 0203 were slightly more interesting years to pick from.
But there's not loads in it. It's just that, yeah, this is not a year I was mega engaged with games. So that's definitely part of it.
Some key things do happen this year, though, Matthew, in games more generally. So there's the release of the PS2 Slim this year. At the same time, the PS2 has a price cut to $149 in the US, which is so cheap.
Can you imagine how many PS5s they'd sell now if they dropped it anywhere near that price instead of it being 400 quid or whatever it is? That would have been obviously huge. But yeah, this was like year five of the PS2, I think, basically at this point.
So it was getting on a bit. It just happened to be that it still had a long runway to go until it ran out of great exclusive games. They keep coming to 07, arguably 08 really.
So obviously the gulf between the PS2 and other formats was enormous. That's a key part of it. But the PS2 Slim definitely sort of refined that console down.
Dinky console, the PS2 Slim. But much easier to store in a living room than the regular PS2 was. The other key things that happened this year, Matthew, PSP launches in Japan in December.
DS launches in the US in November. I think it then launches in Japan a tiny bit later in December. So massively important to the handheld, two of the best handhelds ever.
DS just hugely important, obviously, to this podcast. Driver 3 is this year. I wonder if we should talk about that a little bit.
Quite a lot of sort of print media scandal around Driver 3. And I know little bits and pieces of the truth, but I see it as not really my story to tell. But it's a little bit of that kind of like pre-internet, sort of like a borderline corruption is how it's kind of largely passed.
I mean, I won't really comment on it either way, but that's certainly when you read about the scandal at the time. What did you make of all that? And did you play this game at the time?
Yeah, we bought Driver 3 on launch day because I think we were desperate for the next GTA. We were hungry for something like that. And this game got a 90 in a PlayStation magazine we read.
I want to say PSM 2. I think it was. That game was no 90 dog.
That was hard work. That's probably the most I've hated a game that we've bought from a position of moderate excitement. I've bought equally bad games, but wasn't expecting anything too much for them.
This one, I think visually, in screenshots and whatnot, it looked absolutely amazing.
Yeah.
And the pitch of it was cool and the tone of it. And I remember when we had Jeremy on the GTA GameCourt episode.
That's a fun episode.
And yeah, it was a good episode. And he made a nice case for, like, Driver, you know, he has some affection for it, but we just, we just found it to be this sort of uncontrollable, janky nightmare. And yeah, when I joined Future, I definitely heard Driver 3 discussed by certain people who'd been involved in that whole saga, but I never really got the full picture.
I think everyone just kind of moves on from it a bit. Let's just off-break that one.
Yeah, I had a friend who had it, and I remember playing the... I think there's a mode in it where you could basically free roam, and it just started you in the same place in the same vehicle with a few guns each time. It was a very unhappy game.
It was not anywhere near up to scratch, and it had been obviously long anticipated and mega-hyped. And yeah, it's just from that era of just slightly stinky GTA alikes when GTA is a clear market leader, hence why we did that episode with Jeremy. Definitely recommend hearing Jeremy's take on it.
I think he maybe compared it to like a Michael Mann film or something like that. It was a fun Jeremy episode for sure.
Michael Mann gets it horribly wrong occasionally, so that might be that.
Yeah, about a third of the time, really.
This year, one of the weird things that I remembered looking over various games lists, it was the year of the remarkably similar Second Sight and Psy Ops. That was a strange little thing that happened. These two games, which were both about third person action where you mixed shooting with throwing objects around with telekinesis, both original IP, came out within like a month of each other.
It felt like a riff on, you had it in film where you had Bugs, Life and Ants and Deep Impact and Armageddon.
Yeah, Volcano and Dante's Peak.
I just remember that being a little thing and lots of people having a stance on whether you were for Second Sight or Psyops. Neither of them really amounted to anything. I don't think either of them are held with much fondness these days.
But that was a thing that happened.
Yeah, so was Psyops the Midway one?
Yeah, which I think was actually slightly better. Psyops the Mind Gate Conspiracy. Second Sight was exciting because it was pretty radical.
People were still hoping they were going to become something massive. The X-Goldeneye team. People liked time splitters, but to see them branch out into something slightly different had a strange flashback structure where half of the campaign was quite a straightforward action game and then half of it was once you had these mental powers given to you and so it kind of cut between them.
But I think Psyops was maybe the simpler, cleaner offering.
Yeah, you're right. It was quite well reviewed. I think at the time I definitely always saw Midway as a kind of like stay the fuck away from this game sort of warning on a box, which is maybe a bit unfair, but I don't necessarily think in the course of history that I was incorrect about that.
Yeah, I mean, I sort of remember that. I mean, I always read over Eurogamer's Game of the Year features before we do these ones just to see what people were writing at the time. And it was quite interesting to see the Psyops entry, you know, have a sort of disclaimer with it of like, listen, we know this is by Midway, so it shouldn't really be in a game in the year.
Man, people were really, really hostile towards them. Like, you know, Mortal Kombat was still kind of okay, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was. And I think there is one this year. Is it Armageddon or something?
But yes, it was like, there was just something about them that was like, they were just one of those publishers where they spent, they spent more on the launch party than the game, it felt like, you know what I mean? Or just sort of thinking about how front-loaded Stranglehold is with like the first level being like amazing and the rest of the levels being a bit naff. Midway were just a bit, I mean, I made that joke before, a bit mid.
They were just sort of, that was their sort of whole thing. They were just a very awesome publisher, but it's really funny to hear that even at the time, they had that perception, which I would later have towards THQ, to be honest as well. You know what I mean, though?
Yeah, I know what you mean. They occasionally have something really good, which would make you sort of question it.
Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, that's funny. I did forget that this happened.
I never played either of those games. They didn't appeal to me whatsoever.
I played Second Sight. I was so trying to make Free Radical happen for myself, even though I just wasn't into TimeSplitters before it. And I just never saw eye to eye with that particular studio.
I never saw the... They never got close to the GoldenEye quality for me.
Yeah, that's fair, I think. Well, PsyOps is not on GOG, so I won't be playing on there, Matthew. Maybe I'll get it going on the old Steam Deck wall.
I'll give that some thought.
Mind gate conspiracy.
So, the E3 from this year, we always talk about what was going on with E3. Obviously, it was in Los Angeles at this time. Obviously, all three console manufacturers were there.
This is long before there was any drama around that. It was still a huge event. There was still the weird middle ground between, we've got to show some bar graphs to investors and stuff, and also, it's got to be entertainment for people who like video games.
So it was a really multipurpose weird thing, and it feels like this is just not really what happens anymore. They would never have a state of play where they're like, okay, but before we carry on with, I don't know, fucking Death Stranding 2, here's how PS5 sales are doing in North America. They never do it now.
That's exactly what this was like at the time. So I will say, having studied all of these different conferences, these are the most boring ones by far. The Nintendo one, actually, I think was the most interesting.
I don't think it necessarily had the best games, but it was the most interesting for a specific reason, which we will get to, and we have talked about a little bit before. So the Sony one was definitely the most boring. There's definitely that feeling of they are way out in front.
They don't need to try as hard as the other manufacturers. So there's Kaz Hirai just waffling on about sales and how to prolong sales. He talks about the idea of a 10-year life cycle for consoles being like a responsible way to sort of develop games and also sell games to people.
And yes, there was at this point at this conference, they revealed that 71.3 million PS2s had been sold versus about 13 to 14 a piece for the GameCube and the Xbox. So PS2 just, I mean, miles and miles in front. The PS2 drops in price, like I say, to $149.
And there's a montage of games, not very interesting montage. You see a tiny bit of MGS3 in there, which is not eligible for our list this year because it launches in 05 in the UK. So there's a, then Ted Price comes out, a very young looking Ted Price, and like very sincerely says, ratchet and clank up your arse now on stage, and no one laughs, despite that being the name of the game.
Like that's just, yeah. And then that segment feels like it goes on forever and ever. Then there's more slides from Kaz Hirai.
There's a monetizing online gaming plan. There's a harbinger, a bit of like a warning for the future from the past of like, we can do this, we can sell. Basically, they talk about how like piracy almost destroyed music.
And they're like, but not with gaming because we control the platform and blah, blah, blah. And you're like, oh God, I know where this leads. I'm living it right now.
I've been living it for like 10 years, 10 years plus basically. Then there's like the PSP reveal, this happens. This is probably the most notable part of it.
They had already announced they were making a handheld the year before. They talked about the UMD, I think. And then here they properly reveal the PSP.
The lights come up and I think Kaz Hirai maybe takes one out of his pocket or something like that. It's then shown on stage and looks nice. They talk about how they want to, how they're going to make the PSP a success and how handhelds are more important in this age of people taking devices with them, et cetera, et cetera.
Most of this I covered in the PSP drafts. I don't need to go over it again. If you want to go listen to that episode.
Then comes Don Matric on stage. Oh God, and a load of EA games for the system. Weirdly, FF7 Advent Children gets a trailer on stage.
I guess that's because anything FF7 shaped was going to be a huge deal when they wanted to associate the PSP with that. Because that's coming to UMD, they showed that. Then finally, the most boring segment I think I've ever seen in one of these videos.
The chief technology officer, a gentleman called Masa Chaitani, comes on stage to explain the development of the cell processor, which obviously we know is the very complicated to develop for CPU in the PS3. They will basically do it versus the much more simple to develop for 360. I was jumping through it, but I don't think it ever says the words PS3 to make it exciting.
He just talks about workstations and the intersection between broadband and entertainment in your home and it's so boring, man. And you're like, this is like the first signs of trouble for Sony. Do you know what I mean?
They're eye off the ball. There's no Kojima on stage going, hey, motherfuckers, here's my MGS3 trailer. None of that business, which is what E3 should be about.
And you can just see them going down this really tedious, going to cost $600 kind of like path for Sony. You kind of want to scream out through history and go, no, don't do it. This is really boring.
And there's an actual quote from this guy from Massachitani. Users will jack in to the cyber world using the entertainment system in the home. It's a real quote, jack in to the cyber world.
He was saying this like it was a real thing.
I can't wait to jack in to ratchet and crank up your arsenal.
Xbox is a weird one as well. This is a little bit of an in-between time. There's a couple of things that are of note here.
So there's a weird montage of trailers to start. It goes Unreal Championship 2, Shrek 2, which is just a really weird one to have in there, Full Spectrum Warrior, Mech Assault, Conker Live and Reloaded, Fable, which is obviously a hugely important Xbox game from this time, and Star Wars Republic Commando, which is a game I very much enjoy. Their big reveal was that they were adding friend requests and voice messages.
It was all very of its time, early internet online stuff with multiplayer. But the most interesting thing, I mean, actually the most cursing they have, is that Jenny McCarthy leaves a message for Jay Allard during the presentation, where she talks about spanking him in, the illusion is in multiplayer, but it's just a bit horny and weird kind of noughties content. It is what it is.
But then more interestingly, they reveal XBLA, which this leads to the modern digital storefronts of now. It was a huge deal. They pitched it so well, they're like, this is where retro games and simpler games can live.
And we got all these people making original games for it. I think everyone agrees that XBLA was one of the best things about the Xbox 360, and it all kind of starts here. So that was kind of interesting.
Then Peter Moore comes on stage. He has a tattoo for the Halo 2 release date. He obviously did this for a while, you might remember.
Quite enjoyed Peter Moore's showmanship, even if it's slightly preposterous. They show off some Halo 2 multiplayer. That was significant because Halo 2 had online multiplayer, where Halo 1 did not, unless you had it on PC.
They showed off Dead or Alive Ultimate, Doom 3, Jade Empire, which I always forget that Jade Empire was one of the Bioware games of this era, right? But it feels like the one that no one ever talks about. Do you ever play Jade Empire, Matthew?
Tried playing it many times. I get about an hour and a half into it and like nope out of it.
Yeah, which is, I've never played it, but definitely feels like the forgotten Bioware game of this era for whatever reason. Maybe it's because it's so late on in the Xbox's lifespan that was on PC as well, I believe. Then yeah, they announced the first ever Forza.
I think this is very much their taking on Gran Turismo move at the time, but obviously hugely important Xbox series eventually. Then there's some EA Sports nonsense and Don Mattrick comes on stage again. I mean, I'm a man, so boring, but the whole thing with this was apparently Microsoft had pissed off EA at the start of this generation by making their own sports games, but this year they were like, yeah, EA games are all on our system.
These conferences, they're very up and down. The Nintendo one, Matthew, I have written some notes here, but I feel like you are probably the most tuned in to what this was because we talked about it a bit before. Do you want to recount what the E3 was from this year?
I suppose the key thing is that this is the introduction of Reggie on stage.
Yeah, this is Reggie with his famous song All About Kicking Ass, Taking Names and Nintendo are all about making games. Everyone loved him. Americans certainly loved him.
I think over the years he was revealed to be quite a savvy marketing guy rather than anyone who touched any of the games creatively. Actually, did you ever see him do any of the interviews for his book a couple of years ago when he did after he left Nintendo? He put out his sort of autobiography.
Yeah.
And he was quite overly defensive about his role in it. Like if anyone was ever like, yeah, but Nintendo of Japan did it all. And he'd always be like, well, we chose to put Wii Sports in with the Wii as a packing game.
And that's his go-to. And I'm sure he did impact the development of certain games and certainly how they packaged them up for the West and which ones they chose to bring over. But he isn't at the creative heart of Nintendo as far as I'm concerned.
No, but he is. He is what they needed at the time, though, I think.
They have quite a traditional, polite Japanese company. I mean, I think Iwata gets much better at presenting games and talking about games himself. And Miyamoto leans into being a bit of a showman.
And definitely having Reggie there like helps with that. Of these three conferences, this one feels like it has a little bit more buzz just because it's got a couple of interesting characters in it.
Yeah, so I think that Reggie was kind of important. I agree that there was a little bit of myth making going on with that autobiography tour. Side note though, I do quite enjoy this kind of spate of former executives who go around on podcasts talking about the cool secret stuff they did, basically doing The Back Page, but for their own careers.
And just like the Shuhei Yoshida, that's been some good stuff to come out of that one. I can't remember who it was. Was it Shuhei Yoshida who talked about the trying Star Fox on Wii U and it being like not very good?
I actually can't remember.
And him pretending to like it.
Yeah, that was it.
So he didn't upset me and Moato's feelings.
Yeah, that was funny. But also just this past week we've seen Ted Price talking about his Resistance 4 pitch that got shot down. And I do very much enjoy this.
You get insights you wouldn't get anywhere else. So I do enjoy that even though the Reggie stuff is a little bit on the kind of like myth-making side for my liking. But yeah, this conference is all right.
I mean, you can see the GameCube lineup is thinning out a bit. We have Metroid Prime 2 Echoes as their sort of like big first game. Then we go to Star Fox Assault, which they probably thought was going to be good at the time.
Do you ever play Star Fox Assault, Matthew?
You know, again, one of those, you start an NGamer and then you got the curiosity and want to fill in some gaps. You'll try anything for the length of a lunchtime, you know?
Yeah, it is a little bit of a kind of attempt to do an open world-ish Star Fox experience. We could sort of get in and out of vehicles. And I think that was kind of the pitch of it, right?
And I don't know, I know it's made by Namco. I don't know much else about it, but it's a painless third-person camera. Yeah, it's the Arwen combat and it looks pretty good.
Like it does, like it is in most Star Fox games. They get that bit right. But the on foot and like ground vehicle combat look fucking terrible.
Absolutely dreadful 3D camera in the footage they show here. So would have made me sick playing this, I think. But that happens.
Then obviously Rezzy 4 is almost is coming along. So they have a trailer for that with some new metal style music in the background. But obviously looks really good.
That gets a big cheer from the audience. There's a quite a sort of like big Reggie quote that sort of jumped out to me here that I thought was like a rare little bit of there's a tiny bit this last the previous year to but a bit of sort of taking shots at other sides from Reggie. So he said, We know that this is your third stop on the press tour of the past 24 hours.
We know what you've seen and heard, so let me draw a comparison. One of our competitors is a manufacturer in Japan who wants to capture every one of your entertainment dollars, transporting all your content between all your electronic devices on their memory sticks. We're not that company.
And there's another company out there that doesn't care what you do, as long as you do it on their operating system. We're not that company. Their whole thing was like, we're all about the game.
But I found all of this a little bit rich, considering how fucking rigid the Nintendo eShop has been over the years, or their inability to keep with the times on so many different things or needing this specific Nintendo thing in order for things to function.
Yeah, but I guess he's looking at what they actually do have, which is just games, and going, well, how can we spin this into a positive message when everyone else is pushing out in all these other directions? Yeah.
And the truth is, they did have the most interesting conference, because this is where they reveal the Nintendo DS. Reggie just pulls out of his pocket. I mean, I will say, first of all, they always wheel out George Harrison, who's a slightly boring business numbers man, to talk about stuff here.
And here he got the short straw, because he had to talk about how Game Boy Advance videos were going to be a thing. How you get multiple episodes of Spongebob and Pokemon and a GBA cart, just like really cursed naughty shit really. But then, yeah, Reggie pulls out the DS and obviously it stands for dual screen, but then he says it has a much larger and relevant meaning, a developer system.
It's interesting, I forgot the extent to which they used the DS Matthew to re-court third party developers, because you get Ubisoft, Square Enix, loads of different companies in like talking heads, talking about the DS as a genuinely innovative bit of software. And you can say that they did successfully get third parties on board with the DS, right? And it's so, in a way, they simply did not with the GBA, or hadn't done really since the SNES, so it had been a while.
Yeah, and then they show off Mario 64 and the DS, Metroid Prime Hunters. It's, they get an audible sort of like gasp from the audience where they show how if you tap the screen where you want to fire with Metroid Prime, it works. And that's just quite cool, quite cool to see that sort of like first interaction with the software, the hardware just seem magical to people, you know?
Yeah, and then there's even a little bit of a water at the end. They talk about how the system will create a gaming revolution. He's talking about the Wii.
So this is where the revolution is unveiled. Basically, the very first steps towards the Wii's reveal start here. He does talk about how the era of gaming defined by graphical horsepower is over, which is interesting.
Obviously, that too is a little bit of spin and not even remotely true. But for the Wii, it wouldn't matter. And then the end with Twilight Princess, Matthew.
Does any of this twig a memory for you?
Is this the Twilight Princess trailer where everyone goes mental?
Yeah, that's right. And then I think there's a Miyamoto with a shield and a sword as well.
And everyone's like, yeah, yes, because it was famously the Zelda trailer, which looked a bit like the 3D Zelda they'd shown off many years before Wind Waker even, which people felt like they'd been robbed of when they got Wind Waker instead. Well, those Philistines. I've seen all the YouTube clips of the room losing their mind.
Did they give out a trailer on a DS cart? Was that the year after that? I guess it wouldn't make sense for it to be this year because people didn't have DSs until December to play on.
Maybe they had the trailers running on DSs. I remember there being a canny effort to use the DS to promote all of their conference games throughout the show.
I looked it up for you in the background, Matthew. It's E3 2005, they show this, but it does exist and someone is selling on eBay right now for $12,500 in its box. I mean, where's that guy who bought those DSs for Gamescore?
He should be on there buying that.
He should buy it and then give it to us as a gift. We'll watch it and then we'll send it back to him. I don't know what Twilight Princess looks like, but I'd love to see it at an incredibly low resolution on a DS, for sure.
Yeah, I mean, when you say all that, you know, DS, the first hint of the Wii in Revolution and the unboxing of Reggie, that's all quite exciting.
Yeah, I think there's something to be said for being third place and having to try. You can really see the contrast between Sony and the others here, just very, very lax. That is interesting, but definitely feels like an in-between sort of like E3 in some ways, Matthew.
However, that ends the E3 chat and the sort of like scene setting for 2004 in general, Matthew. Shall we take a quick break and come back with our top 10s?
Let's do it.
That was quite jolly first hour.
Yeah, sorry, I don't have as many good anecdotes for 2004. Absolutely.
I was surprised I had so many.
But the only anecdotes I can remember are incredibly childish and involve like giant shits and things.
But I wouldn't have minded you telling that. I think the listeners would have enjoyed that. Was it just like as in someone left a big poo in the toilet or something?
No, there was an infamous, unshiftable turd in our shared toilet in our dormitory block in college. And someone, I remember someone tried chopping it up with like a load of cutlery stuck together into like a long stick. And it got stuck in the bottom spoon or whatever it was, got stuck in it and it never dislodged it.
And then I just remember like two days later, we got sent a very snotty email from the college accommodation people saying, you must try and keep toilets clean or don't block up toilets. And start flushing cutlery down the toilet, which made me laugh.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, two top 10 lists of The Best Games of 2004. Inevitably, we'll have a bit of crossover, Matthew, but let's see, I imagine only two to three games of crossover will be in there, given our different backgrounds, but...
Maybe. Yeah, so how this works then, we count down from 10 to one. Whoever's got a game higher in their list will talk about it when we get to their placement in the list.
I always explain that badly, but you know by now what I'm talking about.
I listen to this ridiculously long Game of the Year podcast. It was like seven hours long.
Oh right, yeah.
I chipped away at it because I think one of the listeners suggested it to us. These guys do this really long podcast called Into the Ether, I think it's called. Yep.
And so I listened to that game of the year because I just wanted to see what a seven hour podcast sounded like and how they did it. One of the ways that they, not saying they pad it out, but one of the ways they pad it out is by talking about things when they first come up and then they'll talk about them again and then maybe again because there's three people.
Oh, that sounds terrible. I mean, I'm sure the podcast is great, but that sounds savage.
I mean, once it was, and it had some great points, but it did make me laugh. I was like, oh, right, that's the highest metaphor is. And it's like, oh no, you've got another dose of metaphor coming like two hours later.
I'm not knocking it because when I heard these guys and their dedication to going doing, they do like big deep dives into platforms. I was like, if we're ever going to do an international draft with two people who've played like loads of DS games, say they'd be good candidates for it.
Oh, interesting. Well, I might have to listen to their podcast. I'm just a nine hour deep dive into the PSVs or whatever.
Okay, interesting. Well, that's one of the innovations that the Chet and John's Reassuringly Finite Gaming Playlist brought to the game, right? It was when you get to the...
If you've both got it on the list, only talk about it once. It's great podcasting technique, really. But yes.
Okay. All right. Well, then let's start with your number 10, Matthew.
My number 10 is specifically the first half of Far Cry 1.
Not on my list. Go on.
I'm assuming Far Cry 1 in its entirety isn't on there either.
No, I just admit I didn't have a PC at the time, and I don't think they ever brought the full fat one to Xbox or PS2. I don't think that happened.
This was the last time for maybe 10, 12 years where we had quite a cutting edge PC at home. My dad had a very good PC, and I remember playing this in maybe the summer holidays, the late summer holidays. Most of my year was holidays because Oxford only does 24 weeks a year.
It's like mad how little time you spend there, so you spend more time at home.
That sounds amazing. I want that to be my fucking life. That sounds great.
Yeah, tell me about it. Perhaps it's so sweet. It does not set you up for the grim reality of working life, unfortunately.
Going from that lifestyle to magazines, which is like, oh, by the way, every day of the year is fucked now. And you're like, oh, cool. Anyway, yeah, Far Cry had a PC that could play it.
This obviously looked astonishing. Even though we'd had open world sandbox games on consoles, on PlayStation 2 and whatnot, the idea of an openish world with this level of fidelity in first person, just it seemed very, very exciting to me, very attractive to me. Like going back to it now, it's kind of like a nothing of a game.
Like narratively, the lead guy, I think he's called Jack Carver, is like just one of the great gaming nobodies. I think this is a bit of a problem with Crytek in general. It's like amazing tech, but like fucking soulless, you know, through and through as as like narrative worlds.
So Far Cry's got like nothing going for it, you know, on the story side and the character side. But if you wanted to drive sailboats, paraglide around huge open environments, that you've just never seen the likes of before, like this absolutely had that. And, you know, that seemed like the most exciting shit in the world to me.
Like the idea that levels were big enough that you could get in a car and then it would become a driving around in a car game from this first person perspective. Of course, I have said only the first half because about halfway through it introduces these mutants called Trigens and the game just completely like goes to shit. You're suddenly fighting in lots of interiors against these horrible, almost like one hit kill monsters.
I just remember it being like a real slog where, you know, I fought for the tiniest amount of progress every time I played it. I don't think I ever finished this game, but there was a window of time where I was swimming around, you know, a lush, tropical paradise, hopping out, sniping a guy on the other side of a valley, sneaking through some grass and thinking like, well, this is PC gaming. This is what you don't get anywhere else.
But, which is interesting because, you know, I'm not like Mr. Crisis at all, but I think Crisis has a similar problem, right, with that like aliens turn up and then the game's a bit less interesting from that point on.
Yeah, I really want to play original Crisis, actually. I think that might be a, I've sort of got this like very slow ongoing project of trying to play big PC FPS games and fill in some knowledge gaps. And Andy Kelly every three to four years will reinstall Crisis and do a bunch of nice screenshots from it.
And it just takes me each time to dive in and give it a go. But I did play Crisis 2 and it was definitely Solar. So I did play a bit of Crisis 3 and yeah, there's just a little bit of character just lacking from those games, but they are.
But it is enough to be as good looking as they are. You know what I mean? That is enough.
That is the thing. You know, we hadn't played many sandboxy first person shooters at this point. So the fact that it was quite kind of rudimentary and wasn't doing many interesting things, you know, it could get away with that.
Far Cry, I think, mechanically became a way more interesting set of games once Ubisoft kind of started making them. This first one is, you know, it's very, very basic. But there is simple magic in a car or a boat that has the space to actually be useful and lets you approach these clusters of buildings from different angles of attack and whatnot.
But this is probably the most I've ever liked a Crytek game. But I still don't like it that much. And only half of it I'm putting in my list.
I do like the idea of only having half a game in the top ten. That's the first time we've ever done that, I think. But, yeah.
I tried playing some of their other ones. Was it? I think I got Crysis 2 or 3, whichever one was on 360.
Crysis 2 was the one that was in New York. So it was kind of notable.
Yeah, I got that. And again, it was just just I hated the concept of it. I hated the characters, hated the mechanics.
Like it just looks pretty impressive. But it's only ever been like a kind of graphics lovers game. Does anyone truly love a Crytek game on a mechanical level?
Yeah, I mean, I know a lot of people love Hunt Showdown, but that doesn't really count, right?
Oh, yes. Yeah, that's that's slightly different.
But that's like a different, I mean, I know the area you're talking about. They were like chilly graphics showcases basically. And that was kind of it.
And then with some alien nonsense in it, you wouldn't really be invested in either way. I do agree. What I played with 3 and I did finish 2, just I didn't really even remotely love those games.
They were just nice to look at. So yeah, interesting choice, Matthew. Okay, my number 10 from this year is Mashed on PS2.
Do you know this game, Matthew?
I'm aware of it. I've not played it, so it's not on my list. Either half of it is not on my list.
I should have put in Halo 1 minus the library in my list. That would have been good. I'd start deducting bits from games that we don't like.
So I picked this because this is the most significant, memorable multiplayer experience I had this year. In fact, you know what? I should only really be putting in the demo for Mashed because what I did later in the game and on PC, I've never been able to play it past the, well, no, in multiplayer as you're supposed to.
And at the time, there was my little mates, Andrew and Graham. I think Graham had bought OXM that month. And I remember it had, I actually want to see what the game on the cover was because it's definitely going to come up in this top 10.
But Mashed was one of the demos on there. We gave it a go thinking, oh, okay, we'll give this a try, see what it's like. I think he had multiple controllers.
And it is basically just 3D micro machines, but with a lot more in the way of like explosive vehicular combat. So firing missiles at each other, dropping mines, that kind of stuff. And what's cool about it is that when a player is knocked out, as in when like the player at the very back like disappears off the screen, much like they do in micro machines and then lose a point, they get, I think like they can aim projectiles at the remaining characters that are on there.
Like a cursor comes up and they can start firing at the players who are left until one player remains and they score a point and then the round kind of resets, basically. And we played this. I think it was something like midday to 5pm.
We just played this same demo over and over again. And it was the funniest, most competitive, memorable experience. And there are games from this year where like Metro Zero Mission, I almost put on my list because I've played this.
I've played it since. I've played it for about six or seven hours. I almost finished it.
I know it's a better game than Mashed, but to define my 2004, this was an incredibly memorable afternoon of gaming. So I wanted to shout Mashed out as a really solid little multiplayer game from a time where obviously there were just so many PS2 games and things to check out. But just like there was just lots in the way of like good competitive stuff between players.
And it was just cool, man. Yeah, it was just another version of Micro Machines. But guess what?
That formula has never been bad. It never really dates. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah. Yeah, I love that formula. There's, you know, I can't remember the names of them because they were things that just got played randomly in the PlayStation Access office.
But, you know, the mechanic of the person in first position, pulling the person in last position to their doom, is just a great local multiplayer set up. I think I have played this from your description. I remember this, you know, I remember shooting projectiles of people on the tracks and it having that kind of perspective.
Yeah, like, this was an era where you could still get those life-dominating multiplayer games. And, you know, sometimes the single player wasn't much cop. Maybe you only remember the local multiplayer games, but they are so important, you know, as someone who only played Balloon Battle Mode in Double Dash for an entire year, when I wasn't getting dragged to a nightmare nightclub, of course.
This was... I completely get the psychology of putting in games like this into this list. My next one, in fact, is very much of that kind of ilk.
Oh, take it away.
So, number nine. I'm actually going back to a game which was in my list, either the last list or the year before, I can't remember. I'm picking the Gamecube version of WarioWare Inc.
Mega Party Games, which was just a remake of the Game Boy Advance WarioWare, except with multiplayer modes for four players on Gamecube, which just reframed the same collection of games. So I don't think they added any new mini games, micro games, sorry, to the mix. But the multiplayer dressing was so good and so compelling because anyone can play those games.
They're so, you know, pick up and play because they're their basic inputs and the fact that the game is just picking up on the instruction and figuring out what you're meant to do. So it's a really good game that anyone can play. A lot of the multiplayer modes are pretty basic.
They were like, you know, you keep getting randomly assigned games. You lose a life. If you lose the game, you gain a life.
If you win the game and, you know, eventually you get whittled down to one player. But there was one mode in this called Wobbly Bobbly. That was just the absolute shit where at the start of each round, there's a kind of a simultaneous four player game, which is actually a new game.
They've added in these games, which four people are playing one micro game together to decide which player like wins and controls the round. They then play a micro game and if they win, everyone is standing on a turtle on this screen and the person who wins adds a turtle to everyone else's stack. And then there's like a 10 second bit where everyone has to balance on their stack of turtles.
So the more games you're winning, the higher everyone else's stacks are going up. And so, the greater the risk that they're going to fall off come the balance stage. And this was just so fun, the little four player games that they had that decided who played were great.
There was one where four people were waving feathers at a cat and whichever one annoyed the cat the most, it would like bat with their feather and they'd win. And there was one with these four guys, like pulling themselves across, you know, what looked like sort of gym mats towards a cup in the center. But like their bodies were just like limp being dragged behind them.
It had a very slightly cursed energy of like, what's going on with these guys? I'm like, can't they move their bodies properly? But it was really funny to look at.
And then the turtle balancing was always a snapsuit riot, because even if you lost loads or didn't get to play the games, and you were on a stack of 10 turtles, if you really worked the balance, you could still stay in the game. So you could kind of claw back a victory. But as people lost and they fell off their stack, they then become a turtle on the bottom of the screen who could walk around and like fuck with other people's stacks when they were trying to balance them, which is very much like the mashed shooting the players once you're out.
And just the perfect level of like pick up and play, really simple but you can play it for like 10 hours straight, and there's a little bit of room for maliciousness and revenge. Like that's just a perfect cocktail for local multiplayer. And like for that mode alone, wobbly bobbly I think is like properly legit.
And so yeah, mega party games gets included. I made a session of this when we were living in our student house in second year at uni, where there were loads of random people. Like one of the girls I lived with was in like a choir, I think, and some of their choir friends came back.
So we ended up playing this game from like nine in the evening to like three in the morning. And it was just rad to play a video game with like random women you've never met. So that was exciting.
Because you were like, wow, this is really cool. They're super interested in like me and my hobby. Like I'm cool because WarioWare is cool.
By extension.
That's good.
I was not.
I'm sorry this passed me by there, Nick. It's cool that they gave this like another spin. I mean, this was my number one GBA game from 2003.
So that's, I mean, I love WarioWare. And it's still this first form of it is perfect, isn't it? So yeah.
Okay. Good pick, Matthew. Interesting suggestion.
What's your number nine?
It's Onimusha 3 Demon Siege, aka the Jean-Renaud one. Quite low down for me in a placement for the Onimusha games. But that's because it is my least favorite, aside from Dawn of Dreams, which is the 06, 07 era one.
Somehow just loses its grip a little bit. I think I was, Onimusha 1 was very much a kind of like, ah, this is a pretty good spin on Resident Evil in a cool sort of like period Japanese setting. Second one is, oh, they actually have a proper grip on this formula now.
They've laid all these different characters on top of it. It's way more fighting styles. It looks much nicer.
Very good. The voice acting slightly better. Third one is basically like this game is selling really well in Japan, but it's not selling well enough in the West.
What can we do? Let's put Jean Reno in there and have a bit of time travel in it. So you get these weird sections where Salmanovsky, who is the returning main character of the first game, gets sent forward in time to France, where all these monsters are attacking in the future, and then Jean Reno gets sent back in the past to Japan hundreds of years earlier.
It's a really strange premise and I don't think of mega successful game. I think the main problem with this for me though is that the first game where they tried to do a proper 3D camera, previously it was an old Resi fixed perspective thing, and you could control your characters with the analog sticks rather than just a D-pad, which was a weird restriction of Onimusha 1 and 2 on PS2. But there's just something about it that just diminished the formula by taking it out of that setting, because that setting was the most interesting thing about it, and you would think the Jean Reno thing would add a less layer of novelty, but it wears off very quickly because it looks like him, but he only voices himself in French in very brief sections, and then it's just some American bloke pretending to be Jean Reno, and so it doesn't really amount to much other than it's just the face of your generic white guy protagonist, and then I didn't think the present day stuff worked particularly well either, but the main problem was, this is my mistake, I played it after Resident Evil 4 came out, and at that point, my expectations for Capcom games and third person games just fucking exploded and could never be undone.
Do you know what I mean? It's that thing of like, oh I've seen like, I saw like the meteor hit the earth and I was a T-Rex, you know what I mean? That's what the experience of Resident Evil 4 was like, so I played it the wrong way round, I played Resident Evil 4 and then played Onimusha 3, and it just simply couldn't compete, Matthew.
So it was not...
There was an extinction event and then the first life form that raced after that was digital genre.
No. Okay, the analogy doesn't quite work, but Onimusha was a key PlayStation series for me, but I did want to note that this was a game I played from this year and it was significant, but it was, yeah, it was, if they do try and re-master more of these games after 2, you're not missing out on much really. I just don't, I don't think this quite had the stuff compared to the second one.
So on Emissary 3, Matthew, any thoughts on that?
Only that the genre of it is very strange because his star profile at this time, you know, even at its peak, I wouldn't say, you know, unless he was massive in Japan, to the rest of the world, I think he was, you know, the guy in the helicopter in Mission Impossible. Or if you had slightly more sophisticated tastes, you'd probably seen Leon. Or Ronan.
Yeah, Ronan perhaps. But he wasn't, you know, he wasn't like a leading ma- like I think he was already kind of not on his way out, but...
Yeah, not a star, really.
That's so weird, it's so strange. Though, like I said, I remember seeing adverts for this in games mags. Then there was quite a cool double spread advert with him standing next to a police car or something, thinking, oh, that looks cool, John Renau's in a game, that's quite badass.
But then, I was, as established, the film guy. I knew how the films were, as Nigel used to ask. So basing your developing decisions on me would be unwise.
Yeah. The other weird thing about it is it's so obviously leaning on the Leon thing, to the point where you've got a little fairy companion in it who has the Natalie Portman haircut from Leon.
Oh, no.
It's just a bit strange. It's a kind of like, you just, maybe it's that thing of like, maybe Leon was particularly huge in Japan or something. Like, maybe that's kind of part of why they made that choice.
But it's just quite odd, you know.
I know, like, Paris and France, you know, is a big tourist destination for Japan. And like, it's like an, you know, not an obsession as such, but it's like quite a key part of the sort of pop culture, sort of psychology of a country is they love Paris. Maybe Jean Reno just really hits hard.
That's tough.
Here's a thought experiment for you. If you had to cast this now with like, who's the Jean Reno in 2004 equivalent who you would stick in like the, let's say like the new Onimusha has to have one like Western actor, like who is it? You know, it's not...
It's that, it's probably that like Matthias Schoenertz.
That's a great call. I like that. Or that bloke who is the villain in Quantum of Solace, like he beat Matthew Almaric.
He'd be like, perfect for it.
Imagine an action game where one of the co-leads was Matthew Almaric.
Oh, I love that.
That's probably, yeah, that's probably the right kind of level.
I think there's nothing more to discuss than this one, Matthew. What's your number 8?
My number 8 is Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay.
Higher on my list. So.
Good. Crossover.
Indeed. At last. My number 8 is Warhammer 40,000, Dawn of War.
Don't worry, Matthew, I'll be brief. Because this will probably come up next week when Dave Durek comes on the podcast.
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Two doses of Warhammer.
Yay. RTS game. They finally did an RTS game with Warhammer in it that was good.
Relic Entertainment had a run at basically, not a particularly sort of mold-breaking, genre-defying RTS game, basically like a point capture game where you built Warhammer 40,000 units, but you could customize them. This first run at doing it has a few things that people really latched on to. The opening movie of Dawn of War people really liked because again, it was Warhammer tweeps finally getting to see like a big battle in CG and things they just had, they had dreamed of seeing, but had been denied by so many shite Warhammer games that had come out during the 90s.
So this was a first step in the right direction. But really, I think the reason Dawn of War deserves to be in here, and I think some people would have it higher, is that this is an example of a game that really benefited from them adding tons of expansions later on. They just added so many more factions, so many more campaigns that really only ever gets better after that first base game campaign, where you're adding all of these different Imperial Guard and Necron and Sisters of Battle, whatever factions that you might be interested in.
Most of them get represented in some form, but it's just a really good RTS experience at its core. And yeah, I have a lot of affection for this series, and somehow this first game still manages to linger over all of the other attempts they would make to do different ones. I mean, right down to a present on Reddit, there's a rumour that they're working on a fourth one, and everyone in the comments is going, oh, it better be like the first one.
I mean, even though it's a 21-year-old game, somehow it's still the most definitive run at this. Matthew, I know you don't care about RTS games, but I did want to note this anyway. Were you aware of this happening at the time, that Dawn of War was a thing?
Because I definitely knew some games journalists who were pretty into this.
I'd obviously heard of it. I knew what genre it was, and it's the genre I don't even bother trying now. But already by this point, I decided it wasn't going to be for me.
I remember having some friends at uni who were more into this. We're into like, not this specifically, but we're like into like Total War, and just disappointing them with my complete lack of curiosity. So look forward to that in next week's Warhammer episode.
The thing is, I personally think Total War is quite boring and dadly, but I think Dawn of War is actually pretty exciting as RTS games go.
Oh yeah, no, I'm not comparing the two. I was just, you know, I was going through my sort of Rolodex of stories in my head, going, 2004 RTS-adjacent, Cyrus talked to me about Total War once and I wasn't interested.
Yeah, I mean, the recent Dawn of War, I think works versus the others. The scale, well, the two is pretty good as well. It's a slightly smaller scale, more of a like tactical RTS kind of experience.
I talked about that recently in the What We've Been Playing episode about the Dawn of War 2 mode I've been enjoying recently. This just has a scale right. It's sort of like you have a fair few units on screen, but it's not completely out of control and it's not so small scale.
You don't feel like you're being denied the tabletop sort of experience. The sort of game that you imagine in your head when you're moving all those miniatures around using a tape measure or whatever. So yeah.
Okay, that's that done, Matthew. You're free. What's your number seven?
Red Dead Revolver.
Oh, not on my list. Really intrigued to hear this on here.
Yeah, I was really pumped for this. I remember seeing... So for people who don't know, Red Dead Revolver, obviously the precursor to Red Dead Redemption, made by Rockstar, but started by Capcom and Angel Studio, and Angel Studio became Rockstar San Diego.
And I remember seeing early trailers for this on... It must have been the PSM3 free disc that came with the magazine. And being like, I'm so in...
I fucking loved Westerns. I was super, super into Spaghetti Westerns, you know, from as a teenager. And there was this trailer for, you know, just the thing that was Spaghetti Western as hell.
A sort of figure in a poncho, walking through dusty towns, shooting things. Heaven. But it was in development hell.
It never really went anywhere under Capcom. Rockstar stepped in, bought the studio, released, you know, finished the game. And actually, if you compare that very early trailer, which you can find on YouTube, it's not miles off what's in the final game.
But what I think's interesting about it is that Rockstar kind of got it over the line and it has some of their values in terms of, you know, how it looks and sounds and like the level of homage to the films. But it's like a Rockstar game, which has still got loads of weird Capcom shit in it. So like, there's a level where you fight circus freaks and there's a boss who's like covered in dynamite.
There's some stuff which is just, it's so far from Red Dead Redemption, which is obviously like we're going to do the Western straight and try and simulate it as best we can. You know, it's kind of a Rockstar finishing someone else's work and not being able to raise enough of the very weird origins that, you know, Capcom had made lots of, well, several cowboy arcade games, you know, in the 20 years before. And it kind of taps into a bit of that.
It's very kind of cartoonish. And it's actually the cartoonish element of it. I like, you know, you're playing a young boy whose family's killed at the start and you grow up to go and seek revenge.
But as you go through the game, which is linear level by level, it's not an open world game at all. You play as lots of different characters as well. There's always other sort of eccentrics, which again feels a bit more kind of Capcom-y and arcade-y to me.
There's a sort of English gent who's they've all got a different deadeye mechanic. So the English gent can sort of like pinpoint everyone all at once and shoot them. And there's kind of a lady sort of ranch owner with a big blunderbuss.
I think you play as a Native American with a bow and arrow. So they've all got these different action mechanics. And it's really that kind of like leftover Capcom vision, a bit of like Rockstar taking control, not being able to take it closer to Red Dead Redemption.
You know, it is a level by level third-person action game. But I just think it's a really interesting artifact. I still think it's very stylish.
Like, even though it doesn't simulate a whole open world, it does capture enough of the classic moments. There's a great train heist where you're running along the top of it. There's one where you're chasing a train on a horse, shooting like bits of armour off this like war engine with a gatling gun.
You know, there's always different characters get to take you into different territories. There's a quick draw mechanic where you have to very slowly put one stick down and then raise it and paint targets on the body as the cursor passes over them. They use that for a quick draw contest in the middle of a town, which I think is probably better than any quick draw stuff in Red Dead Redemption 1 or 2.
In terms of capturing the drama of a quick draw, it's a lot more quick in the dead. It's like the most fun bits of Red Dead Redemption crushed into this arcade shooter. I really like it.
I think you can still play it backwards compatible.
Yeah. It's 12 quid on Xbox.
I think it's well worth playing through once. It's a fun game.
That absolutely screams of Game Eye Hoover up when I've had a couple of wines for 7.99 in an Xbox sale. Absolutely. I mean, that's definitely happening.
So yeah, really interesting. I have no knowledge of this game whatsoever, other than remembering at the back of my head, the weird Capcom Rockstar handover element of it, and the Angel Studios are going to be Rockstar San Diego. So yeah, it's super interesting to hear about.
I mean, I'm curious to see some of these more tonally, sort of, Squiffy, off-brand, what would now be considered off-brand Red Dead stuff, because yeah, really interesting that this is where, you know, a game that sold 70 million copies, apparently now, in Red Dead Redemption 2, has its origins in this oddball Xbox PS2 game. So that's a cool pick, Matthew. Yeah, I wasn't even, I thought Westerns was so uncool when I was this age, it would just never have appealed to me.
So I just passed me by completely. But yeah, interesting, interesting artifact. Okay, well, my number seven, Matthew, is Final Fantasy X-2, aka the game I was most disappointed by in 2004, and the only game I paid a full 40 pounds for at the time.
I remember getting my mum to order it on her Amazon account before I had my Visa Electron card. I remember saving my pocket money to afford this. Was it worth the wait?
Absolutely not, in my opinion, at the time. It is an interesting game, though, and I think it did come up in some form on the Final Fantasy episode that we did a couple of years ago when 16 came out. It is a very radical departure from the preceding game, Final Fantasy X, one of my favorite games of all time.
Very sort of like, mostly sincere RPG about bringing down this weird religion and killing this giant space whale thing. It's quite out there as stories go, but takes itself quite seriously. FF X-2 is, you pick up in the same world, but things are very, very different.
Things are a lot more kind of like liberal. There are different factions vying for power in this sort of like vacuum that's emerged after this major religion has been ousted. And it's much sort of cheesecakeier and silly and sort of like anime-ish.
And I definitely bristled with that when I was a teenager. I still don't really love it, but I definitely have known people to enjoy this game a great deal and for it to be a big deal for certain players. I sort of respect that about it and it is also...
You just have to admire how tonally interesting it is versus the other Final Fantasy games. It really is like a one of one. I think people just like the idea of having three main characters, all women, and this dress sphere system, so they all have completely different roles that they change into on the fly mid-battle.
That seemed to really capture people's imaginations. I find it a little bit hard to get my head around the progression of how you level up all of those different dress spheres at the same time, what progression looks like in a game where you've got all these different classes to pursue. I found that a little less elegant to follow than Final Fantasy X's sphere grid progression.
But it is very interesting. The structure of it means that it's got a percentage meter of completion. There are side quests you can completely miss in one chapter, and then when you progress the story, the side quest is gone in the next chapter.
You have to be quite meticulous at how you tick things off. Then I believe there's some stuff you can only do on a second playthrough to get the full 100 percent. It's really different in a bunch of ways.
And for what is basically like a glorified asset flip game, there's a lot of asset reuse from FF10 going on in here, alongside some new characters and new locations and stuff. I can see why it's a special thing to some people. It just wasn't to me at the time, Matthew.
Did you have much knowledge of this one? Have you chatted to Catherine about this one?
No, I don't know if Catherine's played it. I should probably ask her about that. Does it at least have an absolutely amazing soundtrack given the scenario?
Right, because you know the main character is a pop star and stuff. Yeah. It's got some bangers on there.
It's not as good a soundtrack, if you ask me, as Final Fantasy X. The battle themes, the boss themes and stuff are just nowhere near as good. The pop music in it is pretty decent though.
Do you think that would have to really land to sell that element of it?
Yeah, I will tell you, my favourite bit of music in this game is that there's a piano track that plays when you turn the game on.
That piece of music is beautiful. I love that music, but it doesn't have loads else that really sticks in the memory. So yeah, it's a weird old game.
Yeah, not entirely successful, but I mean, at the time, it seemed hugely novel that they even did a direct sequel to it, Final Fantasy X. And there was such a wait for it in the West as well. It came out in 03 in the US and Japan, but we had to wait until 04 in the UK.
So a big old wait, and it was not worth it for me, dog, but...
You must have known what was coming. You must have read about it, and you knew it was substantially different. Yes.
Or it wasn't that it took you by surprise.
No, but that's not why I didn't like it. It wasn't the fact that it was the pop star stuff. I was completely fine with that.
I was not one of these teenagers who was afraid of things that had female characters in them or anything like that. I saw the opening movie for it that was on the PSM DVD. I thought, oh, that's pretty cool.
And I saw some of the cut scenes and thought, oh, wow, they're moving the story on from the last one. It's just when you get to things like the Infamous Massage minigame in it or the bit where Yuna, Pain and Riku are in a hot spring and they're kind of fighting in bikinis. It's a bit like, even though I was 16, I was like, I don't like being pandered to.
I want them to take it seriously.
I wouldn't have to work for my fantasy.
I don't know, it was weird. It was like, oh, I guess this has been done. I assumed as a teenage boy this has been done for my benefits.
I mean, you know, I think women who enjoyed the game would argue that that is not the case with this game. But that's what it felt like to me at the time and I was a bit like, oh, but I don't, I preferred it when they took it kind of seriously what was going on. And I think it was just a little bit too jokey.
There were all these weird sort of like jokes with Yuna's cousin, brother, the character is called brother just to make it less confusing, who fancied her on this airship and he was always horndogging after his cousin. I just hated all of that shit. So it really just got on the wrong...
Why can't this be more sophisticated? He says as he goes back to his alias.
What more needs to be said on that Matthew? That's a great note to always leave on a laugh. What's the next one?
GTA San Andreas.
Is that your number 6?
Yes.
Higher on my list.
Yeah, I've got reasonably slower, but we can get to that following our traditional format rather than me telling you now.
And then we talk about it again in extraneous detail in an hour's time. Okay, I'm sorry you got more of me talking. I feel like I've been talking a lot in a row.
I like hearing about these things I haven't played.
Well, you've probably played this game, a little game called Halo 2, which is my number 6, Matthew.
Yeah, this isn't on my list.
Didn't think it would be. It is my least loved Halo. I think, actually that's not true because there are more recent ones.
This was of the original batch. This was the one I did not like that much. It was a notoriously curtailed campaign, massively hyped.
I think everyone had seen the Halo E3 2003 demo where Master Chief and loads of UNSC soldier lads are fighting aliens in the street. And you get a bit of that in the opening chapters where you're going through the city in this. Those are the best bits of the game.
But the rest of it is very unmemorable, flat-looking, boring Halo missions. It really lacks the replayability of the original Halo. That's what the big disappointment was to me at the time.
However, it definitely is worth acknowledging as a key factor in the history. A key element of the series is that the online multiplayer starts here. And for a lot of people, that comes to define what Halo is from this point onwards.
And I know people who played this multiplayer over and over again. We're just so into it, played it for hundreds of hours. And the fact that they, you know, you got to take all of these mechanics that were so good in co-op and local multiplayer online in this game.
And just as people were plausibly starting to get broadband and to get to use Xbox Live and all this stuff, it feels like these are the stepping stones towards the 360 era, where online play becomes just, you know, it's revolutionized. Everyone's got access to it and it starts here. I mean, but my personal relationship with Halo is a little bit more campaign focused, if I'm being honest, and it's never that fun on a replay.
I will say, though, that I add a... This is probably like a seven out of ten campaign, right? But I will say that the anniversary edition in 2014 adds an extra point on, because I think 343 did such a good job of giving it a facelift, like making very boring levels look incredible and sound incredible.
So, yeah, they did their best to really kind of give it a kick up the arse, but it is a mediocre overhyped Halo campaign in some ways, but still a significant part of my 2004 in-gaming Matthew thoughts.
I'd say I've got a similar relationship with Halo in that I'm more kind of campaign first. Also, the first Halo I played properly is Halo 3, which is kind of tough going back to Halos 1 and 2, I'd say, after 3, just because it's such a sophisticated version of that. I don't really remember a huge amount about Halo 2.
I've only played the campaign once as part of the redo that they did. Driving the tanks through the city, I remember that. Was that good?
That is the best bit of it, I think.
Yeah.
Going over that massive bridge in the tank. That's pretty cool. Shooting down banshees.
I remember there being a bit where you had to slipe loads of guys in the treetops as well.
Yeah, that rings a bell. Is there a bit at the end where you're the massive thing as well? I think that's right near the very end, that sort of like…
Two giant men struggle to remember Halo 2.
I don't remember. But I've played through this campaign like three or four times. But this is, I think, to be honest, this is a completely fair sort of representation of what it's like to remember, try and remember Halo 2.
It's not very memorable apart from that city stuff and a couple of like, maybe a couple of other set pieces. This is also where the alien starts talking in the cutscenes. And that is like, that's the worst part of Halo to me, is when they take the story super super seriously and it feels like story comes before gameplay, which I think is what characterizes the 343 games to a large extent.
It's like, this is Master Chief's story. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is a game where tanks flip over onto my mate because I hit it with a big hammer.
That's Halo to me.
So you get the sense though from interviewing Microsoft people when I was on the official Xbox magazine that everyone who was involved in Xbox at this time, they were all drinking the Halo narrative cool lanes. Because I remember a couple of different executives telling their own version of the story about when Halo came out, every member of Xbox got sent all the novelizations that were happening, and they all read them, and they all loved them. And you're like, you are so all in on Halo.
I understand why it became what it became. And it's this quite confusing kind of mixed media project now, because the people who loved it first, loved it in this very intense way. It's a strange old thing, that side of Halo.
It is. I think it's led to this real dead end as well. Although it did seem like for a moment that Halo Infinite might have the approach, because it was a sandbox game, but it just didn't...
It relied on you a bit too much to make your own fun, as opposed to like... It needs that mix of sandbox gameplay, but also a guided hand in creating the right sort of elements of chaos for things to pop off and sort of overlap. And it just...
The right alchemy basically to make a great Halo set piece. It's somehow lost the time a little bit as a thing in the series. But Halo 2 didn't have that much of it anyway, but Halo 3 had a bit more of it.
So that's why it's a superior game. I remember nothing else more about it, Matthew. But it's certainly a game I played with Jay Bayliss in the Master Chief Collection during the pandemic.
So we move on to your number five.
My number five is Paper Mario, The Thousand Year Door.
Not on my list.
People might assume I don't like this game because I've talked it down a lot over the years on The Back Page, which is actually more... I feel it is a little overrated and people are a little bit kind of blinded by it. They just assume there's nothing to be done better in Paper Mario than this because it's absolutely nailed it.
Well, actually, I think it is a little uneven, but here's what I do like about it. I remember at the time seeing images of this and thinking that looks cool as hell. That art style, they've really like refined it and pushed it further from Paper Mario on the N64.
Nothing else looks like Paper Mario, you know, it's completely itself. And when you see it on the page, you know, it's just got such a clear identity that I really like and respond to. I think it does a lot of what Paper Mario did on the N64, but it kind of improves it, makes it more sophisticated.
You know, stuff that we maybe take a little bit for granted now, because there's been so many of these games. You know, the fact that every chapter is a little miniature story arc that takes you to a new place, introduces new characters, maybe has a new mechanic or two, leading up to some exciting boss fight. You know, they're quite satisfying two to three hour chunks of adventure.
Also lets them do all kinds of different things. You know, one of them is a, you know, a wrestling conspiracy. One of them is a spoof of murderer on the Orient Express.
There's, you know, a thing with a strange ghost. There's the one where you lead all the little critters up the giant tree. You know, it has a sense of what the hell is this game going to do next?
And that's kind of a bit of a staple of Paper Mario. You shouldn't staple Paper Mario either way, he'd hate that. But, yeah, that I really, really respond to.
And like the art of those little arcs. Obviously, like the in-jokes and the fact that it takes these silent elements and gives them the voice. Yes, for the thousandth time, the psychology of a Goomba.
But that, I do respond to that stuff. I do like the idea of these things you've not given a second thought to. What if something, a tiny bit more, was going on with them?
I think that's kind of fun. It rips the piss out of Luigi for being incredibly boring. That's always funny.
The timing-based combat system, while I think it gets a little bit boring as it goes on, because you've kind of understood the brief and mastered it, you know, it doesn't take that long to get your head around. And I don't think it really goes to any interesting places. But, you know, all that aside, the fundamentals do work.
There's a reason they do keep returning to this and making more of these games. That's a series where there's, what, five, six different entries, you know, sometimes a couple on an individual platform. You know, it shows a series in good health and a fan base that clearly is still there for it.
There was a time I loved this a lot more. I feel like I've just called on it slightly. Like, if you'd probably asked me in 2004, this probably would have been in my number one slot.
But having like replayed it last year, been a bit a little cooler on some of the elements. You can go back to our What We've Been Playing episode to hear about that. You know, I don't think it holds up quite as well, but it's still, you know, a pretty special 8 out of 10.
Yeah, it's definitely been an interesting sort of like recurring subject matter on this podcast to hear you sort of talk through your thoughts on it and your thoughts on the people who like it. And yes, here it finally appears in chronological order in the Best of Games Best of the News.
And it has a place. See, if I was a child, I just wouldn't have included it.
Yeah, if I'd have included Mashed, but you hadn't included this, it would have been a bit... I imagine some listeners might have objected. But yes.
It's better than Halo 2 in my books.
Is it better than the second half of Far Cry, Matthew?
Oh, definitely. It's better than the first half too.
That's why it's higher. Oh yeah, that's literally the point of the list, isn't it? Yeah, okay, good.
All right, well, that's... I'm glad to hear that's in the mix, Matthew, but still not that high. So, intrigued to see what your top five is going to...
Well, the rest of your top five is going to look like.
Oh, it's a bit... I'm looking at it now. I'm like, is this right?
Anyway, we'll see.
Oh, no, mine definitely isn't right. Mine is... It's a grand sort of like battle of personal preference versus the objective best of the year.
And the objective best of the year is so obvious what it is, but it's just not... Being true to my 04 self, those were not the games that I love. And that's why my number five is Half-Life 2.
Is this on your list?
It's higher on my list.
Then let's come back to it later on. What's in it before?
Fable.
Ah, not on my list.
A bit of a cheatzy one this, because I know Fable 1 best through Fable Anniversary, but I wanted to talk about it here, and I felt like I could put it in here. Obviously, I've talked about Fable 2 and 3 a lot on here before. I'm obviously really excited for new Fable that Playground are working on.
Fable 1 is definitely the simplest and most stripped back of all these games. I think Fable 2 really steps it up and is an all-time favour of mine. Certainly an all-time reviewing experience I have a lot of fondness for.
But what I love about the Fable series is that it's a much more manageable RPG. It doesn't really follow the rules set by JRPGs or other Western RPGs. It's completely its own thing.
It's doable in maybe like 15 or so hours. Feels like a game designed for you to like return to and play several times. Which would make sense as it has this very malleable, sensual character.
Obviously one of the famous things. How you play. You know, the choices you make kind of defines who you are in this world.
This manifests most in Fable 1 as your physical character, you know. If you fight hand to hand, you get very muscly. If you use ranged combat, you are very tall and thin.
Or is it Agile, Agility, you're very tall and thin. And Magic, it kind of covers you in magical glyphs. If you use those powers, if you level those powers up.
So it has this quite cute sort of Cosmetics equals choices thing going on, which they've all had. But I've, you know, always responded to that. I like the fact that it's quite comic and throwaway in tone.
You know, it has the simplicity of a fairy tale. You know, you go to towns when you pick up quests, they're not hugely complicated thing with loads of backstory. It really cut them down to just a few comic lines, probably a bit of a punchline at the end.
Just never wanted to get bogged down in self-seriousness, which I think a lot of RPGs do and make them quite a bad hang. Crucially, like no other game sounds like Fable. Its soundtrack has a very distinct character.
Obviously the main theme was co-written by Danny Elfman and Russell Shaw. Russell Shaw is the composer for the rest of the game. Has an Elfman-ish sound.
It's very kind of choral, sort of mysterious, sort of sleepy, hollow-ish, Edward Scissorhansy kind of sounding thing. And I've always really loved that music, you know, just playing the game and letting that music wash over you is very satisfying. But that music, plus the din of all the little comic NPC soundbites.
It's a game where people are constantly expressing themselves, you know, their opinion of you, or they're talking to each other, or they're just uttering a sort of inane comment about what they're up to. This was its attempt to simulate life, and it doesn't really simulate life. A lot of what Molyneux promised for this game in terms of its grand systems simply isn't in there.
You know, it is surprisingly sort of basic in lots of ways, but I do love that music, the sound of these sort of caricatured British accents, all triggering these silly little things. Maybe you've just done a sort of fart or some ridiculous heroic pose, and everyone's, you know, there's vocal fallout to that. And I love that mix.
I love those specific moments. No other RPG sort of looks, behaves, or sounds quite like Fable, and I'll always have a fondness for it because of that.
Yeah, I mean, it's, I didn't play this one at the time. I wish I had, actually. I had an Xbox, and it feels like it's something I probably would have quite liked.
But so much of the sort of like din around the game was about Mollinue and the promises that the game would have and things it didn't end up having. And that, because I read so many games mags at the time, that really overpowered what Fable was to me. And that arguably is a problem that the next two games would face too.
But as much as I do enjoy Mollinue talking about games, I really do. However, there's no denying that out of the gates, they came up with something super distinctive and something that people really wanted. And it just hasn't really been imitated by any other games effectively.
And still, it feels like there's a... That's why there's such a gap for it to come back. It's because the way it looks, sounds and feels is not like other RPGs or action games.
It's just its own very specific thing. And, yeah, the way that the different ways that you interact with the characters and stuff. And, yeah, the very specific British tone.
Yeah, I have weighed up playing Fable Anniversary, actually, because it's on Game Pass, obviously. It's not that long. And, yeah, I just know, for the time as well, the amount of player expression you had was still pretty outstanding, you know?
Yeah, yeah. I'd say it's got enough of what you like about Fable 2 and 3 in there that you'll still have good fun with it and has its own charms. The only problem with playing Anniversary now is it's got like a...
like every Xbox 360 feature going was included in it, so it's like smart glass integration and that kind of stuff. And it's constantly referring to like now deceased technologies going, well, you can find special treasure, you know, there are special treasure chests you can unlock if you go to this, you know, online portal and you're like, well, that doesn't exist anymore, so, like, forget it.
Good stuff, Matthew, so I'm glad that Fable is at least represented in one of our lists. It does look like an important thing from this year. Okay, we finally reached my placement of The Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay at number four, the perfect film tie-in game by basically not tying into the film at all, the film being The Chronicles of Riddick, obviously, which Matthew talked about in one of our Patreon episodes, Guilty Pleasure film, one that we did.
Yeah.
A very good chat, hearing Matthew talk about that. They made every correct decision with this. They set the canvas super limited.
It's a game where you are put in prison and you have to escape from a prison. Your failed attempts to escape from the prison puts you further into that prison. But it's still all about the escape.
They, instead of making it a game where you're firing guns all the time, you're instead firing guns quite infrequently, and it's more of a game about first-person, hand-to-hand combat, which I feel like at the time, so few games had as a focus or even did that part of the game properly. It was always like, oh shit, I'm out of weapons option doing melee combat. That's how I remember melee combat being in first-person games, at least those that didn't have swords or lightsabers or whatever.
Wasn't any more sophisticated than a GoldenEye slap.
Yeah, exactly. So the idea of building a whole game around that, but then you're getting into these prison yard duels and stuff, and at the same time you're playing as this Vin Diesel character voiced by Vin Diesel. However you feel about the pitch-black Chronicles of Riddick Universe, it's just an evocative and industrial sci-fi setting, perfectly fine for a prison hangout, and then breakout story that this game is, and it was just a perfect canvas, and they just really made something super distinctive and special with it.
I think it deservedly has a cult reputation after all these years. It's just one of those easy heart picks, I think. It was way better than anyone thought it would be, or even better than it even had to be.
But yeah, there's a reason it had, they remade it a few years later. There's a reason it had this really strong reputation, and even does now. And the DNA of this game is, there's a little bit of it in Indiana Jones, the great circle as well.
So this particular strand of FPS with a melee focus. I just love this stuff, Matthew. What did you think of this at the time?
I didn't play it until much later, until the 360 re-release, but I remember this having zero buzz, and then suddenly getting 90 plus reviews in Gamesbast or whatever, saying like, and you could tell their surprise that had come out of nowhere. And they were like, what the hell is this? You know, no one had any idea this was going to be good.
You know, I remember looking at the screenshots of it and hearing it was a first person game, but being so curious by the number of third person shots in the review. Because it has, like Indiana Jones recently, that mechanic of when you're doing full bodied physical actions, like climbing ladders or hanging from rungs, it does switch to a third person camera so you can see the character model. And I just, I really like that, that perspective switching, you know, both in that and, and Indie.
And I loved it when Deus Ex, Mankind, Divided did it, or Human Revolution, or both of them, you know, the flexibility of like, we'll show you the perspective that is most useful or looks coolest in the moment. And that's, that's a great idea. It's really short to the point, you know, it has the, there's no fat on it.
It's, it's as lean as, as a film in terms of the action and like the journey you take around this place. I love the sort of RPG elements of it. The fact you are just talking to people and, you know, at best having the occasional fist fights, it lets you sort of experience that environment in a, in non combative way for a lot of the game, which is, you know, very few games do.
Yeah, just kind of crazy, but no one has stole more from this really. Like only really like Starbreeze and offshoots of Starbreeze ever really understood this, sort of how to really make a body feel like a body in first person and kind of respect and represent that and a real niche, but very, very cool.
Yeah, like you say, no one else has really ripped it off, but really, really great this and no longer really available in any easy way. I imagine you can probably, cause they had it on GOG for a while, you could probably just grab it off of somewhere. I imagine someone's got it hosted somewhere.
They should really just set it for about 10 quid. I bought it about 10 years ago on GOG, and I'm pleased they have it, but I imagine it's out there somewhere, and it's nice that they did remake it so more people could play it, because it was a bit unusual that it was only on Xbox and PC, but it makes sense because it was quite graphically intensive ahead of its time kind of game for the moment. So, yeah, it was a real...
It is one of those classic sort of Xbox exclusives that really defined that original console. So, yeah, it's great. Okay, what's your number three, Matthew?
Half-Life 2.
Here it is. Do you want to kick us off?
Yeah, I didn't really know where to put Half-Life 2, which is interesting why you put it a bit lower. I was fully expecting you to put this in at number one. It's definitely a game I think I admire more than I love.
I agree. I feel exactly the same way even now.
But even back then when it was at its most impressive, and I was bowled over by the gadgets, the source engine, the physics of it. I remember going around to a friend's house because they had better internet than us in their student house, and watching the trailer for this and being like, oh my God, I've just never seen anything as interactive as that. Seeing Raven's home and throwing paint cans and them splashing on the zombies and picking up buzz saws and chopping them in half.
I was just like, you know, the logic and the cause and effect of this world. It looks so exciting. It looks beyond anything we've ever done.
I just don't know if deep down I'm necessarily like Mr. Valve. I find their world vision a little cold, a little clinical. It's certainly interesting, the visual design of it.
Like the strange structures and the horizon and the design of the combine and all that. It's just not a game I ever completely fell in love with. I was just constantly impressed by it.
There's bits that I really didn't like.
I've always struggled with the water bit near the start. That comes so early on and it goes on forever. It's so long.
You just get like your sort of land legs in that game in a sense of what you're meant to be doing. Then you're suddenly driving this boat around. I've never liked that, but that's a bit of a nitpick.
You don't have to sit out the conversation, but I've read all the best writing on this game and I've heard the best people expanding the virtues of this game and loads of people I respect love this game. It is the core text for them and in an unsatisfying way. I just can't quite put my finger on why it's not, but it's still…
I put it at number 3 because it's still hugely impressive. I love that every level does something different, even if one of them is at a level I don't like. The Gravity Gun is just a brilliant piece of tech and the way they use it in puzzle solving and combat to mix things up is really fun.
I don't know, I feel like you've probably got fresher thoughts in this having played it. You know, this is a game I've played once through on PC, whenever this was, 22 years ago, and 21 years ago, and then I've played like several hours of it, several points and never continued on with it for the, you know, normally I get to the water bit and I'm like eh, I'm keen to hear what it meant for you on this playthrough.
I think I agree with you on everything you said, like literally everything. I think no one wants to hear this right, but I think every single section in this game, you are right, they all have, every chapter has a different idea at its heart, right? And some of those might be like going through a prison and you've got all these like AI companions who can help you clear out this prison basically and there's loads of like turrets around or yeah, like you mentioned, like going through the waterway on a speedboat or Raven home, which is basically like the zombie horror level, right?
It's, there's a high concept that guides each chapter and in terms of setting the agenda for what modern narrative-driven game design would be. Like almost every single set piece you can think of is here. I just constantly was stumbling across moments where I was like, I've seen this in other games.
This has been cribbed by other games. This has been turned into a slightly different, twisted in a slightly different way by other games. Like it's, you know, it really is like the rule book on how to do the kind of like, yeah, like the narrative-driven beat by beat set piece and game pacing and things like that.
But the thing no one wants to hear that I believe about this game, Matthew, is that every single chapter in the game goes on about 10 to 20 minutes longer than it really needs to, or that you really want it to as a player, certainly than I did. I feel like it shows you everything it can do and then just keeps going. And you're like, oh, well, I'm ready to do something else now.
And it keeps going. And I think as well, like some of those ideas do whiff a tiny bit and don't quite work. The water, the going through the waterway on like the little airboat thing is way less successful than the later section where you've got the jeep going around like the coast and across the bridge.
That's like a much better version of the same thing, really. And so I don't think it is a perfect game by any means. It's quite flawed in places.
There's a couple of difficulty spikes that really did my head in. At the same time, there's tons to admire about it. But that is the word, admire.
I think that's the thing about Half-Life. I don't think it wants to be... You know, it does have these...
It does have more in the way of character and for the time. And even now, like the sort of facial animations and the different sort of like narrative encounters you would have seem very meaningful. There aren't that many of them in the game, actually.
You probably think in your memory there probably are more of them than there actually are. There are, you know, it's like a... It'll be a tiny percentage of what you get in a Naughty Dog game or something like that.
It's just there's simply not that much in the way of narrative in there. I mean, Gordon Freeman doesn't speak, you don't have characters nattering in your ear all the time. It's a very lonely and quiet experience, much in the way that the original Half-Life is.
It's just that occasionally you'll interact with Alex or Eli or one of the other characters, and it just feels a little bit more human. And so I think when people remember the game, they remember that part of it. But for the most part, it's still the same slightly chilly Valve experience.
And the other thing is, I think that this is a really interesting litmus test. I think of maybe how much sci-fi you read or what kind of fiction you engage with generally, but it is chilly. And I do think it's quite adult in a way that it challenges you to engage with it and like it.
I've always thought this about Half-Life. There's something about it that resists being, like if I'd have played Half-Life 2 when I was 16 and I didn't, I played it later, I think I would have just bounced off of it because of how sort of like, I don't know, sort of elevated it feels. It's like the writing and the performances and stuff.
It doesn't really talk down to you or go to great lengths to explain what's going on in the world. And most video games do. Something like Halo has got fucking loads of cutscenes to explain what's going on in any of the games.
Valve just don't do that. Valve are so much more minimalist and trusting of the player and adult. And I think that does mean that it creates some barriers for you to sort of like really love it and embrace it as a player.
And that's why I think PC players are a little bit more mechanics minded can love it slightly more than maybe people who come from a console background where maybe you're a little bit more used to the being scripted story in the mix traditionally, you know? Obviously those kind of differences don't exist as much in games now. But do you kind of get what I'm sort of hinting at there?
It's a very like, it just it feels like the whole the whole thing is made by people who like really get tech. Yeah, it's like a very techie person's game, like right down to like the me. I would never listen to the Half Life music.
No, no way.
It's a really bad hang for me, but I don't know if like someone at Valve, they're like, that's fucking cool. You know, that's great music.
Yeah, I think.
And it's that, it's something, I can't say what that music is, but that that sort of sums up how I feel about Half Life and the Valve thing. It's I'm just not on their wavelength. You know, I like Nintendo because, you know, I guess I have a more childish mind, you know, and they speak to me and it tickles that part of my brain.
This is just, yeah, it's kind of hard. And I do need that, you know, as sharp as its ideas or pacing or execution is, I need to have something, it needs to throw me some kind of character bone, an emotional bone that I can hold on to.
Yeah. Yeah.
But that's me. And if you don't need that, then you give it fucking 98% in a review or whatever, and that's fine.
If you look like Gordon Freeman in 2004, and your idea of a great Saturday was going around Curry's PC World looking at beige towers with graphics cards in them, like you are the target audience of this game, and you probably adored this. You probably also played like fucking, I don't know, like Mafia and like Republic on PC and love those games, and Dark Messiah, you know what I mean? Like just sort of all these kinds of games.
I think that, yeah, like this, it just wasn't, it's not, I'm not quite that person. I am somewhat that person, but not quite that person. But I do, I definitely still admire it.
And actually like the sort of dead end, dead ends of it design wise are, is the kind of physics-y stuff or where it trusts you as a player to like, oh, how are you gonna get this door open? And it is how you use the gravity gun in combination with different items and stuff. That trust they give the player, that's a shame that that's lost a little bit, that no one would do anything with that.
That that is something you would, you wish that someone would take and put in another game. Like even someone like Nintendo could do something like that. But I guess like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom probably are as close to that sort of thing as I've seen in other games.
It's solutions to problems that a player generated in that way. Yeah, I don't know. There is something about Half-Life that resists being loved, isn't there?
It's interesting.
Yeah, I just think I like Haribo too much. I truly love Half-Life 2.
Oh, what a great note. I don't think there's anything more we need to say on Half-Life 2 after that. What a great, but I know exactly what you mean.
It's really funny we're on the same wavelength about that. I do like it though. I still kind of want to do, I'm gonna play Alex as well, Matthew.
Will you join me in doing a Half-Life episode in April? Will you do that?
Yeah, oh god, that's a lot of games to replay.
No, don't play them all, just watch some bits on YouTube and I'll do the talking. It'll work. It'll work.
All right. My number three is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. It's highest placement on either of our lists.
So then, GTA. So for me, I don't know what your trajectory was like with this series, Matthew, but I adored GTA 3. My parents wouldn't buy me GTA Vice City.
I bought myself the aforementioned Visa Electron card on Amazon.
God bless that card.
Indeed. It did me some real favors. Hugely anticipated game.
It was mega in scale, a huge step up. It basically said, what if that, the cities that you enjoyed exploring in GTA 3 and Vice City, if that was basically a third of the map, and there were two other cities for you to enjoy, along with loads of countryside in between. It basically went from city scale to state scale.
A true marvel of what the fuck-ness on the PS2. Just a proper, like, how did they do that? Sort of like a magician sort of like trick of just, you just imagine the scale would never get larger than what they already achieved with GTA and Vice City, and somehow San Andreas just pushed it so much further.
So instead of New York in GTA 3, their version of New York, Liberty City, and Vice City's Miami in Vice City, you had basically California, so you had, and a little bit of Nevada as well. So you had Los Angeles to start with, Los Santos, San Fierro, their version of San Francisco, and then finally, fuck, what's the Vegas one called? Las Venturas, of course.
And so really impressive right down to the fact that every one of these settings would have their own individual color palettes as well to represent the skies of the places they were mimicking. Like the very sort of like orange skies of LA were just so sort of felt so authentic and the skyline, even though it's like a very, if you drive around it now and compare it to GTA 5's version of Los Santos, it feels quite tiny. And even like San Fierro, think about the blue skies around there that feel just pure Bay Area, San Francisco, it just captures all those areas so, so well.
But it was the increased scale of the fact that like you would leave the city and then you had all these like, yeah, like stretches of countryside in between where there were stuff out there for you to find, like little locations, train tunnels for you to go through, huge mountain to climb, you know, allegedly Bigfoot, all this stuff. At the same time, they added all these RPG mechanics who went to the game before, eating loads of food and making CJ Fats and getting in shape at the gym. It was just so this overload of like, how do we push this to its very limit?
And then at the core of it is just kind of like, what if we turn boys in the hood into this sort of like, cross state crime odyssey? And like, that's basically the story of the game. It's another game that I admire more than love, Matthew.
I didn't quite adore this in the way that I did with GTA 3. I can't quite, I don't quite know why, what was your relationship with this one?
Incredible excitement. I remember sitting in the IT room of college, you know, the computer room, the student computer room at college and, you know, watching very low res videos of this on fucking Gamespotter IGN, and thinking like, oh my god, it was the countryside. The idea of getting out of like urban road grids and just being able to go anywhere, that felt like next level to me.
You're like, oh that, they've done it. They've simulated the whole world, you know. I don't think, not since reading about open every drawer in Shenmue had like an idea kind of caught my imagination better than, well, now everything is here.
You know, you just keep going and going and going, and you know, you can ride bikes and there are dirt bikes. You can jump off things in forest. Fuck it, I just thought it looked rad as hell.
I really liked the sound of all the RPG-ish elements. To me, this is the first step towards what Rockstar are doing now. It's still the open world with the wanted system and all that, that defines it.
But there's more and more effort to simulate lives and activities around the edges. This had a lot more of that. CJ felt like more of a character, and his story was more engaging, like a much bigger cast of characters.
Everything about it felt a little bit more sophisticated. But I do have the same, the lack of complete head over heels love for this, which I largely blame on. Just, I found it so difficult.
Yeah, it's hard.
And it has so many difficulty spikes and so many fucking rancid missions, which despite having this huge world that you can go to all these places and make your own fun, when it comes down to it, like you actually want to progress through the story and get to the next thing and see, you know, open up the map a bit more. And just every stretch of this game was defined by a couple of levels I never thought I'd be able to do. And I stopped playing the game in rage and that just cannot be a truly great game that makes me feel like that.
And, you know, I stopped playing it for months. I got so cross about a third of the way in, you know, some stupid helicopter, little mini helicopter thing. And this is the one I went back to when they did the re-releases recently on, you know, modern consoles.
San Andreas is the one that I played, like, the first section of. And even in, like, playing it for three or four hours, you know, I ran across a mission which I just couldn't for the life of me do and it was making me so cross. I was feeling it all again and, you know, I know we're going to be playing this game through for an upcoming episode and I'm just, yeah.
Am I treading it? I don't know. We'll have to wait and see, but I've definitely got an axe to grind with this one.
And for that rather basic bitch reason, I just, I couldn't, I couldn't put it higher than six for me, just cause it caused me so much misery, but it has so much promise.
Yeah. Maybe I should have flipped it with Riddick, but it was, I think it was still monumental. You just had, this was like one of those, you have to experience what it's like to drive out of that city and go to another city.
It's just, they just, they did it. You know, it was, it's what you, it was like the dream of what GTA could be when you play three and you imagine, well, how much further can they push this? And, you know, arguably it goes even further than that, because you're flying a Harrier over a desert where like Area 52 is, Editors Note, I meant to say Area 69 here, because of course it's Rockstar Games.
I'm not going to shoot missiles at you to try and take you down. It's just so crazy, the canvas, it's just so massive. I think there's 100 main story missions in this game, which is so many.
And I agree, some of them are just rancid difficulty spikes. I never finished it. I got to the missions.
There's that blind dude you're doing missions for in Last Ventura, so that's as far as I got. I was maybe doing one where someone was strapped to a car, and then the PS3 I had at the time, which had my save on it. I was playing it through with HD upscaling.
I just died and took my save with it, and of course I just never bothered with it again. So here we are now. We'll come back to it for the episode we're doing this year on San Andreas.
But yeah, it's just... Wish us luck. Yeah, it does help that you have checkpoints and the aiming and all that stuff in the new ones.
Still difficult.
Yeah, it is still difficult. I mean, I finished three, so I feel like I can do Vice City in San Andreas, but we'll see. Okay.
Yeah, it's just... It's too... Do 20 fewer missions, but make the 80 missions you've got better.
That's basically what the advice I would have given Rockstar at the time, but they made this game in two years, which is just crazy. So, yeah.
And to top it all off, the soundtrack is completely missing any skunking answer. So I was obviously devastated.
That was a question I had for you. Was there any particular radio station you sort of went towards because there's definitely good music on here. But I don't know if there's ever like a Flash FM or Fever 105, where I thought I loved multiple tracks.
Probably like, is there a country in Western?
There's definitely music that plays when you leave Los Santos and go into the countryside.
Yeah, it's probably a bit, I mean, again, surprising you. I'm not Mr. Hip Hop. So a lot of that is definitely lost on me.
And you look forward to some of the whitest podcasting you've ever heard in your life when we talk about this come the episode. But yeah, I actually don't remember. So I'll have to get into it when we do the deep dive.
Probably like whatever was sort of poppiest and like most accessible. Probably whatever channel is in there is like unknowingly NAF radio station. That's the one I probably thought was all right.
Yeah, there's a bit of I think like this is more individual tracks on this one than like any one radio station that jumps out to me like eminence front by the who is on here for example. And that's, you know, just obviously an amazing track. But I think there's maybe it's this one that the Pesh Moda are on.
Or maybe that was Vice City actually. I'm just mixing them up. No, there was personal Jesus is on here as well on Radio X.
But yeah, there was no real sort of like one station I always tuned into. I didn't quite love it on that level either. So that's another thing that Vice City just has over this game for me.
It's just that very firm 80s identity and then loads and loads of music you've heard of on all the radio stations. The 90s kind of past each doesn't just doesn't quite register the same. I say that but then this sold more copies than Vice City did and people fucking love that CJ character.
He pops up everywhere. I mean, yeah, inspired by a bunch of different kind of like films about a similar area of Los Angeles that were released in the 80s and 90s and yet has made more money than any of those films combined. It's kind of a weird old little pop culture mix, San Andreas, its own specific set of influences, quite unusual.
It's not quite as neat, a one-to-one line as like how Miami Vice and Scarface lead to Vice City, you know? Anyway, probably enough on that one, Matthew. What's the number two?
My number two is The Legend of Zelda, The Minish Cap.
Of course.
Yeah, I mean, a lot of these are slightly interchangeable in terms of order. This is one I didn't play until after the fact, like Game by Advance I came to quite late because, you know, I just wasn't really buying games at the time. I think I like this game more than most.
Normally when you bring up Minish Cap, people either haven't played it or if they have played it, they just get a slightly haunted look in their eyes and they start talking about the Kin Stones, which are these sort of like two halves, sort of medallion things that you collect many of and you push them together to get various effects. And there's lots of quests about Kin Stones and people seem to fixate on that rather than the fact that this was, you know, a strange kind of Capcom made Zelda, made by Flagship, which was this this sort of partnership between Nintendo and Capcom. And so kind of tackled 2D top-down Zelda with just a different bit of attitude.
You know, that same kind of thing I was talking about with Red Dead Revolver, you can sense the kind of Capcom-ness in this. You know, it's got this very beautiful 2D art style that riffs on Cell Shaded Link from Wind Waker. It's like hyper-colourful, but you know, very beautifully animated.
A bit richer in its 2D looks than some of the other 2D Zeldas, which I'd say feels like a kind of Capcom productions value influence. Has a very flashy mechanic in that you shrink down all your normal size. So there's a lot of like honey I shrunk the kids.
You know, you go down and there are great, you know, suddenly enemies who are small are giants and, you know, there are big blades of grass and that's, that's, you know, that again feels like sort of Capcom showing off in quite a visual way, which isn't something you necessarily like associate with Nintendo. They're a lot more sort of everything's mechanics first, always mechanics first. And this is quite happy with just wowing you with the visual concept of big and small.
Has some quite inventive weapons, items that you collect, that we haven't seen in other Zeldas before it. Has the mechanic where you can step on these pads that clone links, so you end up controlling a little formation of multiple links. Similar mechanic that they used in the co-op link, the name of which is Just Escape Me, Four Swords Adventures.
So it kind of leans into that, it is a single player game, but it leans into that idea of having multiple links and creating a formation of him to defend against a certain boss attack, say, or solve a particular puzzle. So I just think it's a sort of Zelda that goes all out on big flashy ideas. Maybe if you really kind of stew on it, it's slightly shallower than some of the other Zelda games.
But I like that it does have this quite ballsy, skin deep beauty element to it. That does mark it out as quite a distinct adventure. It's got some great boss fights in it, some great dungeon concepts.
Again, the shrinking growing, just satisfying, really good stuff. So it is more than kin stones. And don't let the detractors tell you otherwise.
Yeah, very, like such a gorgeous looking game. I'd say like one of the number one things to check out on the Switch Online GBA sort of library, you know, just a, chances are this is probably one of the Zelda games you haven't played. You know, that was certainly the case for me.
It was just, I didn't have a GBA at the time. And then, yeah, like when I did get a DS, I think I ended up buying that link to the past, sort of like re-release instead. I think it just, this probably passed a few people by.
And the Toon Link thing, of course, like even Nintendo sort of swept it to one side, sort of, after a fashion. So, yeah, it's a cool thing. I think I only played two or three hours of it, but I was quite besotted with the way it looked and felt, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good choice. It's fun. It's quite fast moving.
It's just, yeah, like this GBA era was, they made some unusually beautiful, sort of 16-bit style games that are prettier than a lot of SNES games. It's just a good console for that particular sort of aesthetic.
I agree. Okay, my number two, we are firmly in Samuel Roberts' heart pick territory now. We are exiting credible video game design, and we are entering...
I have no idea what your number top two are.
We are entering Pandemic's Star Wars Battlefront. It was the game I had dreamt of for many years. What if you could run around a big map and climb in a spaceship, fly away and blow up a big walker or crash it into some other players or climb in the walker yourself, shoot a load of rebels on the ground, get into a snow speeder, take on a load of walkers, a lot of walkers basically, on a bunch of different Star Wars planets.
Matthew groaned there. This was like a quite rough but really fun sketch of what a big Star Wars battle could look like in the age before multiplayer games became so polished and refined that they could never be this jank again. It was just so much fun and it was such a great sort of like match for the PS2.
I don't think these games were pretty big on PC, but to me they were like so console-y. They were third person primarily. There was a lot of like auto aim going on.
And it was just really fun to rack up loads of kills and fly your favorite Star Wars ships around or actually, to be honest, most of the space battle stuff is in the second one. But they do get a little bit of it here in terms of stuff that you can sort of fly around. A little bit of stretching the bounds of where you might use an X-Wing or Tie Fighter in a Star Wars set piece in the films.
Jesus Christ, listen to yourself.
It was just really good shit, man. It was just really simple and exciting and just had the scale that you wanted from this kind of experience and did feel like a Star Wars type of game that just hadn't really attempted before. Did this cross paths with you at the time, Matthew?
So was this online? Did you play this online?
I didn't play it online because I had it on original Xbox. I played the second one online, though.
Right, OK. Maybe I'm just kind of crushing two things together, but there was definitely in this period anything which had like the whiff of online about it, which is obviously unfair if this game wasn't online.
No, it was, but I didn't play it online.
Oh, OK. So then this does hold up. Anything with the whiff of online, I didn't go anywhere near it, you know, like, because I was just like, well, in my head, online gaming would come at such a huge cost.
You know, I didn't have, you know, I think we were still on some quite patchy sort of dial up style internet back then. And, you know, we were limited in our internet usage. So it was like, don't even entertain the idea of being able to play a game online.
It's never going to happen. So anything which did rely on it, I just didn't even really engage with it. It's the reason I don't have like any relationship with like Fancy Star Online on GameCube despite being absolutely loved.
It's like, well, I just wouldn't be able to play, I wouldn't be allowed to play that. So it's not a very exciting reason why I didn't engage with these games. But yeah, they just completely passed me by for that reason.
Yeah, which is fair enough. I just didn't, I just knew that you could play it with bots and that was fine by me. And I still, primarily how I enjoy this.
I mean, I demolished my brother at the remaster they did of this one and the second one, which released the subsequent year. I think I talked about the podcast and it was still just tons of fun. And it's massively unpolished.
That's the thing. All of Pandemic's games just didn't really have the stuff when it came to like super precise, polished third-person shooting. They were just, they were very like arcadey and junky.
But like, I just think there was the right time for it. And then things got a little bit too polished. We all became a bit too obsessed with fucking hitboxes and stuff like that.
And it sort of took the joy out of a lot of those kinds of games. And now first-person shooting is basically just CS GO, Call of Duty and a little bit of Apex, isn't it? It's not much of it around really.
So, yeah, I don't know, this was, I think people just had a bit more imagination with the kind of like silly, large-scale experiences they would enjoy online at that time, even if they weren't perfect. And yeah, this had enough of the right Star Wars beats to really appeal to me, Matthew. But if you think that's a duff pic for number two, wait till you hear my number one.
What's your number?
No, I don't think that's a duff pic. I was just, like I say, a bit like the RTS. Online in my head was a genre of games and I was like nope, not for me.
I do get that. I was largely the same as well at the time. That old network features thing on a PS2 box was like, get that the fuck away from me, sort of dog territory.
So what's your number one, Matthew?
My number one is Fire Emblem on the Game Boy Advance.
Of course.
Came to this very late, having played other Fire Emblems probably in the last 10 years. It's on the Switch Online thing. You can play it on GBA.
This was the first Fire Emblem released in the West. It's technically Fire Emblem 7, famously released in the West, allegedly because of Roy and Marth in Smash Bros. You know, kind of caught the public's imagination.
And Nintendo went, well, maybe Fire Emblem does have a chance. They, you know, previously been on the NES and the SNES.
Is that true? Has there ever been like a myth busters about that? To sort of verify that in the West.
I think it has been mentioned in like, in Iwata asks.
Right, right. I guess it does make sense.
Yeah, yeah, it does. Yes, I think it makes sense. I mean, they're not actually in this one.
This one's like a prequel to the next one that came on GBA. And that one's got Roy in it. I think this has got Roy's dad in it.
I'm not very good on the fucking timelines of it. But anyway, what I like about this is it's not just the first one localized for the West, but feels like, even now, arguably, like a perfect jumping in point. It doesn't have a huge amount going on.
Like, it hasn't layered up lots of complicated systems on it. You know, it has fundamentally the same term-based battlefields. It has the weapon-rock-paper-scissors relationship between axes, swords and spears.
It has the support conversations where characters get to know each other a little bit better on the battlefield and develop relationships over the games. But like, outside of those, there's not many gimmicks. It's kind of the core rule set of the game.
It's a very good place to learn the basics of Fire Emblem and then take those into basically any other Fire Emblem and you're probably going to be doing alright. Some people have marked it down for that, saying it's too stripped back. You know, there's no world map, there's no like, grinding or extra RPG gubbins between the levels.
It's just battlefield, battlefield, battlefield, battlefield. I've actually read a few things where people who are at the more hardcore end of the Fire Emblem scale, which I am definitely not, they quite like that it doesn't have all that because any leveling up or character shaping you want to do, you have to do on the battlefield and that actually adds a little bit of drama to it. You know, you're not just trying to win the encounter, you're trying to sort of exploit the encounter to level up your army in certain ways, which is cool if you want to go down that route.
Yeah, but crucially, this focuses on, you know, just the core magic of it, the terrifying risk reward of every fight in that when characters are dead, they're dead for good. So these people who are friends that you want to take through the whole campaign, you feel very invested in them, every decision becomes super charged with meaning because of that. I mean, this is just what makes Fire Emblem great.
You know, what it specifically has, you know, on top of all that, is this gorgeous art style. Like, it's a really, really nice sprite art on the GBA. Very nice sort of character portraits.
Are the 3D models in the newer games better? They're definitely more sophisticated and complicated, but there is something definitely to be said for the amount of character they put in these sprites. And something I've always really liked about The Best Fire Emblem Games is that even though, you know, you aren't controlling them when you fight, you direct them around the battlefield and then the actual fight itself is a little kind of pre-canned animation.
If that animation can like sell you on how badass a character is or make you somehow like feel the hit with a little bit of judder or something, you know, they put a lot of effort into making those battle animations feel very like meaningful and impressive. And there's something about those stripped back sort of 16 bit sprites that really, really do that for me here. So it's just a beautiful little package that perfectly introduces this series to the West.
You can return to it now and still enjoy it. It's got its own characters, its own story. Even if you've played more complicated ones or more sophisticated ones, you can go back and just kind of enjoy the core building blocks of this series.
And then if you enjoy that, play the GBA sequel and whatnot. So yeah, it's definitely not what I expected to put at number one. But as I was making a list, I was like, you know what?
I think this sort of satisfies all my criteria here. I like that pick. Yeah.
I like that pick. That's cool. Yeah, I do agree.
There's something about the Switch Fire Emblem games where the 3D art is a little bit more like there's a gap budget. It feels like there's a gap budget-wise between it and the Zelda games on the system or Mario Odyssey. It feels like it's a little bit more second tier.
So I think that there is something appealing about having a more primitive pixel art style that can convey a little bit more character and detail. I don't personally hate that as a touch, and it is a really nice looking game. Interesting that leveling up thing, the idea of having to prolong certain battles in order to get the leveling up done that you need.
That's quite an interesting choice in terms of what makes you do tactically as a player.
Yeah, I do think that's quite a niche concern. It was more just watching some footage of it and reminding myself of it. Someone made that point and thought, oh yeah, that's actually pretty interesting.
I didn't know that that's how higher leveled Fire Emblem players think of this quite old iteration of it.
Yeah, that's an interesting one. Okay, well, that's a great pick for number one, Matthew. I can only contrast that by chucking in for my number one, the tie-in game to Spider-Man 2, the movie from Sam Raimi, which is my ultimate 2004 heart pick game.
I mean, this came up on the PS2 draft and I think that Wally Dave Scarborough picked it, I believe. The thing is, I did love this game. It is flawed in terms of the melee combat is not very good.
That's like the main weakness of it. This is way before, it's five years before Arkham Asylum comes along and Free Flow Combat basically solves this kind of superhero combat system forever and then everyone just rips off the same combat system, which is fine, it works. People are happy with it.
Give or take that fucking parry in Spider-Man 2, which I could absolutely live without, as in the new Spider-Man 2, not this one. But there's loads I loved about this. I mean, it was the fact that the first Treyarch Spider-Man game for the first Tobey Maguire film was so mediocre.
It looked pretty good for the time, but it was just... You get this tiny section where you're webbing around this big tower near the start, and then you're like, oh, I just wish I could go out into the city and properly do this. And then this is a game that fully commits to that.
It's like, yep, you are going to get to go around all of Manhattan. It's all here. It's all going to be in pretty simple, simple borderline sort of cardboard box detail in terms of the skyscrapers and stuff.
Give or take like a few screens in Times Square or what have you. But they do that and then they do the webbing authentically, having the webs actually connect to the different buildings and having like a progression system so you get faster and better at the webbing. I mean, it's so fulfilled a fantasy that everyone at that time wanted from a Spider-Man game but hadn't had before.
And so that it does so, so well. On top of the kind of like sort of dubious authenticity of the experience more generally, where like, you know, this is way before anyone gave a shit about things like Canon being sacred and like the MCU films are obviously built on this, but no one gave a shit at this time. So you just have Peter hanging out with like Black Cat who hadn't appeared in the films, but Peter's played by Toby Maguire.
And you got all these like NAF villains like Shocker turning up. And just Mysterio's in this as well. I think he's Mysterio's in this one, but it's just a bunch of villains who hadn't been introduced in the Raimi films yet, but Treyarch were like, yeah, we'll just stick Shocker in here because they just thought, we can't just have Doc Ock in here.
The video game will be quite boring if it's just one villain. But I was so fond of it. And then of course the Bruce Campbell tutorial stuff, we talked about that on the PS2 redraft, but it just had like, this was like, I rented it twice because I couldn't afford it when I rented it, because I had bought fucking Final Fantasy X-2, that's why I couldn't afford it.
But I just adored it. It was like, oh, I can't believe they actually did it. And then it takes all those years later, like 14 years later for Insomniac to tap into that same magic for the Spider-Man PS4 game.
What are your thoughts on me putting this at number one, Matthew?
I can appreciate, I can understand it being in the top 10. I mean, I'm surprised it's number one, but I get it, heart pick. And I completely know what you're talking about in terms of like, this was one of the core gaming fantasies of like, whoever makes a Spider-Man game, which captures the thriller being Spider-Man, like they will be successful.
It's the reason we all probably bought lots of bad Spider-Man games over the, over, you know, I think we bought the Spider-Man, the movie based on the first Sam Raimi film, which really wasn't it. And the PS1 ones were quite successful as well.
They were OK. They were OK, the PS1 ones. They were never soft ones.
Yeah. Always think they just look like just a big soupy fog and a couple of like the tops of buildings poking out over the top of it. But whatever, that's fine.
I had this on Gamecube. You know, I bought it for the same reasons. Like, yeah, if there is a game where you can do proper web swinging, I'm into that.
You certainly can. I think I ran out of patience with the surrounding game. I wasn't particularly in love with how they filled your time in that game.
Yeah. Fetching balloons, etc.
Yeah. That kind of shit. I mean, that really just did for me.
And so I don't think I ever finished it. I kind of played like five hours of it, got bored of the filler and then moved on. But I do...
I can understand how this came to be your number one.
Yeah. It's sort of that thing of...
I'm not judging you.
Thank you. Remembering how into that film I was at the time and just how that was like a multiplier on my hype for the game. It was like, I can't...
This film is going to be so good and then I can't believe they're doing this with the game tie into it. I just...
Yeah.
Yeah. And then it mostly delivering. Yeah.
It's sort of like I'm not objectively... Saying this is the objective best game of this year.
No.
It wasn't. That would probably be Half Life 2, followed by Riddick, followed by San Andreas, probably. But that's not why we're here.
We're doing personal top 10 lists. So there it is. Neither of us picked Burnout 3, Matthew.
I just wanted to point that out because Burnout 3 is great, but I didn't play it massively at the time.
I played 2 on GameCube a lot, so...
Yeah. So I do really like 3. It is the right balance between that super mega arcadey action while having pretty great racing in it, before it gets sillier with revenge.
But yeah, it did make the top 10. I have no other honorable mentions otherwise, Matthew. So yeah, that's the 2004 games.
Fucking long episode, but I feel like we did it the year just now.
That was long.
It was. Okay. Well, where could people get your social media, Matthew?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
Yeah. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
Also, the podcast is BackpagePod on all social media platforms, Twitter. As a matter of fact, all is not true at all, but Twitter, Blue Sky, it's on both of those. And there is a Discord as well, which is linked in the, I've had an increase of people asking me via Patreon how to get into the Discord.
If you just go to either the Blue Sky at BackpagePod or Twitter, BackpagePod, you will see a link there, permanent link, so you can just join up and see what all the fuss open commas is all about. But yes, that's the podcast. Thank you so much for listening and we'll be back next week.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
