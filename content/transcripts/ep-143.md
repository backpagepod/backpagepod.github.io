Hello, and welcome to The Back Page: A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, you are ill. So, we have delayed the Nintendo DS draft by one week.
I'm sorry, listeners, and to you, Samuel.
No, it's okay. I think we needed an extra week to make this one good, because I did want to have a very rich and exciting Saturday morning, dipping into some old games, and also some other games I've been hoovering up on eBay. So I think we needed the extra time, ultimately, to kind of crash straight into that one after Gamescom.
I'm not sure we would give the DS its full due, and I want to give it the same treatment we were able to give the PS3 and the 360. Felt pretty, felt like we nailed those ones. You know what I mean?
We just, we like, properly gave a good hit.
Yeah, you nailed the PS3 one. I certainly, fuck all about what I was talking about.
Oh, well, you attended.
I've got to bring my A game to the DS. I feel like there's a lot of eyes on me to see, like, has Old Castle still got it? Can we still draft with the best of them?
Yeah, I mean, I think you are currently winning the XXL draft, but that's a non-canon draft.
I mean, that is also, like, total horseshit.
We should never talk about that episode again, even though people seem to quite enjoy it.
People are like, hmm, I fancy watching Just Planes, Trains and Autos for the rest of my life, so I'll vote for this service.
Yeah, you have finished Basic Instinct. Now you'll watch Ricky Gervais meets Gary Shadling. That was...
But if you don't subscribe to the Patreon tier, then you've not really missed out. People who are subscribed seem to enjoy it, but I don't know. It's for the listener to decide.
We wash our hands of it and we can move on. But yes, a DS draft, I agree. We really nailed the preamble on the last two drafts, so I just want to make sure we get that bit right, because I don't know as much about the history of the DS as I do about the PS3 and the 360, so I want to make sure we get there with the episode plans, so that's why that one's gone back a week.
But that doesn't mean this episode will be a waste of time. Far from it. So me and Matthew have been playing a few little bits and pieces, nothing major, but I did also want to give people, Matthew, a taste of what's coming up on the September 2023 pod schedule.
So this is September 1st, you've got a What We've Been Playing episode. On the 8th, we've got the Nintendo DS draft. 11th, we've got our Excel pod, the Patriot exclusive episode of the month, Two Giant Men take on an escape room and the best gaming prisons.
Me and Matthew are going to an escape room on the Monday after you're listening to this to try and finish that escape room, then we'll record a podcast about it. Should be fun. Maybe we'll try and capture some audio while we're in there.
We haven't thought that far ahead, but.
Maybe. I worry that the person running the escape room will see us like, because they watch you on CCTV cameras to make sure you're not stuck. And I worry that they'd be like, why are these two weirdos apparently podcasting you in our escape room?
Yeah, who are these fucking psychos? I look forward to that awkward moment on a Monday night. So yeah, that's happening on the 11th.
And then on the 15th, we've got Games Court, the return of Games Court. Got some listener entries for that one, Matthew. But at some point, I think in October or November, I will have a Games Court of my own for you to litigate of my purchases.
I now have enough for another one. So that's how things have been going lately on the Coping Emotionally front.
One of those summers.
Very much so, yes. And then we get to September 22nd, where we have Two Giant Men Play Starfield. I'm going to give ourselves a bit of time for that one.
So we won't actually get to play it till the 6th, I don't think.
It's available day one on Game Pass. By day one, I mean day six.
But we still want to talk about Starfield. Major, obviously, a huge release of this year. Looking forward to trying to crown that and boulder skate three into my end of year schedule.
Going to be a fucking nightmare.
Ain't going to happen.
No, definitely not. September 28th, another Patreon episode, XXL episode. More of Matthew's Asian crime fiction bullshit.
Matthew said the first episode we ever did of the podcast, Behind the Paywall, was an XXL episode on Japanese crime fiction, so we're going to return more broadly to crime fiction in that episode, Matthew. Do you have any more inkling of what that episode is going to be about yet, or is that TBA?
Yeah, it's not just going to be Japanese stuff, but some Chinese and some Korean stuff. I'm trying to think of something quite quick and easy to give you so we could maybe have another little book club section, because I quite enjoyed that in the first episode. So I'll try and palm you off on that.
Might throw a bit of manga into the mix, maybe.
Ooh, exciting. If you've got anything that's like the Japanese crime fiction equivalent of Mr. Men books, then that would be ideal for the...
I actually do. I've got a tiny little book of short stories. The book's about the size of a Mr. Man book.
It's physically smaller. It's called There Was a Knock at the Door, and it's short stories which all start with there being a knock on the door, and they're sort of like, I don't know, mystery, thriller, kind of Twilight Zone-y kind of things.
Okay, interesting. If you do have anything that's like Mr. Grumpy was assassinated in Kyoto, that would be Spawn.
He was assassinated in a locked room, but there was a grandfather clock and an avocado.
Well, that's the kind of fun that you'll get behind the paywall this month, then should be good. And then the final episode of the month of the regular feed, September 29th, things you only realize when you make games with People Can Fly's Jamie Smith, who I've never met, but really likes the podcast. Seems like a good dude, has been on other podcasts.
And yep, he's going to talk a bit about, well, basically what it's like to be a game developer and how I think how like, the public perceive the game versus how developers perceive games, something like that. It's in a somewhat larval form, but it's in a correct us on all our bullshit, basically. Yeah, is what you've 80% of your content has been wrong.
And here's why. No, it should be good. So looking forward to that should be a packed month, Matthew, very exciting.
This episode then what we've been playing Matthew and me have we got we got three games each to discuss basically, do I start with one of my Matthew, what's the one of yours?
Let's start with one of yours.
Okay, so first up, I'm afraid there's nothing major like blockbuster in the in the mix this month, if that's the sort of thing you were kind of hoping we talk about. But I would say that all of the things we have to discuss are quite interesting. Actually, that's a lie.
We've got Armored Core in here, haven't we? So that is like literally a from software game that Matthew has been playing. So we can talk about that.
But the first thing I'm going to discuss is a doom wad known as My House. Now this has done the rounds with horror YouTube and a lot of the major PC gaming websites covered it. I first heard about it because a long time listener of the pod Robert Augusta Meier was talking about, I think he was like talking about how no one was discussing My House as a game of the year contender when it really should be.
So I was kind of curious, that sent me down the rabbit hole, Robert has previously asked why haven't we played and talked about cruelty squad on the podcast. I feel like I've let him down on a lot of games. So I wanted to look into this and I'm really glad I did.
So this is basically a horror game in the form of a Doom mod. And the Doom mod is presented as if it's a mod of someone's house. And then you dig into it and realize there are layers to it.
And I suppose like the key thing with this is you don't want to spoil the surprise, right? Because I think that's a lot of the magic of this is you expect one thing and you get something else. So I feel comfortable saying it's a horror game and that the sort of like the My House element is very much a fa√ßade to lure you into a full sense of security, because that's really only step one with this.
Top level, it is a Doom level in the sense that you fight Doom enemies as you're going through this house type environment. But the house keeps changing. Now, I won't say exactly why.
A lot of my early journey with this game was understanding the different points of interaction in the house and what you're supposed to be doing. Fundamentally, you're kind of collecting little props that pop up across the course of this mod that is basically a standalone game. You need Doom 2 and you can save it as you go, load it.
You'll need to be doing that a lot because you might find yourself going down one of multiple paths in the game, which is pretty amazing as well to discover that's a thing in this. And it's something I would describe as somewhere between the games of Daniel Mullin's PT and a little bit of puppet combo I've talked about in the podcast before, sort of like PS1, PS2 horror aesthetic, kind of amazing sort of like indie games made for a sort of a select audience that has kind of expanded over time. And this is sort of like an interactive horror game in the form of a Doom level.
And it keeps surprising you, keeps amazing you. As I say, it's got multiple paths. There are some things that won't occur if you don't activate certain objects at certain times.
And unpicking it has been one of my great pleasures of playing games this year, Matthew. I've played probably four hours of it, and I don't think it's meant to be four hours long. I think I'm just rubbish and bad at figuring it out.
But once I went down a route that I realized was completely optional, I had to read all about it. I basically went and started it again and then found a bunch of other stuff. But the amount of detail it put into it, you'll go down, you'll see doors to places that shouldn't exist.
You'll open a door that seems like it should go to nowhere, but it spills off into a whole other area of the house. You'll see like what is normally just a closet with, you know, just like a sort of like chest of drawers in there turn into like a path to nowhere with a kind of like a wall that doesn't go anywhere. Then when you open the door again, it's a normal closet again, that kind of stuff.
Just things that fuck with your mind. And then some much bigger high concept stuff that I've shared with you on Discord, but do not do not want to spoil for the listeners who are 100% encouraged to go out and play this. But I was curious what you think as someone who had some of the, you know, the spoilery bits sent to you, what you kind of make of this, how this affected your perception of what this is.
I had some idea just from the people who were talking about it on Twitter. I've seen a few people mention it and knowing their tastes and that they were excited about it. I thought, oh, this is probably some like deep, deep horror cut.
Does it ever present itself as not that? Like, is it ever like it's the first thing you experience quite straightforward or is it quite odd from the off?
Yes, it is straightforward at first because you it is a doom level. You fight doom enemies and they're in a house and then you shoot them and you can you collect ammo. It has ammo and health like a doom level would and then I would say on the second at some point you leave the house and you come back into the house.
I would say that's when it starts getting strange and how it does that with music and the ways in which the house changes. Right. That's as far as I'll go with explaining.
Yeah, I know I love this kind of stuff. You know, I love the fiction of that this thing is just out there in the world and people have discovered it quite organically. I think it's right that no one really knows who made this.
Is that right?
Yeah, I think it is. It's a largely unknown creator called Steve Veg Nelson. Veg being an inverted comma just to make that very clear.
All right, it's not one surname Veg Nelson.
But what is cool about how they presented it is that it's an enhanced. They presented it as an enhanced version of a 15 year old mod. And it's quite clear from playing it that that is a little bit of a fib.
But it's a nice fib to set your expectations at a certain level, I would say. It kind of feels like, yeah, it's much more advanced than you initially think it's going to be, I would say. And they did also present it as my house, my own house, but full of demons, which cannot be true.
But I understand this taps into like quite an old doom thing of people making their house or making houses in doom. That was like a thing that people used to do in the 90s, is my understanding from Roberts, who has met, who has tweeted me about this a few times.
Right, right. Yeah, I just, I just need to play this for myself. It sounds like, I definitely, some of the stuff you told me about, and one of the things you showed me was like, sounded faintly preposterous.
Like, this isn't like a terminally online game, is it?
No, I understand why you thought that from what I said you.
Yeah.
But that is as terminally online as it gets, I would say. Yeah. Yeah, and that, that moment is designed to evoke something very specific as well, which makes sense when you play it, I think.
Right, I have to play it. I mean, I'm not going to spoil what it was that you shared with me, but it was a kind of a, oh, right, I thought I had a read on this thing, but that, that is, that is not what I was expecting to hear at all. It sounded quite, it sounded like something Jay Bayliss would like.
Yeah, definitely.
It's got big kind of like cursed 90s energy, which is something I associate with him for whatever reason.
He'll take that as the praise and criticism it's meant as. So, yeah, and I would struggle to talk about it anymore. What I will say actually about it is that it does what I think a lot of, we used to get from a lot of kind of walking simulator type games in terms of like, a feeling, a vibe, a narrative experience.
But because it's wrapped up in a doom level and you're doing like lots of doom shooting still, I think that ends up being quite a good contemporary vessel for that kind of like, what the hell is going on here type storytelling. I'm really impressed by it as a kind of a halfway house between, yet genuinely brilliantly constructed interactive narrative vibes. I'm not saying like there's loads and loads of meat on the bones to the story, but there's a lot of what is going on here that is delivered through how the environment is presented to you.
That is incredibly impressive. So yeah, this is rad.
What I'm hearing is basically you wish that Gone Home had an attic area full of demons to shoot.
If Gone Home was like a quake map, that would be quite fun, I think. But yeah, it's just that I just think it's such a great, I don't know, we kind of live in this weird nostalgia era of old and new things colliding all the time. And this almost feels like the best contemporary form to put something, a narrative experience like that in, where you can appreciate the effort that's gone to bringing the world to life and the feeling it creates in the music.
The music in this is, well, I just think it has to be heard to be believed, frankly, it's quite the thing.
You've sold me on it. I'm just like, you know, here's a cursed, here's a cursed Doomwad is like such a great pitch. Because so many of these kind of like creepy pasta things, you know, they're just stories.
You know, it's just, oh, I played this fucked up Pokemon cartridge or whatever. But to go to the effort of just putting it out and letting people discover it, I wonder if the person who made this old veg Nelson had to, like, nudge people, you know, to like, you've made it and you're like, are people going to just discover this organically? Or do I have to just prod people in the right direction?
It's a bit like when you've made like a weird Twitter account, like the Back Page: Quotes account, and you're desperate to get a bit of traction. It's like, how do you give something the bump into the realms where it's going to be found?
Yeah, I think what's happened here is that it was dropped onto one of the sort of like places where the Doomworld forums basically where this stuff gets shared. And it was meant to be unassuming, I think, in terms of how it was presented. And then I think that it's now got 61 pages, that thread.
It's like a whole story kind of like thrown together. So it's like, Vege says, excited to finally release this tribute map. Last August, I lost a good childhood friend of mine and took it pretty hard.
When I was visiting my hometown for his funeral, I connected with his parents who shared with me some of his old belongings. Among them was a copy of an old map of his backed up on a 3.5 inch floppy disk from high school. Thomas and I were into amateur Doom mapping in the early noughties, but I'd never seen this map of his prior to uncovering it on one of the old floppy disks.
So you have a little bit of like, I don't know how much of that, you know, might be informed by weird excuses. Yeah, that's great.
That's like Ringu shit.
Yeah, exactly. So, and then it's, yeah, it also presents it as not much of a challenge and roughly 10 minutes of playtime, which is just not true. But my understanding is that from there, it sort of like, its popularity grew and then it started punching outside of like the usual places that people would talk about Doom was, because obviously this is like a, you know, like a long running community.
You know, this is a, it's like, you know, it's a constant, Doom, Doom boards are a constant of PC gaming, right? And for this to punch out and reach the corners that it has, I think it really is one of these true viral successes and therefore it's worth celebrating for that reason. So yeah, exciting.
I bet people who have, because I own Doom 2 on Switch, right? I actually had to go buy a Steam version to play this because hadn't played Doom in years, hadn't played Doom 2 in years. So I actually spent like four quid to get it so I could play this.
So you know, a bit of money in Bethesda's pocket for that. But yeah, well worth it. This is absolutely going on the game of the year list as it stands.
So yeah. Yeah, it's really good. It's really, it's not, yeah, I've worried now, I've now overhyped it, but the way it's been presented to me has not been overhyped.
So yeah.
Yeah, like I've only heard amazing things, but likewise, like tempered by not wanting to tell you what it is. Yeah, it's got big, like, just play it like the end of Inside, you know, it's got, you just need to see this.
Yeah, it's very much like how people were talking about inscription where they were like, it's this card game, but something else is going on. It's very, very similar vibe. And that's high praise for something you can play for free with a very old game.
So yeah, don't want to set people's expectations too high. I would recommend making many saves because you'll find that you'll activate things you can't reactivate and break things and need to go back. I've needed to reload and start again.
Well, not start again necessarily, but go back at least like six or seven times. So go into accepting that it's not like it's not a completely linear experience. You will make mistakes and you'll need to go back.
So that's what I will say. But yeah, My House. Thank you so much, Mr. Veg.
You did me a solid there. So we come to your first game, Matthew. What do you got?
I'm trying to work out which order to set these in.
You can go with your first one here.
Yeah. Sea of Stars, which is a retro-inspired RPG from Sabotage. They're the people who made The Messenger.
The Messenger, if you didn't play it, was like a modern retro riff on Ninja Gaiden, the 8-bit version. This is a similar approach, modern tech, modern sensibility, modern design lessons applied to the RPGs of the SNES era. Specifically, Chrono Trigger is a big influence on this.
There's quite a lot of Mario and Luigi and Paper Mario RPG in its combat system. It has that timed combat system where you press button Qs to energize attacks and boost your defense.
I love this sort of approach to games. It's the same thing we saw in Shovel Knight, where someone makes a love letter to a particular thing, but sands off a lot of the rough edges, makes it very smooth, very fast moving. It's obviously visually very glossy.
This one, to look at the screenshots, kind of has that sort of 16-bit sprite look. But then when you play it, you begin to realize there's a lot of more tech going under the hood with lighting and real-time shadows, and the story kind of revolves around sort of mystic, sort of monk-like warriors who pull their power from the sun and the moon. So there's a kind of mechanic, which in the first 10 hours actually hasn't been used that much, but there's a mechanic where you can stand on these pads and fast forward time or rewind time to change the light in the sky and change the shadows of things and where the shadows land can activate new machines.
But suddenly seeing this static 16-bit screen, which normally in the old games, the lighting would just be baked into it. And suddenly to see all that light shift and all the shadows move and the music as well will change from a kind of day composition to a night composition. This is just stuff that would have been like way beyond the SNES, but here this indie team is obviously capable of doing it.
So, there is just great pleasure in being in a genre that you enjoy and it kind of taking you back. I mean, the cliche is, it's this genre as you remember it, but it's obviously those games tend to be jankier and this is a lot more polished, which is why it's very much the kind of rose tinted version. Well, yeah, I know, you know, apart from just like the production values and like the beautiful sprite work and the lovely music, some of which is supplied by Mitsuda, one of the composers behind Chrono Trigger and Xenoblade.
I think he only contributed like 10 tracks to the game. And there's a little bit of when you're playing it, I'm constantly aware of, do I think this tune is good enough to be one of the Mitsuda 10 or is this the other bloke? I'm sure he's also an amazing composer, but maybe that's some of my Xenoblades snobbiness there.
And what I really like about it is the combat system, which like I say, it has these kind of like real time button presses of Mario, but also has just a little bit more going under the hood. Enemies have, when enemies are kind of preparing special attacks, they get these kind of locks above their heads, which are a series of icons, which if you then attack them with those powers, if you attack them with all the icons, you know, that comprise that lock, you can sort of stun them and knock them out of that attack. So there's this sort of drive to, you know, target particular enemies before they unleash really special attacks.
And can you combine your own attacks and can you find the right combination of moves between your party to make sure you tick off all the relevant icons? It might be they need two sword attacks, two blunt attacks and a moon attack. And some of your moves will kind of combine like a blunt attack and a moon attack.
So what's the kind of minimal number of moves you can do the most sort of efficient lock damage with? That's quite an interesting hook. There's also this kind of magic system where as you attack enemies, they kind of drop sparks on the floor, which your party can then absorb to sort of like supercharge the next move that they do, which lets you start adding solar or lunar damage to moves that didn't previously have them.
And I just think as a combat system, it feels like you're very like, you have to kind of exist in the moment and it kind of feeds itself. A lot of it's about like managing energy, which is generated from the combat itself. So it's got this quite nice sort of feedback loop where you're hitting enemies, they're dropping these things, you're using these things to break another attack.
And it doesn't just feel like you leave the battle and you consume a load of like potions to get your magic points back. It feels like there's certain things can only be achieved and can only be generated in battle. I mean, the actual special attacks, you have to kind of land normal attacks to charge up a combo meter as well.
So it's just sort of impressively in the moment for one of these systems. And also like the pacing of the adventure means that there's quite a nice variety of enemies and you're constantly introduced to new enemy types, which is like one of the big flaws of that Paper Mario or the Mario and Luigi combat system, is that once you've kind of learned an enemy's attack patterns, every fight with them becomes a little boring as a result because you're like, ah, it's this move again. I know the perfect timing for this.
So the only solution to that is to kind of keep giving you lots of enemy variety, because then you're having to constantly learn new attack rhythms and new little gimmicks to kind of get through the battles. And this actually does a very good job of that. So like, I don't really have many complaints about it, to be honest.
I've been having a really, really nice time with this. So it's a little like cutesy in terms of the story. Like it's not gonna like win any writing awards, I don't think.
You know, it's pretty kind of generic, kind of chosen ones going out to save the world, but you know, it moves you through environments fast. The environments are varied. There's lots of nice music.
There's lots of nice little touches. There's actually a really good mini game, which is like one of the key criteria, I would say for one of these kind of RPGs, which is like a kind of battling. I don't even know how you'd really describe it.
You're kind of, it's kind of like a fruit machine. And as you pull it, you get these symbols and the symbols become resources to either like power up these mechanical figures or build a defense around them. So it's this sort of strange risk reward system built around a fruit machine.
That's a very bad way of explaining it. If you played it, you'd be like, oh yeah, that's cool. But it has that kind of like, you know, it's not Gwent level, but it's a decent side distraction.
I think if the stuff around the edges is good, that usually kind of gives you confidence in the main quest. I see you've been playing this one a little bit as well. How are you getting on with it?
Yeah, it's funny, it's funny we got asked a few weeks ago about indie RPGs, right? And which ones are out there, which ones are worth checking out. And we didn't have loads beyond Undertale and Amore and a couple of others.
And playing this made me realize just how for the taking, a high-end version of this Japanese RPG type was there. You know, that was still relatively untapped. And maybe think about how obviously J's game, Cassette Beast, taps into that indie Pokemon thing, right?
It's kind of there for the taking if you can make one that's good enough and looks good enough and sounds good enough. And this looks and sounds incredible. It's, like you say, it makes the most of modern tech.
And so it's quite clever in how it will reuse bits of foliage, like swaying trees and things like that to populate the environment and make it feel alive. But I would say it feels very expensive to me in terms of how detailed the animations are, how beautifully that world has brought to life. Chrono Trigger is obviously their main point of reference here because you have this element of collaboration, the combat, in terms of the way that you can make different party members combine abilities to, well, you unlock new abilities that require multiple party members to pull them off.
But also at the same time, like you say, there is that Mario and Luigi action command element to the combat, which is pretty common these days. We've seen that in South Park and things like that. But let's say the blocking special moves element of it and having to react to the battle that way means it's not exactly the same.
So it's a best of of all the modern touches on a Japanese RPG with a few new ideas of its own. So I'm really impressed by it. I'm only a couple of hours in, essentially.
I'm nowhere near as deep into it as you. I think the obvious weakness is the writing. The writing is not as strong as all the other elements of the game.
If the writing was better, it would be a nine, I think, on the like, no problem. I really do think that it's.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the thing. It has like the looks and the shape of the quest and like, you know, the mechanics of the battle and also like, you know, there are some nice little puzzle elements in the dungeons and things. It's a little bit kind of golden sunny in the way that you can kind of you have like almost like Zelda dungeons at times and kind of how you use some real time powers.
Battles aren't like random, you see the enemies on the screen. So it's all quite well behaved. But I think you're right.
Like the story to me feels like a little bit too cute, a little bit too throw away. You know, like those RPGs for their time, you know, they may seem like quite sweet by maybe some modern storytelling standards, but they had like a bit of edge to them, you know, they had stakes, they had characters who were worried about here, you know, the enemies are quite sort of Saturday morning cartoon. It's quite silly, you know, I guess more like Mario and Luigi were actually like, if this had a story which really landed it, it has all the other ingredients for that to like gel into something like really spectacular.
And as it is, you know, it's nearly very good.
Yeah, yeah, I have no complaints about the art or the sound or the mechanics, all really well done. Like the writing thing, actually, you know what, it did make me go away and think about, well, what is it actually about that Snare Zero RPG? Was that writing like fundamentally good on paper?
Because I always think about that very smug tweet about how Chrono Trigger has 12 endings. Remind me, how many endings does Ulysses have? Which is one of my all time most hated tweets because it's so snobby about obviously Japanese RPGs.
Was that also Jason Isaac's?
The McFlurries are melting. No, it wasn't that. You know, the thing is, I think they're actually quite economical with how they used words.
They're not actually so packed with story that you're sat there reading reams and reams of text. Whereas sometimes you can be in this game because it's more contemporary sort of flowery characterization and you know, there's people talk more, there's more to say and that sort of thing. It's not to say there's too much of it, but I think it makes you think about the quality of its writing more than those old games do.
And also, you are right, there was an edge to those games. In Chrono Trigger, one of the first things that happens is you go to the far future and find out you've lost, you know, you find out that the world has been completely destroyed by Lavos. So you then have to go back and figure out how do I stop this timeline from happening?
So it sets really high stakes early on. Now, I'm not really far enough into this game to understand if it has a little bit of that, Matthew, but you are and it sounds like there's not necessarily.
I think what it does, which is good, is it's constantly establishing like new stakes for like little hour long adventures, which I think is actually quite common to this genre. It's like a, you know, allegedly a 30 hour quest that's made up of lots of little stories. Because each location you go to has its story, which, you know, is a reason to go into a dungeon and fight a boss.
Some of the stories like hint at darkness, like there's this one about a, there's like a town with a haunted mansion, which just, I don't know if it's every night, but every once in a while, it just sort of summons a sort of sacrifice to the mansion. And you know, a person just becomes entranced from the village and walks there of their own. And you know, played the right way, that could be a lot more sinister, this idea where everyone's just resigned to like, by random, you could get pulled into this like fucking nightmare situation.
But even there, it's like, hee hee, you know, there's these dumb comedy pirates that in what I've played of it, it really leans on them a lot. And every time they turn up, I'm like, ah, you know, there's just going to be like a minute too much of these guys talking every time. Right, yeah, which is just enough for you to be like, ah, come on, you know, get on with it.
But like, they've animated them, they've obviously taken great pride in their character design. And maybe that's something that like, you know, will really resonate with people. It's just, I don't know, like, in wanting to stretch their kind of comic visual design muscles, they've had to kind of match that with this sort of story, which can can never go too hard.
But like I say, maybe in the remaining 20 hours I have left to play, it will go that way. And the fact that it's reviewed so well, you know, people say it really sort of sticks the landing. And I have got to a point in the game now where, like, the world map opens up a lot more.
And that's quite fun. Like it's, it's, you know, for a game of in a moderate scale, I think this was like a team of 40 people kickstarted, you know, and they've definitely scaled up from the messenger. But like, you know, it's doing a very good impression of what once would have been like, you know, one of the biggest budgeted games of its time.
So I am really impressed. The story thing doesn't bother me that much. Like it's just a, oh man, this could have been like this could really compete with some of those greats if it just had a little bit more bite to it.
Yeah, it's I think it's deceptive in how, you know, maybe like low budget it seems. But yeah, they do have quite a big team working on this and they do have like these full animations that play in it, right? I think they have like maybe a sister studio that does animation, something like that, Matthew.
But either way, either way, it just imbues it with this next level of production values that, you know, definitely makes it stand out from the pack. And you know, as we're recording this, I've just said it sold 100,000 copies in a day basically.
So yeah, and that's on top of it being in Game Pass and on PS Plus as well.
Yeah. And them having, you know, obviously backers to the things to fulfill. So you know, it's absolutely going to be in a loaded game of the year list.
And I'm definitely going to keep playing it. And that actually is high praise because not all of these kinds of rifts on all the Japanese RPGs have worked for me over the over the last few years. And I think for this one to get the mechanics and the look and sound so right is a massive achievement, even if I'm not like totally tuned into the story.
So I really do appreciate what I've played of it so far and I will keep going because as mentioned, Starfield is not coming out when I thought it was so. So I have a little bit of time to fill and Starfield died.
So see if stars could live.
Yeah.
One thing that's quite funny about this is because it's a Kickstarter game. It has an area that's full of Kickstarter stuff, like all the in game things that people obviously bought when they signed up for it. And I kind of forgot it was Kickstarter when I was playing it and I got to this island and there's this big sort of song and dance about, oh, it's this mysterious temple.
And I was like, oh, okay. And I went into this temple not realizing it was where all the Kickstarter rewards had been placed. And all of a sudden you just find all this really incongruous bullshit.
Like you go up to a plaque and read it and it will be like, you know, this one's for you, Jonesy or whatever, and you're like, what's that got to do with the story? And then you go into another room and there's just like a dance tattoo of like quite a, like quite photorealistic looking dog. And next to it is a statue of like, like a family, like they obviously people could send in photographs to be turned into statues in this temple.
And it's just full of like all these real world people in like real world clothes.
That's what happened if we raised our, we had another tier on the Patreon, Matthew, is we'd have to like start without, we'd have our here's to you Jonesy section of the podcast every month. So, yeah, this is like, this is like, you gave us a grand on Kickstarter. So here's your dog forever enshrined in this amazing RPG, you know?
Yeah. But I always find that that odd in these games, it was the same in Shenmue 3, where you get to the second city and then there's this like big impressive looking temple, dojo thing and you go in and it's just full of all this like weird fan art that people have drawn and there's like a, you know, a Gashapon sort of capsule toy machine and you open it up and like a toy of like, just some bloke comes out of it.
And you're like, what?
No, that's it. You know, you're kind of, oh, is this, is this a guy from Virtua Fighter? And you're like, no, that's just, that's just Dave, you know, a guy who played 200 quid to be turned into a toy in Shenmue 3.
You know, nice that they've saw it through and it's great that they honor their backers and everything, but it's very, very hard to work those things into the game in a way which doesn't seem baffling to anyone outside of the Kickstarter process, because this is, you discovering this temple, like it's a beat in the story. That's why I found it odd, because there was like a mysterious voice calling to you. And it turns out it was calling me because it wanted to just read basically a load of like random yearbook scrolls all over the game.
Yeah, that is bizarre. It feels like that could almost be cordoned off slightly more. But yeah, like you say, because now 99% of the player base for whom this temple was not intended for them will have to go through this very strange sequence of the game before they continue on with the story.
So yeah, like you say, nice sale to the backers, but also quite confusing. So yeah, I look forward to getting to that bit. But yeah, very good, Matthew.
Look, it's a good year for the six to seven indies that people have decided are the indies will talk about this. Yes, so yes, good for them. And yeah, look forward to talking about this probably a bit more Matthew.
Maybe you'll, I assume you'll continue on with this one.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Okay, good. All right, then.
So we get to my second and final game. Well, technically, my thugs have played Sea of Stars as well. But I've been playing Dredge Matthew, one of the other indies as mentioned, that people have been playing this year.
So I wanted to get to this fishing horror game because I'd heard so many good things about it. I had a code from a good pal, Ashley Day, who I saw at Gamescom, and that was quite fun. Actually, a little pleasant conversation before he disappeared and I never saw him again.
And so yeah, I played this on Steam Deck where it's kind of perfect. And a lot of people just talked about this already, but it is a game where you start in a little fishing boat. You go around making money from fishing and slowly upgrading your boat.
But there are also horror elements at play as well. So at nighttime, weird, lovecrafty and shit happens. You start encountering monsters, that sort of thing.
Really, I would say like the thing about this is it's a weird comparison to make, right? But last year, I loved Arcade Paradise because they said, what if we did this really cool idea, which was a game where you manage an arcade and they made the best possible version of what that game could be on the budget they had. This developer has done the same thing with, what if we made a fishing horror game and they made the best possible version of that?
That's what's really impressive about this. The fishing mechanics are simple but good. You just tap buttons at the right time in order to fish and the patterns change depending on the different fish that you find.
As the name suggests, you are dredging up wreckages of different boats and there are different types of fish to find. You can drop little crab pots, that sort of thing. But the layers of spookiness work incredibly well.
The game is really good at making your boat feel tiny in an ocean that's got so much weird shit in it. And the map changes as you feel braver and you explore more and you get better engines and a larger hull and sorry, larger cargo hold and that sort of thing and better rods, that sort of stuff. It's got all the elements right, including decent little bits of story on top of that, really beautiful looking game and has more going on than even I really thought it did at first.
It really unravels as you go. So, yeah, fantastic little game, Matthew, and I can see why it's become one of the big indie hits this year. Most again, very strong candidate for the game of the year list.
Have you played this one yet?
I've played a tiny little bit. Lots of people on my team are really obsessed with this and it really seems to have broken out. And I don't mean that like I'm surprised, you know, it's got this very like compelling sort of central routine to it of like the phishing and the upgrading.
You know, even just taken as a job sim, it kind of works. But then it obviously has all that like weird shit out around the outside. But even with those things in mind, like I'm kind of surprised this has been broken out as much as it has.
I guess it's just a lot of weird horror heads out there.
Yeah, it's also got a visual style that's perfect for the Switch. I imagine this has been enormous on Switch. It feels like the right place for it.
And, you know, again, I'm never quite sure where we're at with Switch performance these days. So I play on Steam Deck instead. But yeah, so it's and it's also got like a passive mode if you don't actually want to do the horror stuff and you just want to enjoy the world.
But I would say that you'd be missing out if you did that. It's well worth having the fright, frighteners on. So yeah, they've kept updating it as well with new stuff and it's yeah, it kind of like captures the wonder of the ocean as well.
Like you will kind of like see like a blue whale swimming beneath you and things like that and dolphins in the distance as well as the kind of like much darker and stranger stuff you find later on. So yeah, real good. And I can see what's broken now.
If it's like a kind of gateway drug to sunless seas. Yeah, you know, in terms of like, you know, weird stuff, you know, you're going to bump into some like slightly weird kind of cosmic horror and stuff out in the ocean.
Yeah, really, really good, Matthew. It's very pick up and play. And yeah, again, just with a simple visual style does so much to make nights feel more threatening than day.
Yeah, well done to Black Salt Games. I look forward to seeing what they do next. So good stuff.
I'll tell you a small story about an amusing fishing sign.
Go for it.
My parents, they live in this town called Beer in Devon. And they used to be this. This isn't really...
I've already bigged up this story way too much. This anecdote is basically over. Is that it?
Was that the story?
When you walk down to the beach, there's a sign advertising a small boat business, but it's missing a comma on it. And it offers mackerel fishing excursions and also does pleasure trips. And there was this sign that used to say, for mackerel pleasure, contact so-and-so.
Amazing. That does sound like something you'd see in a toilet, in a public toilet, doesn't it?
That's my little fishing boat sign story.
No, it's pretty good. It actually did make me think about, because obviously Devon's got a big fishing culture down there, right? It's basically why Brexit happened.
But also it's a generational job, right? It gets kind of like passed down and it's very gruelling. And you just have these very harsh nights as you're trying to like, you know, basically sort of, keep your business going.
So it's not, yeah, it's not for the faint of heart by any means. So I found this game interesting from that basis too, of like, I've thought about what is it like to fish at night? It's probably fucking terrifying.
So, yeah.
I've got quite a lot of affection for that fishing culture. Like, my stepdad befriended a lot of the local fishermen there. Yeah.
You know, he likes to sit on the, because a lot of them go out in the morning, do their fishing then, and then they come in and then basically spend the rest of the day sitting in front of beach huts, drinking these enormous mugs of tea. Like, it's beyond a mug, it's like a giga mug. Like, I have no idea what these things are called.
A carafe, a carafe of tea.
A carafe of tea. And even though he's not a fisherman himself, he was sort of allowed in to their little community. I think maybe because they rinsed him for free tea.
And took advantage of a sucker. So sit there, have these teas for these fishermen. And then every once in a while, my parents would have like, you know, pub barbecues or like evening do's or parties or whatever up at their house.
And invite a lot of the local people. And you know, you'd get a lot of these crusty old fisherman guys there. And when you get enough of them together at night, and they've had a few drinks, like inevitably, and it sounds like bullshit, but like they do start singing like sea shanties.
Right.
And like I've spent many evenings like sitting in the living room, like listening to these guys sitting in another room, singing all these shanties about their towns and, you know, things lost to the sea or whatever. And this story isn't really going anywhere.
Is that the end of the story, basically?
No, no. One of the things I noticed, they had a lot of songs where, about like the town that they live in, and it's structured so that the town name is like very replaceable. So these, I imagine these shanties are sung up and down the Jurassic Coast, and that people just insert the name of their town, like the name of the town is not sort of, the rhyme doesn't hinge on it, you know?
So it's just there. So that's what I always think, is like there's these shanty templates that get passed along the coast to kind of like insert a bit of local colour to make it your own. And I wonder who wrote the original shanty that was sort of structured so that it could be adapted.
That was a very fucking long winded route to nothing.
Jesus Christ. We got there in the end though, didn't we?
But I've told you some stuff about a shanty, all right?
Oh, I have one more question actually about your stepdad in that situation. Do you think he very much was like Alan Partridge when he had those builders round where it's like, I see we're all going to keep in touch after the tea, that kind of situation.
I don't know how it started, but it's genuinely... I think that some of the locals down there can be quite suspicious or standoffish with outsiders to the town. So for him, very much not a fisherman to be allowed into their little club.
These are people who are only known as nicknames. I have no idea what any of them are actually called. I imagine their nicknames would be on their gravestones.
Salmon Bob, et cetera.
Salmon Bob. Isn't that the guy you work for in Splatoon? Isn't that that raccoon who wants you to kill all the fish?
Oh dear. Okay. I reckon that's enough time down this tangent.
It's been fun though. It's been fun little gentle ride. We should do a sort of face off of which podcast host's parents lives in the more middle class town in Devon.
That's something we can do in an Excel pod at some point Matthew. Okay. So we've got two more games to get through from you.
I don't have any more, but you have two more. So what do you got?
The one I'm really excited to talk about is Paranormasight, which I was toying with actually holding off and just dropping on you in the game of the year discussion.
Oh yeah. I thought about that for a few games.
I like to have a few surprises in the mix, but also like I just like it too much and I feel like I should sing its praises in this What We've Been Playing episode.
Yeah, that was me with My House as well. I really wanted to surprise you with that one, but oh well, never mind.
Yes. I mean, maybe there's some other surprises I'm sitting on. No, probably not.
This was on my raid after it was championed a lot by Chris Schilling when it came out many months ago and it was like, I've got to play that. I know it's going to be good. This is a very weird subgenre of Square Enix game where basically every year Square Enix make one game just for me, which is really nice of them.
And last year it was a centennial case.
I remember it well.
This year it's Paranormasight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. What I like about these games is that they both have the same like title structure, which is like bollocks, colon bollocks. It's just nonsense, which means no one ever buys them or plays them even though they're really good.
It's a horror visual novel about a group of seemingly unconnected citizens in this particular ward of Tokyo, who on a particular night are gifted a curse, a means of killing another person and collecting soul energy from them. And if they collect enough of this soul energy, they can resurrect one dead person in their life. And it is kind of like the Zero Escape games, in that you're following this big sort of story flowchart through this night and the day after and some other time to try and get all these people through their respective journeys kind of intact, because obviously lots of people are getting bumped off in this story or can get bumped off based on these curses.
So the structure of the game is, you know, is fundamentally like listening to a lot of story and then making key decisions to try and avoid a bad fate and then rewinding and making a different decision to get a different branch of the story. That's all cool. That's fine.
Maybe actually the thing it's more like is should be a scramble, because you're jumping between multiple characters and decisions you make in one path may deliberately be made to help someone in another path, or you might deliberately steer two characters so they're in the same location, so they meet at the same time, things like that. What I really love about this and why it's quite difficult to talk about is the actual setup of the curses and the rules of the curses. It's kind of the big mystery you're trying to unpick.
A curse is only known to the person who has it in terms of they get told the conditions they have to fill to kill someone else. So you end up with all these people who keep meeting each other and they're trying to figure out A. Does this other person have a curse?
And also, if I do think they have a curse, what's the weird condition that I'm trying to avoid fulfilling? It's like this very prolonged narrative game of cat and mouse. People trying to work out what shouldn't I do in any given situation to trigger these curses.
And that I think is such a cool hook. I'm super into it. About halfway through the story, got about half the curses figured out.
Some of the stories are coming together. But this idea of having these murder weapons that trigger in very unusual circumstances and trying to second guess those and figure those out, that would be a great hook in a mystery novel. So it's just like playing through this really juicy mystery, which is actually quite scary.
With very minimal interactions, you're basically clicking on menus to make dialogue choices. And in certain areas, you can look around. From that, it pulls out a surprising number of tricks.
This is quite a, almost Kojima-y feeling game in some of the tricks it pulls. It really has fun with the rules of the game and the technology of the game and how visual novels function. I'm genuinely quite blown away with it.
I'm pleased that you are eating so well with this genre, Matthew. You have certainly not been left behind when it comes to interesting visual novels of late. But also, this sounds like it has a lot more going on layered on top of that in terms of the way those curses manifest.
Super interesting. I've put this on my wish list. It's got 1,500 Steam reviews.
Some people have found it, some people are enjoying it. Maybe it's the typical crowd who finds all these games, Matthew.
It's like 15, 20 quid. I think it's meant to be about 10, 12 hours long. But given all the doom and gloom about Square Enix doubling down on basically Final Fantasy and selling off all those Western IP and all this, as long as they still make interesting things like this and support interesting projects like this, this and Centennial Case.
I would love a sequel to that, please. Yeah, I don't know. I would love to know who is there that is commissioning this stuff.
Oh, they should call it the Bicentennial Case. There you go. That's all I got for that one.
Yeah, I would play it. And that would definitely be on the Game of the Year list. But yeah, just a really weird thing that they're doing, but also really welcome.
Great characters, fantastic music, like very groovy when it wants to be, but also quite spooky. It's genuinely made me jump a few times this game.
Well, I think this is a low-key, quite a cool Square Enix era, where they basically just made loads of mid-range stuff, sort of Valkyrie, sort of sequel, and these sort of SNES 2.5 HD RPGs. And it's quite an interesting mix in there amid the big Final Fantasy and stuff, you know? Seems like Forspoken didn't really work out, but I don't know.
It's cool that this exists. It's just on mobile, Switch and Steam, is that right?
That sounds about right.
Yeah, so not on PS5 and stuff.
It almost feels like the wing of Square Enix that would have been making DS games if there were still DS around. That's probably what this feels like.
Well, they never really made anything like this on DS, did they? That wasn't really their forte. That was other people, really.
Yeah, but they did stuff like, you know, The World Ends With You. Maybe not specifically them, but it has that kind of 8 out of 10 that's probably going to be a 9 out of 10 for some people kind of energy.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I've put this on my wishlist anyway, so if I see it achieved, then I'll give it a go because I already have Videoverse to play this year, Matthew, on the visual novel front, but this is obviously a very different deal.
Yeah, yeah. That's great as well. It's actually a pretty amazing year, this one.
Yeah, absolutely. Like I say, you've been eating well. Yep, good.
We talked about Paranormasight without you getting into a sort of panic about, have I talked about it for too long? That happened last year.
I probably did talk about it too long.
People know you like this stuff and you are an authority on this genre, so who am I to stand in the way with my low nutrition quips? That's no real value, does it? That's what I've got midweek.
Okay, so Matthew, we come to your game of the year, which is Armored Core 6, and why don't you tell me about why you love it so much?
This is the one I've played the least amount of, but I thought I'd throw out a bonus. People are interested in it, I guess. I read Wes Fenlon's excellent review on PC Gamer, and this got me really excited about this.
He brings it, Wes, when it comes to this kind of stuff, for sure.
Yeah, and I definitely enter this game from a place of caution. Like, I'm not a big mech head. I've talked about this before, you know, I'm not into mech culture, I don't idolise them, I don't have, like, mech models.
And that is definitely, like, a big part of this game, and a lot of the people who've reviewed it clearly have an existing love for both mechs and specifically Armored Core, which is where I think a lot of the enthusiasm comes from. It's just, this is a game laser-targeted at a particular person, and all those particular people seemingly got to review it. So it got, like, mega scores.
So, you know, I'd offer a take of someone who is really coming to this with none of that.
Which is a valuable take, I think, with a series as this niche, you know? Yeah. This was, like, whatever people say, this was not a going concern for most people on PS2.
Definitely not in Europe. Maybe a bit more in North America and Japan. This was always niche, you know, even in those times.
So, yeah, it's definitely taken on a different profile thanks to From's increased prominence in the games industry, you know? So, yeah, it's a valuable perspective, Matthew. I'm curious to hear what you think of it.
I'll say what really resonated me in Westeros and made me want to play it was talking about it's not just customisation for the sake of, like, bumping up some stats or some numbers. It really changes how your Armored Core handles, you know? It becomes different vehicles based on what you build.
And he was talking specifically about, like, the weapons and, like, I bought these particular rocket launchers and they had such a satisfying sort of sound and feeling to them that just unleashing these things and that one point in the review made me think, oh, OK, I've got to give this a go. This sounds great. I like this idea of meaningful customisation that really changes the kind of texture of the game.
And that customisation, like, is clearly at the heart of the game, even from, like, the few hours I've played, which really isn't very much and I haven't got very far because I'm quite bad at this game, is enough to see that the loop of the game is not just building a mech which you occasionally add an extra part to to bump up its stats. It's radically rebuilding your mech based on the missions you're in. And the missions are often very short.
Some of them are like two minutes long. I think the longest one I've done was probably about 20 minutes long. So it isn't like a big open world.
If you're really coming to this blind and you just see FromSoft on there, it isn't a Elden Ring or Dark Souls or anything like that. It's basically a series of quite large sci-fi vistas that you get dropped into with a very specific mission. But the nature of that mission will, in theory, lead you to building different mechs.
So if there's a mission where there's lots of snipers, you might have a mech with a really good long range weapon. If there's lots of verticality, you might build a mech with better jumping legs so it can get into the air without using as much energy and get an aerial advantage or get onto the rooftops a bit easier. So there's this sense of if you are butting heads with the game, it isn't because the mission is super difficult.
It's that you've probably bought in a kind of ill-suited creation. And I think that's at the core of the game. And I do appreciate that.
The thing it reminds me of is Infinite Space, the DS spaceship building game, which what I really liked in that is that the components you put in your spaceship radically changed how it handled and the strategies you would pursue in space battles. And that probably makes sense because I think that game has some heritage. It comes from one of the guys from Nude Maker who I think they were like Steel Battalion.
There is a through line from like mech games to Infinite Space. So it makes sense that this game is tickling a bit of my Infinite Space loving brain. I don't find those changes as dramatic in the hands as some reviews led me to believe.
You definitely sense missions being easier when you've matched a mech to it. But I don't feel like I'm handling something radically different. Every mission sort of feels the same to me.
It feels like a lot of shooting tiny dots on the horizon. Maybe that's the build I've got is that I'm not getting up close and personal with things. But I don't find it like a hugely visceral game to play.
It doesn't really sell me as much on that mech fantasy, which was kind of the thing that Wes's review really spoke to me. It was this really tangible, satisfying, like, holy shit, the power of these weapons. Actually, everything I've played with so far feels kind of the same.
It feels like I shoot a lot of tiny dots from afar, which then explode into a tiny fireball until I get to a boss, which I just can't do because difficulty shoots right up. There's this, I thought, quite severe difficulty spike right at the end of the tutorial. Once you get through that, it's then followed by a suite of regular, actual tutorials open, and, like, the game suddenly gets much better.
I can see other people like me coming into this game, getting to the tutorial boss and going, fuck this, I'm refunding it or I'm sending it back. Like, this just isn't for me. If this is the kind of ride I'm gonna have, which actually doesn't reflect what the game is at all.
Like, I think it's, I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's very kind after that first tutorial fight, and kind of shows you some quite cool stuff quite quickly. Like, I don't know if you've seen any of the stuff with like the giant Strider mech thing.
No, I've actually like more or less tuned out of this game entirely, because I just assumed it wasn't really gonna be for me. Yeah, well... I wasn't expecting you to play it, to be honest, so it's, you know.
You know, I wanted to see what the deal was, because I've seen lots of people say like, oh, it's a lot more kind of like pick up and play, and it kind of is. There's still a jankiness to it. It feels like the combat's built around like lock-on, which you can very easily fuck with by trying to move the camera.
You almost have to train yourself, like, not to touch the camera. And I don't know if that's me playing it wrong, but that seems to be what it's leaning me towards. You know, you focus more on kind of evasion and moving the thing around and let the lock-on kind of deal with the aiming.
Seems to be the thrust of it. And that's what really threw me in the first boss, because it was moving all over the place. I just couldn't literally, like, keep up with it or kind of get a bead on it, and I was getting quite frustrated with it.
I won't lie, Catherine had to do it for me in the end. That's fine, she's better at games than I am. But then after that, you suddenly get into these missions, which you can do, and you definitely see the appeal of climbing up these giant icy dams and blasting things out of the sky.
You know, it gives you this huge sort of, like, shadow of the Colossus style Titan kind of robot thing to climb in, like, the fourth or fifth mission. So it gives you something, like, really spectacular, which is more of a sort of set piece level than an actual boss fight. Like, it's quite easy, you know, you dodge some lasers in the run up to it and then kind of, like, fly up its back and stuff.
But the thing is, I just wanted to play more Sea of Stars and Paranormasight, so I haven't, like, seen this through to it. You know, I haven't seen my sort of line of thought, but it's... I don't see the 10 out of 10 in this that some people seem to see.
But maybe, like, if you just live for giant robots, then this is probably, like... Well, it seems like from what people have written, this is, like, the only game in town. I can't really begrudge people for getting excited that their niche is, like, served.
I don't know. I don't give Ace Attorney 10 out of 10, even though it's my favorite thing, you know?
No, it's... I think there's also that little mix of... I don't know.
It seems cool to have rediscovered Armored Core when, you know... I don't know if you saw Jeremy Peel's floopy-doop-ex tweet, Matthew, but that spoke to me quite a lot. Just the idea that I don't know if people would be discussing Armored Core or excavating it in any way, shape or form had there been no Dark Souls.
You know what I mean? That entire lineage of games has created a perspective on it that is maybe not reflective of what those games were like to play at the time, at least to me, as someone who reviewed at least one of these games and had such a boring time on PS3. I think it was Armored Core 4 I played.
I think its reputation has been inflated by just the incredible work that From Software has done since then. That's not to say I don't believe the people who have enjoyed this. I believe they have.
No, no, no, no.
It's just, I think like you say, maybe it's best, you know like when you see like out of park baseball get like 10 out of 10 or whatever. And it's like if you like a baseball simulation game, that's the one game you should play. And this is probably that for mech enthusiasts.
So maybe it makes sense that by that criteria, those scores are that high, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I still think when you're dealing with those kind of scores, there is an element of like, can this go beyond its core? Can this like bring other people in in a way? And I wouldn't say this does from what I've played so far, you know?
But yeah, that's saying. I thought I was going to bounce off it way more than I have. I thought like if it was all like that, at the time I was having the tutorial boss, I'd be like, fuck this game.
Yeah, it's just weird how what follows is just such a better introduction to the world and its mechanics than that first mission. You know, they continue to be diabolically shit at kind of like getting people into the game.
The new player experience. Yeah, that's just the whole thing, isn't it? It's just like, yeah, we just dropped a turd in the middle of like, you know, that you're opening stretch of this game and you'd either push through, push through the turd and declare this the best game ever or resign in disgrace in the face of the turd.
So, yeah, that's just from software, I guess. But it definitely seems that it's a lot shorter, at least. How long to beat a peg set at 20 hours at most, Matthew, to do everything.
So, that's intriguing.
It's super explicit about like the story. You know, it just has characters that say exactly what they mean, and it's just like mercs barking over the radio and stuff. And, you know, there are missions where you go in and it partners you up with AI characters and you just go on a big old rampage and you're like, well, this is great.
We're just having lots of fun here. This is just pure spectacle. Like, no brains at all, which I would say is very sort of the sort of antithesis to what I would just, you know, would take our like from software strengths.
And maybe that's just true to Armored Core, you know, like I say, not a series I have experience with. I don't really see like a huge amount of connective tissue between the work they've been doing elsewhere, you know, in the intervening years and this. But, you know, maybe it means I'd actually finish it.
I don't know. I bet there's some fucking evil boss. I mean, I couldn't do a tutorial boss.
I know the next boss I meet will be just the end for me.
Well, I look forward to hearing more about your adventures of this. You've been a very curious player of late. You've got a lot of games sort of like you've racked a bunch of hours with.
I'm very impressed by your, you know, your diligence, Matthew, and ticking things off this year. Well, you are. I think you're just so much better at finishing games than me.
You've got like, you know, you've got Zelda at a point where you can finish it. You've finished it. Almost finished FF16.
You've got that nearly done.
I have finished that now. Yeah.
Oh, there you go. Baldur's Gate 3. Where are you at with that?
Oh, no. I've got loads to go.
That's good. Maybe that is a pod for us at some point as well. Maybe like we get some proper time with it and talk about it.
That one's tough because like I like to play it for like five hours. If I'm going to play it, I want to play it for five hours and I never seem to have that window of time.
Gotcha. Well, in any case, Matthew, I think that was a solid little pack of what we've been playing for this month. So hopefully people got some value out of that.
I definitely have enjoyed playing some different bits and pieces to the monster size games that are coming out this year. So shall we take a quick break, Matthew, and come back with some list of questions?
No, it's fine. I was just trying to steer you out of it at a certain point.
Yeah, I just, I don't know what I thought about it.
No, it's okay, but I think it was not too long anyway. It was all good. It was only about 10 minutes of the pod there.
So yeah, don't worry about it, it's all good. All right, I'll jump back in. Welcome back to the podcast.
So as we try and catch up with our monster backlog of pod questions in the Discord, which is a blessing, not a curse, I remind myself, to have so many listeners who want to hear what we think. We are very grateful for that. We have a bunch more questions here to get through.
I know we just did a mailbag, but we're just trying to catch up as much as we can. So we have a few more to get through. Matthew, do you want to read this first one?
Yes. Sir Samuel and Master Matthew, how do you fare physically when playing VR? I'm enjoying Half-Life Alex on the Oculus Quest 2 at the moment, inspired by Matthew's hilarious stream of it when he was at RPS.
But every session gets cut short by nausea and headaches for me. Any tips for how to get the best experience of VR? That's from Bumster.
Good stuff. Bumster returns, the return of Bumster. So, yeah, I actually don't get this.
In some ways, I think that you either do get the VR motion sickness or you don't. And that's kind of, sadly, I think you're just doomed with it. I mean, the kind of like, the sort of, the physical effects I get are, I can't really stand up that long these days without my back hurting, which is really embarrassing.
And, or at least I can't stand up and exert myself for more than like an hour before I need to sit down for a bit or lie down for a bit. So don't know what happened there, my mid-30s probably. So funny actually, like the most physical damage I've taken from VR lately was playing.
I've been getting to like some of the later boxers in Threat of the Fight, the boxing game, and that requires you to absolutely batter the air. I was doing it before work each morning, but it's gotten too sunny lately to do it. But the last time I played it, it was like I'd actually been boxing.
I was like collapsed on my sofa, I was sweating. I felt like I had an actual fight, except it hadn't been punched in the face at all. I was just like, my back was caning and my arms really hurt.
I was like, oh my God, I'm completely fucked. So that was my last VR experience. I don't know about tips to get the best from it.
I think playing in moderation is probably the best thing I can offer on this because I really do think that the Quest and I don't know about PSVR too, but I imagine it's a similar thing. Playing them for about an hour at a time feels right to me. I never really feels right to be playing VR for like four to five hours at a time.
It's not really what it's for to me. It's like you do a little bit of that physical exertion, you have the headset on your face for a while, and then you just want to take it off and maybe wipe away the sweat or whatever, and just allow your eyes to recalibrate to reality. What are your thoughts on this one, Matthew?
Yeah, I'm kind of so similar. The only thing that really gets to me is ones with quite a lot of physical clambering about. When I'm having to move my arms and my head's just moving a lot in the game world, the Horizon one on PSVR 2, that makes me feel truly terrible.
I had to play loads of that for some capture for some stuff at work. When you're like, you've got the time pressure of like, I really need to get through this so I can capture this particular thing, and combined with just the nausea that you have to push through, that was like a super tough hang. My general setup and my solution is that I bought this stupid high stool that I sit on, because I just can't stand up for more than 10 minutes without my back hurting because I'm so fat.
And that stool, whenever guests come around, one of our cats always sits on it and everyone is like, oh, that's nice, you've got a little cat stool. And in my head I'm thinking, no, that's my special lazy throne for VR, but you don't need to know that.
It's so funny though that when you think it is for the cat, it's so funny that moment of like, because you all sat down on an actual chair, Catherine sat down on the sofa, and then there's just this mystery stool, a cat appears there and you're like, oh, I guess that's the cat seat. And it's like, it's pretty funny, I'm not going to lie.
So it's quite a tall chair, right?
You've seen very tall, very tall. Yeah, yeah.
So this cat is like, this cat's probably like above your head.
Exactly. It's a little bit disconcerting. But I see that as a sign of respect from you towards your cat.
So you're like, we treat you as equals here and better than I guess. So yeah, good. That's still, yeah, the VR still, that's pretty funny.
Yeah, okay. So hopefully that was at least partially informative.
It's just tough, isn't it?
It's like my dad used to always get sick from playing first-person games. He just couldn't play them after a certain point. So he used to, one of his great pleasures used to be playing Duke Nukem 3D or Dark Forces.
And then he just, at a certain point, he was like, I just can't play these. I'm getting sick now. So I feel bad for him.
I think some people come back with that with FOV sliders, but I don't really know what the solution is with VR. That's just, like I say, you either get it or you don't. And maybe as headsets become crisper, the resolution improves and the headset becomes more comfortable, it maybe you'll get that experience will improve for people.
At least I hope so. Is your dad's love of the saboteur, is that just like a sort of second best of this will do?
Well, I don't know because he plays the Call of Duty campaigns. I don't know if it's like an old FPS thing. I don't know what his deal is really.
But he only ever really plays games in like small doses. I should say he doesn't just play the saboteur. I mean, I feel like I've set that expectation on this podcast.
He does, he dabbles with other games, but they have to involve World War II and like masculine dudes doing shit in World War II. And the same applies for him with like a lot of his entertainment. If you get a TV show that has that in it, great.
A book, fantastic. Although he also enjoys the Sharp Books by Bernard Cornwell, obviously, because he is a dad.
What about silly World War II? What about like Wolfenstein?
You know what? I don't think he would engage with it because of the zombies and the supernatural element. I don't think he would be into it.
Not all of them have zombies though, do they? It's not really an undead element in the machine games ones, is there?
Yeah, it's got robots.
Yeah, even that might be a bit too silly for him. Like, I don't think it's like a big and glorious bastard's head, for example. I think he's much more like, I need a film that's about like some dudes blowing up one bridge, and that's like his whole deal, basically.
This is good. This is important popcorn. It's good for the real heads like to like learn a little bit more about home lives.
I've thrown them a little bit of Devon, you've thrown them a little bit of your dad's war tastes.
What's weird though, is I'm now getting to the age where my dad was, when he had accumulated a lot of his dad-like hobbies. So watching Sharp was very much a thing he was doing in the 90s, you know, getting into, I don't know, Bravo 2-0 or whatever. And that kind of level of content, gardening, decorating.
And I've engaged with none of that. What's... Why haven't we...
Yeah, but the things that you are into, which feel like a young man's pursuits, like comic books, may be in the eyes of the true young men of today. They're like, oh man, imagine reading comic books, like old grandpa Robert's over here.
I don't know.
What they like is screeching on TikTok.
And playing Final Fantasy feels a bit more like, I don't feel like playing Final Fantasy is the watching sharp on ITV1 equivalent of today.
I think it is. I think, yeah, like playing an MMO, my God. That's very much the in the eyes, maybe.
Anyway, I mean, lots to think about there. Anyway, Bumster, I hope that answers your question.
It absolutely didn't.
Next question then. With the release of Baldur's Gate 3, if it could be any fictional race, what would you be? Deep gnomes, Matthew, obviously.
Also any preference in class? Basically, what would you like to play as in D&D? As some Betamax Bandit.
I feel like we talked about this a little bit. This might have predated our deep gnomes conversation.
I talked about what companion I'd be to stop you romancing me.
Oh yeah, yeah, good times there.
And that's why I was the deep gnome.
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. I don't really know really. We talked about the D&D thing.
I'm a bit like, I don't, you know, it's not something I really know much about. Like, it's like a goblin bard or thing. I've no idea really, but you know.
I don't think I'd play as some like weird creature, which was very different to myself. Like in the game, I'm playing as a monk wood elf, I think. Or maybe a monk half elf, half elf something.
Sounds very vanilla.
I look very humanoid and I punch people a lot. I do a lot of punching in that game and a lot of punching people down holes, which is good. Did I tell you about the thing with Adam Smith's character?
No.
So I used to work with Adam Smith at Rock Paper Shotgun. He obviously left Rock Paper Shotgun to go and work at Larian. He's one of their, I think he's their lead writer now.
He's kind of climbed the ranks there. Very, very smart, brilliant dude. And the way it works at Larian is that each writer takes ownership over a particular companion.
I think that's the same at BioWare and other studios. And so they write all their companion quest lines and all the dialogue for them. The character Adam wrote is one of the evil characters who's quite optional.
If you just follow the normal quest line, you'll meet this person, have to kill them. But if you talk to them, they can enlist you and basically get you to turn on your friends and then they'll be a companion for the rest of the game. So it's actually quite like...
You know, there's a very good chance you won't spend much time with this character at all, who he has written all this stuff for. But when I encountered her in the game, I had this very extreme version of this, where I kind of got into a battle encounter with her before we even had a chance to exchange a word. And the first thing I did was punch her with my monk, who's got like a punches which send people flying.
I just punched her into a bottomless pit and she instantly died. So I just sent him a DM on Twitter to saying, I've just punched all your work down a hole. Like I literally, she didn't say anything to me.
I haven't heard a word of what you wrote from this character. And like, that's part of the brilliance of Baldur's Gate, that they have employed people to write these amazing characters who you are then free to like punch down a hole. He was like, that's okay.
You know, you can kind of go back on the replay in the Lister. Cause like, I promise you, it's really good. But it just made me laugh.
The kind of vindictiveness of rubbing that in his face.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's funny. I'm sure he's getting lots and lots of messages from former colleagues at the moment.
Just being like, oh, I'm doing this with your game and stuff like that. So he'd probably be a good pod guest, wouldn't he?
I'd say I saw him from afar at Gamescom and anyone in a Baldur's Gate 3 dev shirt at Gamescom is just like instant rockstar.
Yeah, I felt like Gamescom was like their victory lap a little bit.
Oh yeah, 100%.
You don't need to sell this game anymore.
Yeah, he rocked up. Actually, Adam rocked up. He was in, when I was playing Space Marine 2.
I think if you worked on Baldur's Gate 3, you can basically go to any booth and they'll show you their game, even if you've not got an appointment.
Right, fair enough. Yeah.
It's like the anti-official Xbox magazine.
Big actively, actively turned away.
Yes.
Space Marine, our Space Marine 2. Have we talked about that in the podcast? Come up, I don't know if we have, have we?
So was that all right? Just very briefly, was that good?
Yeah, it uses the zombie tech from World War Z to have all the Tyranids pile up in like really grim mountains of Tyranids, which is quite cool.
That is pretty cool. All right, cool. Well, I look forward to playing that one.
Look at me saying Tyranids, like I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
I call them Tyranids for ages, and then some of them are Tyranids.
I don't know how I should pronounce it.
I don't know either. I should really know this stuff, to be honest, but anyway. Okay, next question, Matthew, do I read this one?
Yes. All right, S&M, do you ever suffer with choice paralysis with games? I have a big backlog of physical games and a game pass sub, so the options feel a bit overwhelming at times.
Do you ever suffer with this? And if so, what strategies do you have to break out of it?
Oh, boy, do I ever. This is like my life, basically, is choice paralysis for what games to play. And this podcast sets the terms of them to some extent, which helps because it's like, I know we have a podcast on this at a certain point.
I know I need to have played these before the end of the year. But to be honest, the main thing I would suggest is that just follow your instincts and do random bullshit. Because that's how I ended up playing Pikmin 4 when I had a Final Fantasy and a Zelda to play.
I was just like, I need to just not think about the weight of these 60 plus hour games and I need to just play something else. I just need to chuck some blue Pikmin to their death for like 20 hours. And that's what I did.
So yeah, that's, I really do think you've just got to like, you just got to like follow your instinct down the different sort of like rabbit holes it takes you and you'll find things you like instead of playing things you feel like you're obliged to play. And yeah, again, like that's how I ended up playing Dredge, it's how I ended up playing My House. I've got bigger games I need to be playing, but I just thought the idea takes my fancy.
I want to give this a go. And I've been having some of my best game experiences of the year doing that rather than feeling like, you know, I need to get the most out of my game pass subscription or whatever, because I know I can always come back to that stuff. So I suppose that's my tip is yeah, just sort of like follow your nose a little bit.
What do you think Matthew?
Yeah, I definitely don't get this with physical games. Like if I buy a game, if I actually go out and spend money, that's all the motivation I need to, you know, at least give it a decent chunk of time to see if I like it. Game pass though, yeah, it is tricky.
I mean, occasionally just have evenings where I'll play like an hour of lots of different things. It's like, you've got an hour to impress me, which maybe isn't a very fair way to play some games. Like they're gonna need time to bed in or they don't put their best foot forward.
But that also reveals some pleasant surprises to you. Yeah, it's not a very satisfying answer, is it? It's tricky, but it is tricky.
For context, Matthew didn't have the questions for this episode until like two minutes before we recorded the podcast. So it's just like me going, yeah, you were right, that is a problem. Game pass is like having an endless sort of like demo disc for like official PlayStation magazine or Xbox magazine in the noughties.
It's like, what if you had an endless array of stuff and you played them all for like 30 minutes to an hour? Now, some of them will stick and that's kind of amazing, but the experience is not unlike that, I would say. It's like, oh, I've got a little selection box of things to dip into, you know?
So imagine being a teenager now though.
Yeah, good and bad though, because there's just so much stuff fighting for your attention, whereas it felt manageable in the nineties and noughties.
Yeah, also the world will probably be on fire by the time you're like 80.
Oh, we're back to that, are we?
Well, we'll have just avoided that, I think.
Yeah, maybe just by the skin of our teeth, but younger generations will hate us for not solving it, basically, and instead arguing about fucking ULEZ or whatever.
Yeah, but they'll be able to look back and go, but man, we had the ultimate version of demo discs in Game Boy. And went at the perfect, at the time where we had time to enjoy these things, since we were teenagers, except.
Well, the key thing as well is the games are obviously much longer now. So it would actually be more manageable if we didn't have to contest with five to 10 games that are 60 hours plus a year. When we did the 360 drive, the thing that stood out was, there would be one or two games a year that were that long, but you could fire through a sort of dead space and fable and Mirror's Edge and probably all capture that all within about 50 hours.
You know what I mean? You had less bang for your buck, but that was arguably better for you in terms of the amount you were able to sort of absorb playing games and yeah, yeah. So it's not just a volume problem, it's how fucking long the games are.
Okay, this next podcast, this next, oh sorry.
Coy is on our Discord and goes to the cinema loads, right?
Yeah, he does, yeah. I think so.
Let's just go to the cinema less. That's your problem.
Well, you go to the cinema plenty.
Yeah, but he goes way more with me. That's life advice. What you are is a film fan, my friend, not a game fan.
This is turning into something very different and twisted sort of Agony Arn situation. Okay, this next question.
This is when I had time to prep.
Fair enough. Okay, Dear Sam and Matthew, listening to your interview episodes, you often get a really interesting tour of the guests' early gaming experiences and career. I find myself wishing for a similar tour of your own early journeys with gaming.
And I can piece it together from previous episodes. So my question is, have you ever participated in another podcast where you gave such a tour of your gaming journey I can listen to? Personally, I'd love to see both of you as guests on Simon Parkins, My Perfect Console podcast.
Best regards. Oh, there's a joke there.
He's pretending that he's Simon writing to us.
Yeah, that's from R-Space. We're not really famous enough to be in this podcast.
So he's pretending to be from Simon Parkins, but it's actually from someone called R-Space.
Yeah, we're not really famous enough to go on Simon's podcast.
No, that would be like, that's got like, in like five years from now, and he's really done everyone else in his contact book. And he's like, is these guys?
Someone did point out in response, and both myself and Matthew have been on the Final Games podcast, which is quite a lot like Simon's podcast beforehand. It was hosted by Liam Edwards, who is now an indie developer, and we both talked about our Desert Island games on that. I would probably change my choices quite substantially if I did that again.
I would say that of our podcast, probably the one that's probably got the most meat on the bones would be that Excel podcast we did on 16-bit games, Matthew, because that had really far back early memories of game stuff, right? Stuff we've never talked about before, and it was actually quite a good little pod that one. I think I talked about that, my trumpet anecdote on that one.
It was a good time. What about you, Matthew?
It would be super self-indulgent, but they were really desperate. If you were sick and you can't do an episode, and I've got the mic to myself, I'd probably get my brother on just to litigate all the anecdotes I've told through this whole podcast project about our life, just to see how much of it I actually, because my brother's got a much better memory than me. So I'd like to tour it with someone who actually remembers it.
He's debunked a few of your anecdotes as well, which was really funny. He's a great laugh as well, Alex. That'd be really fun to have him on, I think, at some point.
Okay. So anything else to add on that one, Matthew?
We'll do an episode where we have my brother on and your dad on.
I don't want my dad on the podcast. I'd like, no, just no. I said to him, I was expecting him to go, oh, wow, when they announce the Dark Forces remaster they're doing, no response.
That's so typically him. Usually, if I tell him something like that, he'll tell me an anecdote that's only partially related to it. I'm surprised he can come back to me and go, oh, I got stuck in that sewer level for ages when I played that game.
It's like, yes, dad, I was there. That's the kind of situation I normally get into with him. Next question, Matthew, do you want to read this one?
Yeah, from the sublime to the ridiculous. If you were a filled egg, what filling would you have and what kind of animal would lay you?
Yeah, I've been stripping out too many of the bullshit questions in the Discord, and people have been complaining that I'm neglecting them, and it's fair enough. So we haven't had a Yushinaka question for a while, probably because he's in jail. He's not really in jail.
He just got tried for a crime and found guilty. If you're a filled egg, I think I would probably contain salted caramel, or, you know, like, sort of like...
That kind of egg?
Well, filled egg, right? It's not like, you know...
I don't really know what a filled egg is.
Well, like a cream egg is a filled egg, right?
Like a chocolate egg. He's not talking about... Right, I was thinking like a scotch egg.
Well, yeah, I thought you meant like, what if I was a chicken situation? But I don't think it's that. Yeah, so salted caramel, or something much more cursed, like the fatty rind on like a pork chop, like that would be inside my egg.
You bite into it and then you just be like, you recoil in horror, essentially.
Would it be more cursed to be a drink inside a filled egg?
Oh, what, like Fanta or something?
You punch a hole in it. Yeah, so you've got like a chocolate shell. You punch a hole in it and then you just, like a coconut, you drink Rio from inside.
Yeah, that would be pretty disgusting because those things shouldn't really be mixed together. But I don't think I can get more cursed than my fatty rind idea.
Yeah, that is really unpleasant.
And it just spills out when you like crack the top of it. Really grim stuff.
I would imagine a pig would lay that, right?
Yeah, so, okay. So me as a filled egg of fatty rind laid by a pig. Great, great job, listers.
What have you got, Matthew?
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, I'm a chocolate egg filled with tropical Rio. And what laser? I mean, that's just, I mean.
Only a robot could make that.
Well, Rio would suggest some kind of like jungle animal, wouldn't it? Like a fucking.
Snake.
Yeah, okay, fine, snake. I was about to say gorilla and I was like, they don't lay eggs.
Lay a disgusting Rio filled egg.
Yeah, a very like a dubious giraffe egg, which can't possibly exist, so yeah.
There you go, Melma. Hope you enjoyed that answer.
Oh, bloody hell, sweaty job that one. Okay, after the success of Power Wash Simulator, which Monday in job would make a great video game, that's from Welsh Boy Mick. Do you know what?
I remember getting very excited about the idea of Paperboy 64. That's how they did Paperboy 64? I feel like it is, Matthew.
Yeah, it rings a bell.
Yeah, I remember just being some kind of 3D revival of Paperboy and I think it was just because when I was about 11 or 12 reading about that in Games Master or wherever, the idea of being a paperboy seemed very exotic and exciting to me. Then I became a paperboy and it was quite mundane. And yeah, so what can I say?
But I don't know, something like that might be good. Power Stimulator was like a very impressive version of that type of thing and the amount of longevity they've got out of it by doing collaborations with Warhammer and sort of like Final Fantasy and all kinds of stuff is pretty impressive. But yeah, I don't know.
Paperboy weirdly jumps out to me as something that's still kind of exciting. I like that mini-gaming bully where you're a paperboy I think that's pretty cool, getting chased by the dog. Yeah, why not?
What about you, Matthew?
It would be the paint mixing machine at home base. Because it's got like a nice interface that you can interact with. It's got like the physicality of like getting the right pot of paint.
But there's a lot of things that can go wrong. There's a lot of variables, which I think makes for the kind of the skill of the game. You know, like someone tells you the situation that they want the paint mixed for, and then you have to go like, well, okay, that's gonna be a bathroom.
So we probably want like, you know, a matte paint that isn't too kind of glossy when the sun comes through, you know, that's gonna be bad. So like, you know, there's almost like a verbal stage where they're telling you the thing and you're working out exactly what they need. And then there's the physical, like putting the paint machine in, typing all the buttons in, maybe the using the paint matching technology that they have.
You know, they used to have that Dulux, I can't remember, they used to call it. The adverts were like, you bring in a sample of something, we'll scan it and then we'll make that color for you. So people bring you all these like weird objects that you have to get into the machine.
And then, you know, there's restocking the paint swatches. That's fun.
I think you should just go and do this job in real life because it would clearly bring you lots of joy.
I've done my time on this. I was never happier at home base than when on the paint mix.
I was never happier at home base at the start of a sentence. Yeah, okay.
Not in my life. I mean, as a life experience, quite low down the ladder, but.
Better or worse than working on OXM post relaunch, Matthew.
I would still take OXM then.
That's good. You have to think about it though.
Yeah. The worst thing about that machine, the kind of, you know, you bring it, we'll match it. It's the advert on TV.
You know, you had a lot of cute things where someone would, you know, like steal a weird ornament from someone's house because it had a fleck of color on it. And actually the amount of color, you needed quite a substantial amount of it for the scanner to work. And also it had to be flat.
So if anyone did bring you something weird, like a toy car or a fucking plate or something, you're like, well, I'm not gonna be able to get this in the machine. Like you've watched the advert and taken it too literally. Like what it's actually about is like matching to wallpaper.
That's what you really want is someone to bring you a bit of wallpaper to put in the machine. And then more often than not, the machine would like wig out, would see multiple colors and just merge them together and just give you brown every single time. It'd be like, you're looking for brown.
And you're like, no, no, they're not looking for brown. So what you do is while the machine was doing it, you'd go, why don't you look at the color swatches and see if you can pick the closest match to what you think it is. And then they'd pick something and you'd go, yeah, it was that.
Well, okay, it was red.
It's like, that's it. You've got the perfect eye. That's exactly what the machine suggested.
Yeah, orange. Oh wow, I didn't think of that one. Yeah, that's sort of fine.
Well, amazing. Well, for that person who asked, is there a podcast that's just about like your entire life up until this point, we've just filled in another chapter of Matthew's life there, so lots of granular detail to enjoy. So that is a computer game basically, Matthew, is that what we're saying?
Yeah.
I like that our lives are basically like, you know the screen of her story where you can see all the different clips that you've collected so far and you're like, you've unlocked 12% of my life story and now the little bit about paint mixing is filled in.
Yeah, cross fading my man boobs with another shot of my man boobs, kind of like me walking around my flat topless basically. Sorry, I don't know how I got down this road. Okay, whose turn is it next?
Is it you or me, I can't remember.
Hello gents. If you could take one thing out of any game and put it into every game ever made to make those games better, what would it be and why? Can be anything, a gimmick, Marius double chops, a particular weapon, et cetera.
I wouldn't want this to be in every game because, that's a curse. Yeah, again, I don't know if you should put, what remains of Edith Finch would benefit from Just Cause's grappling hook? You know what I mean?
Those things may not be, well, you never know actually, it's that fish sequence, you could grapple some of the fish together, I guess. Yeah, I would-
That baby could have got out of the bar.
Oh gosh, spoiler alert. So yeah, I would say probably that, actually, because it's the kind of like the noise it used to make when you would snap those two, you snap two objects together using that grappling hook. And then the little sort of like metallic sound that would happen when you sort of like activated it to basically pull the two objects together.
That sort of like mechanic in Just Cause was just really, really cool. Well, it was just, the applications of it were reasonably limited in the end. You were basically just strapping explosive barrels to vehicles and that sort of thing.
But the act of doing it always felt really good. Like they got the feedback right for that one. So that's the thing I probably think about the most is like, yeah, just the mechanic that's stuck in my head after all this time where I'm like, yeah, you know, just attaching two things together, just fun, fun in the game.
What about you, Matthew?
Just got this demented image of immortality, except in one of the clips, she just does a double jump out of nowhere. And then it's like, what the fuck?
Yeah, she's got like the BFG from Doom or whatever. So yeah, just makes no sense at all.
But you have to do it. That's the concept of the question.
Yeah, true.
Oh, it's very difficult.
Remember, it's not actually gonna happen, Matthew. It's just, you just got to like-
This is something I would, you know, I could have prepped a hilarious answer. What do I like in games? What's good, but what I'll take, I'll take the writing of Ace Attorney.
I'll take Shootakumi's writing, and he's now responsible for all games. So all games are written in that same tone, whatever their subject matter.
But he's extremely tired now. That's like his, because he's had to rewrite every game.
He's had to rewrite every game. You're not allowed to play another game until it's been through the process. He's there, and it's a bit like, we know in Xbox, we're proud to pronounce these five games are now backwards compatible.
It's like, we're proud to announce these five games are now shoe, shoe penned. And he's just like, oh God, and he's like, what's next? And they're like, oh, bad luck, it's.
Red Alert, you know.
And that's easy. It's more like, oh, you've got to rewrite Dragon Age, and you're like, oh, Christ, that's gonna take a long time.
I don't know, Red Alert would be quite demanding. It's like, oh yeah, if something smells, it's usually Joseph Starland, you know what I mean?
It's gonna be tough for him in there, you know what I mean? I'm gonna refine my point. I want specifically that junk in every game ever.
Sorry to like-
Just if something smells, it's usually, and then it has to be something in your game.
I'm sorry that that's the only bit of Ace Attorney writing I could pull out of thin air, but here we are. We got the most Matthew Castle on forever. Shoot Akumi rewriting every game.
Okay, it's a beautiful day in the Discord. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and Samuel's smiling possibly because he's banished. Games have actually chatted to its own channel.
That happened a little while ago. It was very dramatic in the Discord. If you two could banish, each banish one topic, gaming or not, from all discourse news and media, to somewhere you need never see it again, what topic would you pick?
Love the pod, 177 episodes including Patreon stuff and still going strong, some balladeer. Matthew, what would you ban from all discussion?
The Activision Xbox deal, just very, very boring. And it's just surrounded by unpleasant characters. So that's why, that's what I don't want to hear.
I don't want to hear the kind of Twitter commentary at doing their things. I also don't want to hear like, you know, you get those like, there's that kind of weird Activision sort of pit bull PR person who's always giving everyone grief on Twitter. I'm like, no thanks, not for me.
So, for me, all fanboy content really, if I could like purge people saying, I don't know, PlayStation or Xbox, this or that, because I think that stuff has been weirdly legitimized.
I feel like a little part of me dies with that conversation too though. Like I've got a little bit of fanboy-ishness in me.
I don't, I don't though. I really don't. I'm completely objective.
I just go where the good games are.
I'm completely objective.
Well, I am about hardware manufacturers because I don't really care who makes the hardware as long as they're responsible hardware, they're responsible platform holders and they have good games on them. That is all I care about. I don't put Sony ahead of Microsoft or Nintendo ahead of Microsoft or Microsoft ahead of Sony.
I don't care about any of that. Honestly, I have no investment in that whatsoever. I don't care who wins.
I want all of them to stay in business because it's good for me as a player, but I don't care who wins. And if I could never have to hear about it again, I'd be very happy. People who align their identities with that stuff, I would purge from the internet.
Yeah, yeah. I realize I do sound ridiculous saying I'm completely objective. Just about that one thing.
Everything else, I'm subjective about everything. So, yeah. Do you want to read out this last one, Matthew?
Dear Samuel and Matthew, I recently visited Uncharted Lost Legacy and found myself marvelling at many of the sites. What are some of the games that stand out to you in terms of grand vistas? Yours, Blinky.
Yeah, so obviously open world games are really obvious fit for this. You know, obviously Zelda does incredibly well and Ghost of Tsushima, pretty much anything you can name. Cinematic Sony games like Last of Us Part II, incredible bringing those worlds to life.
I guess like slightly less obviously Final Fantasy XIII is a game of amazing vistas that you experience from inside a corridor, but they are extraordinary vistas. That's kind of like the point of why you're in a corridor, I think, is just to kind of like marvel at the amazing surroundings they've built you. These, you know, sci-fi cityscapes or sort of like gorgeous, fantastical, you know, sort of like natural land masses and things like that.
I would also throw in Destiny, Matthew. I think Destiny's got some amazing sort of like sci-fi book cover style stuff that you can just sort of enjoy from afar while you're popping lots of aliens off. Obviously, you know, Destiny might not be your sort of thing, but you can't deny that Bungie's got amazing artists that bring this stuff to life.
So yeah, a few examples from you there, Matthew. What about you?
Yes.
Even Mario Kart's got good vistas, you know?
Everything's got good vistas these days.
It's basically like, it has to be a USP of your game now.
Yeah.
I really liked how they kind of sell the kind of space beyond the playing space in Star Wars Jedi Survivor. I thought that was nice. That had some good Star Wars-y sights you could stare out.
I thought that was cool.
Some you could eventually go to.
Yeah, well, that was what was cool about that. You were like, is that just background or is that actually in the game? You're just going to have to accept that underpowered answer from me, I'm afraid.
And on that note, the podcast comes to a close. So we will keep working through those questions.
What a disappointing ending. I couldn't think of a vista.
That's cool. Have you got any more anecdotes about sort of comedy macro science in beer and Devon, Matthew?
Because I can whip those out when they don't have a good answer. It's like, instead I'll just, I'll give you a little bit more completion rate of my her story back story.
Yeah. You know, just like 45 more minutes on working in home base, basically.
That's a lot of home base material.
I've got some one stopper material we can trade at some point. But yeah, that'll be exciting for the listeners, no doubt. So as mentioned, DS draft next week.
Hopefully Matthew will feel a bit better by then. Although he has somehow recorded two hours of podcasts with me on a weeknight. This is not aiding your recovery at all, pal.
It's terrible, really. So go eat some dinner after this. You can follow the podcast The Back Page: Pod on Twitter.
We're also in Blue Sky now, Back Page: Pod and Blue Sky as well. I've set up an account on there. No idea if Matthew is using Blue Sky yet, but either way, I've given him a code.
So yeah, we're on there and you can support the podcast, patreon.com/backpagepod. Let's hear a podcast on gaming prisons and doing an escape room this month, then that's the place to go. Also some more Asian crime fiction that we'll talk about on there.
Should be fun. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
MrBazzill underscore Pesto.
Let's get out of here, see you next week, goodbye.
Bye-bye.
