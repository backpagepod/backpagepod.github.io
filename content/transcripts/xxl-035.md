Hello and welcome to the Backpage XXL, a Patreon-exclusive episode of the Backpage

podcast i'm samuel robertson joined as ever by matthew castle hello hello matthew another

interesting situation where my little brother is staying with me this weekend and i filed him off

in into my bedroom just to hang out and play a switch or whatever while we record a podcast so

it says a boy sitting like within 15 meters of you i mean a 26 year old man sitting within 15

meters of you yeah but it's like because i'm 11 years old with him there is a bit of an age gap

so I'm a bit like he kind of gets filed away basically while I record episodes it feels it

feels slightly cruel but I'm also like well it's it's quite nice but it's just a bit an unusual

situation to to make a podcast while a sibling has been locked away essentially so that's I feel

like there's a race against time to get this episode done to release your brother from the oxygen

dwindling room no it's okay he's got access to a window and stuff he's not in a cupboard or anything

it's not gotten that bad um but yeah it's quite a an odd time to record a podcast this is late on

a friday for us so you're listening to this on the tuesday and uh yeah we um i just ate a chateau

briand because it's with my brother because it's my birthday as we're recording this so that's um

that's a bit novel and i've had like a third of a bottle of wine so it's an interesting mindset

with which to come into the um the episode matthew just got an invite to play um marathon the alpha

of marathon from um phil savage on pc gamer who get them sent me some kind of sign up thing i don't

know if there's an nda there i don't think there is did they drop no i think it's an open thing

yeah yeah i like that he's just trying to pull you into what is probably going to be his next sickness

well people seem pretty positive on it from their impressions it certainly looks nice and i thought

it's a shiny thing to play on pc talk about what we've been playing episodes seem like a good call

you know how are you doing anyway how's your how's your week been matthew you're right it's been good

I uh speaking of fancy meals I uh cashed in some birthday vouchers yesterday to go to the

Beckford canteen in Bath oh I know the place yeah yeah really nice but I I committed a bit of a faux

par uh well I say faux pas I ran into a culinary situation which I hadn't ever had before so I had

soul for the first time ever I've never had soul before the fish that's a it's a pretty normal fish

though right it's just a white fish right yeah but it's very bony right yeah okay yeah yeah and i

i've only ever eaten like fillets of like i've never really eaten a fish which has still like

got its skeletal structure within it uh and i literally like didn't know how to cope with this

fucking dish like right i put in a mouthful and it was just full of bones and i was like what the

fuck has happened here and i i was having to look around the restaurant at other people eating it

to just get like tips from how you how do you eat a soul if you look up online how to eat soul

like there are youtube videos and seo articles it is enough of a thing that people have have done that

for it i just realized that age 40 i just didn't know how to eat the food that was in front of me

and ended up picking it off the bones very carefully whereas i watched a video later it

said you should basically score it along the spine and then sort of flip the fish off the bones in

one smooth move it's not a fucking anime it makes it sound like you're doing all kinds of you know

sort of quite exotic weaponry based attacks that's how these videos made it look and that these

articles made it sound where i i really struggled through it and it it was an amazing meal i don't

get me wrong it was all very delicious but the bone incident and the realization that i didn't know

how to eat actually i can file that under the same kind of embarrassment that i felt from seeing people

today scoff at the notion that i don't know what a damson is or i hadn't had a damson until it

shattered my fucking gob last week um people have people have took the wrong bit of that anecdote

away you know i feel like you're forever eating foods where you you're not totally sure what the

contents are then somehow the contents inside create some sort of like situation for you you

That seems to be a thing with you.

I don't know.

It's unlucky.

The foods I've got, I've got like bad inner food RNG.

I keep pulling.

Like, what was it last time?

It was a stone that shattered your teeth.

This time I had to swallow a load of bones because I felt awkward about spitting them out on a plate in a nice restaurant.

Yeah, or it's mashed potato that's actually apple sauce.

Yeah.

I spent chunk of like going to bedtime last night, lying in bed thinking,

oh, these bones I've swallowed going to like kill me somehow.

So, you know, I'm envious of your Chateaubriand.

Yeah, I mean, that's the Beckford Canteen actually is the place that I was really disappointed

because it replaced the old sushi place that was there.

Yeah.

That died during the pandemic.

that was a source of a fairly legendary complaint that was um that was refuted or at least countered

by nathan brown formerly of edge magazine who um when i said that there were too many people bringing

their children to have sushi and they were they all had names like toby or whatever or tobias

and um obviously just too young to appreciate it it seemed like a waste and his point was like yeah

but adults like going for nice food and you have to take your children when you go to the restaurant

You can't just leave them at McDonald's or whatever, which is a completely fair point.

But yeah, I'd miss that sushi place because I don't think Barth has really got loads of good options for that sort of thing now.

Hondo?

Yeah, that is true, actually.

I did go there for the first time recently and had the katsu curry, which I thought was just okay, to be honest.

Oh, I quite like it.

It's the centerpiece of my Hondo Google review.

Fair enough.

Maybe I should give it another shot.

Oh, man.

It was certainly filling.

it's a pretty popular place and they had um quite a lot of seating i thought they had like loads of

seating that i think i realized there's a big mirror at the back and it was actually just um right just

seemed twice as big as it was you don't need to know that detail listeners but anyway i did go there

um and it was yeah it was it was all right but maybe next time i should just try the sushi give it

a go yeah catherine always has they like to serve the sushi on like they do like a bridge of sushi

and it's a little wooden bridge model covered in sushi that's a good a good format for uh for sushi

i appreciate that um there was something i was going to mention to you that was it it was the um

the uh episode we just did well down quite well didn't it the blueprints chat i knew people would

like that that you know we just do a podcast segment you're like i think that's got the juice

or the sauce matthew people seem to really click with it or at least they seem to find it quite a

lot of themselves in either your experience or my experience with it is that how you found that

that kind of response as well yeah i know i was feeling a little bit awkward about it not like the

quality of the chat which i thought was good but i when you're talking about something when you're

aware that there's so much more of it that you haven't seen and kind of passing any kind of

judgment on it or saying like this thing seemed irrelevant and then i was living in fear of loads

of people coming out of the woodwork and saying oh well actually that thing you deemed irrelevant

is the core to the hour 80 mystery or whatever and i was like uh so there might still be a bit of that

but if people do feel that way they've been you know quite gracious about it yeah i think so i

think it's just more honestly reflects it i did get two dms one of which was from joe scrabbles and

the other of which was from uh a friend of ours at capcom matthew i'll just say that um about uh

that isn't code for shooter kimi listeners just to be very clear about that yeah um i'm not being

coy because it's cool well it is cool but it's not it is cool he's a he's a cool guy but yeah it's um

yeah it was just really funny to hear i think because i just i i came across as a bit more

buffoonish i think you're a bit better like guarding yourself and giving takes about it and

i was a bit more wildly emotional and sort of weapons free on the whole thing and mentioning

saying the words kicking you in the balls a lot for example so um yeah it was it was funny to get

two strong responses to that before i'd even like logged on to do work that was that was good

Okay, this XXL episode then, best first episodes of TV shows ever.

Matthew suggested this episode.

I thought it was quite a nice idea.

Matthew, what kind of inspired this for you?

Well, I watch a lot of TV and, yeah, really not much more than that.

I suppose as well, we don't do much in the way of, or at least it's been a long time since

we did any kind of sort of historical TV stuff, you know?

Yeah, I guess the meat of the thinking was I like the XLs or the XXLs

where people come out with a great load of recommendations.

As much as I love the deep dive into three Austin Powers films

or The Right Stuff and another grim space drama that escapes me.

Breads.

You know, you kind of put all your eggs in one basket

where here, you know, there might be 20 baskets.

And I feel kind of better about those odds.

Yeah.

And also pilots, you know, they're quite interesting things.

It's interesting you mentioned the history, though,

because as I was doing my list, I realised that

it's not that it's super modern,

but it definitely, like, the last 20 years dominates.

And it did make me think a little bit about, you know,

how TV culture had changed, that the concept of a pilot,

you know, maybe becomes a bit more important, you know, in those last couple of decades.

Yeah, like a grab everyone out of the gates kind of thing.

Yeah, or just everyone being, I mean, you know, it's just getting a little bit ahead.

But, you know, that sense of, I just think people are tapped more into the nature of like

serialised storytelling on TV. And the idea that the pilot is a kind of a key component of that,

where I think before people maybe had a more casual relationship with TV shows.

And you might not have ever even seen the pilot.

And, you know, we can get into all of that.

Yeah, it's interesting because I think that TV shows

maybe used to have to find themselves a bit more

before they got started because they went on for so long.

They were like, you know, seasons ran for 22 episodes in the US.

In the UK, it's always been lower episode count.

But I feel generally speaking that all of the,

like quite a few 90 shows had to sort of find what their deal was.

Some of them were like they knew what they were at the gate.

and really hit the ground running but i could think of at least a few shows that i like that

didn't really take form until their second season for example right um most of my picks were from

about the same 15 years ago period and then it made me think i was a bit disappointed in myself

i couldn't think of more modern entries because i've watched so many tv shows but for example like

severance is not in this list i don't really remember that pilot episode because it feels

like the lower episode count means that it's a bit a bit flatter the quality of it like it's a bit

more consistent um likewise something like ripley which was my number one tv show last year um or

adolescence this year which is a really good first episode but like for some reason tv shows have

become a bit more consistent and a bit less well whatever happens in the story this week is going

to fuck the whole thing up because serialized drama has sort of yeah flattened it out a bit and short

episode counts mean that they don't need to make as much stuff and therefore it's more likely to be

good does that make sense yeah i think so i think like what a pilot has to kind of impress upon you

now is maybe slightly different to what it had to like 20 years ago it's almost like the pilot of the

concept the pilot concept has sort of gone away in tv a little bit more generally like they used to

make these things in the u.s networks because they were like we'll put them side by side and we'll pick

the best ones basically and they'd even get you know you'd hear stories about how they'd reshoot

pilots and recast certain actors and stuff and redo them and there's at least like um two shows

i can think of where they they weren't happy with the first episode and then picked a different

episode to be the first episode basically yeah i was the original john snow in game of thrones

that's how bad that pilot was oh dear yeah it's sort of there's like um an original version of

willow in like a quite cursed looking cursed looking because of the quality of the film

um like buffy pilot um for example um but just a girl who like never really stars anything else

just a very normal looking girl and then obviously get alison hannigan who's very talented so it's

very strange when you watch it because everyone else is in it i think even like um cordelia's in

it and stuff but it's just right yeah it's like sarah michelle gellard but willow's like it's

completely different girl it's quite strange but yeah i was gonna say like you know another thing i

guess is like the rise of the mini series which doesn't really operate by the same logic as a

traditional tv show because it's kind of 10 episodes and done and they they know the full

arc of it and there's it almost feels like there's less pressure on that first episode

um and likewise with anthologies where basically the first episode of every season is is like a new

pilot for the new iteration of that show they're harder to kind of bring into this yeah i agree with

that like i didn't even consider putting the black mirror pilot in for example um yeah but even like

white lotus or um fargo or something or like a mayor of east town you know like a a sort of a

show that's got um that is a yeah like a mini series has a great plot and you like the show

overall but you wouldn't necessarily just pick it for that one particular thing yeah yeah for some

reason it's a bit more of a trad tv show kind of concern you know i wonder if it's something to do

the star power of like kate winslet in east town or like jodie foster in true detective where you're

like well they're not going to waste this person's time like this person isn't going to suffer the

embarrassment of having their show canceled after one episode so it's kind of like a guarantee that

this thing's going to happen to a certain extent and so it doesn't have to think you know particularly

well not not it doesn't have to think particularly hard it has you know it can do different things

of its pilot whereas some of these other shows on my list a lot of them are like your main

introduction to the person who's going to hold this show for the next you know five to ten years

that's quite like i mean that's that's kind of what excites me the most i guess about pilots is

that moment of holy shit this is a this is a new cool person you know yeah and there are so many tv

shows obviously never get past one season or whatever and like it just shows you how unusual

is to actually get that formula right out the gate so uh i mean that was going to be my first

question to you matthew is what makes a great pilot episode of a tv show i think we've kind of

covered a little bit of it there it's it's a bit of like um it's making sure the setup is so good

that they've kind of locked you in either the setup is so good or the characters are so good

um or the jokes are so good in the case of a comedy that you are your your investment is immediately

bought and then they've kind of they've got you on board and then they just have to not lose you

from that point onwards that's broadly how i consider a pilot episode to be great but what

do you think yeah i'd agree with that you know i'd written down sort of broadly how quickly it can

pull you into a world um characters that you instantly like or have a an appreciation of um

i think it's i mean maybe this is for more specific genres of shows but i quite like a

a balance of sort of hooks for the future but also immediate reward and maybe that's like more of a

concern in the kind of like post lost era where a lot of shows are about like the promise of a payday

down the line you know i want a bit of that absolutely cede my interest in the future but i

also want to get a sense that watching each episode is going to actually give me some like

something now rather than just like watch for next week's episode or you know i don't i don't just

want mystery uh i think sometimes as well certainly when i'm you know because me and catherine we watch

all kinds of shit that we don't carry on with um a lot of the time it's like you're watching something

for a sense of like what its pace is gonna kind of be in you know if you can extrapolate that from

one episode of like oh this is really slow we're not interested or oh this is really quick it seems

you know there's not much risk in in investing in this because it's going to show us so much stuff

so that's that's like another part of it um but this sense that maybe like in older shows or like

pre-serialized drama i think what i was looking for you know in a in a first episode was just a

sense of like here's a format do you enjoy this format will you be happy to see this format 22 times

a season and I'd be like that's enough where actually now I think in the age of serialized

storytelling when tv's maybe like a little bit more novelistic uh you know in its structure

it doesn't have to like you know immediately grit me it just has to set up the the general kind of

promise of a show just make you think it's going to be a thing investing in over time which I didn't

used to think about tv like that at all like when I was a teenager I wasn't watching something going

like oh am I gonna watch this for six seasons well I kind of do think that now I don't know if I've

been burnt by like bad tv over the years um I don't know if you have a sort of similar thing or if

that's just a madness on my part I definitely used to be in that mindset and then got I would say like

definitely some some watch some bad pilots or first seasons or like shows I like got cancelled that was

probably the main factor and then I thought well you gotta fight a bit harder for my time now I might

even wait till the show's been on for like two seasons so and also now shows don't really run for

six seasons right they yeah they all kind of end after about three or four if you're lucky and

you know like mini series is still quite dominant so um i do i definitely agree with the principles

with which you're working there though that does make sense to me you know do any kind of examples

come to mind of shows that didn't earn that out the gates and you were like well fuck this i'll

spin it off then anything for the last few years you know a lot of the the marvel and star wars stuff

but I mean that's kind of you know it's a bit like shooting fish in a barrel picking on those shows

um the last thing I gave a try and was horrified by how bad the first episode was and gave up on

doesn't happen often now because I feel like a lot of things that are in that sort of like middle

of that Venn diagram of actually got onto the telly and that I had the I even like was patient

enough to sit and watch it's like um it's quite rare that's that'll end up being 15 shows a year

and I'm quite selective but it was that Avenue 5 HBO Iannucci show with that was a absolute stinker

and oh see also the franchise yeah like why is that guy made like two very toothless unfunny shows

in a row like that actually made me doubt the whole enterprise a little bit because I liked Veep

but I didn't think Veep was as good as other people said it was um even though I watched about

I think I watched four seasons of it, but it never really made me laugh like the thick of it did.

You know, it never quite had the same bite.

But yeah, Avenue Fight was a real stinker.

That's a few years ago now, but it was super bad, you know.

Oh, that was terrible.

That was so bad.

Yeah.

And everyone involved, it should have been amazing.

Yeah, you're right.

Actually, that tends to be comedy stuff.

There's lots of things with Nicole Kidman, because she's in so much TV.

There's like three different shows.

There's like one where she runs this like wellness retreat.

I think it might be called something like like 12 12 strangers or 12 weird strangers or something.

Is it something like nine perfect strangers?

Nine perfect strangers.

There you go.

There was that one.

She she was in that expats.

I think it was called.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, that's right.

Was it Expat?

About the Hong Kong family,

and it was directed by a director who did The Farewell,

which I really liked, that film.

And that was just like a huge, huge bust after one episode.

And then she was in that wedding,

Thrillery One on Netflix.

Nicole Kidman, I don't think it's her particularly.

I think she just makes so much fucking TV

that the odds are stacked against her a bit

that if you're going to dump a show,

she's probably going to be in it.

what about um because i i do agree with you there and that made me think about because she's in that

show lioness right there zoe sardana one and i know you dabbled with taylor sheridan and i feel

like that we have and i feel like that's probably the kind of air that's probably the most likely to

for you to see more inconsistent shows on the air because he's involved in so many of them

yeah and they seem they seem a little bit diminishing returns to me i watched the first

episode of yellowstone i thought it was excellent actually i thought it was a really good bit of

like dadcore tv yeah but i would imagine that the more shows he gets on the air the worse they're

probably getting were any of those sort of a bit i'm not sure about this i've only i think i've only

seen the pilot of yellowstone we actually watched like five or six episodes but there were just

too many people getting shot and dumped in gorges in that show for my liking like if you want to see

people getting murdered and just like it seemed to be a world where you could just murder people

and there were no repercussions as long as you put them in a deep enough gorge and that i thought

was silly uh and i watched the the pilot of the oil one with billy bob thornton landsman landman

yeah landman uh and i didn't think a huge amount of that so he didn't carry on watching that

yeah i don't know i think maybe you've got to be like tapped into his particular universe and thing

that he's going for and if you are you can see like you know there are like different interesting

shades these characters but to me it just felt like oh this is gonna be another another yellow

stone for us so um yeah we didn't continue apologies to him love his films though you know

well that's it but he's he doesn't really make films now that's the thing he that's because he

literally writes like 60 episodes of tv a year yeah and gets paid very well to do it so fair enough

and he can write an entire episode of tv in a day i read in an interview that's how far he just

locks himself in a shed and churns out a season of yellowstone in like two weeks that's crazy well

that's that's why there's diminishing returns i mean the the script for sicario and wind river are

like amazing and yeah you just think oh well this guy's really really talented but i i imagine he

didn't write those scripts in like three days a piece you know i imagine they took a bit more time

so maybe he's like the rancher version of bradley cooper in limitless i also i guess like as well

i think maybe people maybe some people feel a bit more politically complicated about those shows

because it's it's a bit like the whole world they sell is a bit false isn't it it's sort of like that

artificial real america thing that is just in the more conservative batshit age of the us maybe seems

a little bit more appealing to people who live in that part of the world you know and so it's a bit

like i know that's not totally his vibe politically he's quite hard to perceive politically but the

show's a very red state aren't they so you know it's a bit more of an acquired taste um that isn't

that isn't particularly like a problem i had i had with them um i can enjoy you know characters i don't

agree with s craig zala films you enjoy those matthew so uh problematic fave yeah um but yeah

truthfully I can't think of many TV shows recently that have had bad pilots I do agree that the

Marvel and Star Wars shows are examples of you know oh I'm not so sure about this but then I actually

usually find the Marvel shows the pilot episodes are good and then they just get worse from there

they drop off an absolute cliff like Moon Knight for example or Falcon and Winter Soldier you're

like well there's the bones of something here then by episode six you're like thank fuck that's over

basically so um um so can a great TV show have a bad pilot Matthew yeah absolutely because there

are plenty of shows that you know don't get into their groove or unlock something a bit later well

actually maybe i'm thinking more of like rather than bad pilot unexceptional pilot you know like i

don't think you would necessarily call the wire as a masterpiece from that first episode because it

takes a long time for it to establish like the stakes and the characters and that what it's doing

as a television project you know is going to be very multifaceted and take some time

so the idea of like one hour capturing it i actually feel the same way about a lot of hbo

stuff i don't think i've got many or any on my list of best pilots i have none but i can tell you

a show that i i didn't watch the whole thing um but i thought the pilot was amazing which was six

feet under um yeah that's like that's like i agree with you more generally i find that hbo dramas

in fact I was just talking about this with IGN Simon Cardi yesterday about he was like well the

Sopranos pilot is not really an exceptional Sopranos episode and I do remember a bit of that

episode because I remember the bit where Tony and Meda were in that church and he talks about how his

dad didn't know didn't design the church but he knew how to build it like you know it was a I think

it was like a whole thing about the sort of like class he comes from and what he respects about you

know the kind of like world he comes from and his bloodline and stuff the idea of like making

something and that being you know kind of like valuable i remember that conversation but generally

speaking i couldn't even tell you what happens in the wire pilot you know it's not even doesn't

even come to mind i imagine there's a lot of d'angelo barksdale on a couch like thinking is this is this

okay what we're doing is this the life for me you know that kind of thing the main thrust of it is

is McNulty's in court watching a load of Stringer's sub-lieutenants getting let off for like the

the nth time and so he's like well I'm gonna do something about it like really they have the whole

episode it's just him deciding this can't go on I've got to do something I've got I've got to sort

of put together this team somehow um you know which is like is Stringer in the courtroom as well

is it yeah that's right yeah yeah I remember that and there's this there's this sense of like

you know these are gonna be the this is gonna be like the main rivalry but yeah like half the

characters aren't in it you know it takes a good few episodes to just remember who everyone is in

that show and what everyone's relationship like who's in charge of who um before it really beds in

um uh i mean another and this is an hbo but another quite pretty the most famous example of like

bad bad pilot and bad first season that goes on to be a bit of an institution is like the us office

Right, yeah. Yeah, good call.

But then that's, you know, that has a specific problem in that it's like literally a remake of the UK office,

has jokes lifted wholesale from it, and tone of it isn't right, you know,

it becomes the show it's sort of meant to be once they tap into the slightly kind of softer version of it,

you know, the slightly more sentimental side and the kind of the human drama and the silliness.

like it isn't as sort of bitter or sharp a show as the uk where i think the first season is going

for a bit of that and it just doesn't really land like no one's that no one's that comfortable

in that kind of mode also um mega cursed slicked back steve carell hair in that pilot um where it

looks like he's it looks like he's got about half the hair he'll then have in season two um i don't

know if it's like a transplant or just like a bad combed or something but the vibes are off you know

can just tell that something happened in that writer's room because the first episode season

two is like instantly this is a different show and has big laughs and you're like oh this is this is

what this is going to be for the next hundred or whatever episodes yeah it was such a weird like

so i watched season one of that and then didn't watch season two for years because i thought it

was so shit yeah i did give it a go because it was like um it was such a bomb when they showed it

in the UK I remember that I think it's BBC made a big deal about them getting the rights to air it

and then it was so unpopular they ditched it after just those six episodes and then I remember ITV2

picked it up and then showed it at like 11 o'clock on a weeknight or something and I was like wow

that was how people that was how much people hated that first season and then obviously in the UK that

sort of like response to it was heightened because people were already suspicious of British

things being remade by Americans because that's that's just how we are in this country then I

watched those three episodes I remember when the office clicked it was the episode where um because

I thought that I think the Dundees is all right that's the first episode of season two but it's the

one where Michael burns his foot on the George Foreman grill that's like the one where I was like

oh no this is actually this is a good time um and then yeah here's a question do you skip season one

when you re-watch the office because I know you've re-watched the office yeah I've never gone back to

it's just too cursed see also um parks and recreation which goes through the same thing

right there's six episodes that people don't really like and then by season two they've started

to figure out what is clicking about the show and then it sort of gets really good when adam scott

replaces that guy who is in the assassination of jesse james yeah after that it really becomes what

it is but sometimes these things do just take time you know here's one i don't think it's got a bad

pilot but i wasn't it took me like a good couple of episodes before i sort of saw what everyone was

raving about um breaking bad the pilot is quite um because i remember the pilot you does it starts

like shot off the trousers right um as like because he's in the he's in the meth van and then it goes

flashes back to like whatever hours forward right and i remember thinking oh yeah you know it's it's

very much an attention grab because it's brian cranston running around in his pants in the desert

or whatever that's what i remember about that pilot you know yeah i just because i think it

a lot of it and at least how i remember it was just establishing like the sadness of his life

that he was gonna fight against yeah by becoming this this mad drug kingpin but i you know i found

this true of um better call soul as well they were just sort of snowballing shows you know that's

that's vince gilligan's like whole thing is that you know the the full extent of it all the full

brilliance won't reveal itself in the beginning and it's it's all the little consequences adding

up until you know by the end everyone's just like crushed by them in both those shows i think it's

like such a interesting like curve to them yeah for sure i think um i thought breaking bad really

clicked when kristen ritter was in it because that was the point where you got a bit more of the it's

not for horny reasons i should point out but um it's because i think that's when the you got a bit

more of jesse's inner life and i think you need that for that i think you just soften the edges

of that character a bit than what he's like in season one because it's just quite an antagonistic

relationship and then at that point he's got something to lose and obviously that that ends

very well well not well in terms of for the character but like the story is exceptionally

well done you know um okay can a bad tv show have a great pilot matthew uh but shodden to think of

like a really golden example of this have you got one i can think of shows that yes i mean

flash forward for example this made me think about the lost the clone of the clones of lost that came

out in the round the early 2010s yeah i remember flash forward just having this great because

basically it shows you what's going to happen to a bunch of characters and it's side directed by

david goyer it's pretty good and then the whole show is basically like a slow crawl towards the

events that occur in that in that flash forward so it's very much the kind of like the old jj abrams

72 hours earlier thing you get in like every other episode of alias except the entire show was that

and by the time you get to that episode five or six the whole thing's sagging under the weight of

it you know um yeah so yeah that that came to mind i couldn't think of many more i think it is more

often the other way around otherwise i thought things like heroes which was that was a great

first season though not just the pilot yeah yeah um yeah so i don't know it's i think like yeah

there was a time though where they definitely tried to kind of grab people with these high

concept mystery shows had all this like batshit stuff in episode one and then episode two the the

foot comes off the gas and then you just completely zone out from it and then everyone kind of stopped

watching i mean lost was really the only show like that ever went the distance you know so yeah yeah

we've been watching from and we've stuck with that um and that's quite a that's quite a bad hang uh

of a show you know in that it's have you watched any of from i don't know no it's harold perinot right

yeah yeah but it's like it's kind of like horror lost you know it has a lot of the same kind of

dynamics as lost in terms of like the makeup of the group you know it's quite a large community

that you can kind of pick people off and there's you know mystery upon mystery um but there's also

some like really gnarly like monster horror these horrible things come out at night and like

everyone up everyone talks about it it's the show where you drive in to the town at one end and if

at the other end you come back in so it's like a you're trapped in this like looping space rather

than like a a time loop or anything but what they don't really talk about is the fact that at night

all these monsters come out and eat everyone and they're quite scary looking uh you know and the

violence is quite full-on so it's quite a it's quite a weird combo and we sort of push through

three seasons of it so almost in sort of spite of ourselves they've they've said there is an actual

ending you know there is a pre-written ending to this or worse that effect so you know i am kind

of curious what the whole deal is but it does feel like very like mid-season lost at the moment where

you're like oh i just can't be another we crack the code of this thing and it takes us to another

cryptic location it's very blueprints yeah just you're on the nook episode of um of from uh not

ideal you know oh it's the toilet again okay good stuff Matthew let's get to our suggestions then for

these um pilot episodes me and Matthew have about about eight each I don't think we'll get hugely

granular with each one but we'll kind of talk about why each episode was good but I think we

start off with you Matthew because you've got a proper vintage castle pick for for number one here

so I've kicked off with Cheers uh which I guess this sort of feels like the template for any any

good sitcom in that you you just need to establish what the situation is and all the characters are

going to be stuck in that location forever um because sitcoms are kind of like from i guess

you can just never ever leave this space what i like about cheers is characters are absolutely

amazing but it very quickly establishes like the bar culture specifically you know like the the

opening scene is um like sam malone uh having like an interaction with an underage drinker and

you know that's the the dialogue's really zipping between them but you know right from the off you

know it introduces the concept that like loads of different people are going to be coming through

this door and while there are these regular characters it is going to be about this kind of

quite flexible community of people inside this bar and that hooked me in and that's something i've

loved all the way through Cheers it's like the bar is this brilliant constant sort of background and

constantly refreshing itself um but really I mean you know the magic of episode one is that uh Diane

Chambers who is Sam Malone's love interest for the first few seasons um and probably one of the

earliest or certainly most famous will they won't they tv romances you know she comes in the first

episode they hit it off and it's just seeing this like crazy chemistry that's going to carry the show

for the next is it three or four seasons she's in i can't remember but um uh you know that that you

know the fact that he's this sort of like incredibly handsome slight sort of lunk-headed

ex-sportsman she's this uh very very intelligent you know beautiful um academic and you know they're

obviously kind of gonna kind of butt heads over just about everything but uh like establishing

that relationship getting you to buy into it getting you already excited about where that's

going you know all in the spate of what like 22 minutes it's like everything that's ever going to

be good about cheers is in that episode it's yeah it's like an absolute classic to me it's not comedy

that finds its feet over time like it's it's just off to the races it's it's really impressive the

The guy who always directs those pilot episodes is James Burrows, right?

And he's one of those, like, basically TV engineers

who knows exactly how to make the thing, you know?

That seems to be that guy's, like, whole deal

because I think he does the Friends pilot as well.

So he just knows how to...

Yeah, Will and Grace.

Some of the... Big Bang Theory, maybe?

Yeah, worked on Mary Tyler Moore as well.

Yeah, I read his autobiography last year.

Oh, interesting.

just because I wanted all the cheers stuff,

Frasier, I think he directs most of that.

He sort of gets it, and the live studio audience thing,

there is a real sense of performance to it,

and you can see the cast already from episode one,

how well bonded they are and how well-tuned they are to the audience,

letting them break for laughter and not stepping on each other's lines and things.

Yeah, it's just the best version of that for me still.

Yeah, I can totally see that.

I think I might have watched a bunch of that for a previous, maybe because you mentioned

that conversation to me.

Yeah, I think we did this in our favourite TV show episodes.

I mean, there's a lot of crossover with that list and what I've picked here.

Well, that's all right.

There's not like you loads of surprises for me either, which is why I'm going to start with

Mad Men for my first one, Matthew.

Yes.

Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, which is an episode I've probably seen five or six times now because

I've rewatched, I only rewatched Mad Men all the way through once, but I would say I rewatched

the first four seasons or so pretty much every five years and this this is true during the run

of it as well because it's just so good that first opening run of seasons it doesn't get bad in later

seasons it just changes quite a lot and the the mode of it in the first three four is like um just

spot on in terms of the the characters they've they've kind of got around and like what the dynamics

are and i think the first season of madmen is one of just the greatest first seasons ever it's just

all the characters are so well formed out of the gate so much significant stuff happens really early

on in the show um and the interesting thing about this episode is that it kind of basically builds

the myth of don draper and then debunks it and then the whole thing is about you trying to figure

out who this guy is basically because you know that he's like the hot shot um creative ads man

but that he also doesn't have a big idea for Lucky Strike the um uh the tobacco company that and

that's like the whole basically plot that this episode pivots around so you basically see him

stressing about it um and then he does um he does succeed in the pitch but then the final basically

twist of the episode is that you think this guy who you see basically has like a you know a woman

he's like sleeping with in New York and all this stuff and it's Jon Hamm you know in kind of like

a 60s suit just hair slicked back looks like basically a kurt swan drawing of superman um

just like a you know proper all-american looking guy better slicked back hair than uh steve carell

much better much denser hair um and then it basically goes home to his um wife and kids at

the end and then it plays uh that the street where he lives and it's a really like amazing bit of

music and yeah the show just the show is just so certain of what it is out of the gates and then

how it wants to peel back the layers to you of like how how desperate Pete Campbell is in the show

who like Peggy is his assistant that kind of thing and I you know I just started re-watching

this again last last year um didn't continue because more great TV came out as is often the

case but it's all back on Netflix so um got halfway through the first season and every every episode

in that season is just unbelievable they switch focus to like you know to Pete to Roger so well in

those opening episodes and you get such a complete sense of who these characters are and i do weirdly

find it comforting on a rewatch even though it's about people having the existential crisis i find

it quite a warm show because i like the characters so much but yeah and i even remember what you know

watching this at the time in in 2008 when it was first on on bbc in the uk and having this reaction

of wow this is like this it does feel kind of like movie quality even though it's a it's all

basically shot in one office you never really see many exteriors in mad men um but yeah it was

pretty amazing out the gates matthew do you ever do a mad men rewatch well katherine hadn't seen it

she started watching it i actually joined like joined in the rewatch around season three so i

missed that or is it even season four i basically missed all the the first company that they work at

i watched it when they form their own company because i you know i won't lie i kind of i kind

of prefer that that that period of it when they have their own thing but that's just because i like

the drama of them trying to kind of get the business off the ground i'm too invested in the

like the successfulness of the business which i don't think is really what you're meant to care

about in that show as much but for whatever reason that's what tickled me um yeah i i i did really

like this at the time though i was found him like don drape is like such a sort of quite like

challenging character like like but you know based on your own you know what you value as a person

you know your own sort of judgment system i guess you know he can be quite a reprehensible dude and

like not always the best person to spend time with do you think madman becomes more of an ensemble

over time or do you think is that a bad reading of it yeah i think that's true i don't think they

they know that at the start but yeah because characters like um pete's like a major character

in it from the start peggy's a major character and obviously don is um but you don't really get the

that like jones for example christine hendrix character or any of those like um second tier

ad guys like um ken cosgrove and um you know the harry and the other one whose name i can't remember

who they kind of phase out later on but um yeah they is it paul yes paul those guys are all just

sort of like background like one-dimensional dudes and there's even like the occasional character who

is in like one or two scenes and then never turns up again or will pop up again like three seasons

later basically but like all those characters are like background detail and then they kind of come

into focus as the show goes you know yeah and i think maybe like that that's opening up a focus

is where i like really fall in love with it but that isn't say like the earliest stuff's weaker

at all it's just a personal taste thing but yeah i need to go back and re-watch this one because i

have i've only seen this pilot once when it first came out so oh i'd love to hear what you think of

doing this and a rewatch it's so good man it's great with you about don draper but um you know

what he's never boring to look at because he's so damn handsome so uh and so well so well photographed

in this show yeah what's the next bit matthew veronica mars which i mean for me really that

you know this this is that thing i was talking about like when someone turns up that you've never

seen in something and they're just like holy shit amazing from the off and um yeah that's very much

kristin bell in this she's just just so cool and confident and you know was like a late teenager

when this came out whatever you're the perfect age to be like this is just the coolest person in the

world and the fact that she's an outcast so for like a master people haven't seen it it's a it's

like a sort of teenage detective um who is is lives in this very affluent community but is you know

quite poor herself and uh for various plot reasons has been kind of cast out of her social group so

she has to sort of make do with all these sort of sad sacks and sort of losers who she meets in this

first episode and befriends um and they've got a really nice like warm energy to them that group of

people but i i think what what i like you know beyond her is that you kind of join the show like

in the middle of all its drama like all this stuff has happened in her past and because it's going to

be this sort of private eye detective show she's investigating that past and through lots of like

flashbacks and things you kind of learn about who she was and her old life and this old group of people

but you also have like fresh things happening that are pushing the story forwards and it just

you know in terms of of needing loads of juicy hooks this sense of like all this bad shit has

already gone down and more stuff's going to start piling on top of it i just found that really

exciting like i love this as a mystery story i think this is like a really really good bit of

like detective fiction um also though less fanciable uh keith mars her dad uh another just awesome guy

i'd seen in things but in this you're like this this guy's just you know so cool just very sort of

funny you know they made a great pairing um you know just instantly wanted like more more more of

that yeah i feel like um it's a real gif that you get uh keith martin indiana jones is a great circle

yeah doing and like they actually used his likeness as well so you have keith mars next

to harrison ford and i'm like yes this is so my shit basically um uh yeah i i love this from the

off as well i just i was i remember hearing about it as a bit a bit of a grapevine show that hadn't

really taken off in the uk didn't really have a good home but then went and got the dvd and then

just devoured it and yeah it's it's really good at creating this sort of like sun-kissed noir

feel that um it's like way more sophisticated than anything else that was on like the i think it was

on upn it launched um just very much like that cw era of tv you know just yeah you know small

villain is the sort of thing you compare it to and it's for a car miles is much more sophisticated

than that level of show you know um yeah yeah super good okay in that same era matthew that i

think it launched basically the the same time i have to talk about the lost pilot i mean you know

not just because dave picked lost via domus in the um 360 redraft obviously but more just as a

it was a proper sort of bet by abc at the time i remember it was like a 10 million pilot and you'd

read that everywhere and it was i was reported that the executive who took the bet on it lost his job

because he made the bet on it and then it ended up being this like massive show um i think it debuted

with something like 16 million viewers or 18 million something like that it was just huge from the off

and you know they they actually went to hawaii to to film this and they have that very real looking

set they you know cover that beach in like plain debris and it feels really blockbuster and widescreen

in a way that tv wasn't at the time and then you get basically the end of the the pilot is like um

they don't they don't know where the fuck they are they find the pilot played by um greg grunberg our

favorite matthew yeah and says that the his like radar went haywire when they went near the island

and so they were like miles off course and something was dragging them towards the island

and then they're like they don't know what it is and then a smoke monster basically gets him

and then um charlie played by uh dominic monohan goes guys where are we and then that's the kind

of like hook for the whole show um and it was just great shit because it was like the it was

the monoculture we didn't have better things to do than watch lost um and it was a really good way to

sort of get you involved in a bunch of mysteries it's the classic sort of like jj abrams um promise

you something really cool up front then later shit its pants uh approach to making all media

and he has not made a film in six years and you know maybe that makes sense when you think about

how Lost had all these ups and downs but certainly in those in that first instance it was pretty

amazing right yeah absolutely it was kind of agony waiting for this to come out you know I felt like

everyone was talking about it for months before it came out in the UK am I misremembering that

it was it launched in 05 in the UK and it had already been on for like I think four months in the

in the us yeah yeah so like if you if you read kind of any nerd culture site back then like ain't it

cool news or something every other fucking story was like is so and so dead is this the smoke monster

and you're like i don't know what any of that means um so just to untangle that and see what it was all

about um yeah like probably like it's very rare that something can build up this this kind of hype

beforehand because everything releases at the same time now you can't really ride that you know that

wave other than like the sort of pre-publicity that they they used to kind of conjure it up so

going into something knowing that in america everyone was going nuts for this thing and it

was apparently really strange and out there and exciting yeah like i it was fun to experience my

memory of lost is more as a communal it was just the thing everyone was doing for for a few years

rather than necessarily specific beats.

It's not sure I've ever gone back to rewatch

or really had any desire to rewatch

just because it's too tied in with the moment for me

and I'm kind of happy to remember it.

A bit like Goldeneye on N64.

Some things you don't go back to.

It's a bumpy rewatch for sure

because you're so aware of the ups and downs

as you go into it.

So we were rewatching it.

Got to season five

and then when the island starts jumping around

the time frame they're telling the story goes all over the place.

My partner at the time was just like,

I just can't watch this anymore.

It's just, it's just, it's testing me too much.

And she wasn't ultimately that bothered about finding out what happened,

what the island was and all that stuff.

I think she just burned out on the, on them just delaying and delaying,

which is fair enough.

So yeah, I think that's fair enough, Matthew, for you also.

What's your next pick?

My next pick is The Shield.

Have you watched this?

Yeah, I've seen season one of The Shield, yeah.

Okay, well, that's fine.

There's a small spoiler of sorts,

but this was the Sean Ryan TV show

about a group of kind of like a crazy aggressive vice squad

embedded in this Los Angeles police station

who have sort of carte blanche to sort of bring down crime rates

however they see fit.

They're all slightly bent cops,

and it's, you know, ostensibly in this first season

about the kind of battle for power

between the head of this unit, Vic Mackey,

played by Michael Chiklis,

and David Acevedo,

who's like the kind of police chief of the station

and has aspirations at a political career,

so he doesn't want to be associated with like bent cops

or anything like that.

And what I liked about this is just,

on a nuts and bolts episode to episode level,

this was just a really propulsive crime thriller

shot with this sort of handheld style,

So it felt very sort of sweaty and real.

It's kind of training day-esque.

It's a very hot and sweaty LA show

about people getting angry and doing really bad things

in this horrible kind of climate.

And all that was just really exciting to watch.

It establishes this whole police station in this first episode.

You've got this sort of central squad.

I wish I could remember their fucking nickname.

They're not the riot squad.

It's terrible anyway.

And, you know, the slightly more legit cops.

There's this really nerdy detective in it called Dutch Wagenbach,

who I really like as a character.

He's kind of like the anti-Vince McKay.

Fancies himself as a criminal profiler and wants to land, like,

big serial killer cases.

And, you know, individually all their stories are really interesting.

But what I think marks out the pilot,

other than establishing all these great traits which are going to run on,

is that the act it builds up to, which is Vic Mackey kills a member of his team,

who is a mole placed there to try and basically expose him and his dodgy dealings.

And this death, as well as being a shocking moment in the episode,

it completely changes your perception of the character.

He goes from being quite a rough diamond, but sort of fun-feeling guy,

he doesn't seem too dangerous, to like, oh, he's really, really bad news.

So it completely establishes the most extreme depths he'll go to in the pilot.

But also the actual act itself will haunt him all the way to the end of the show.

So maybe it's a great pilot in hindsight, but I do love that literally the inciting incident for everything that's going to follow is kind of here.

And it's ultimately this one thing he does and this sort of mistake he makes.

That's kind of going to be, well, is it going to be his undoing?

You'll have to watch the excellent seasons of The Shield to find out.

Yeah, I thought this was a really great show.

It sort of felt like a tier below HBO.

It's like slightly trashier, but above kind of like, yeah,

your sort of network shows.

It was just very well placed.

It's like very punchy and enjoyable,

but has some sort of real psychology to it as well.

Yeah, it's funny because you never really get another big

Michael Chiklis show after this, right?

It's very much his...

Yeah.

He's not like one of those, you know,

like someone like John Hamm, who's been in so much good stuff or big stuff,

it doesn't feel like people made that same room for Michael Chiklis.

He's a bit more of a, I don't know, he just suits the character so well.

He looks like what that character should look like in this very specific way.

Yeah, it's a weird one.

He turns up in Winning Time, the HBO drama about the LA Lakers.

He's the head of the Boston Celtics.

I still always think of him as well as having a bit of hair in that Seinfeld episode.

he's in the um he's that guy who sort of insists on hanging out with jerry i remember i remember

that about him what was unusual about this show is i don't think i would have predicted that walton

goggins was the the breakout from it um but he obviously because he sort of he he also doesn't

look like a typical leading man really um he's got that kind of like what looks like a permanently

receding hairline and he's just like you know he's a he's a very charming dude as um as you know his

career sort of tells but yeah his character and his vibe in this does not necessarily scream yeah

like he's gonna be a big deal you know um yeah he's kind of like the secret weapon in the show though

in that he's kind of vick mackie's second hand man um shane vendrell and he's he's like quite dumb

like he just goes along with him because he's you know he's he's not incredibly sharp but as it goes

on like the situation he ends up in and like the some of the stuff he goes through and has to do

is so brutal it's actually it's a it's a really great character and i think you come out the other

end going oh that guy's capable of a lot more you know as an actor and it's yeah it's just

interesting to see him in other things now because i forget for years i just thought he was dumb shane

in in the shield um but yeah like probably like the most powerful stuff in the shield is

is like down to him in the last couple of seasons yeah i do i do unfortunately know how this ends

because i know the real i know i know the real thing that inspired the show the show's ending

and it's very um it's certainly an interesting a creative approach they took with it but yeah yeah

you're right it's sort of it's trapped in that sort of hinterland between yeah like network tv and

and something like hbo right it's like when fx made slightly dirtier things you know um so that's

a cool pick i like that um i've seen people on discord chat about that show so um clearly it's

sort of stuck around a little bit yeah and there's a really good like amazon prime i think they did

like a nice wide screen like quite hd version it looks great i watched a little bit before recording

this uh and it's yeah a good way of watching it now all right well my next pick matthew is peep show

um another show i'm sure we talked about before i think this first episode's got everything i think

the first thing that happens in it is that uh mark is chased by kids who um later called him a pedo

um outside his flat but he puts his um hand down on a seat in a bus and um oliver coleman's character

um sophie um sits on his hand and he's too awkward to say anything about it fantastic gag out of the

gates um and then later on he's like uh sat his computer um saying those kids have no idea what

when I'm the Stalingrad, just great stuff.

And then it ends with them chasing those kids

with a metal pole.

And it also has Jez

recording, this is outrageous,

this is contagious. I think this episode's

fucking amazing. And they just

instantly know what

this show is and who these characters are.

It's so, so good. I don't have

loads more to say about it, but when I think about

a show being fully equipped with what it is,

what it's going to be, you know?

I probably laughed as hard as

as I was ever going to laugh at Peep Show in this first episode.

Yeah.

Like, the laughs are that big.

I remember watching it when I got back from work at home base

on a Friday night and being like,

what the hell is this?

And I think I was watching it with my mum and we were all laughing.

I think even back then someone said in the room, like,

oh, you're like that one.

You're like the Mark character.

Obviously they didn't know he was called Mark back then.

They were like, you're like him.

You know, I'd probably gotten home, coming back from home base,

having been tormented in the bus station in a very kind of Corrigan-esque moment.

Yeah.

So yeah, this show's too real, but also too good.

The thing I always thought was too real about Peep Show was when you see Mark wasting a bank

holiday playing Blitzkrieg 2 on PC.

That's an orbital strike on men of a certain generation, I think.

That's, yeah, okay.

So that's Peep Show, Matthew.

What's your next one?

Very quickly on Borgen, everyone's famous favourite Danish political drama.

uh i've you know well one day someone will listen to this podcast and will choose to watch borgen and

they'll enjoy it i swear you'll enjoy it it'll be for sure definitely be cur but not after you

made fun of my damson incident anyway um yeah so the concept of borgen is basically what happens

if you are a lowly kind of nothing of a politician really and then you get thrust into like the highest

sort of position in the land um via a series of not accidents but like very quick political

maneuverings in this first episode um brigitte nyborg um becomes states minister of denmark

and what i like about it is you know again really good characters really good vibe you just like oh

i'm gonna i'm gonna enjoy the kind of world of this show and its take on politics and their

relationship with the media but i think it also establishes like you know there's that old saying

you know that was it like a 24 hours is a long time in politics or a day is a long time in politics

like how quickly power comes to her i think hangs over the rest of this show of like all this can be

taken away just as quickly and it establishes the stakes of like this quite fast moving political

system whether or not that's true to life i have no idea but it is what powers the drama you know

it's not like oh you're locked in for four years so there's four seasons and an election there's

there's constant sort of shifting in seats and the idea could all go away and i just i think that's uh

as a hook for a show a pretty strong one i've followed you down many paths making this podcast

i've not yet dabbled in borgen i think you'd like it it's cool every time you describe it i'm like oh

that does sound cool so um yeah and the first episode's got an awful lot of um old jeff keely

in it like that character's very integral to the beginning of the show so just watch it for that

i feel like people do listen to you in the discord though there's plenty of people who have like

what have read books that you've recommended and stuff but they've they've watched they've

they've read the stuff which has got like murders in it you know stuff which is more traditionally

entertaining it sounds more exciting not many people have made the jump into the the danish

political drama yeah things called like the honjin murders they're like all over that sounds more i

mean murder in the crooked house or borgen what is even a borgen yeah exactly all the multiple

mysteries of honjo whatever it might be um yeah i don't know borgen just needed a slightly more

yeah slightly spicier title but every time you describe it i'm like oh that does sound like a

smart show for adults and um i know you'll bring up old jeff keely and that's um that's okay by me

matthew okay my next pick is um search party which may also be a show i've discussed before i feel

like this is like a big deja vu episode of like oh these are things i talked about three years ago

um pick this because i do this is one of those it's a very weird show where they completely

reinvented what it was each season and then it kind of goes off the boil in a lot of ways i think

you either kind of follow it on that journey or you just sort of spin out with it but i thought

the first season was excellent because it's basically about a millennial played by um alia

shawkat from um rest of development and i may be pronouncing her name incorrectly there so if so i

apologize so basically the character is this millennial in a long-term relationship but quite

in between things and not doesn't have much to kind of like occupy her days and her mind and she

becomes fixated on this girl she used to know who disappears and kind of following the mystery of

what happened to her this girl called Chantal and the show is really good at making it setting it up

to feel like this Twin Peaks-esque what happened to this girl drama and it's got a really good final

hook that leads you into thinking oh well shit I've got to see what happens and and what this is and

then the kind of as it goes on you realize the the mystery is really the main character projecting

because she needs this in her life she needs this thing to be preoccupied with um and it becomes an

incredibly dark show um it definitely takes some turns but i do think the first season was like

pretty pretty outstanding i watched it yeah yeah in a almost like in like i think like two weekends

it's pretty pretty close together and i think maybe i recommended it to you matthew you watched it is

that is that what happened yeah off the back of it i really love those characters i didn't particularly

love where the story took them like they were such a sort of fun interesting bunch and then they had

dark slash goofy at times stuff they had to deal with um we never finished it in the end yeah me

either because i think it maybe changed networks in the us and then it wasn't available in the uk for

a long time it was on channel 4 for a while that's when i watched it and then it yeah it just disappeared

for years i think and then it might have come back onto bbc or something it i've seen it pop up but

yeah the first season was really good it's got good use of ron livingston as well i like ron

livingston he's a pretty pretty underrated actor so yeah um do recommend that show if you're ever

in the mood for something a bit different i've not really seen anything else like it exactly it's

one of the only real examples of a true sort of millennial core show um it feels like people about

our age wrote it and just understand that perspective a little bit more um yeah i did

like it what's your next pick matthew it's uh another oh i've forgotten the actress's name

Alia Shawkat, yeah.

Alia Shawkat, if that is how we're pronouncing her name,

we don't know, apologies.

Arrested Development, which I re-watched a couple of hours ago,

just to refresh my memory of...

Is this as good as I remember?

I think what I like about Arrested Development is more the

seeing its rat-a-tat-tat approach to story structure and joke-telling,

and all that's in episode one.

You kind of really notice the Ron Howard is this narrator

holding this this quite kind of like shaky story together that's going off in all these different

directions and he's sort of stitching it together and i but you know i'm very fond of that format

um i mean really it's like the introduction of 10 kind of all-timer tv comedy characters which is

quite a lot of people to be juggling all at once you know and the show will only go on to add more

people and grow out its kind of comedy universe but just the central family like they're so well

realized all their little journeys and quirks are already in this episode um you know a lot of them

take their first sort of steps towards the kind of characters they're going to become it's really

funny seeing uh michael cera and alia shortcut so young so young you know they look like 12 or

something like it's it's absolutely terrifying to watch you know hearing will arnett's job for the

first time i think still like the best use of him ever like i don't think he's ever been quite quite

on top of it since uh for my money maybe people disagree um but yeah just just really good times

beginnings of jokes which are gonna bounce around for the next three seasons and whatever happens

afterwards so yeah it's really good stuff yeah you know what i never really put season one in my

rotation and when i re-watched it because season one's good a lot of people told me the season one's

season and i'm completely wrong about this um i i mean it's the one that you know because i bought

it on dvd and i re-watched it it was the fastest re-watch i've ever had like i went all through it

and then all through it again and then maybe a couple weeks later again like i watched it over

summer holidays yeah in my student house so like maybe it's more familiarity but that it's the

season i've seen the most um it's really like because it's a very plot heavy sitcom as these

shows go and that's kind of the best thing about it it means it's like a real feeling of momentum

because the story is going so is going somewhere and it it very slowly pieces together what that

plot is over the course of three seasons it's actually very well told i think more generally

but it's my first touch point with the show was like oh yeah i quite like this it's kind of funny

and then on the next rewatch my love of it just doubling and then like watching it again and then

tripling that was the that was the effect of watching it it was wasn't a show you just watch

once there's a lot of uh comedies at that time i would just like watch once and that was kind of

fine like i um like um something like flight of the concords for example i watched it once i was

like oh yeah this is pretty good i like this but the rest of development was something like something

i just lived a bit like peep show i just like i just kind of like lived in it for about a decade

yeah and then it just became yeah like i think it just became a fundamental part of so many like

men's personalities in the noughties you know the weird thing is i learned about this i watched them

review it on news night review after news night and it was like jermaine greer and tom paulin uh

the irish poet um yeah reviewing arrested development in this very like serious highbrow

way and i thought but the clip they showed i think it was of the bit where they're looking at all the

gay pirates on the barge and like the mother says something acidic about oh i think i've got that

blouse and she says oh it looks he looks much better on him i'm just laughing at that and thinking

well i've got to see the rest of whatever this show is you know regardless whether or not jermaine

greer thinks it's funny jermaine greer weighing in on the rest of development is wild that's really

funny that's that was the good thing about news don't review back then before they canned it you

No, they'd be reviewing a sort of ballet or an opera or something at the Tate Modern.

But then you'd also get these sort of Oxford academics reviewing Shrek 2.

And that's great TV.

It was, actually.

I think that was the first time.

Is that because they used to have Mark Kermode on there, right, as well?

Yeah, Hedekesia would be on there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, and I remember just that was my first.

I think that was the first time I was really exposed to, like,

I would say that proper sort of cultural criticism with people being, like,

searingly harsh on things that I thought were quite good.

That was like maybe my first time I ever encountered that, you know?

So, yeah, because they didn't really do video games, did they?

I think you mentioned they did the Wii once.

No, they did the Wii when it came out.

That's it, but generally speaking, they wouldn't like, you know,

I bet Sony pitched really hard to get them to cover Heavy Rain or something,

which I bet Commode would have fucking despised.

So that was, you know, yeah, this was like a show I got.

I've got the DVD for the first season right when I started at Imagine

and then just even though I had no money just picking up each season and being like as soon as

I think it was like the day season three released was that summer and I was like I've got to go

fucking buy that day one basically and then yeah um it's it's so good I feel like I should re-watch

it a few things have made it cursed in recent years but I feel like maybe enough times pass now

they're like I don't know uh maybe maybe when Jeffrey Tambor dies I'll watch it again I don't

know something to think about okay um next up then I've picked the Mandalorian next Matthew

I picked this because I was sort of like

maybe it's because I was watching Andor

and I was thinking about how exciting

Star Wars TV initially seemed

when the pitch was just like

we've made a show like Hercules or Xena

except it's got Star Wars in it

and they launched Disney Plus with it

and everyone agreed it was

pretty enjoyable, no one thought it was like

mold breaking TV, but everyone agreed that

they spent the right amount of money on this

it looks good, it feels like premium

it's exciting, it's fun, it's really

simple to watch and it's over in under 40 minutes and it's got a great theme tune and that was what

the mandalorian was and um this first episode is basically like the reveal of baby yoda and also

has old um werner herzog as well so it's kind of got a lot of the i think like the key ingredients

there from the start and just yeah just like a interesting enigmatic protagonist really simple

storytelling looks really nice just thought it was it was a amazing first episode and they they hooked

the the success basically kicked off the success of an entire streaming service that ultimately

turned out to not be very good but um certainly the first instance that seemed all right maybe

the lesson should be just make one show at a time and not like eight of them you know yes were you a

big uh baby yoda head i can't remember where you where you sort of fell on that i thought that the

fact that it was like a puppet was good like it was it was like i always admire when there's some

off behind it you know just had to admire the sort of like oh some actual like talented people built

this it's not it doesn't feel mega cynical when it's done this well that was how i felt about baby

yoda um i prefer baby yoda to baby groot but i'm definitely over the whole anything like this now

if i'm ever in a charity shop and i see some baby yoda merch i'm like oh yeah that happened didn't

it that's like a real that's a real scar on us culturally um so yes um mandalorian ultimately

didn't end well but you know none of these things ever do do they well maybe they'll knock it out

the park with their um upcoming film with uh jeremy allen white as freaking jabber's son or

whatever it is yeah far the heart or whatever it's yeah it's not ideal all that kind of stuff i just

think again like why does it get so complicated i mean i would have watched like eight seasons of

this show as it was pitched you know it's like oh he's gone to a different town and they've got a

different problem there's some fucking you know one-eyed alien in this big cave they've got to go

kill he's got to go rescue a kid every plot should be like that basically you know what i mean just

we got he's got a thing to solve he's got this little cute sidekick that's the entire show and

it's all it had to be and it immediately became like we've got to weigh this down with so much

bullshit from star wars and they had to just they ruin it like they ruin everything from star wars

basically matthew so um that's that one uh what's what's your next one my next one is my most recent

uh pick on this list which is paradise um currently streaming on disney plus uh show stars

sterling k brown as a bodyguard to the president played by james marsden who if you've seen the

trailers you'll know that the president is murdered in the first episode and this bodyguard

is investigating what's going on.

Annoyingly, can't really talk about

what makes this pilot good without spoiling it.

Did you ever watch this?

I watched this whole pilot, yeah.

And I've got to say, it felt very throwback

to the days of the lost kind of pilot.

It did, but I've almost picked it as an inclusion.

Like, I don't think the subsequent season was bad.

It had a couple of amazing episodes,

again, which I can't spoil for plot reasons.

I feel this is just too fresh to completely kind of rip that bandage off.

But yeah, I guess so.

It's sort of like, it's funny though,

because it's actually conceptually quite similar to a lot of shows

that have been around in recent years, isn't it?

It is, but I like the reveal.

Like, the end of the, you know,

if one purpose of a pilot is to get you hankering to watch the next episode,

this did, if only by dropping a load of information

about the world they were living in right at the end of the episode.

Yeah.

And it's almost like it's the crudest version of a successful pilot,

but it is a success nonetheless,

because I went on to Twitter and went,

well, I want to see the next episode now,

not realising that they'd released two episodes at launch.

So I look like a big old idiot.

Tough.

It's just like, why didn't you watch it?

And you're like, okay, yes, that is a very valid response to that tweet.

yeah i i mean like as an actual show and you know the actual like if this show didn't go where it

goes and it was just this this guy investigating this president i'm not sure that these two characters

as charming as they are and i like their interactions and their their like tone of voice

and everything you know i'm not saying that's that's like a pilot for the ages i'm not saying

like holy shit you've got to see the pairing of sterling k brown james marsden but i do think the

the kind of reveal of what the show's actually going to be about is quite a cool tv moment um

or a cooler tv moment i've had in the last few years yeah i am i there's definitely things i

liked about this it's funny because the twist i thought was quite i was quite wary of the twist

in the same way that i was a lot of these shows like flash forward in the event that were here's

the big splashy pilot and then right right don't don't quite live up to it or revolution do you

remember that one Matthew? Oh so the one where there's no electricity. Yeah that's right so

but I suppose the difference was I was like well I really like Sterling K. Brown I really like James

Marston. People you know what Dave Scarborough out on Sterling K. Brown he was like I think he does

the same thing in everything he's in this very emotionally raw over intense performance I'm like

but it's a really good mode you know what I mean like I. Oh but no one does watery eyes better than

him. I really rate him as yeah he's great in um American fiction for example he's like. Oh

yeah yeah so much to it i whenever he turns up in something i'm like oh damn i always want to

see this guy and more stuff this is interesting i think this is where our tv tastes diverge a little

bit like you're a much more curious tv viewer than me i think you would watch that and be like

oh yeah here we go whereas i got to the end of the first episode of silo for example and i was like

i think i get this and i'm i'm good you know what i mean like i i wish it well you know if i get a

whiff of uh you know an obnoxious mystery being dangled in front of me like that is normal that

normally a turn off and i know that's exactly what this is doing it's more that uh and now sadly an

experience i've robbed of our xxl listeners i didn't know it was going to be like a twist show and i

don't think it announces itself as such like i do think you because because the central because the

first 40 minutes of the episode are a mystery you know you're like oh this is a mystery show and it's

just about a different mystery and that's that's that's the switcheroo i quite like it's not like

it's a rom-com and it became a horror it was just a mystery that switched into a slightly different

mystery and you know with my fiction taste that's bound to appeal yeah that makes sense okay well

that's um i don't think that's too much of a spoiler if anything it'll probably like you know

people who are maybe a bit on the fence about watching it might be tempted to see what the deal

is so um i think that's all right matthew okay my next one is 30 rock matthew which we've both

been re-watching this year yeah um and i think you and i were both like i can't believe how much of

what's great about this sitcom is here straight away like a lot of its most iconic lines and jokes

are in the first season which I was quite surprised by it's maybe the most like consistent

first season of a show ever so it's um behind the scenes of a sitcom I'm sure people are familiar

with it you know like always beloved by critics but never really a huge ratings winner I feel like

in the UK as well it's maybe a little little bit more underseen because I don't think it ever had

like a big run on a on a channel here you know it was a little bit more like you got it on dvd or

you watched it on some freeview channel that no one really had um and that was definitely my

experience with it but yeah the first episode is is pretty straightforward it's basically that the

the sketch show they're making has no longer really got the stuff and so liz lemon who is the showrunner

of the of the sketch show um her new boss played by alec bolwin uh jack donaghy basically uh insists

that she hires Tracy Jordan who is this slightly deranged film actor who can give the the show some

juice and she has to go out and convince him to basically join uh join this sketch show and I

would say that a lot of the best stuff in the pilot is basically Liz's interactions with um with Tracy

um just like really basically him sharing conspiracy theories about um them injecting

AIDS into the chicken nuggets and things like that it just that kind of like um who the hell is

this guy kind of thing weirdly i think the show actually doesn't quite know how to keep that same

momentum with tracy he just becomes just basically this weirdo in the show as it goes on there's

stranger and stranger goofy plot lines but um yeah i think it just the contrast just works really well

and then it sets up the different layers of humor in the show i think some some like layers of the

jokes are just really quite smart and funny and then others just completely ridiculous and i think

that's what what's great about 30 rock is it mixes all those together kind of has the the juice or the

source from the art for Matthew so uh is that how you found out a rewatch as well yeah absolutely

and like the central dynamic between Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy is it's just great you know that

she's this sort of artistic tv maker and he's this sort of parody of kind of conservative business

values particularly Bush era you know yeah yeah I mean it is very much of its time like I mean

there's so much about this show not just like the politics but there's a I'd say there's like an

unkindness to some of its comedy

which firmly dates it as a show

from 20 years ago.

I just don't think it would happen now.

Well, I was saying

that there's a bit of acid in

some of Girls 5 Ever

but there's some

stereotype stuff in this which is

slightly the aches.

They've had to remove some episodes

from streaming for controversial reasons

I think is an indicator

of where this show sits

and obviously Alec Baldwin

and he's a difficult figure these days.

Though if you watch enough of this show all at once,

you kind of do forget that,

and you just get into it and enjoy the character.

I'm not saying that's right,

or that I feel good about that,

but that is what's been happening.

Truthfully, there's occasional episodes

where he puts a gun in his hands,

and you're like, ugh.

Yeah, I did think,

should I ask Matthew about this on the episode?

Because it is like,

that's why I didn't rewatch it for the longest time,

because it acts, you know, manslaughter.

Yeah, and it is a thing.

I get it.

I completely understand it.

It's like a horrible, horrible thing.

I mean, he says, I mean, God, you can't do it justice, can you?

Like, what a fucked up situation it is.

And I don't know if it's as simple as can you separate the sort of art from the artist kind of deal,

because it's just him front and centre.

They're still out there making, like, reality TV shows.

That is a weird shit.

Well, that's worse.

They're kind of, like, trying to kind of whitewash your reputation with a reality TV show that shows the real you,

how but trying to paint yourself as like as this victim of that situation anyway not to get in all

of that 30 rock generally good hair the funniest thing watching this with my little brother was

like um because like the actress who plays serene it is like 17 when they start it it's like um that's

a bit of a reality check because she is definitely treated as an object of attraction in the show

and so that's a little bit like wild there's just so many of the situations involving her are basically

outfit she's wearing that week there's like a real there's an amazing joke in one episode where um

loads of characters are doing a round of applause you think it's for like two characters in the

foreground but then it turns out there's just sari in quite a skimpy outfit it's a load of blokes

giving her a round of applause as she's walking past yes and i i died laughing at that i thought

just that's so funny a great fake out um and like my little brother turned to me quick as a flash and

went remember Samuel, Sari was 17 when this was made as if to shame me out of being like a horned

dog before I'd even said anything and I was I just found that really really funny but that's like

another way in which it's really like of its time I don't feel like a show would be able to do that

now that it'd be massively scrutinized you know but it just it was a bit more of an anything goes

kind of era um and that's definitely true with the jokes for sure like you and I were exchanging

messages about things where it was like wow i can't believe they said that in in this show i just

completely forgotten that was part of it you know um yeah interesting stuff all right what's the next

one matthew um very briefly pushing daisies i thought i had on a streaming service i wanted to

go back and make sure this was good but i remember this being good did you ever watch this show back

in the day i watched the whole thing matthew yeah i really liked it yeah again like i guess along the

similar line with cheers this comes down to a kind of like great chemistry thing and chemistry being

at the heart of the show so pushing daisies if you haven't seen it lee pace is a baker with the

ability to bring the dead back to life when he touches them they come back to life uh if he

touches them again they die forever and can't come back to life with a touch and if they're

alive for longer than a minute when he brings them back someone else has to die in exchange

That's his setup. And then you've got his childhood crush played by Anna Friel, who has in this first episode died.

And he basically brings her back to life and lets her live longer than a minute, killing someone else.

And then has this dilemma of like, well, the love of my life is back.

But if I ever physically touch her again, she would die for good.

And that's the setup of the show.

It's this sort of whimsical romance fantasy murder mystery show

because they solve crimes every week with this private eye

called Emerson Cod, I think.

That name sticks in my head.

That's right, yeah.

I just really, I mean, they have great chemistry together.

I love Lee Pace.

Anna Freeland, this show, was just like dream lady, basically.

She's just absolutely just so beautifully filmed and shot

and so charming.

and winning and yet they have this incredibly chaste relationship because of the whole death

thing and um but all that you know it's it's just obvious it's there from the start like

it's kind of a i don't i don't think i wouldn't say tim burtony but it's like this hyper real

kind of very well it's barry sonnenfeld right that's that was who died for the pilot yeah so

it's kind of got that that sort of that visual energy to it so from a production value thing as

well you're like well i want to i want to spend more time in this world this is really cool and

is really funny and it's just it's just all so well judged but i think at the heart of it i i just

really really bought into them as you know this this couple that kind of sort of yearned for each

other but had this dilemma and you were like well this is this isn't going to play out like any show

you've seen before um so i that's that's why it's really successful as a pilot and generally as a

show um i'd say if a formally wrap up or does it just end after two seasons no they they do give it

a proper finale i think they basically condense a bunch of the story into like an epilogue kind of

thing um right it's funny though because i thought it was really good while it was on i did also think

this is the kind of show that would be better with like 10 episode seasons rather than trying to do 22

or whatever because i did find it right somewhat inconsistent you know um it was very impressive

but it was almost like a bit too early for prestige tv where i think it would have been a huge hit and

it was like i think it was killed by the writer's strike as well i think that was what it dropped

in the middle of it so they ended up having a shorter second season and they just ditched it but

it was a really special thing um yeah yeah and i really i thought the setup was really good

tim burnett is a good comparison because there is a dark fairy tale quality to the whole thing you

know yeah the music's very sort of elf mini if i recall a lovely pace as well whenever he turns up

in something it's not marvel i should point out he's rubbish in those but you know lots of people

are um he is he is wonderful i was trying to remember what he was called earlier and i said

to gatherine you know he was in marvel he was like uh he was like um malcolm despicable or something

something the conqueror i can't quite remember um i think he's ronan the accuser yeah it was like

crap crap in guardians of the galaxy and then crap again in captain marvel just like just two rounds

yeah this crap blue guy's back yeah exactly uh yeah loved it i was actually more of a kristin

chennaworth guy than i mean she's amazing in it as well she is obviously just an incredible singer

so she sings that cover of uh is it eternal flame yeah that's right yeah in this by the bangles oh

that's really good yeah yeah she's good olive snook um yeah the name's definitely stuck in my head i did

i did try and re-watch this with my partner we didn't get all the way through it but it was

it's just brilliant from the off um my favorite moment from it was it might even be the second

episode is that like because he brought his dog back to life as a kid and killed his mum that's

part of the plot of the show yeah um he has to like stroke the dog using like one of those hat

like his extender claw things and um and i think he thinks that like because he that's how he sort of

shows affection to his dog that that's an okay substitution for the real thing but then as he's

talking about it his dog just makes a very sad noise like actually no this is not this is not as

good as being stroked by you properly and that moment really stuck with me the dog was actively

sad that he doesn't he can't show real affection that was that's good um digby there's the name of

the dog all this is stuck in my head matthew so it must be must be a good show yeah okay definitely

brief on this one futurama just occurred to me the other day what a great setup this is for a tv

show like schlubby kind of 90s late 90s man falls into a freezer wakes up a thousand years in the

future it has to adapt it's actually like a brilliant yeah elegant idea for a for a sitcom

i can see why as a kid i was like i gotta fucking watch this show as soon as i knew it existed and

it is like um the first episode does have the suicide booth joke which immediately makes it

much darker than the simpsons is but just has that very vivid and amazing looking world and a real

a real feeling that they kind of knew the sort of jokes they wanted to make which is basically

that you can go a thousand years in the future and things are still quite shit basically it's not a

utopia you still have to be a delivery boy and kind of get on with your life and they've just got this

great cast of characters out the gate bender who he meets outside the suicide booth and um yeah and

lila who is managing the uh cryo um freezing uh facility where fry wakes up basically but even at

the time i thought that this was great but it kind of has everything you need from a pilot it's

fucking a million times better than the first Simpsons episode,

that one with Santa's little helper,

where all the characters look absolutely warped,

which I know is like a favourite to watch at Christmas and stuff,

but it's not really objectively good.

But this is good, Matthew, isn't it?

Oh, yeah, this was brilliant.

I keep thinking back to, like, just before this came out,

the excitement around the people who made The Simpsons

and making another show,

and there's going to be a whole other thing,

And you're like, there's going to be like two Simpsons quality things in the world.

Because this is where like the Simpsons had such cred that that would have been a real, you know, really exciting.

Well, I'd say all it took was like disillusionment for people to be.

I think if they, if Matt Groening said you're doing another thing now, you'd be like, eh, you know.

Oh, yeah, that's definitely how I'd feel.

Do you mean disenchantment, Matthew?

Disenchantment, yeah, sorry.

It's disillusionment that I felt with his output.

It's so unmemorable.

Oh, that's just fucking crap, isn't it?

What a stinker.

And like, oh, god damn it.

I mean, there's just no jokes in it at all.

It just wasn't.

It looked really nice as well.

It was a great looking show.

Yeah.

Just like, let's do fantasy Futurama.

And you're like, it doesn't work like that, I'm afraid.

Yeah, don't do that, dog.

No more TV shows, please.

Yeah, I completely agree.

but Futurama starts

Futurama's great pretty much all the way

through in that original run that has like the inverse

thing where it becomes shit and then

never ever gets good again after it's original

run so yeah I've not

dealt with any of the later run stuff so

no I can't believe it's like still on

like I was on Disney Plus the other day like coming

soon Futurama I was like why

why are we still making it

I went from please

make more Futurama to stop making Futurama

basically that was my journey with this show

what's your next one Matthew my next one uh well it's the question does Battlestar Galactica count

so I think it does because they sort of treat the second pilot which is the episode 33 is it 33 or

33 minutes something like that isn't it it's 33 I think yeah yeah that basically they treat that

like it is the first episode don't they really yeah so we're talking about that rather than the

mini movie the mini series is good for sure but the 33 is like one of the best tv episodes ever

isn't it yeah which is crazy i mean obviously it doesn't exist in isolation if you haven't seen

batter star galactica there's like a three hour something mini movie that establishes um that uh

a load of evil robots called the cylons come for humanity and there happens to be a few people left

in this starship called batter star galactica which is uh being kind of decommissioned but then

you know in the twist of fate actually becomes sort of humanity's uh last chance for hope and

escapes their planet uh with with the last of humanity and that's where you then get dropped

into episode one which is kind of like the second pilot which is a chase they're being pursued by

these enemy forces and they have to um keep making a series of light jumps warp jumps whatever the

terminology is but every time they jump they then have to get their sort of engines going again and

able to jump again and you are basically learning about a cast of 20 or so characters it's a huge

cast about the star galactica uh and you're learning about them in probably like the most

hectic days of their lives ever and that's just a great a great place for drama to happen um i would

included that or the original mini movie because i think just either one like the the size of the

cast and how quickly it establishes all these people you really care about or you know villains

you really want to see get their comeuppance or uh cool badasses like is uh we were always obsessed

with um is it ty his second in command oh yeah i love ty yeah so like i just think it's it's it's a

great showcase and a great scenario for these these characters to exist in um just felt like really

big exciting sci-fi you know very different from the other big sci-fi shows of the time your star

treks or whatever just didn't seem to have any kind of like hope or kind of wide-eyed aspirations of

what space could bring it was about the panic of being absolutely fucked in space um which is just

like so refreshing and uh oh this show was so fucking good i was properly into it i i kind of

liked it all the way to the end only got a bit wobbly for sure but those earlier seasons like

you forget like that drive to escape was always there i remember when they gave uh colonel ty an

eye patch oh yeah like season three i was like yeah that's a chef kiss that's the good shit that is

it's like the one character you would want to get an eye patch it's like yeah that suits his

personality so well yeah um yeah i love that him and edward james almost just like these two ancient

guys making all the decisions that protects the future of humanity and mary mcdonnell as the

president it just it works so well as a like a power dynamic and i like it i just liked it was

realistically drawn it wasn't like here's like some a hot 40 year old who's in charge of this it's like

no i mean as in all states like quite old people end up being in charge of these these because they

have the most experience they know what they're doing there were some absolute babes and hunks on

that crew oh yeah definitely 100 for sure they like they were there for the for the dads you know

for the mums mostly the dads obviously um given it was battle star um but for sure but i just like

that it had that sort of multi-generational cast to it um i do i do agree i was definitely locked

into it to the end there was never ever a point where i thought you know what i'm gonna stop watching

this it definitely suffered from a lot of the same mystery box show elements that derailed some of

the other shows from this time but um they spend more money on it as it goes as well so some yeah

the first season's quite compromised feeling in places you see a lot of repeated effect shots but

then season three and four have some unbelievable looking space stuff in them you know yeah i i

actually bought the box set for this the season one box set doesn't have the standalone movie that's

annoying yeah you have to buy separately we had to buy separately 20 years ago um and i remember

starting watch because i'd heard about this being a cool show and i started watching episode one so

the 33 and being like what the fuck is this show about what is going on who are all these people

this is so confusing i was like are we gonna have a flashback i think i watched that whole episode

and was like i don't i have no idea what's going on i don't know who many of these people i don't

know what the stakes are like this is the most confusing show ever made and that's when i realized

like a three-hour lesson you had to take first

to understand the show.

I remember watching it.

I was unemployed before I moved out of my parents' house

to be a staff writer,

and I just spent all of my one-stop salary,

which was not much at the time.

It would have been like 80 quid in a month

or something like that.

Something ridiculously low,

maybe a bit more than that.

And then I bought the...

Because I did know about the miniseries,

and I bought that,

and the season one and two box set.

And then once I realized how good the miniseries was,

just that like warm feeling of,

oh my God, I've got two whole seasons of this to annihilate now.

And what would ultimately be the two best seasons of the show as well?

It's sort of, it does sort of like,

I think what's weird about the show is it is inconsistent,

but some of its best plots also sit amongst some stuff

that doesn't quite work.

And so you get three or four episode arcs here and there

that are absolutely amazing.

Like the escape from New Caprica stuff in season three

at the start is really good.

Or the mutiny that happens in season four

is fucking amazing.

That's really good.

But like you get a lot of

we're trying to find this real earth

kind of like stuff

and final five stuff

that submerges the show in

yeah, mystery boxy kind of nonsense.

But it's always got something to watch

because the characters are so good I think.

I've got the Blu-ray of this

and maybe I should rewatch it at some point.

But again, too much actual new TV to watch isn't there?

So, you know, such as it is Matthew.

Okay, next up.

Justified is my penultimate one, Matthew.

This episode's amazing.

It starts with Timothy Olyphant in a cowboy hat on a rooftop in Miami,

shooting an absolute motherfucker and just making it look really cool.

And this incident is basically what gets him demoted

and sent to his hometown in Kentucky,

where he basically has to be the kind of like deputy sheriff there,

not even in charge.

And in doing so, basically encounters his old pal, Boyd Crowder, who is a ne'er-do-well.

So they're on opposite sides of the lore, but they used to be friends.

And I think one of the first things you see is Walton Goggins with a rocket launcher blowing up a church.

And it's just great shit.

Amazing.

I think Justified is pretty consistent in its first few seasons.

Season two is the best one.

But I remember this pilot just being unbelievable.

Did you check this out at the time as well?

Yeah, definitely.

I think my dad bought me the DVD box set for Christmas

because he'd been watching it and was like,

you've got to see this.

My dad got me onto The Shield as well, actually.

So a man of exceptional TV tastes.

I haven't actually finished all of Justified.

So that's something I need to go back and do

because I really, really like this.

And I feel like my love and appreciation

of both Timothy Olyphant and Boughton Goggins

has only deepened over the years.

So I'm sure I'd get even more pleasure out of it now.

Yeah, they've really stood the test of time, those two casting choices.

Yeah, those guys have been in everything since then.

So, great show.

One I have definitely tried to do a rewatch on, but didn't get all the way through.

So, yeah.

What's your final one, Matthew?

My final one is Ozark on Netflix, which is, I would say it's kind of in the Breaking Bad

mold of TV shows, if you haven't seen it or heard of it, in that it's about, you know,

someone who is a quote-unquote reasonable person

having to learn to carry themselves in a criminal organisation.

It's not quite a one-to-one,

because in this show, Jason Bateman is basically a money launderer

for the Mexican cartel,

and his business partner in the first episode

turns out he's been skimming money off the cartel,

so they come to murder them.

And in a kind of moment of begging for his life,

Jason Bateman makes this sort of ridiculous business proposition slash promise that he can launder X amount of money in X amount of time by going to the Ozarks, this rural region.

I don't even know where it is, the Ozarks.

I don't know if it crosses multiple states.

Pardon my lack of knowledge, American listeners.

Wherever the Ozarks is, it looks like backward, forested, middle of nowhere to me, which is why it's a quiet place to avoid the authorities and good for money laundering, but also not necessarily crazy footfall for having businesses to spend that money in.

But what I liked about this is it almost felt like joining Breaking Bad at like the point where he goes into business with like Gus Fring.

The stakes are like instantly mega high.

And, you know, the first episode has a man like begging for his life and only kind of pulling himself out of an execution by making, you know, promising something he couldn't possibly deliver.

And, you know, the show makes it quite clear how difficult it's going to be.

it just a brilliant setting of the stakes you know you are you are just completely and you've

you completely understand how violent the people are he's dealing with um the the the villain who's

threatening him is played by oh the guy he was the bad guy in um the last mission impossible

oh um esai esai morales yes that's him yeah so he's he's he's the kind of the guy with a gun to

the head and i just i kind of like that it kind of cut out the ramping up to that point i like that

it just goes straight in on like it's all fucked jason bateman's having to do some pretty intense

and serious acting by his standards like straight off the bat his life's really miserable like he's

not happy with his life it establishes very quickly so it's not just that he's been pulled

into a situation it's that he's he's like fighting for an existence he's not even particularly invested

in like he's fact like he's kind of sort of at odds with his family in in various ways uh i i just

thought it was great like thriller construction and if you do find the the slow build-up of of like

a breaking bad or a better cause so you know a bit too subtle this is kind of like the sort of

hitting the gas pedal version of it which i thought was a pretty good pitch i'm not going to say it

sustains that necessarily all the way to the end uh but the ups and downs of this show like it's i

feel like it's a surprisingly good show nestling on netflix that a lot of people may have just

like skipped over because it's got a weird name or something i think loads and loads of people

watched this during covid i think it was one of those shows that because i think they maybe had a

new season that dropped during those first few months where people were just really fucking bored

and wanted anything new to do right and so i think i think that that did happen with this show and it

just became like one of the most watched things in the world like ever because it was just it just

yeah it was just the right moment for it um yeah never quite gave this a go i think actually the

breaking bad comparisons put me off because i didn't really want it i didn't really want another

experience like that i didn't really care yeah but then i heard so much about how like good like

julia garner in there is in this how good laura linney is in this and i was like ah maybe i should

give this a go at some point it's got feelings peter mullen's very good in the first season i love

Peter Mullen

yeah

it's always a net gain

to whatever he's in

yeah yeah

just his voice alone

is like

it's great stuff

yeah I always meant

to give this a go Matthew

that's um

well do

like

it's just easy

I bet it's easy viewing

as well

I bet I could just

have this on

and probably churn

through it quite quickly

yeah it's quite stressful

like if you do

concentrate on it

like the situation

and like what he has

to achieve

feels quite unwinnable

uh

but

like part of the fun

is how the show

kind of

writes its way around

that in different ways

he's had a weird career jason bateman i wouldn't have been i wouldn't have predicted exactly what

he did off the back of arrest of development you kind of i don't i guess i don't i wouldn't know

where he goes because i don't actually think he's that funny he's not he's like the straight man in

arrest of development he gets probably like five percent of the really good jokes um i guess he's

sort of like a dry run of adam scott yeah yeah i think that's probably true but he's obviously

surrounded by like these completely wacky some of the funniest actors who have ever lived basically

so then it kind of makes sense he'd go on to do more dramatic stuff but yeah i might i might add

this to my netflix watch list matthew okay my last pick then is twin peaks i have to mention this

because the pilot yeah is almost like a blueprint of what a lot of these kind of serialized dramas

would use as a pilot in terms of um setting up a horrible murder that has shaken this local

community and then the kind of like strange sort of bits of evidence that suggests there's maybe

more at play than is obvious um and so begins the journey to figure out who killed laura palmer which

um goes to some supernatural places but i think in just terms of establishing who all the different

weirdos are in this town kind of like giving you a sense of their inner lives and the idea of like

there's there are things going on beneath the surface with a lot of the people who live here

very, very effective, obviously very funny as well,

and odd in places, right?

They're kind of like Lynch-tonal mix,

but also five to ten amazing bits of casting in this

that just help carry the show the distance.

I think Twin Peaks does ultimately always need the mystery

to give it that momentum,

but it is very good at getting you invested

in the minutiae of these people's lives.

It does feel like a more functional mystery to begin with,

like a more traditional show.

Like, if you compare this first episode with, like, the first episode of season two, and how they both open, I can remember thinking, like, what the fuck is this in season two?

Where this has, you know, as odd as it is, it has some shape to it and, like, speed, which I appreciate.

Yeah, it's true.

I think it's, like, it might be the second episode, no, the third episode, where they do their whole red room thing with the backwards talking.

And by that point, it instantly becomes something else.

And like you say, by the beginning of season two,

it's just like this wild, supernatural kind of horror mystery,

which I do like that mode of Twin Peaks as well.

But I think the first season's tone,

maybe people liked it being 5% that show,

but 95% a bit more conventional.

So yeah, but it is fantastic.

The pilot is amazing.

It was a real revelation to watch at the time.

And I also like the first episode of Twin Peaks,

The Return as well,

where it's like basically Cooper's been trapped in the Black Lodge for like 25 years,

which is a very horrible, dark concept.

And there's some very, very scary things that are set up by that pilot episode.

And then it's a lot of Karma Glocklin screaming for the next like 10 episodes after that.

Bit of a tough hang, but you know.

I'll say.

Definitely a rewatch to be done there for me.

Obviously has some amazing highs, but it doesn't really resemble what the original Twin Peaks is.

Okay, Matthew, that's us done.

I can now let my brother leave my bedroom.

Oh, I've had your brother in mind.

Well, it sounds weird.

I've had your brother in mind this whole time.

You know, I've been concerned for your brother.

While we were chatting, I sent him the Expedition 33 trailer,

and I was like, I think you'll like this.

I think this is your sort of thing.

He likes Final Fantasy like I do.

And he went, that's nice, but I wanted to use the bathroom for 40 minutes

or I'd ruin your podcast if I do it.

I was like, no, it's fine.

I've shut the door.

Just go, you know, the microphone will cancel it out.

It's okay.

Also, he's now watched that trailer 70 times in a row.

He's nothing else to do in there.

It's tough for him.

Okay, good stuff.

This episode is done then.

Thank you to Michael Banyabat for the edits as ever.

And people know where to get us, Matthew.

So let's get out of here.

See you later.

Bye-bye.

Goodbye.

Bye.
