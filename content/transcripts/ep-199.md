Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew, how's it going? You enjoying this overcast day in Bath this Monday evening?
I'm pretty sure my toe is broken, you know.
Oh, God, really?
Yeah, it's getting worse, but just for people who are interested in the saga of the toe.
That's an important update there, as we switch tack to our guests. So our returning guest this week is Louise Blain, who last appeared on The Back Page in October 2021 for our Best Horror Games episode or 15 of the Best Horror Games, something like that. Delighted to have Louise back.
These days, she's the creative lead for Blumhouse Games. Pretty amazing stuff. So how's it going, Louise?
It is great to have you back on.
It's really good, but I want to know more about Matt's toe. What's happened to your toe? How did this happen?
Oh, well, this is great. This is my specialist subject at the moment. Sam came around to play Mario Party, of all things.
Great evening, cracking evening.
I excitedly ran out to the kitchen to get him a drink and pranged my toe into a pipe coming out of the radiator and it really, really hurt. Everyone laughed at me and I kind of clowned it up for the rest of the evening because, you know, I'm a good host. That's what I do, even though it was really, really hurting.
And now I'm convinced it is broken. All the swelling and bruising has gone down, but it just hurts like shit. It feels like it's wrong, you know, on a kind of core level.
But it was all in the name of getting Samuel a drink.
Yeah.
I love that. It was all in your quest for being a good host. It was your sacrifice.
I left the room with the speed that I've just never left the room in. I get a bit overexcited when we've got guests. And yeah, it's crazy.
It's a corner I've taken a thousand times in my life and not walked into the radiator.
I saw it happen and I thought, well, that's this evening done for then. That's the subject of this evening now. And to some extent it was.
But Matthew tried his best to hide it. But yeah, it sounds like the situation is only worse. And that was over a week ago now, Matthew, and it's still getting worse.
Okay, well, I hope you can sort of doctor about that. Looking forward to weekly toe updates. But Louise, how is it going?
True body horror.
Yeah.
If you want to license a story of my toe for a game, go right ahead.
Yeah, Blumhouse has optioned the rights to the toe.
Only if it comes to life. Yeah. Things are good.
It's also gray here in Los Angeles today for the first time in ages, which I love. I've been so excited any time that it gets any cooler in LA. I just bask.
I'm like one of those huskies that you see on Instagram, who go out and lie on snow. That's me in Los Angeles when air arrives. No, it's lovely.
It's going very well. It's beautiful. It's blue skies and palm trees.
But at the same time, I'm like, oh, I'm not really sure how to do spooky season when it's 36 degrees.
Yeah. My memory of Los Angeles in the summer where the heat was just on full blasts. Basically, dodging sun beams like that big sun cannon and Gears of War.
Basically, just get a sprint between bits of cover in LA Live essentially. That's exciting though, Halloween in Los Angeles. What have you learned about their way of doing it so far?
It's the fact that anytime you've ever seen Halloween depicted in movies in America is how this is. There's endless, I've been pumpkin picking, you go apple picking, you literally go and choose your pumpkin from enormous things and then eat donuts and pick apples and have lovely times. But I think seeing things like Spirit Halloween, which I'd never experienced before, if you've never experienced Spirit Halloween, it's like all these pop-up Halloween stores that just arrive in empty shop fronts and they just have every single possible.
You usually see them, they have crazy animatronics for your front garden or your yard, as they like to say here. You usually see children standing in front of them and then huge witches popping up and then terrifying the children or half of clowns with intestines coming out the bottom, they're constantly flipping forward. But these are everywhere and then you just drive around and you just see street after street of just incredible, the 12-foot skeletons from Home Depot and everything.
So I just, I love it, I love just walking around and feeling that I am with my spooky people. It's lovely. Although my girlfriend isn't happy with the amount of Halloween stuff that I've got that I don't want to put away.
I'm just going to want it as permanent decoration. But I'm sure we'll come to it. I bought a headless horseman the other day in Home Goods, which is amazing.
It's got a light up pumpkin under its arm.
How big is it?
My horseman. I'm looking at it just now. About 50 centimetres tall.
It's quite big.
That's impressive.
Did you think it was life size, Matthew?
That would have been amazing.
It's maximus, isn't it, America? Everything's bigger.
Yeah.
Well, the skeletons definitely are.
Well, Bath just had the autumn fair, fair spelt with a Y, Louise. Don't think Los Angeles can compete with that. One street of overpriced goods and some cake stands.
Very exciting.
Was there wooden ties? Did they have the huts at the Christmas market?
No, it's a little bit lower key than that, but obviously the Christmas market is coming. We live in fear of it in Bath. So yeah, that's something to dread on the horizon for sure.
But damn, exciting. Los Angeles life. It sounds really, really cool.
So last time we had you on the podcast, Louise, you were hosting Sound of Gaming on BBC Radio 3, and now you obviously have a new job. So when did you make the leap to Blumhouse? And what led to that opportunity for you?
So I moved to Blumhouse last August, so August 2023. But it was actually, I think it was released, it was released and sort of announced that Blumhouse were moving into games in at DICE early last year. And the president, our co-founder, Zach Wood, and Don Seclar, our CFO, they basically launched Blumhouse Games then.
And Zach and I, funnily enough, had met, we'd seen each other online and met on Twitter, et cetera. But the first time we'd met digitally was in Animal Crossing when Zach came to my island to sell his turnips. So that's where we like to say that we properly met.
But he knew of my sort of horror background and my games background. So he got in touch early last year saying, we're doing this. And I sort of had this incredible moment of, the sort of casual moment where you try and say, so if you ever need anyone to work with you on that, I'd be happy to, but I didn't have to because he basically said, like, so if you'd ever like to talk about anything and working on anything, and I started consulting for them and then moved into the creative lead role in August of last year.
So yeah.
That's awesome.
It was just the dream. It was the absolute dream moment. I couldn't, I still can't really believe it.
I still go, what do I do? This is amazing. It's the best thing.
That's really cool. I remember when you, I think it was last Gamescom you told me about it. And I was like, wow, that is the most perfect match of all time.
And I'm super happy for us. That's really, really, really cool. Yeah.
So this year, obviously, you've broken cover on the titles that you're working on. So an exciting time. Can you talk about the early conversations you had around Blumhouse Games?
When you talked to them about the role, how was it pitched to you and what sparked Blumhouse's initial interest in getting into games?
Well, I think their initial interest in getting into games is they talk about basically telling stories, telling scary stories, wherever those stories can be told. And obviously the horror market in games, the indie horror in particular is really thriving. So I think it's a great time for indie horror games.
And people really continue to want to be scared across the board. The horror genre continues to do incredible things. I mean, we just saw Terrifier 3 has, I think, beaten Joker soundly at the box office just in the last weekend.
So horror continues to be, it's not really just a Halloween thing anymore. Horror is a full 365 days a year affair now. And I think Blumhouse wanted to find a good way to break into the games market.
And I think specifically they chose our president, the company, Zach Woods and Don, because they'd had gaming, they lived the games industry. I mean, I think Zach has always, he's worked in the games industry his whole life. He started at Midway.
I think he's worked for Arcane, worked for PlayStation, on Sound Shapes and Edith Finch. So he's really been in the indie sphere and loves it passionately. And Don worked for PlayStation for 12 years.
So basically, they wanted to work with people who understood the industry. And I think approaching indie games with the same mentality that Blumhouse, when it was initially founded in, I want to say 2007, I hope Jason doesn't appear and smite me down, but with Paranormal Activity, that was a very low budget horror movie that was very, very successful. So it means that you can take indie risks with smaller budgets and smaller games doing exciting things.
And it means everybody wins. It means that people are playing interesting, unique, creative horror experiences. At the same time, there's not such a massive business risk of AAA development.
And I think that works really well. So we're taking the same attitude to our games and our slate over the next few years.
My next question was definitely along those lines. But I think a lot of people, like you say, know Blumhouse is this powerhouse of low to mid budget horror movies that have the potential to become massively profitable. Though I know they make a bunch of other stuff as well, like documentaries and sharp objects on the TV side is kind of like borderline horror, sort of thriller mystery.
Horror adjacency, yes.
Yeah, exactly. So the philosophy of Blumhouse on the game side then, I guess like you've tapped into the kind of budget side of it there. It's about indie devs and stuff.
But I guess like more from a more of a creative angle, what are the sort of like things that as a company that you're interested in, in terms of like representing different sides of horror?
Yeah, I think it's exactly that. It's the thing. I mean, I've always loved horror my whole life from when I go to the library and get Goosebumps books and read as many ghost stories as possible.
And I think we sometimes kind of forget that horror comes in so many different types of horror. You've got ghost, you've got folk, psychological, cosmic. And if you look at movies, especially Blumhouse movies, you'll see a lot of those genres represented there.
And I think what we really want to do is be able to reflect that in a game slate. You know, over the past couple of years, there have been games that are horror games that potentially aren't just survival horror. I think people have this idea that the survival horror genre is where horror lives in video games.
And that's fine, because it's wonderful. You know, I've been playing the new Silent Hill and I'm sure we'll talk about it later. But there are so many different facets to that.
And that might not be your bag. And you might not want to play that. People might be scared to play that or apprehensive to do that.
But they still enjoy scary stories. So, one thing that I'm really passionate about is finding people their horror game that they didn't know they were into. So we have so many different types of games in our slate that we announced at Summer Games Fest.
You know, we've got Grave Seasons, which is a horror and farming simulator. We've got something like Crissol, which is a Spanish first person shooter, but it's full of a sort of twisted version of Spain with Spanish folklore. And we really just want to deliver lots of different horror experiences for so many different audiences.
So that if people looked at our slate announced back in June and thought, oh, I want to play that. And everyone will have their different version of that because we've got different styles and different genres and different visual styles. But they're all under the sort of grand, creepy umbrella that is horror.
That's what's really exciting to me.
Yeah, absolutely. This wasn't in my plan, actually, Louise, I hope you don't mind me asking. But I was curious if there were any specific kind of indie horror games for the last few years that might have sparked interest in the genre from Blumhouse Games.
If there's anything in particular that inspired them to want to get into that space. Like it's a thriving sort of busy scene. But is there anything like behind the scenes that people are like, I played this and I thought it'd be cool if we could move into that sort of area of publishing?
I don't think specifically sort of cause and effect like that with games. I don't think there was one thing that said, no, we must do this. But internally, we like to look at, since we like to look at games like Dredge or Inscription as doing interesting things in the horror space.
So we like to think about those. But that was kind of after. So I don't think there was anything prior that immediately said, this one success story is the one way in.
It's just, I think, the general success of the game space and the sort of potential there. And obviously, on the movie side, we released Five Nights at Freddy's. But the conversation in games has actually been long before the sort of release of that movie last year.
But yeah, I think there's lots of things that we look at internally and think of as really interesting, creative lenses into horror, like Dredge, like Inscription. I really liked Killer Frequency, that Team 17 released last year, which was kind of a fixed in place, radio based slasher story. So these kind of different twists on the horror genre is just always something that's really going to excite us.
And the exciting thing is like, there is no shortage of people who have these ideas, and that's what's really, really cool right now, is there is so much horror out there and so much potential for it.
Yeah, absolutely. You've been asked this question before, and it's not interesting, this question, but it seems like the right thing to ask. So have there been any questions about adapting Blumhouse's range of movie franchises for games?
That doesn't sound at all like the angle you've really gone for with Blumhouse Games, but I thought it's worth probing anyway, because obviously that's what the company is known for.
No, of course. And I think a lot of people, when they heard that Blumhouse were getting into the game space, were immediately like, oh, great, Purge Games, and I think that's what people maybe thought we'd announce at Summer Games Fest. And because of the indie approach that we've taken, that's not obviously what we announced, but certainly, of course, in the future that would make complete sense.
But I think the important thing is, we're definitely not against any pitches regarding our own IP. You know, if you're looking at projects like Megan and Insidious and all of these different things, there's such exciting potential there. But I also think that we're looking, making sure it's the right project and the right time, and also something that speaks to us.
Because I think the important thing is, we are big fans of those IPs, you know, and I think authenticity is what they always deserve. So I think, you know, we're never saying never, but certainly, it will have to be the right project, the right time that we're super excited by. And the thing is, the potential for that happening in pitch form is high, you know, so it will be exciting to see what happens over the next few years, but we're certainly never saying never.
That's cool, yeah. I mean, you know, paranormal activity beat them up, not on the cards for now, but you know, just, yeah, that makes sense. So yeah, like we talked about it a bit there, but even though all your games are horror games, it seems like there's a deliberate attempt to make sure the types of horror represented are quite different.
You have a couple of games in more of a cozy horror vein. But I suppose I was kind of curious, Louise, if there was about the other sides of horror as well, like how kind of like weird you're trying to get with the types of things that you're going for, how much you're leaning towards different types of sub-genres like slashers and that sort of thing, like in kind of representing that range, how do you think about the titles you're publishing more holistically?
Well, I think we want that range, we want the biggest range. You know, I think as I said, we want people to say, oh, I hadn't thought that I wanted a game like that. You know, I think you can have something that is cozier, like like grave seasons, or you can have something that really dives into gaming meta narratives, like the simulation, which is incredible.
I don't think you always have to say, is it, you know, scary? I don't think that really comes into it. It's like if it's living in the horror space, there's an expectation that it will be unsettling and unknown and scary and creepy.
That's kind of a given. But I think holistically, I do want to explore as many of horror sub genres as possible and sort of have it like scary ice cream with lots of different flavors we've kind of joked about. And it's because there's just so much potential because so many people are, you know, we all are afraid of different things as well.
And the kind of things that appeal to us are all very different. And I think it is just about making sure that things appeal to, not appeal to everyone, but make sure there is something that appeals, maybe one thing will appeal to everyone. And I think we can go super weird and interesting and scary and strange.
I mean, we have we have Project C from Sam Barlow and Brandon Cronenberg, which is, I can't say much about, but is if you have looked at the work of both of those creators and then could possibly imagine what would happen if they got together. That's what's cooking up in Project C, and it's really, really exciting. And that certainly isn't, you know, that that's it's not going to be cosy.
Let's put it that way. That's not going to be a cosier experience. But yeah, it's all of these all of these different horror flavours.
It's kind of the holistic approach, really.
That makes sense as someone who's been to as many frightfests as you have and, you know, maybe like sees the kind of programming logic of a festival and how you can sort of like bring all those different sort of tones under one roof. Is there anything you'd say connects the titles you unveiled as part of the Blumhouse Games line up back in June?
I think just a unique look into horror, something that maybe you don't expect, that there's always kind of a twist on it. You know, I think if you're looking at Fear the Spotlight, which is coming out October 22nd, which is our first game, that's a very sort of PS1-inspired experience. But at the same time, the two developers behind it, it's husband and wife team, cozy game pals, and it's not the coziest.
But Krista Castro and Brian Singh, Brian previously used to work for Naughty Dog. And so he obviously working on Uncharted and The Last of Us. So what you actually get is a game that might look very PS1 style and sort of beautiful style because Krista is an animator who previously worked for Nickelodeon and various things, Cartoon Network.
And it's got a very modern gameplay feel. It doesn't feel like something that was made in 96. It might look like that and be a sort of artistic version of that, but it certainly doesn't feel like it.
So that's got a very modern underlying to it, undertone to it. And it's also got very sort of tactile puzzles that you can kind of grab on to stuff and move things around in a first person perspective because they were inspired by things like they loved Silent Hill and Resident Evil and things, but they also wanted to bring their own twist to it. So I think even using that as an example.
And then Grave Seasons, farming simulator, but you've never seen it with murder. Crissall, you've never exchanged or you have in various things, but perhaps not in a sort of a twisted version of Spain. Have you switched out your blood for bullets?
You're kind of living on this constant sacrifice exercise. And then we've got Sleep Awake, which is a first person experience from the studio Eyes Out, which is Corey Davis and who made Spec Ops The Line and Robin Fink, the guitarist with the Nine Inch Nails. And it's all about basically a world where people, when they go to sleep, just disappear.
So people try and kind of find different ways to stay awake. Then you've got something like Project C, which is going to be very, very different from those two. So the simulation, it just, I think we just have this idea of just adding a twist and adding creativity and something that feels fresh and something that feels interesting.
And that's kind of our, that's what we're doing.
That's pretty cool.
Can I ask actually, oh, this is a really basic question compared to all the excellent in-depth questions Sam's prepared. The actual, the unveiling itself, I was thrilled to see you on the stage at Summer Games Fest. It was a proper like Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme of like, holy shit, that's Louise, that's crazy.
And, you know, just, you know, absolutely thrilled for you. But like as someone who's covered those events for years, you know, from the other side, you know, watching them as a journalist, what was it actually like being involved with that and being involved with that reveal?
It was, it was so surreal. I think having been the person that's covered them on live blogs and news, and then suddenly standing on stage with Jason and Jeff, and suddenly realizing that Jeff is asking me the questions that I need to then say something. But it was a one, you know, it was so good because we haven't, we hadn't been able to talk for so long about what we'd been doing.
You know, people were so interested in it, had to just completely say nothing. So actually to get to unveil it on that stage was amazing. But what was so cool was the Slate trailer came out before, was on before we arrived on the stage.
And it was the best thing to hear how the, it was in the YouTube theatre. And it was the best thing to hear how the crowd reacted. Just to seeing, you know, hearing the Blumhouse Games logo go up.
And then have they announced, because I think initially a few people said that they thought it was all one game. No, no, it's six different games. But I, and I think that was because people didn't know what to expect.
So suddenly by the time you got to the third game, you're like, oh, these are all different. This is amazing. So I think it was exciting to be able to hear that reaction and finally be able to talk about it.
And it's just, it was so lovely afterwards as well to have people be so excited about specific titles already. Yeah, it was a really surreal, brilliant feeling. And I think every so often, if I ever have any sort of hard weeks or hard times, sometimes I quite like to think about, you know, exactly how that felt to come out on stage and do that, because it just, it was the coolest thing.
And people were so lovely. The response has been so, so good that people are excited. And yeah, it was the coolest thing.
That's awesome. So I was curious, as Creative Lead, what does your day to day look like? What are the different elements that make up your job?
Yeah. So as Creative Lead, I am responsible for working with our dev teams with regards to feedback and just help it. Like, so we obviously, the way that all game development works is on milestones.
So they'll send over milestone builds and, you know, I will look at those and then speak to them and the rest of the team will kind of get involved. We're a very small team, which is really nice. There's only seven of us.
So it means that everyone can actually really dive into stuff and get involved and catch up with the dev. So that's basically me is speaking to speaking to our dev teams at various points. And if maybe, you know, with something like Fear the Spotlight, as we got closer to as we got closer to launch, it was playing it a lot and seeing what was happening.
And I think it's just it varies day to day. But I tend to do a lot of playing of builds and also meeting, you know, pitch teams, you know, dev teams that are pitching to us. Yeah, I think it's kind of it kind of mixed day to day.
But I work with a lot of just everyone on the creative side. Basically, it's kind of my purview, which doesn't sound like a busy day. Every day does seem to be very busy and disappear in a slew of meetings and gaming.
And I think it's that nice thing as well where because that is solely my job, it means that if we get a build and I can really dive into it and really speak to the team. And I think it's helpful because something that I think obviously yourselves probably did at one point as well is there's the whole consultation and mock review part that journalists quite often get hired for, which I was working on over the past couple of years as well. Like the longer your freelance and the more video games you play, suddenly the earlier you see them and the more access you get to them because people want to take advantage of your expertise and how you communicate certain flow, or do you understand this, or how hard is this puzzle really?
And all of those things. So I really got to take advantage of my experience that way and just think about how you feel as a player to experience something. And I think that's hopefully something that I can give our teams on a regular basis without things having to go out to mock reviewers or consultants, which will obviously happen later down the line, but it means they get that extra creative stage from the publisher, which is hopefully helpful.
Yeah, that makes sense. It's really interesting because I think the fight you have when you work internally at a publisher is not to get too tunnel vision about things, where you lose perspective on what it is you're looking at. And I think that that's a fine line.
You almost need that sense of remove to remind yourself of what it's like being in that Games Journalist headspace in order to sort of like do that side of the job. I know it sounds kind of weird, but I think it probably makes sense to you.
That hasn't left me, you know, I think, I don't think that I think having done, I mean, when I looked back at it, I was a Games Journalist for 12 years, and I don't think that has left me yet of that core experience of being able to see something with fresh eyes and I'm sure, you know, any longer development cycles I'll have to remind myself. It's like, right, remember how you felt, X, Y and Zedigal. And I do think that's really important with horror, especially because I think horror, you have to remember that something was scary, because if you're expecting something, that's not going to be scary anymore, potentially.
But you have to remember that that first experience where you saw whatever you saw or you felt it or you heard it, that was that was scary once, you know, it's like comedians. I think when they're working so long on a set, they literally remind themselves that something was actually funny and they did find it funny and people will find it funny. And I think that's the case with horror and scares is that, am I just used to this?
Is this not scary anymore? And it's like, no, no, it's still scary. I think that is, I think that's a really interesting creative process as well as making sure that you don't, you don't become sort of immune to something that you're experiencing and the difference that a player will have when they encounter that exact same interaction.
Something I've often wondered about, you know, people who are in the business of taking on new games and being pitched to and whatnot. Can you talk a little bit about, like, what, what you're, you know, not specifically, like, the specific games you get pitched or shown, but, like, what, what do you actually see to have to, to make those kind of judgment calls on? I think a lot of people don't know, you know, like, are you seeing, like, a build?
Is it just an idea? Like, what, what's in front of you that you actually have to then go, yes, we're gonna, we're gonna kind of bet on this person?
Well, I think it varies probably from publisher to publisher and even with us from pitch deck to pitch, because what you do see is, you know, everybody makes up the 101 of it, you make up a pitch deck and your pitch deck in there is the idea for your game. So maybe that's art from your game. Maybe that's how the gameplay will flow.
Maybe that is what your inspirations are. Or maybe it's, hopefully it's all of those things. It's like, well, it's like this game meets this game and it costs this much.
That's the kind of meat and potatoes of a pitch deck is here's our idea, here's why it's good, here's why it's scary, here's what's cool about it. And I think, you can see just an idea and a team and no, or sometimes maybe you would, it's great if you can play a prototype. A lot of the time people have been working on a prototype just to kind of give that flavour of how something will actually feel, because I think that's important.
You can look at a diagram of how a gameplay flow will be, but you can get an idea of that, but you don't actually know how that's going to feel until it's in prototype form. And prototype form can be in all sort of shapes. You can have a sort of super shiny vertical slice, which has all the art and the music and the sound and everything is there.
But also a prototype can just be a white box and you experiencing a sort of basic version of how it will run. So I think it really depends on the developer and it really depends on what they've got. So far and what they're working on.
So and I think our decisions then are never based on, oh, we need, we need X or Y. It's, it's all just, we want to see, we want to see everything. And if you've got a prototype, that's amazing.
But like it really, it really, really depends. It's kind of how long is a piece of string on that way. But it's, it's, it's a really, really interesting process when there isn't a game, but there is, you know, a map of how it's going to feel.
And sometimes you can look at it and go, great, I get it. Brilliant. And sometimes you're like, oh, I really need to play and find out how that's going to run.
And even that can surprise you. You know, so I think it's all very different, but it's very, very cool because I think previously, you know, my experiences as a journalist, you kind of, there's a certain point where you don't see games like I'd, I hadn't experienced masses of games in white box, for instance. You know, I'd never really wandered around empty environments.
I'd always seen them at a certain stage of development. So it's been great to kind of go through that and journey through that and see where flow changes or all of that can happen. So it really kind of opens your eyes to the full development process.
Does it feel, I know you're just going into a room and instantly in the spot going yes or no, but there has to come a point where you're like, yes, we're going to proceed with something or we're not. Is that quite like a nerve wracking for you? Because it feels like quite a big gamble, right?
That you're like, we're going to commit to this thing.
I don't, it doesn't feel like, I think it just feels, I think it just feels quite exciting.
Oh, that's great.
Let's do this. Because, yeah, I think there's a real feeling of excitement and like, you know, the partners that we work with, especially, it's like, wow, this is amazing. Like there is no part of me, you know, you've got this, this is great.
I'm so excited for this. I can't wait to see every part of this, you know? And I think that's what's, I think that's what's cool.
So rather than an oh no, it's like, oh, this is amazing. Look at the awesome creative stuff they're doing. Like, let's do that, you know?
So I think, and that's it. Like, we're so excited by all the different teams that we have working on things, because they're all so different and they're all different sizes. And obviously we have sort of, our budget is sort of, our sweet spot is between three and five million.
So that obviously dictates how big the teams can be, but they all vary in sizes and they're all around the world and doing cool things. So yeah, I think, I think it's just exciting.
This is a weird question, but I think it is relevant because Blumhouse Games is, you know, it's very rare you get a publisher who are sort of like, I guess, subject matter or genre focused as opposed to, you know, like being a broader kind of indie label. So the horror focus is, you know, specifically an interesting sort of angle to the, you know, to the approach that you folks are taking obviously. And I was curious how important you find your own expertise in horror is to doing the job, Louise.
So how much do you think you need that kind of solid knowledge base to understand like the vision of what developers are going for or like what good horror looks like in video game form?
Oh, that is a really juicy question because I think with horror, I don't think you need to be an expert in horror to know what good horror feels like. If it scares you and you feel, you feel it, then you don't necessarily, you know, you don't, you don't necessarily need some kind of degree in horror studies. Because I've seen all the sort of horror films that we've seen.
But I do think it comes in handy just because I can feel when something feels really fresh as a scare or something feels unique or different, or if it feels like something that I've never quite seen before, or I also, there was once I was talking to one of our developers and he brought up a specific philosophical approach to horror that I'd actually studied at university when I did an aesthetic section of my philosophy degree, which I specialized in the philosophy of horror. And he brought up this very specific philosopher, and I knew that philosopher, and it felt like one of those moments where he said, in school, you've learned all this, but you've never actually managed to apply it. But this was this one moment where I got to be like, yes, I studied that at university when I was studying horror.
So it was like, yes, it legitimized my entire university education for this one moment. But no, I like to think that I am a feature, not a bug with my horror knowledge. But I certainly don't think, I think actually sometimes some of the most interesting horror comes from people who haven't made horror before, or they want to, you know, I think there's always like, I'm losing a name here, but in terms of composers, when a regular composer decides to turn their hand to a horror score, sometimes they can end up with something really incredible because they're kind of taking other influences as well.
So I certainly don't think horror is a sealed space. I think the more people that work in horror, who are coming from other aspects or coming from other genres, can only make horror richer. I think it can only get better that way because I think different approaches to it.
You know, you've got someone like Mike Flanagan, for instance, who just makes the most human heartbreaking, scary horror. And it's a very specific type that comes from him wanting to bring something very particular in there. And I think it's all the richer for his human heartbreaking element, which is sort of similar to Stephen King.
But I do think people coming from drawing from so many different inspiration points makes scary things even scarier because the heart of scary stuff is that it's human. Really, it's not it's not jump scares. It's horror is a very human emotion.
And if people can tap into that and make you feel unnerved, then everybody wins.
That's yeah, that makes sense. So it's it's interesting. So you are really open about the kinds of developers you're looking to work with in terms of scale.
I mean, you mentioned like three to five million there. I think that that's really good at setting expectations. I was curious if that was like the scale that you think Blumhouse Games will always work out or is this kind of like it's our starting point with figuring this out because you mentioned that like blockbuster game developers not something you're looking to get into.
But I was kind of curious like how, how fixed that is, I guess. Like do you see a future where there might be larger projects you get involved with?
I think we're sticking to indie for now with our sort of initial slate. There's not a temptation of let's go AAA or AA. I think we want to stick indie for now.
I wouldn't be able to say what our growth would be. We're at the moment we're looking for. We've got our first.
I don't know if I said earlier, but we're actually very, very ahead of schedule. When Blumhouse Games was announced, our first game was meant to come out in 2026. Now our first game is coming out next week.
We have three games in 2025, and 326. So actually, we're far ahead because I think there is far more than you can actually sign because so many people are doing interesting things in that indie space. So that's where we really want to stay for at least for now.
I don't know what in terms of the future, I can't officially tell you exactly what the future would be, but currently our slate for the next few years is very, very indie focused and with that kind of set plan. And it'll be interesting to see what happens there. But currently staying small, staying lean, staying scrappy and our set releases every year.
That makes sense. Okay, so your first title is Fear the Spotlight, which we've discussed a little bit already. It's a game that's being re-released on October 22nd with a significant update.
Can you talk about how that came to be the first Blumhouse Games title?
Yeah, so actually Fear the Spotlight was actually released last, I want to say September or October, and Zach saw one of his friends posting about it on Twitter and he was like, oh, we should play that. So we did and we loved it. It's just this wonderful teen horror with an amazing story and it's properly scary and creepy, but it's just got so much.
It was just, every so often we'd look at each other and be like, this is amazing because we're playing it next to each other. So we then followed Cozy Game Pals, the developers, on Twitter. And then there was really a DM, Brian, messaged me like, oh, we're interested in what you're doing with Blumhouse Games.
And then we ended up having a meeting and we basically said to them, is there any way that we can help? And they said, we'd love to bring this to consoles. And we said, well, if you had more time, they said, well, if we had more time, we would add stuff to it.
And that was basically what we did. So they took it off, it was just released on PC, took it off the Steam store for it to be made into a complete version. And now next week, it's that new version with new content that's gonna be released.
So what's exciting was the previous version was between sort of two to three hours, and now you're looking at four to five hours. But what's really good is the fact that it doesn't feel, there's no sort of, it's not padded content, it's additional content that enhances and enriches the entire story. So that's, we're really, really happy that this could be our first release.
We like to think about it as being like the kind of everything that we would like all Blumhouse Games to be, is it's got this great story, great characters, so appealing. And also I love the fact that it's quite short, so you can do it in probably one or two sittings, and really feel like you've kind of experienced this amazing like 90s teen horror movie, which is one of my favourite things.
That's awesome. Seems like that kind of PS1 aesthetic is having a bit of a moment as well. Crow Country obviously came out this year, and I feel like in general as well, like the audience is really ready for games that sort of riff on that kind of aesthetic.
I'm sure it means a lot to you as well.
Yeah, I think the PS1 aesthetic has so much potential, which is really exciting. Like you've kind of got people's nostalgic thoughts of what PS1 was, so it kind of gets you that nostalgic feeling. But at the same time, something like Fear the Spotlight really, really takes advantage of it because you think you can actually change the polygon wobble in the settings, and you can change the frame rate, and you can change how that looks.
So if you want it to look super retro, and you want everything to wiggle all over the place, fine. If you want to crank that back down and have it to be quite smooth, you can do that too. So you can have as much nostalgia as you want that way.
But what I think it does is with your draw distance being a certain distance or something moving, is that a polygon or is that something waiting there? So it really takes advantage of the fact that you're playing a scary game, the way you're worried about, is that something around that corner? Did something just appear?
No, no, I didn't really see anything. So I actually think PS1 horror really can lean into that. And then with Fear the Spotlight, it is that much more modern experience underneath.
So people will be very surprised by how that feels to play.
That's really cool. Yeah, I can't wait to check that out. That sounds awesome.
I was curious, then, like, so that's your first release. What does the next year or two look like for Blumhouse Games? You say that 2026 is originally when you were looking to start publishing games, but obviously you have like a full slate now.
So what's the next few folks after this?
We haven't announced any release dates as yet for any of the other games on our slates announced, but it will be three next year and 326 and after that. So they'll be coming out. And I think that's one thing as a small publisher, we want to make sure that we are doing right by our developers and making sure that everything gets the time and the time for us to show them off and preview them at the right times as well.
So we're keeping it limited to that to make sure that we can really shine a no pun intended spotlight at the right times.
Gotcha. Okay. So I guess then the inevitable Project C question.
So a collaboration between Sam Barlow and Brandon Kronenberg. I suppose obviously you can't say much about the game. So I will ask, what can you say about the game?
What can you say about how that particular collaboration came together?
If you've experienced Sam's games, you know the kind of games that Sam makes. And obviously, Brandon makes really interesting horror. If you've watched Possessor or Infinity Pool, he has a very interesting approach to horror that is very unique to him.
And it's very human, but it's also very affecting. But the way that that... So when you put those two together, you have a very exciting combination of talents, really, to kind of sneak under your skin.
But the way that came about was actually, we utilised and made the most of the fact that we are Blumhouse. So that was actually, we worked with our film team. And we, you know, Ryan Turek on the film side, kind of paired up who we, you know, who we thought was going to be right.
And they made a sort of list of who would be the right fit for this. And then, you know, that was how it all came together quite sort of naturally. But we made the most of the fact that we are the, we are Blumhouse.
And that's something that we like to be able to do is, you know, we have people like James Wan, obviously Blumhouse merged with Atomic Monster. So we have James Wan, who likes to be able to give feedback on things. So we really like to be able to show everyone what we're doing on the game side.
We're certainly not siloed. We want to be able to celebrate and everyone to be able to have a look and see what we're doing and seeing what we're working on. And that kind of just felt like the sort of perfect crossover of games and film.
OK, well, that's really interesting.
It's the idea of taking these games over to these names you revere in the film space and going, what do you think of this? That's so funny. Do you get quite starstruck around when you see people who you do know from your horror film fandom?
I have managed to keep my fangirl under wraps. Nice. But I think, actually, that's a really good thing.
I think if you, someone like James, I've been watching James' movies since obviously with Saw, and then Loving Dead Silence, and everything that has come after. I think there's just something really exciting about then working with someone like that, who is just a lovely person. I think that's one thing that I've just, horror people are really, really cuddly and cosy and actually very, very sweet people.
I think people who maybe are outside the horror genre aren't particularly, they think horror is just all violence and guts and blood. But actually, I think horror people are just really empathetic. I think it was Joe Hill, Stephen King's son who said that horror is an exercise in extreme empathy and I fully agree with that.
I think that actually, I find horror a very, very safe space because usually if someone's horrible, chances are they're going to pay for it horribly by being murdered by something awful or glommed by a giant creature. You know, I hate watching, I hate watching like reality TV where people are being just heinous to each other and no one is about to be murdered, you know? So I actually think horror is a very moralistic space.
Oftentimes, that's actually just as enduring as, as much of an endurance as some of it is, I do think it's quite a cathartic and helpful space to have all of that be fiction. So yeah, horror people are great people and it turns out they're just also just lovely creative people to work with.
Nice.
I guess along similar lines Louise, like since you broke cover and talked more openly about what you're doing at Blumhouse Games, I was wondering if you had any like people from the horror film side of things like come to you and pitch things to you. Is that something you get now? Because I imagine with a lot of horror directors, they're probably in that millennial, maybe even Gen Z space where they games are going to be more of a part of their mix of interest than like it would have been for, you know, like film filmmakers who were like 50 plus maybe.
Like I was curious if that was anything that if anything had happened on that side for you.
Well, yeah, not anyone specific. But I think what's interesting is that someone like Blumhouse moving into games kind of gives people an in because they go, oh, I didn't know who to speak to in games or I didn't know how to because I think the games industry for being so big, I think people kind of look at it as maybe as a little bit of a closed entity. So maybe they're the top director in Hollywood, but actually like maybe they have a game idea, that would be great.
But they have no idea who to speak to about it. So I think it kind of rather than any specific cases, I think it kind of opens a conduit for that to be the case. Like if someone wanted to do that, that would be amazing.
So I think it gives them an in really, where previously they maybe wouldn't know who to speak to or how to do it. So I'd love that to happen. I'd love that to be with, that would be amazing.
But yeah, I do think there's just people, more people talking about having ideas for games and wanting to get into the space. Like it would be great just to be able to open those channels even more, because as I was saying, I think more creative brains in the space can only mean good things for us.
Absolutely. So last short question, Louise. So as someone who knows games, how much of the role is you being pitched up by devs versus going out and creating opportunities with people you admire?
Like I guess with Project C, for example, that feels like something that had to be put together rather than something that you were directly pitched. I might be wrong about that, but I was curious how much of it about it was being pitched versus going out and making the thing happen yourself.
I think it's a mix really. I think we really want to just platform people with really interesting creative ideas. So I do think pitches where everything is being decided, great.
But if there's someone that's looking for help in something, that's also something that we can give. So I think that's a place that we're quite fortunate in, actually, is the capacity for that. But really we're just counting on, and there's being so much of it, and there's really more than we can actually sign.
It's just people with great horror ideas, so it's kind of a balance, or if people do want that help, that's also great too, just talking to people who are having ideas in the scary space. So it's really just whatever is necessary, but there's certainly no shortage of amazing horror ideas that I've been pitched. No shortage.
The challenge is not being able to sign all of them. It's the best possible challenge, but that's the challenge is because we have a limited slate is not being able to take that on.
Yeah. Okay. That's really interesting.
Do you ever get pitched anything where you're like, oh man, that is just too extreme? Because if it's going to happen, it's going to happen in the horror space. I would think of like, that is just too much.
Or do people kind of temper it knowing that that will kind of probably do them out of a commission?
Truthfully, I don't think I've seen anything that is too much. I think people's... I think everyone's idea of that is obviously different.
Like what is your capacity? What is your level? You know, and obviously, Terrifier 3 is a really good example.
I've not seen it yet, but you know, they're giving out sick bags, and cinemas are apparently warning people, you know, if you're faint of heart, don't watch this. You know, if you feel sick, speak to a member of staff, that kind of thing. And part of that is really good marketing, and part of it is genuinely how people feel when they see really gory stuff.
And I just think like, I think interesting things in horror. I think as long as you're justified in doing something, I think that's the difference whether something is too out there. You know, I think that's the key, that's the key difference is, can you, is your, does your narrative earn you this?
If you, does this feel like a logical thing to happen? Yes, it will be shocking, but does it feel validated? Does it feel like it belongs there?
And in that case, something isn't too much. But if you've just, if you're just covering the walls and intestines just for the hell of it, you might be like, is that essential? You know, but I do think like, as long as something, as long as something is core to its story and belongs there, you might feel shocked by something, but it will, it won't be too much because it's earned and it's deserved.
And I think that's personally, you know, I think a lot of people who think that the horror genre is just those needless gore and pointlessness when actually a lot of the most effective sequences in horror that are gore are earned. They are shocking, but they're earned.
Okay, so some more frivolous questions for me. So any horror movie recommendations of late that you'd throw away? I've been actually keeping on top of horror more lately than I normally have been.
I saw that film that's all shot from the killer's perspective during the summer. That's about 80 minutes long. That was cool.
In a violent nature.
Yes. Yeah, that was very, very gory, but quite enjoyable. What else have you been watching on your side lately?
One of my absolute highlights from this year is Audity.
Is that a Shudder film?
I think it's on Shudder now. The director, Dimian McCarthy, he previously made a film called, he's Irish, he made a film called Caveat previously, which I found brilliant and terrifying. And there is a bunny in it with a symbol and it's great.
And now Audity is genuinely one of the most brilliant, tense experiences I've had in a cinema. Edinburgh Festival did, they did an amazing week of like midnight screenings of stuff. And that was one of their ones that I saw at midnight in a packed Edinburgh cinema, which was so cool.
And I think that's genuinely probably my highlight of the year. I've enjoyed things like, you know, I was looking back at all the horror this year, I've enjoyed things like Immaculate and The First Old Moon and that kind of thing. That's genuinely been, it's been a very good year.
And I've still got this, I've got plans for October watching of like Cuckoo and Strange Darling. And there's quite, and The Substance, which I still haven't seen yet, but I'm very excited to watch. So I've got a lot of, I've got a lot of horror stuff to catch up on because I've been, well, for one, I spent like 36 hours playing Astrobot of all things.
That is an horror. That's the exact opposite of horror.
Well, that's it. And that's what you need, right? And there was those really cute, spooky levels.
Yeah, I loved it. But yeah, I need to, I've got a big watch list, which I don't normally do. Normally I kind of manage to watch sort of throughout the year, but actually I kind of get to catch up this month, which will be really nice.
Do you get to see stuff through the job? You know, the Blumhouse connection, like I don't know how much crossover there is, so you might get to go to a screening or something.
Yeah, we have screenings where we watch all the new movies together, which is really cool. It's great to be able to do that.
You've really found your people. It's kind of unreal.
Yeah, it's great.
What about the horror game side of things, Louise? Has anything got your blood pumping lately?
The big one on that one is the Silent Hill 2 remake, which I think I'm about six hours into. And the funny thing is, I think six hours was about three quarters of the previous game, but I feel like I've just barely started Silent Hill 2. But it's genuinely, I think it's a really interesting exploration of video game horror because you've got 23 years in between.
So I think it's really hard to play and not kind of disconnect it from, oh, so this was what we played. This was our experience. And this was how what we expected from games and what they've changed and what they've updated and what they haven't.
And I think I'm finding it, like it's almost difficult to not put that part of my brain on and go, that's interesting. This is cool. But actually, overall, I'm just genuinely terrified of it, just as I was when I played it back then.
I find the score and the sound have just been so cranked up in a way that I find it genuinely intimidating with every step. There's no, there's no other than when you're standing, literally standing in front of a save point, I don't feel like there's any point of release where you don't feel horrified. And that's amazing.
But genuinely, like, it's a real treat to be able to play that and be so afraid. And I think there was a few moments where I was in the, I'm not, no spoilers, but there was a certain thing that had been, I think, added to the second apartment building that I found really horrifying. And, you know, that feeling of constantly unsettled is, oh, great, another thing is standing really still, made of legs, great.
But yeah, I'm having a lot of fun with that. But I think in terms of other horror experiences, like there's been some really fun, really indie horror that I've played recently. So Grun was this fun, like, evil gardening simulator, which is interesting.
Home Safety Hotline, I played that, where you play as someone who works for, initially, I think that you're telling people that, you know, they're phoning in saying that they might have rats, and you're helping them out with their rat invasion. And then as time goes on, you realize that you're actually dealing with supernatural stuff, and you're recommending them help with things that can steal their faces, and sneak out of their pipes, and steal their children. And then if you don't tell them the right thing, then they will phone you, and the thing, the awful thing might happen to them while they're on their phone saying, oh, that thing you asked me about didn't work.
And then something awful happens to them, and you feel vaguely guilty. So I've really enjoyed that too.
Did you, this is such a trite question to ask, but you are Scottish. Have you still, still wakes the deep? Have you had time for that one yet?
I have indeed. I have not played anything as Scottish. I mean, in the first 10 minutes of that game, someone used the term, the height, thinks he's the height of shite, which I haven't heard for about 20 years.
And it was so West of Scotland. And it was, it's so, it's incredible, because I've been to a few people over here, and obviously your PlayStation or your console will recognise where you are, and then it will adjust subtitles accordingly. So apparently they're just getting, the US English version just gets like, if someone gets a BAM pot or an Egypt or a wanker, then it just says, bastard is the subtitle.
It basically removes all the good Scottishness. So I love how Scottish it is. And there were some moments, I properly cried at Still Wakes the Deep, like it properly really got me.
But there was some really, really scary moments in that, that properly tapped into sort of that, the mist, like cosmic horror of something, thinking you're safe and coming outside onto a deck and realizing that there is something far bigger than you. And you're just a rat and there's something in the mist, you know, so I think it really, it really nails a lot of amazing horror feelings, like and Scottish. So yeah, I had a, I had a really good time.
I played it a little later than Release but I had a really, really good time with Still Wakes the Deep.
Yeah, absolutely. I think it's that feeling of like I can't, I cannot get off of this place. I'm stuck here.
There's just no way to leave. And then also someone will say, Boar Bag and I'm like, okay, good. Well, I'm pleased I were able to cross those two streams.
That's good.
Yeah, it felt like the most me game that way actually.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Intersection of your interests.
Okay. That's really cool Louise. Well, really appreciate you taking the time here.
You are, you literally have job stuff to go and do. And we really appreciate you setting aside an hour of your day to speak to us. It's really great to have you back on.
So I was curious, where can people find you on social media and where should people go to learn more about Blumhouse's games?
Yeah. So you can find me on Twitter and Instagram as shiny underscore demon. And you can find Blumhouse Games across all the platforms as Blumhouse Games.
And next week is our first release. So Fear the Spotlight is out on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series and Switch. So you can find that too.
And you can follow Cozy Game Pals on Twitter and Instagram. That's the developers behind that as well. So there's going to be a lot of really cool stuff coming out about that.
And I'm excited for everybody to play it.
Yeah.
But thank you so much for having me as well. It was so lovely to be back on. It's been properly big changes since last time.
And it's so cool. Thanks, guys.
Yeah, of course. Absolutely, Louise. It's an absolute pleasure and it's great to see you thriving in a job you're so perfect for.
Our boring social media stuff. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
MrBazzle, underscore pesto and MrBazzle pesto, no underscore on blue sky for toe updates.
Yeah, you can keep will give you color related updates on social media at back page pod on Twitter and blue sky. And I'm Samuel W Roberts on both those platforms, patreon.com back page pod. If you'd like to support the podcast, get two extra episodes a month.
I will not talk about what the last patron episode was because it was just better off just listening to it rather than have me explain it, I would say. That's the best sell I could do for that one. This was our 199th episode, so next week is our 200th episode.
So expect a perfectly normal one. Let's get out of here. Thank you so much for your time, Louise.
And yeah, catch you later. Bye bye.
