Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts. I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, got a couple of things to ask you about straight away. So, when I bumped into you in town the other day, I was slightly mortified, because instead of saying, gotta run to you, when I had to like speed past you and go to an American fiction screening, I said, gotta jog, which is like not something that people say. So, after I said that, I was like, oh God, I just, I hate myself.
I thought about the first probably 20 minutes of American fiction before that feeling subsided. Did you think about that encounter at all in similar ways?
Yeah, well, I was with Catherine at the time and we both turned to each other and went, that was a bit of a weird thing to say. Is that a thing you're saying now?
Did you really say that?
Yeah, we had a cold conversation about it.
Gotta jog, yeah, I just thought, oh God, it just wasn't quite right. Do you know what I mean? It was a bit incorrect, so.
Yeah, like I assumed you were in a crazy hurry because it's not something I've ever heard you say. It just sounded like extra impersonal, which made you sound maybe a little bit more cross than you were.
Oh, right, no, I wasn't cross at all. I was like, if anything, I felt guilty that I couldn't interact with you in a few minutes.
Oh, that's fine, you were worried. It felt like a no, I'm not gonna talk to you, which I guess it kind of was, but that combined with the specific phrasing.
Gotta jog, oh God, gotta jog fast, as Sonic the Hedgehog famously said.
I mean, we didn't talk about it for that long. I think by the time we'd got to the zebra crossing down by Odeon, we'd moved on to something else.
Sounds like a minute of conversation probably, it's not too...
It was about a minute of conversation, we were like, oh, that was fine. And I said, well, he's probably in a hurry for a film or something.
Yeah, so I've started doing speed runs of awards films at a little theater in Bath. I basically, I refuse to sit through the adverts anymore, and I'm pretty sure now if you time it for like exactly 15 minutes, you will always get like the last film trailer before the film starts. So I've been, the last three or four films I've seen, I've been arriving 15 minutes late, but it is like a fine line, you know what I mean?
So-
That's quite a bold move, yeah. I can understand trying to cut off the early commercials, but I'd like to see the film trailers.
Yeah, I do normally want to see them, but because I've seen so many awards films at the little theater, I've seen the same few trailers over and over again. So I've seen the trailer for Monster from Your Guys and Coriader, that guy. Yeah, he is your guy, isn't he?
And then I've seen the Taste of Things trailer and June part two, all the stuff they show, they kind of show the same few. So I don't feel massively compelled to just sit through them again.
That's a, the Taste of Things and June trailer is a deadly combo, because the Taste of Things gets your mouth all salivating over that delicious looking food, and then suddenly you're into the dry, dry desert and you have to recalibrate your mouth.
Exactly. And so yeah, that's, you know, it's a real minefield, isn't it? So yeah, that's kind of why I've been doing that.
I'm nearly at the end of that though now. I've only got like one more awardsy film to see. Actually, I do want to see the Taste of Things next week, but yeah, I'm seeing the Iron Claw after we're recording this.
That's going to date this podcast horribly. Like awards films that will probably mean nothing in two or three years, American fiction and the Iron Claw.
Is Iron Claw an awards film? I haven't really seen it in the conversation for much.
No, it missed out, but I think it was originally intended for that. But I think the wider speculation was that A24 released both that and The Zone of Interest, and The Zone of Interest was the more awardsy film. I saw that last week, last night.
And let me tell you, my friend, that is a definition of a tough hang. So, as you would expect, but really good. So yes, that's two Jonathan Blaser films.
Not The Zone of Enders, as I confusingly called it this morning.
I was so gutted we didn't record that. Matthew said, how was The Zone of Enders? And I was like, it's kind of like with a slight energy of when your dad's not really engaged with the thing that you're into.
There's a little bit of that to it. Anyway, I'm now gonna sign off every one of these podcasts with Got a Joke. So look forward to that in every episode.
Yeah.
Where did you settle on the Tango Ice Blast?
I didn't go for one. Cause the little theater, they don't actually sell the Tango Ice Blast there. So that was more of an odian concern.
But no, I decided to opt out of the Tango Blast after consulting with my panel of advisors. They gave me some good sound advice on that. So that's good.
The other thing I was going to ask you about was the tiny, well, no, the very low down chandelier made of magnifying glasses. That's like gone viral. Like the Matthew Castle version of going viral.
That's gone viral. How's that been for you?
Yeah, it's great. I mean, I'm not going to lie. When I had my picture taken next to it, I thought this feels like it could be 100 likes on Twitter.
And it was, it was.
And it was. What I liked about it is that my brother's new apartment in Bristol is quite like my old flat, which in Bath, which famously had, I say famously, in my small circle of friends had a chandelier, which was a real burden because I had to change so many light bulbs in it. So I like that he's now afflicted with a apartment that has its own weird chandelier.
His chandelier is weird in so many other ways. Yeah, it's incredibly low. I mean, it's hanging at torso level and the kitchen, I mean, it's a high ceiling apartment.
So the rooms are maybe like three meters tall.
Right.
So it's hanging down a good two meters in the middle of the room. Everyone has to walk around it. I guess if you put a table under it, it wouldn't look quite as odd, but they haven't.
So it's just hanging there in the middle of the room. It looks like a trap that had triggered at some point and now it's just a non-aligned dormant.
A Resident Evil kind of thing.
Yeah. A bit like when Indiana Jones goes through the grail temple in The Last Crusade, deactivating all the traps. It's a bit like that.
It feels like Indiana Jones has already been through that kitchen. That's the energy of it. Yeah, and the other strange thing is that it is made from hundreds of tiny magnifying glasses, which he had told me.
And I'd just gone, oh, well, I guess when I see it, that will make sense. But when I saw it, I was like, oh no, that's like loads of tiny little, I mean, hundreds of things. You can unclip them really easily.
So it looks like it's, I mean, is it a chandelier or is it actually a sort of display case for tiny magnifying glasses? I don't know.
Yeah, it's a great picture. And for people who have missed out on this, on the hilarity, I have retweeted it on the Back Page: Pod Twitter account. So, now it's out there.
It does look like the sort of front cover to your concept album, do you know what I mean? It's like magnifying light, the sort of like prog rock album by Matthew Castle and the Castles or something like that. You know what I mean?
There's like, there's that vibe. I also like the idea that there's something like odd chandeliers are sort of like a generational curse for the Castle family. Like, you know, you've got ancestors going back, have always had to deal with like the slight inconvenience of a weird chandelier.
So, anyway.
It's like a much more tame version of Eternal Darkness.
I was going to say, I like that chandelier when it clobbered Leon S. Kennedy on the head. That was, that was tough for him.
So, yeah, good stuff.
It looks like something that Benoit Blanc would have in his house.
What with Hugh Grant? That's their canonical pairing, isn't it? That they're, I see that means Hugh Grant will be in the third one.
Anyway, yes, good stuff. So, that content is out there for you to find. Great picture of Matthew Castle with lots of tiny magnifying glasses.
I saw that and I thought, that's good. That deserves a fab. I fabbed it.
Then I saw 140 other people had done the same thing and I thought, good for him. The memory of the Borgon tweet is sort of like stricken from the record.
There's a very thin line between a Borgon tweet and a magnifying chandelier tweet. There for the grace of God, guy.
Right then, this podcast, the PlayStation One Draft or PlayStation Draft is more accurate, really. I'm sure Purus would hate me saying that. People on Twitter have been trying to call it the PSX Draft.
I don't think it was ever called PSX. I think that was like a, maybe it was a working title like that. And some 90s mags called it PSX.
But for the purposes of this podcast, PlayStation Draft is what we're going with. So, Matthew, I've roped you into this. This is definitely like the, I would say along with the PSP and the PS3, the draft I've bullied you into the most.
And you didn't want to go, but you have been like brought kicking and screaming into the light. What is the deal here for you and the PS1?
Very simply, I didn't have one. I haven't made any effort in my adult life to go back and get to grips with it. Something has to give.
You can't know about everything, he said, while the listeners roll their eyes. But given the size and importance of PlayStation, I imagine lots of people will be surprised how very little I know about it and how little experience I have with it. I mean, yeah, it just feels like a bit of a, a lot of what I'm gonna be saying is gonna sound slightly fortunate.
The funny thing is, I think this is the only draft we've done where neither of us owned the console while it was out. Right. I think that's the first time we've tried to do that.
So, that is quite ambitious and it does mean that, yeah, like maybe people might sense the odd knowledge gap, that sort of thing. I feel reasonably confident with it for a few reasons. One, a lot of the games, a lot of the key games have been re-released on the other platforms.
And two, I did discover a lot more of this catalogue when I had a PlayStation 2, so that was the key thing. That was when I went back and sort of like discovered the cream of the crop and I knew a lot of friends who had them too. So, you know, that's my kind of way into it.
But for you, it's been a lot trickier, hasn't it?
Yeah, I've had to call on some favors from fans and people with expertise to help, not fans of mine, some fans of PlayStation, to give me some pointers. I've had to, like, you know, I'm gonna come clean. Most of the things I'm hoping to pick, I've not played.
So I've been watching playthroughs on YouTube. I've been basically trying to like, sort of like swatting for an exam for a class that I just didn't pay attention in for 25 years. And now I'm like, shit, it's finally the exam.
I wish I'd known about PlayStation. Trying to remember things that I'd read in Games Master. Cause I felt like I was relatively on top of it, like at the time through Games Master.
But a lot of these games, like all the ones I could think of were just shit things that you would never pick, like nightmare creatures and things like that. So yeah, it's weird what has stuck and what hasn't stuck, but we'll see what happens. I'm basically trying to set this up so that if I get absolutely thrashed on, it doesn't look too bad for me.
Yeah, I think that's it. I think you just have to go into it thinking the stakes are quite low. Do you know what I mean?
It's not like, I can't take things you love because you don't love any of this. So yeah, that's good.
Yeah, I just, I always feel on this podcast that like admitting any lack of knowledge, it feels like you're sort of opening yourself up for like, well, if you don't know about that, why should I listen to you about anything? And I know that's preposterous because we've proven time and time again, or at least I hope we've proven time and time again that we do know what we're talking about in our areas of expertise. But you know what the internet's like?
It's that kind of, oh, you got this one thing wrong, so everything you've ever said was wrong.
The thing is, like, we've never really been challenged on that sort of thing by people. I think that our long-term listeners understand that we have knowledge gaps that are simply related to our age or our availability of, you know, access to certain consoles. So we don't get a lot of shit for that, you know?
I've seen some of that sentiment around some of the Sega stuff in the past. Yeah, but it's like, oh, kind of surprised, you know, sort of disappointed, sort of disappointed they don't know about Dreamcast. And obviously that I've met with, you know, I tried to get around that and make myself feel better by painting all Dreamcast like as fundamentally bad people.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And that's how I've dealt with it. It's kind of harder to do that for PlayStation because obviously it's a massive ongoing concern.
100 million people if you're writing off that.
100 million people can't be wrong, or can they? No, they probably aren't.
Yeah, so it's an interesting one in the sense that, yes, it does test our knowledge a little bit more, I suppose. So it's not the, I don't have the innate PS1 knowledge that I do for the PS2, for example, where it was very, very easy in that draft for me to conjure 10, 20, maybe even 30 games that I could talk about. Here, well, I actually, no problem with 10, and I can make it to 20, but if I had to go deeper than that, I think I would struggle in terms of having a, you know, that sort of really deep understanding of the hardware and the software.
Well, actually, I get what the deal was, but it just wasn't happening in real time to me because I was playing PC games at the time. That's the reality of me and the PS1. But yeah, you know, we've kind of like found our way around the sort of knowledge gap thing anyway.
We're just drafting a ringer like Ashley Day to talk about the Dreamcast, and then we don't have to worry about it. But when there's no ringers to start us, it's a bit more like, oh, I guess we've got, well, just a sink or swim, I guess. But yeah, I think it'll be a good episode.
The categories are good. The catalog of games is so vast that inevitably there's a couple of things in there that you've played, Matthew. I mean, I know there's at least two games that you have played on PS1 that you might want to draft.
So probably some more besides that. It is a genuinely interesting console to discuss because it was a seismic shift in the games industry, and the types of games that are being made just changed overnight. It was the birth of 3D games.
So there's lots to talk about, Matthew. I think it'll be good. So yes, are you ready for my very lengthy preamble?
Yeah. So OK, my source on this is a piece I mentioned a couple of weeks ago with when Jeremy was on, which is the edge feature on the making of PlayStation, which I believe was in the 200th issue. I think it's 2009, something like that.
And I essentially read that and cross checked it with a couple of other sources, just because some parts of the PlayStation story are so bizarre, so strange. They almost sound like early 90s, kind of like corporate fiction, where you can't find video sources for this stuff as you would in the 360 draft. Most of the stuff is available.
Much of this is just written down and is communicated from people at the time. So it's quite wild. It's quite a strange story.
I'm waiting for the inevitable Aaron Sorkin film based on this.
Yeah, it's a console built out of spite, basically. That's which is an amazing reason to do anything. I've always believed that spite is a very powerful motivator.
But on this scale, the scale of revenge story it is, I mean, it's a very sort of like-
From sprites to spite. That's the tagline for the film.
Two star Apple TV movie energy, that one. That's much like the Tetris movie, which is quite entertaining. But yeah.
So it's a really interesting story of a company being basically sort of like spurned into action by, you know, some sort of like bad faith deal making essentially. And it results in the games industry changing forever. So I'll get into it, Matthew.
You probably won't talk for a while, but you can jump in every now and then with a quip, which is what I've come to depend on you.
What I'll do is I'll go, mm, mm, every like 20 seconds, because I know people like that.
I've come to depend on you for like wacky quips every five minutes as well. That's like definitely one of the USPs you bring to this podcast, so definitely jump in. So, yeah, so essentially, Origins of the PlayStation.
It was originally a project for Nintendo. A lot of people would know this. At CES 1991, Ken Kutaragi, who had been an employee at Sony since 1971, revealed a disc-based add-on for the SNES to the world.
And one day later, Nintendo kills the partnership and teams up with Philips instead. The disagreement was over royalties. It was, I think it was to read about, it sounds a bit like Sony was demanding a bit too much from Nintendo.
And without that in place, went ahead and announced the hardware. I believe they were happy with the hardware, but that royalty element of it just hadn't been figured out. And because the SNES was such a tightly controlled platform by Nintendo, it essentially created some real headaches there and some problems between the companies.
So it's quite rare for this sort of thing to happen in Japanese business culture is my understanding that like, this is the sort of thing that happens in America all the time. And you're like, yeah, that guy, you know, it's like, it's all kind of for lulz, and it doesn't matter if someone's like a massive bastard. But in Japan, I think this is like, you talked about this before, they still have the concept of shame, which we in the Western world have decided to move on from in the past 15 years.
So again, I was sort of a bit like, did this definitely happen this way? And it sounds like it did, but Norio Oga, who was the president of Sony, I really hope I'm pronouncing his name right there. If I'm not, I apologize.
Saying Oga over and over again and getting it wrong would be embarrassing. Let's hope so. Insisted that they stay in the race and essentially gave Kutaragi some 3D graphics wizards who'd been building this broadcasting technology.
And they went from there basically in terms of like building the building, I think there's something like they had these 3D workstations where they were like, let's ball this down into a games console essentially. That's as technical as I can get. This is not Digital Foundry.
There's a great extract in this edge piece. When Oga asked what sort of chip it would require, Kutaragi replied it would need 1 million gate arrays, a number that made Oga laugh. Sony's production could only achieve 100,000.
But Kutaragi slightly counted with, are you going to sit back and accept what Nintendo did to us? The reminder enraged Oga all over again. So, interesting stuff there, I just, you know, again, like it's one of those things where I, I couldn't find another source for that exact quote, but I want to believe that happened because that's like, you know, that is pure sorkin, isn't it really?
Are you going to accept what Nintendo did to us?
So, Kutaragi was moved to Sony Music because there's a lot of internal politics over getting into games at Sony. Basically, there was an old guard who saw games as toys and saw the market as not their market. Essentially, they were like this sort of like powerhouse, electronics manufacturer, but they were determined to, Sony's president was determined to make this happen.
Kutaragi moved to Sony Music where there was fewer internal politics and founded SCEI, so Sony Computer Entertainment International.
Sony Music was big on spending money to launch things and attracting big talent. They were essentially this more ambitious, faster moving part of the company that were not weighed down by the old guard. At least that's how it was framed in the piece I was reading about.
There are a few other key players who come into this. Interestingly, there's a writer who was once nominated for the Icelandic Literature Prize, at least according to the edge piece called Olaf Olafsson, he was made president of the newly founded SCE Umbrella company that this company sat under. There are another really key figure, Terry Tokinaka, who would run SCEI later on.
Tokinaka brought the vision that Sony's appeal had to be twofold. It had to be the business choice and the creative choice for publishers. It couldn't be one or the other.
To succeed, it had to be seen as the console you want to develop for, then also just has the capacity to sell millions and millions of units. They knew that to crack this market, they essentially needed both. Then the console, about two years after the CES unveiling, and then the big Nintendo fallout, in summer 1993, they greenlight the console.
It's a CD-ROM based console, which is perfect for Sony who were printing millions of CDs at the time. Was it Discman, the CD player? Whatever it was.
Yeah. Hugely important music-based hardware. It made sense that it was CDs.
Sony's advantage was that developers and publishers were ready for a change from the 16-bit era where Nintendo and Sega were super restrictive about what you could do, about how their games were released, and what was released, that sort of thing. They just controlled this market. They essentially set a bunch of evangelists out to sell the dream of PlayStation to the industry and made it clear to them that they could control their own supply infrastructure, which Nintendo controlled on its own hardware because obviously making carts is quite expensive, and there were restrictions to how many you could print, when you could print them, that sort of thing.
I saw a quote from Mark Cerny saying that on a cart-based game before people switched to CD-ROMs, you were lucky to make like a dollar per sale. And then sort of relatively with discs, he said that would raise to like $10 per sale to give an idea of like the gulf between the two formats.
Yeah, that's a great, great bit of research, Matthew. I appreciate that. I hope you got more nuggets like that as we go.
Or is that literally it?
No, I've got a couple of little nuggets.
No, that's good. That is useful. But again, it illustrates right why there was a there was like hunger for for change.
And I think it's worth noting because obviously third party publishers and developers would be such a massive part of Sony's success on the original PlayStation that, you know, just that the fact that they were so willing to make that that jump to new hardware was just, yeah, it was just a sign of the times, essentially. So developers love the hardware, but we're nervous about reaching players. And in 1994, at a hotel in Tokyo, Sony basically unveiled this phalanx of marketing bots and basically said, we're going to go out and sell your games, essentially, like we're not going to, you know, it's sort of like, we're Sony, we know what we're doing with with marketing and we, you know, we're building this team to do that.
It's interesting, so Edgepiece frames the success of PlayStation as a marketing one, as well as a, you know, it was the right hardware for the right time, which is, I think is true. And that applies in the developer side too. So publishers signed up, apparently, before royalty fees were even discussed.
That's how keen they were for this, which is interesting because he really does suggest like a, you know, a fair bit of sort of like apprehension towards where Nintendo was at the time. The other advantage of Sony is there was explosion of PC software on CDs in the early 90s, where, you know, developers were starting to use FMVs, that sort of thing, and, you know, 3D graphics and the kind of like look of games was advancing. And in parallel, having a console that where you were sort of like you could, you could, you had the similar capabilities in terms of, you know, FMVs, that sort of thing, which you couldn't easily do on a cartridge meant that it was another kind of like factor that made them an easier choice for developers.
And it was, but it was breaking out of the cartridge lead sign that really worked in Sony's advantage. So the developers essentially couldn't react to demand with Sega and Nintendo's hardware. They were just sort of like bound by the very tightly controlled supply infrastructure.
Printing CDs was just very cheap and easy to do. So again, like if a game was a big success, you could flood the market with more, with more disks. So again, another factor working in their favor.
There's quite one quite interesting thing I read actually, there was a PlayStation oral history in Game Informer. And as part of it, they'd obviously talked to a lot of PlayStation's current first party like in-house developers about what they thought at the time. So there was a guy from Guerrilla saying, you know, the talk, you know, talking about the benefits of a disk based format and things like that.
And one of the interesting ones was, you know, a lot of these people who were working with PlayStation now got on board at PlayStation 1 and were there from the start. An exception being Sucker Punch, who obviously famously entered the market on N64 rather than PlayStation 1.
Rocket Robot Wheels.
And they were saying that they could see all the benefits of the PlayStation 1 and that it allowed for like, you know, amazing music and video sequences and like, you know, the really, really polished art. But they were like, those weren't our strengths. We didn't have the skill set to make a game for that.
As programmers, we were better, like, to try and work in the constraints of the N64. Like, where our skills worked was in, like, maximizing the power of a more challenging development environment, if that makes sense. So they were like, rather than try and compete, you know, on the terms that PlayStation was competing on, we decided to go N64 first, even though we could see the advantages of that, which I thought was kind of interesting, given what happens to Sucker Punch going forward.
Yeah, yeah. That's a, you know, again, really, really good insight. Did most people echo the sort of like sentiment that the cartridges were just too restrictive, that it was just too hard to sort of like make?
Oh, yeah, it was, it was, yeah, having to commit to say, you know, they were like, you couldn't be reactive if something was doing better, you know, it was much harder to kind of produce them at speed. And, you know, you just had so much more control over what you were publishing and printing, which was just like that, that's, that's the I think maybe that is like the radical shift, which like powers most of this.
Yeah, I think so. And it's, it's, it's also just I think that the capability to like do proper 3D graphics as well. That's just really appealing.
So developers want you to make that jump. So yeah, I mean, you know, it's obviously a key thing that happens with with PlayStation is a square jumps across, we'll talk about this a bit more soon. But like the, again, the the software, what what they what they did in Final Fantasy seven was essentially using every single thing that PlayStation could do right from the 3D visuals to the FMVs.
These are things they wanted to to put in the game to having the music sound as good as it did. It was just it was just very appealing. It seemed to just fit the bill for so many developers.
So yeah, that makes sense. But hey, Rocket Robot Wheel was a banger, Matthew.
It is a banger. It is a banger.
This is how the culture shift sort of happens. It is all about sort of like the ease of working with PlayStation. There are just so many reasons to that they kind of tick the box essentially versus sort of like picking the path of least resistance, I guess.
So yeah, so a lot of devs made the jump. And apparently another factor in that was there was a lack of competition or at least a perceived lack of competition in the sense that Sony had no in-house studios whatsoever. It changed in 1993 when they acquired Cygnosis, who were still allowed to publish games on other platforms themselves.
That's how you end up with G-Police on PC or Wipeout 64, for example. But they were dependent on external partners. But again, that was part of the appeal.
They weren't on SNES or N64. You were up against Nintendo themselves, master game developers. So really interesting again, that's seen as another plus in their favor.
So when the PlayStation launches in December 1994 in Japan, only has Ridge Racer as a notable launch title. The rest are very forgettable. It sold 300,000 within a month and it was sold at a loss, which again, was another contentious thing that Kitaragi had to fight.
He was like, we have to get into this market and this is the price we pay, but we'll make it back on software. And that's essentially the mentality all console manufacturers go by now. Maybe not Nintendo, they might still sell hardware at a profit, I'm not sure.
But certainly it's fairly well known that most of the most recent hardware has been sold at a loss because, yeah, you sell games and therefore it's worth it. So, another key thing that happens ahead of the US launch in 1995, there's the moment on stage at Sony's E3 conference where they go 299 just as a Saturn, basically like sort of shadow drops at 399. And that basically kills Saturn at the moment.
It's one of those great sort of like E3 sort of like stories that people tell. And apparently that was not fully signed off within Sony and there was a little bit of a little bit of consternation internally about saying 299 on stage. But hey, it really sort of, it really kind of like worked for them, obviously.
So Saturn was basically annihilated in that moment. And it's interesting because the PlayStation name was apparently contentious within Sony. They'd actually bought the rights to it from Yamaha, which was quite interesting.
But like again, like Ogre again, hope I'm saying his name right. If I'm not, fuck it out. But basically, again, like the name, so spent a bunch of money to get that name.
And you know, I think PlayStation is a great name. It's sort of like it really, really does everything. Maybe it's because we have so much history with it.
But I don't know. I think at the time as well, it just tells you what it is. And the name is pretty.
Yeah, again, in this Game Informer piece, Andrew House, who was more involved in marketing, I think, at the time, said that there was a big push to call it PSX specifically in America, but they were very like, it has to be a universal global name.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is interesting. That makes sense. This sounds like a good feature.
Have you got any more bits and pieces to add here, Matthew? This sounds useful.
They did say, interestingly, it had, oh, God, what's his name? Who's the guy who does the PlayStation, like, more recently, who's heading up, like, the PlayStation Indie stuff?
Oh, is it Shuhei Ishida?
Yeah, that's it. Shuhei Ishida was talking about, in that first year of release before it was out in the West, it didn't feel like a sure thing that it was going to, like, beat Saturn. Apparently, Saturn, like, had a much stronger Christmas than it did in Japan, and they were all kind of shitting it a bit, which maybe then inspires what happens at E3, maybe.
He didn't say that in the article, but you could see that that may be happening.
Yeah, that's possibly part of it. And the other way in which Sony was quite forward-thinking is they built an audience in Europe, they built a market in Europe. And my understanding was that Sega and Nintendo at the time saw Europe as a bit of an afterthought.
And I think that probably bears out in how long we had to wait for some of the games here, right? And so, yeah, I think that that kind of tracks, whereas Sony was like, this is a massive market. It's, you know, potentially as big as the US.
And, yeah, essentially, once the generation was over, the US and Europe sold a similar amount of PlayStation, so they were ahead of the game on that as well. So, yeah, so it launches in the US on the 9th of September 1995, sold 800,000 units before the end of the year, like a sizable success. And then launched later in September in Europe as well, performed similarly well.
So it was like a big deal out of the gate. It was, yeah, it was, you know, it definitely sort of snowballs. But even at the start, people were ready for this thing.
Number of publishers who embraced Sony was enormous. Pretty much every Japanese publisher, most notably Square, sort of like jumped aboard. And it's a sign that everyone was ready for change, like I say.
So that's basically what I've got in the making of PlayStation, Matthew. So again, like it's a Nintendo add-on that they just decide to turn into like the core foundation of their business and becomes like such a big deal. There are some years where PlayStation is responsible for 90 percent of Sony's profits.
That's like a boast that Phil Harrison put in this piece that I was reading. So yeah, really, really interesting. But the sort of like obviously the games are what make the hardware.
And I think the thing that defines PlayStation is it brings gaming into the 3D age and it got more types, more different types of people to play a larger array of games than they ever had previously. And I think that sort of combined thing of just this is what this is kind of like what 3D games look like to a massive audience and this flood of things that people had never seen before just makes it feel like just a fundamental shift in the games that were made and sold and played. Like it just this is a moment where games change forever.
Do you think that's a fair way of putting the PlayStation's legacy?
Definitely. Like, you know, I remember when it came out and, you know, like I say, reading about it in Games Master, it felt like a new audience was being targeted with it. It felt like a console for older gamers.
And, you know, part of the reason I didn't have any interaction with it or much desire to have one at the time was it was well targeted at people who weren't me. And a lot of the genres that were big on it were not necessarily genres I was particularly into, you know, and like there isn't actually much crossover in terms of like which genres the N64 and the PlayStation excelled at. They kind of conquered different realms quite clearly, which feels, you know, at the time I would have said, oh, that's a weakness of PlayStation is it didn't really speak to me as a lover of platformers and adventure games.
But actually, you know, it was quietly building 100 million sales elsewhere, you know, people who wanted, you know, Tekken and Wipeout and whatnot, which just didn't speak to me. So, yeah, it's but it's kind of hard to see things outside of your bubble when you're that young, I think.
The genres that mattered on PlayStation, I think you're right. It's a different set of genres to what succeeds on N64. A tiny bit of crossover in racing games, a huge part of games at this time, or sports games, for example.
But like fighting games, arcade experiences generally, RPG, survival horror. These are all like a massive deal on PlayStation. Even music games, music based games, which were a bit of a newer, newer sort of idea.
So, yeah, that's yeah, those essentially the other genres that do thrive on PlayStation. I mean, you know, platformers sort of more debatable, but we can we can.
Listen, I know there are loads of platformers on there, but really, and this isn't just me being an asshole, but like if you think the platforming genre on PlayStation can compete with the platforming genre in N64, you're deluded. That's that's an insane stance.
Well, I think I agree with you. I think they're just like the very highest end platformers were on were on Nintendo's hardware. You'd expect that from Nintendo, wouldn't you?
That's like that's kind of like all they had.
OK, yeah, exactly. So Matthew, we've kind of got a bit of it there. So your personal relationship to the PlayStation, what is it?
Is it very limited, like you say?
Yeah, it's basically as limited as I've laid out. I had a couple of friends who had them. So if there were things that I kind of coveted through, you know, reading magazines, you know, I would hope friends would get them or have a demo and a couple of the games that I'm trying to get in the draft, which we'll talk about later.
You know, I have very clear memories of playing them after school at friends' houses and particularly things which were a bit more adult and violent. You know, there weren't sort of heaps of that on the N64, so they seem very attractive. You know, there are a couple of things which were like obviously sort of definitive PlayStation 1 games, but you know, I did eventually play on PC.
You know, that's probably an indicator of where I was at with it, is that we, you know, we waited for PC ports of Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII rather than entertain the thought of getting a PlayStation 1. It wasn't a thing we could make happen, you know, we had an N64, the idea of us having both consoles. That felt a little unheard of at the time.
Like, you would be an opulent motherfucker if you had two consoles.
Yeah, I knew one kid who had both and he was a child of divorce and he had a N64 at his mum's house and a PlayStation at his dad's house. I was like, that's it, that's how you get both. You know, your parents need to basically divorce.
My parents were divorced and we had an N64 that we took between the two houses.
You were swindled then, my friend. Like, it was more you should have demanded. It was quite an interesting kid.
He was quite wayward, he used to set fire to leaves and stuff like that. He was a bit like, is this kid definitely okay? Anyway, he seems to have grown up into an adult with children.
I won't name him, obviously, but yes. So, yeah, so it's interesting actually, because I think this is something I'm going to ask you about, but I knew more kids who had an N64 than a PlayStation. And I don't know if that's because of how it was targeted.
I knew one family who's like the older brother had a PlayStation, and the younger brother had the N64. But N64 was more of a fixture of my life, because I think that, and people might disagree with this listing, I think the N64 just had like this five to ten games that were incredibly sticky and replayable. And so you would just end up playing GoldenEye more than you would end up playing anything else on PlayStation that's similar.
There's a few exceptions to that, and I don't want to give my hand too much away in the draft, but there were a few fighting games or racing games where maybe we did do a bit past the pad and stuff like that. But nothing that really compares to GoldenEye or Mario Kart in terms of how pervasive a part of our young lives that was, like how much multiplayer we did with those games. So that was interesting.
But I did know a bunch of kids still who had PlayStations, and it was like being exposed to this whole world of completely different stuff. Like the N64 and PS1 libraries are vastly different. They are like just, you know, just like night and day, really.
They're basically alternate realities to each other, just like completely different. Like the RPGs, for example, they don't really exist on N64. That's basically like, you know, there's like two or three, and that's it on N64.
Whereas on PlayStation, that's an absolutely massive genre. Like a key memory for me is seeing a friend walking around Wall Market at Final Fantasy VII and me being like, what's that? And even seeing like a TV advert of Cloud on the motorcycle and on like, I don't know, morning TV or something, and being like, what is that game?
And, you know, and there was a little bit of that. There was, I knew kids who had chipped PlayStation, so I played absolutely tons of games as a result of that. Like piracy was a massive problem on this console.
And I knew like a kid who had a box of like 40 games. And that's the other thing that I think separates N64 and PlayStation, Matthew, is that N64, we talked about this, you would have about 10 games and you'd have like one Xena Warrior Princess sized duff game in there and the rest would be like all classics. PlayStation, I feel like people tend to have like 20 to 30 PlayStation games and you would have more duff ones within that because, you know, they had budget, price, range.
You could get games quite cheaply on PlayStation, obviously, because they were disc-based games. Is that how you sort of perceived the library whenever you came into contact with a friend who would have a PlayStation that you would see like some of the sort of like top series in there, but you would also see a load of nonsense as well?
Yeah, definitely. For some reason, when you were saying that, what popped into my head was like a slightly manky version of Worms on PlayStation, which we've obviously been playing on the Amiga. Yeah, I was definitely aware that PlayStation had like loads more games than the N64.
But I definitely agree with what you're saying about like the stickiness of it. Weirdly, I don't know if this really answers the question, but like if you go just a couple of years older than me, I think it does shift quite dramatically. Like at work, there are people who are in, you know, say 40 or 41.
And for them, you know, like PlayStation was part of maybe their sixth form college and university experience, where it just, you could see it fitting in way more there and making sense in like a dorm room, maybe more than like a kiddyish Nintendo 64. Just the name Nintendo is like a bit of a like lamer thing to kind of have at university in the 90s. And those people were obsessively playing like Tekken 3 or, you know, like we've had people who, you know, our peers on this podcast who are a couple of years older than us, and they had big PlayStation experiences at university like Simon Park and Ellie and, you know.
Yeah, absolutely.
It does. I think it is just, you know, I feel like I'm just two years, two years too young. But yeah, going back to the nature of the collections, definitely like the people I knew who had PlayStation, they all had like wildly different collections.
Like me and my friends who had the N64, we basically all owned the same N64 games, where like, you know, I remember one of my sister's friends had a PlayStation, they had all this like weird license shit. And then there was a guy in the year above us who had a PlayStation and he had all the kind of violent stuff. And it felt like, I don't know, it almost felt like you could have individual tastes, could begin forming a bit more on PlayStation.
Yeah, I think that's probably true. It's just so much more to choose from, both good and bad. I mean, I felt like the games that were sort of like the license rubbish that was flooding the Mega Drive went to PlayStation instead, you know what I mean?
That's sort of like where, yeah, those games go and live on PlayStation, but so does everything else basically. The library was deep enough that you might end up with a weird 7 out of 10 something that ends up becoming like the foundation of your taste. And then suddenly you're the guy who's on forums talking about how good Bushido played is, you know what I mean?
That sort of happens. One thing I want to ask about, was that version of Worms Mankey on PlayStation? I thought it was a pretty good version, if I recall.
That's how I got to know that one.
I played loads of Worms on the Amiga and I actually, when I said that, I remembered that when I went home from university, like, somehow, what was the very, what was like the last, cheapest PlayStation one that was ever released? Like, it was really small.
Yeah, it was PS1, that was how it was branded basically.
But yeah, one of those had surfaced in our house at some point and I remember them playing Worms on that. No, it's fine, like, it's Worms, isn't it? But like, I just remember it looking and, I don't know, maybe like it felt better with a mouse.
This is where you say there's mouse support on PS1.
No, I have no idea. I just, I know it's got like the little FMVs of the Worms getting messed up or whatever and some of the, I think there's some brief FMVs when you lose in that game or something like that, but no, I was just curious. I thought like, were you a big, you were suddenly going Digital Foundry on the Worms?
Oh no, no, it wasn't like that. Nothing like that. Anecdotally, I remember looking at it on TV and going, hmm, that looks a bit rubbish.
Yeah, I don't think, I don't think I perceive much of a difference, but anyway. Okay. So, yeah, okay, so right then, looking back then, do you think this is a great catalogue of games, Matthew, especially as someone who was not there at the time?
How do you think it's held up over time and how much of it would you want to play now?
Uh, yeah, I mean, yeah, I wouldn't say, I don't think it's an all-timer. Like, quite compared to some. I mean, it definitely has some absolutely, like, essential classics there, some really important stuff.
I think part of the problem is maybe a lot of it, like, lives on in other, like, forms or I came to it on other formats and things like that, which maybe impacts it. I don't know. Is that going to be a wildly unpopular take?
I think it is an old timer. I think it's just it's like wide and deep in the way that the PlayStation 2's catalogue was. I think that where it maybe differs from something like the PS2 is that the number of games you would actually want to play now is a lot smaller.
And I think this applies to N64 as well, where it's like the earliest days are 3D and therefore, you know, is it that appealing to go back to before we figured out how you do controls for, like, first person shooters?
I think that's probably a better way of putting it. I don't really see the appeal now. Yes, at the time, yeah, of course, right.
You know, this is laying the foundations for how lots of genres are going to work in 3D. And I absolutely get that. Maybe just with my 2024 vision, I'm like, I could probably live without most of this stuff.
Or I'm just so familiar with it that it doesn't jump out. Yeah, I still can't quite get over that. I just think that a lot of the genres where big leaps were being made just are still things that I'm not hugely into.
Like in my heart, I'm just not really a big early PlayStation person.
Right, right. I think there's some genres that hold up better than others. I think RPGs are where the platform just really sings.
There are just so many RPGs on this console. That is an easier genre to revisit now. In recent years, we've seen Chrono Cross come back, for example, and obviously the Final Fantasy games have been excavated and republished elsewhere, the three mainline entries and tactics as well.
There's a lot of cult-ish RPGs on PlayStation as well, like Xenogears and the.
SquareSoft alone, so many games, and even in recent years we've talked about that game, Racing Lagoon, that had been translated like a car racing RPG made from SquareSoft at the time too. I think that stuff has aged well. I think there are a few reasons to go back and play a fighting game from the time or a racing game from the time, that sort of thing.
I think that's true for the N64 as well. There are very few N64 games I would want to play now. There's probably just as many PlayStation games that I'd play now as N64 games, honestly.
I think it's very much a kind of like, you pick the cream of the crop and play those or the ones you have nostalgia for. But I will say, I will definitely underline, I think this is a great catalogue. And I think that this is definitely like, at the time, I think N64 felt like where my sort of heart belonged at the time.
Like I wanted GoldenEye so badly, Lylat Wars. I just loved all those kind of games. But PlayStation felt like more than half of what was going on in games was happening on PlayStation.
I felt like it was just so loud as a format. How much of how the PlayStation was perceived as a more mature console versus the N64 was about marketing versus the reality of what each system offered?
It's quite sort of interlinked. Like they were definitely marketing it as that. But then I think they had the games to back it up.
I can remember reading about Wipeout and them talking about the licensed soundtrack. But to me, I was like, well, I fucking hate that music. Why would I ever want to listen to that?
It might be cool, but it is not for me. Where other people would go, here's something which is positioning itself as it's part of the young adult or adult culture in the same way that, you know, some music, film, TV was at the time. And here was a game which, like, you know, not to single it out, but, you know, literally has, you know, you know that cool music you listen to in the clubs?
It's in this game, like, it has the chops. It is that, you know, that weird place where, you know, those ties between this new gaming division and, like, the older music division and its understanding of what was cool and what worked. And they're kind of one and the same.
Like, it's almost as effective, or if it is as effective as, you know, when, you know, Nintendo change direction with Wii and DS and they have the game library to actually speak to the people they're marketing at, you know, like, it doesn't always happen that way. You know, people try and sell things however they can, you know, to have such, like, unity of, like, messaging and product is actually quite rare.
There's a lot that defines the PlayStation games at the time. Music is definitely part of it. That sort of, like, drum and bass kind of sound that you get in so many games.
Playing, like, G-Police or, like, a Ridge Racer game, like, the music is just so distinctive. There are loads of, like, playlists on YouTube that sum up this kind of, like, soundscape, you know, and just have, like, a bunch of it back to back. And you realize that that was the sound of PlayStation.
It was so distinctive and such a powerful part of what the console offered. So, yeah, I think it was... I think it was born out in the games that were released.
But there was definitely, like, the marketing was definitely part of it. The marketing sort of, like, solidified the dream of what the game sold, which is what marketing is supposed to do. So, yeah, I think it did a good job of positioning games as cool and mature.
It's just such a different proposition to either the Mega Drive or the Nintendo. Like, even the way the Mega Drive was marketed was quite juvenile in some ways, particularly in the US. That's not to say that I think the games are, but, like, yeah, you just see the difference in what they're going for and who they're targeting, for sure.
Yeah, okay, so both consoles had quite distinctive 3D aesthetics, Matthew. I was going to try and bore this down as, like, N64 was, like, blurry-ass 3D. But, like, but quite, but a little bit more detailed and pretty, whereas PS1 was, like, not blurry, but, like, that wall is vibrating 3D.
Yeah.
Where, like, yeah, and everything looks less detailed. Does that kind of sum up the aesthetics of these consoles quite nicely?
Yeah, PS1 is definitely sharper, but has whatever the fuck was going on with textures in those games. Like, it was all a bit wobbly.
Yeah.
Yeah, N64 softer, but sort of, like, felt maybe a bit more sort of solid and real underneath.
Yeah, it's a weird one. I think just, yeah, the vibrating walls thing, it's just like... That's just like how, when I think of, like, the wall textures in Shadow Moses, I just think of them, like, sort of, like, popping in and out a little bit.
And, yeah, yeah, it's definitely...
But then, I don't know, in time, like, you become quite affectionate for that look, you know?
Yeah, definitely.
Like, it's so of its own. Like, you know... A lot of N64 stuff, when you go back to them, they look quite, like, rough now.
You know, they're quite hard work. And I kind of... I'm almost less put off by PlayStation, even though I didn't really have that connection with it at the time.
You know, it sort of feels deliberate in a way.
Yeah, I think when they did the 3DS ports of the two Zelda N64 games, I felt like the effort made there to meet me more than halfway was very welcome. You know what I mean? Likewise, playing like Perfect Dark and GoldenEye on 360, you know?
Or Xbox Series X. So, yeah. Okay, cool.
So, yeah, I think that's definitely part of it, is how those games looked was quite different because of the limitations of the hardware. We'll briefly discuss the official PlayStation mag at the time. I basically got at the end of this section a load of vague PS1 ephemera I wanted to go through, but I think the magazine element of this is actually huge.
So, the demo discs, they included. Demo discs were a massive part of the PS1 experience, I think. It was just suddenly people had access to a bunch of different games they might never try.
I don't know how much the demo discs existed outside of PC mags, where obviously it was a huge part of it. I don't know how much of it there was with older mags. I have a feeling this might have been part of the mix, but maybe it was the access to the scale of games you were getting here, just how big the titles were, and obviously how much more money was going into some of these games at the time.
It just seemed like the demo disc was a key part of the OPM experience. I had friends who had stacks of these, and I just remember going to my cousin's house and putting in every demo disc he had, and being like, this is Cooler World, this is Medieval, these are all these games that I've just played for nine or ten minutes, but they are burned into my brain years later. Did you have much encounter with this side of things, Matthew?
This felt like a key part of the PS1 culture to me.
I experienced it definitely on PS2, which I think has the same kind of vibe. You just feel like you can be better informed without having spent loads of money. But yeah, I know this was a massive part of it, and like I said, a lot of what I have played, I think were demos around a friend's house of like, you've got to check this thing out, or I'd read about something in Games Master and say, you don't happen to have a demo of that that I could come and see.
You don't happen to have like the first level of siphon filter that I can come and test out. So yeah, I mean, a huge part of it, and on N64 where, like we said earlier, you could get through a whole generation and literally have only played 12 games maybe. You know, PlayStation people just didn't have that.
You know, I wonder how many of these things like translated into sales for some of these games or if these people, you know, their entire knowledge of a game is from that one demo. I imagine there's a lot of that shared experience.
Yeah, I think there probably is. I think that in some cases, I think that it felt like the games were made around like one really amazing level, like siphon filter's first level, for example, which I remember being the demo at the time. It's so, so good.
And I can't remember much about siphon filter after that. I know I've played like probably about half of it. I think I got it on PSP years ago or PS3.
But the first level just where you're kind of like running through those streets and like shooting dudes was so exciting that it kind of amped you up for it. And I remember like a friend just going and buying it off the back of that. But the big one, the big demo that like was a sort of like, holy fuck, this game, I can't believe this, was Metal Gear Solid?
That demo. Just where me and my friend were struggling through that first kind of like, you know, you come out of the water and that first sort of like basically cargo bay room where you're waiting for the elevator to come down, trying to figure out the guard behavior, learning, oh, if you hold, if you press square, then you choke the guards out. And what kind of revelation that was.
It's like, oh, if you don't get seen, you can choke them out and then also break their necks so they disappear from the environment and you've gotten rid of them. Like, just like unpicking the complexity of that, but also getting just enough of the atmosphere of the game for it to be like, I feel like something seismic is happening here. And even just by having this demo disc, I'm privy to this, even though I won't get to play this game for another like seven years, basically, which is what happened to me in the original MGS.
So, yeah, like, I think it was a big part of the sort of shared culture. And I think it probably does mean that people remember more PS1 games than they owned as a result and can have something to say about that experience, as opposed to N64, where, yeah, again, the same 10 to 12 games. So, yeah, I do remember I met, I think it was GDC 2014.
I met Chris Steering, who was the former president of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. And I can't remember exactly what he said. It was something like, yeah, I was there when I made a deal with Chris Anderson to put a disc, like to put the demo disc on OPM and like sold a million copies a month.
And I made him very rich. He said something like that. And I just remember thinking, wow, like a million copies.
That's just such a massive part of the population buying magazines. You know what I mean? Think of like all the different types of games that were being sampled then.
Like you can never get the same traction with the demo now, because there's just always too much to play. But at the time, that wasn't the case.
Do they have these demo discs in the States, do we know?
Yeah, they did. I don't know how they were sold any differently, but I think they were. I'm pretty sure they made the same stuff.
I wonder if Metal Gear Solid would have been what it was without the demo.
Yeah, it's an interesting one. There was a lot of hype behind it. It did have a bunch of E3 trailers that really amazed people, that showed off all the different stuff that Snake could do.
Almost like an immersive approach to it, where you see him laying bombs and you see him doing all this different stuff, and it's just about showing how you can play around with the guards, basically. I think there was a lot of hype behind it, but the demo maybe confirms to you that it's the real deal. Okay, Matthew, we're getting close to the draft here.
Is it possible to boil down the entire identity of this console into 10 games or even 20 games? So what do you think the sort of like, you know, the true classics, how many of them do you think there are on this console?
Oh, I mean, you know, just looking down the Metacritic list, I think there's, you know, a good case for including a lot of like, you know, there's maybe like the top 50 or something. You know, there's a lot of things there where you're like, if that appeared on a real mini console, you wouldn't feel like you were being shortchanged. Obviously hard to show the full extent of this machine in just 10 games.
I do think you can capture the attitude of the machine quite comfortably in 10 games. And like what it stands for and, you know, that general, you know, slightly more adult vibe, I think you could see quite clearly from 10. But yeah, I don't know what the optimal number would be.
And it's quite funny because the actual mini console they did make seems quite disappointing.
Yeah, it's I think it's I kind of get it was probably quite challenging to to do because, you know, probably some of the publishers don't exist, that sort of thing. When Nintendo does one, they own the rights to all the games that you want to see on them, basically, right? Minus maybe three or four different games.
Whereas on PlayStation, because it's all third party, but for the most part, third party is maybe a bit trickier. But yeah, so the the PS Mini is OK. So I thought I'd fire through actually what was on the PlayStation Classic they released a few years ago, which was 2018.
They released it. It was in over here. It was Battle Arena Toshinden, Cool Borders 2, Destruction Derby, FF7, GTA, the original, Intelligent Cube.
I don't remember that game at all. Jumping Flash, which is rubbish. Metal Gear Solid, Mr. Driller, which is obviously classic.
Oddworld, Abe's Odyssey, R4, Ridge Racer Type 4, Rayman, the Resident Evil Director's Cut, Revelations Persona, Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, Siphon Filter, Tekken 3, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Twisted Metal and Wild Arms. Now, I don't think it's that bad, actually. Yeah, she wouldn't say it there.
Yeah, it's just really, really hard to boil this console down to that handful of games. So, yeah, it is challenging. The Japanese one had a few different ones as well.
So they had Parasite Yvonne there and Saga Frontier, Devil Dice, a game I don't know, G Darius, a Gradius game, Armored Core, which people pretend to like, of course, and Ark the Lad and Ark the Lad 2. So, yeah, it's just really hard because the size of the library is the strength, I think. But there are still plenty of classics within that.
So, yeah. OK, Matthew, just a couple more questions before we get into this. So, basically, PS1, better line up with the PS2 and the 360 or worse?
I don't think so. But that's with hindsight and not having those formative experiences. You know, if I had to play one of these libraries forever, I'd be wrestling between PS2 and 360 more than PS1.
But that just comes from personal history.
Yeah, I think I agree, though, and I was trying to work out why this is, and I think I figured it out. I think it's because third-person games were so much better on PS2. So, you know, like you have Devil May Cry and that kind of hack-and-slash genre taking off, right?
Or the likes of Akami or Ico and, you know what I mean? Like Shadow of the Colossus where God of War, where they just figure out what third-person games in 3D should look and feel like in a more concrete way, whereas obviously here you're at basically the birth of 3D or at least the early days of 3D, and they're still figuring out the rules for those things. On PS2, they know a lot more of the rules for 3D games, so I think that's why the PS2 has the edge.
And then I think 360 as well is also better, but I think, again, if you have more lived-in experience than us, you might disagree. You might feel differently about this, and I'd respect that. And again, I think there are certain types of games on PS1 that define the console more than they do on PS2.
I think it already changes a little bit between them, so yeah, key thing there.
I mean, if it was based on genres, I think that there's definitely a case for, like, best JRPG generation ever.
Yeah, I think so.
If it's not just a case, I think that's probably a fact. That's a fact, right?
I think people would say SNES, yes, you know, SNES has got, like, a big library of those games too, some of which weren't all localized in the US and many of which were never released in the UK. But I think it's, like, it's definitely up there, you know. It's, yeah, I do agree on that level.
So, yeah, it's interesting stuff. So, okay, Matthew, that's my preamble about done. I just want to give a shout out to some of the oddball ephemera on PS1.
The big T-Rex head tech demo, of course. The G-Con sort of, like, gun controller you can have in your house to play Time Crisis and point blank. The Pocket Station, which had some kind of Chocobo minigame on it in FF8, which I could never, I never played, which I'd like to play.
I think I should, at some point, I'm going to end up buying one of these on eBay and it will go in Games Court. I think that will happen at some point.
Along with all your Dreamcast UVs.
It's a very incriminating case I'm building up in Games Court at the moment. There's, like, two different Rich Racer controllers they've released for PlayStation. One of them is called the JogCon.
I didn't note what the other one's called, but the JogCon has a steering wheel built on top of it, which is novel, and the PlayStation Link Cable so you could play multiplayer games without doing split-screen. Don't think I knew many people had that, but the multi-tap that was boomerang-shaped, quite a famous object as well, and the little LCD screen they released for the smaller PlayStation 1. Imagine playing that on the go.
Really funny thought. Yeah, loads of, like, strange bits and pieces on PS1. A shout-out to every cursed third-party controller that had a turbo button on it or some nonsense.
I was always the one who had to play those when going out with my friend Reese's House and playing Tekken 2, and that was my burden to bear. So, yes, that's the PlayStation.
Jock-on, incidentally, is what I say to you when I see you rushing onto the cinema.
Very good.
I say, Jock-on, Sam.
And on that note, Kirby enthusiasm style, as we loop back to the start of the podcast, we take a quick break and come back with a PS1 draft goodbye. Editor's note here, I forgot to mention bloody DualShock, didn't I? They released a new controller in 1997, had two sticks and could rumble, and it worked with pretty much most of the games that were released from there on in and was bundled with Ape Escape at one point.
So, in making the definitive PS1 episode, had to fucking take that off, didn't I?
Cheers.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, time for the PlayStation 1 Draft. Oh, gosh, here we go.
This is where the spice really begins. You've had the sort of like very civil preamble, and now the nerves build, as me and Matthew engage in psychological warfare to pick the best 10 games for PS1 each. So, okay, the categories then.
Category one, fighting game. Category two, shooter. Category three, survival horror.
Category four, racing or sports. Category five, licensed game. Category six, platformer.
Category seven, RPG. Category eight, 90 plus on Metacritic. Category nine, wild card.
And category 10, free pick. Matthew, do you have any thoughts on the overall sort of like lineup here? Is this the right set of categories or was there anything you thought was missing as you're going through the library?
No, I think this is the right selection. Like there are some where there's just way too much you can possibly use. There are some where you instantly begin feeling nervous, which I think you need to get the draft some shape.
If every category is too easy, it gets a little bit mushy. But yeah, I think these are the right ones. There are a couple where if I don't get my thing, I'm pretty fucked because I just don't have the knowledge to quickly cook up a replacement.
So let's see what happens.
Great! With that optimistic note, let's get into it then I suppose. So should we do the old coin toss, Matthew?
What would you like?
I would like heads.
Heads it is. Wow! Yeah!
Okay, so how this works then, basically what we're going to do is we're going to do, I get to decide whether I go first or second, and whoever goes second gets two picks, and then it comes back around to one pick each basically to make the first pick not too disproportionately unfair. Okay then, so for category eight, I'm going to go first. Sorry, I should say that.
Let's go well, isn't it? Okay, for category eight, 90 plus on Metacritic, I'm taking Metal Gear Solid.
Metal Gear Solid.
Why is this the pick that you have to take first? Because there's no other game like it on PlayStation, right? Although I suppose, Matthew, you could take the VR missions if you wanted to.
No, no bullshit like that.
Metal Gear Solid, seminal stealth game, a massive step forward for video game storytelling in terms of presentation, voice acting, absolutely blew my mind how this game looked and sounded on that level. This spooky, stormy conspiracy thriller, we had to go and blow up a big nuclear robot that had been hijacked by terrorists. Basically, I felt like the iconography in this game is like my adolescent brain comes online when all of this happens.
Seeing the cyborg ninja beaming in and out of invisibility and murdering all those soldiers in that corridor, and then going haywire when he's in that computer room with you, just like all-time shit, all these distinctive Kojima, Shinkawa bosses, Vulcan Raven and Revolver Ocelot, just such distinctive characters. All that stuff just blew my mind, and then just notice building up to this fight against this nuclear mech. Everything about it just really spoke to me, and I think that the original MGS as well just has this very distinctive look and sound that the other ones don't have.
MGS2's settings don't have the same vibe here, where I think the music is doing as much heavy lifting as Snake's Cold Breath in Shadow Moses or Leaving Footsteps in the Snow. I think it's about that industrial dour, echo-y score that really brings atmosphere to life as well. This absolutely blew my mind and it remains actually one of the few games you would still want to play now because the stealth is simple enough that it doesn't fuck you up too much, it's not too unfair, it's easy enough to play and control now.
It's not that long either, but incredibly memorable, formative game for me. Thoughts, Matthew?
It goes on a bit, doesn't it, in the old natterin? No, of course I love Metal Gear Solid. Behind the scenes, we've been discussing this as like, is this the one that decides it?
I guess we'll find out. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm not gonna sag it off. The most I wanted a PS1 was to play this thing, it just sounded so wonderful.
And then when I did eventually play it, you know, it completely lived up to it. Great fun on a larger sort of systemic stealth level, but then it also has that weird Kojima specificity and you know, the way he's married, those two things has the stories made him like one of the all time greats. This is before it gets too bogged down in any bullshit as well.
Like it's pretty pure.
The most bullshit you get in this one, so I replayed the last few bits of it with my friend Lynch when I went to Japan in December is that it's like when there's a load of stuff about nuclear disarmament at the end, there's about like eight FMVs in a row that talk about that. And you're like, I'm good, thanks, dog. I don't need to watch this again as a 35 year old man.
But I wish you well. So other than that, I don't think it does go on too much. No.
And at the time, you just hadn't seen anything like this. And now when you encounter like walls of cutscenes, maybe you feel differently about it. But yeah, it's sort of like it was definitely felt like it was a key part of the experience at the time.
There is one other pic I think that could tip this in your favor, Matthew, where there's not really another comparable game like it. I wonder if you'll pick that next. So we come to your first pic.
Why have you said that? Because now it's made me question everything I'm doing.
Yes, that's the game, my friend.
So I get two picks.
Yep.
I'm already straying from my plan. So this next one, I wasn't going to pick it. So one of the things I've been knowing about is like, and this always comes up, is like availability elsewhere.
And I know these consoles kind of like, they sort of exist in this little bubble where it's like, we'll just imagine this thing exists and the argument that something is readily available on other platforms does that undermine it as a pick. In the past, I think I've put too much weight on that and I've picked games which, you know, are like locked to a console and actually people don't give a fuck. They just like the things that they like as a rule.
So I'm going to play to, let's play to the cheap seats. For RPG, I'll take Final Fantasy VII.
Nice.
It's tricky to pen anyone in with this pick because there are multiple Final Fantasies that are loved by different people. I still think Final Fantasy VII is the one in most people's minds. Absolutely incredible first disc that I've experienced.
Yeah, that is now factually accurate.
Yes, properly truly epic. For years, I'd only played the opening stretch of this game, which could almost have been a satisfying game in itself, the amount it kind of packs in, the level of sort of sophistication in terms of like storytelling and setting felt like a big leap forwards. Mechanically, I've really come to appreciate it.
I know I always coveted it as a very shiny thing because of the video sequences and the pre-rendered backgrounds, but playing it and now having a better understanding of like how flexible like the material system is and all the kind of like weird subtleties hidden in that system. Like I think I do appreciate it more as a kind of complete package of kind of story and RPG depth full of really iconic moments. I think it's worth experiencing, especially if you want to play the remakes now and enjoy that whole project.
Those two games are in like this conversation with each other, which sort of makes each of them a little bit more interesting as well. So it still feels like a game you could discover now and have a great time with. So I don't feel bad about putting it on my list.
Yep. Good pick.
So my next pick. Again, I just want to get a classic. Can't really argue with it.
Maybe there's a spicier or kind of like weirder pick in the margins. For survival horror, I'll take Resident Evil 2. Yep.
Resident Evil 1. Absolutely classic. Exploring that big spooky house, seeing these things for the first time.
I think Resident Evil 2, with its slightly more kind of full on action bent in that it just drops you in the middle of a zombie apocalypse in Raccoon City, feels a little bit more exciting. Having the kind of the two campaigns with Leon and Claire and the way they interact. A little bit more interesting here in the original than it was in the remakes.
One of the few areas I think it does still have a few more surprises than that remake and I prefer it in the original. Incredible atmosphere, particularly in the earlier parts of the game in the kind of city and the police station. Quite old fashioned, but I still find very compelling inventory management, sort of risk reward system of like what you're going to cart around and moving things around this building, trying to manage that space while all these iconic enemies sort of jump out at you.
So, yeah, Resident Evil 2, I'm confident people will like that.
Yeah, I haven't really weighed in on any of these yet, so I should... FF7 first then. So, yeah, FF7, obviously defining RPG for the system makes sense, obviously with Resident Evil 2.
I think this one's a bit more of a... There are like two other great picks in this category. Yeah, so that's the thing is like I thought I actually couldn't decide between this and another entry in this series for this category is the best one because I think that in some ways like what it is the like the perfect vision of what it is, is in the first one.
But I also think this has some of the most like memorable survival horror moments, playground worthy stuff where you share like what it's like when the liquor first turns up or, you know...
People come out of the more body containers and...
Yeah, just the police station is such an iconic location. I know you played this a few years ago, didn't you Matthew as well for the Vita?
Yeah, I played it on the PS1 original on the Vita before the remake came out. So, you know, it's a bit fresher in my mind.
Yeah.
And it's still very, you know, even on that tiny little screen, it was it was very effective. And yeah, I just think the dual campaign stuff is still, you know, a really good hook and more kind of clearly felt here than maybe any of the others.
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I think that's a good justification. Okay, so come to my second pick.
So time to pick one of three games I've played this weekend in research for this episode, Matthew. So for category 10 free pick, I'm going to take Castlevania Symphony of the Night, pioneering Metroidvania game, obviously, in terms of sort of taking that more action platformer approach and turning it into this more like an adding sort of like RPG systems on top of it, more of the kind of like multiple route type stuff, absolutely banging music. Really great and underappreciated by some press at the time because it was a 2D game.
And obviously, we talked about this before, but there's a little bit of sniffiness towards 2D. But this, I think, is another of those games that has held up over time as a, you know, in terms of like games you would actually play now. It is pretty widely available.
Still not everything. I don't think you can play this on Switch still, but you can play on PS4. You can play on Vita, which is where I played it.
I played it on my PS Vita, which was nice and novel. Looks amazing. And yeah, just I think, I think that atmosphere is spot on as well.
Really challenging to get to grips with, but the RPG system means you can sort of pull it back around in your favor if you're really struggling. Amazing looking bosses. It's a really cool game and considered an all time classic.
So yeah, I haven't finished it, but I've played about three hours of it this weekend. Having a great time. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I love this game. It definitely was like in the mix. If I was going to ding it for anything, it's maybe that personally I prefer some of the 2D sequels to it.
I've spoken a lot about Dawn of Sorrows, but that's not what this exercise is. It isn't much of a game as Castlevania. It's one of the best games on PS1, and it definitely feels like Castlevania Symphony of Night has only grown in reputation over the years.
I really don't remember the conversations around it at the time. Maybe because of the whole 2D thing, I just wasn't paying much attention to it.
Possibly you're also bigger in the US.
Yes, absolutely. But over the years you just began to see it appearing regularly in the greatest games of all time lists, and you were like, oh, what's this thing that I've managed to overlook? So yeah, it's a cool game.
Very, very playable now still as well.
I thought that was going to be your second pick for sure. So I was like, oh, fuck, I'm going to lose this. And it's another game where I don't think there's anything like it on PlayStation you can pick that's comparable.
So that's why I took it.
Don't worry, you know I'm too bad at drafts to do anything good like that.
Also I love us giving backhanded compliments to games. I was listening to myself talk about FF7, I was like, what am I doing? I fucking adore this game, and I'm just trying to talk around it, it's ridiculous.
Such is the odd tension of the draft episodes.
It's particularly funny in this one, because you're not trying to praise the thing I've picked. I can't really praise a lot of them because I don't have that much experience of them, so they just come up really poorly, like, advocated for.
Yeah, amazing stuff really. Yeah, it's classic. Indeed, yeah, so a failed episode, we'll just have a talk about again.
Final Fantasy 7 and Resident Evil 2 are probably the two I've had the most experience with, so that's the level of discussion you can expect from me this episode.
Yeah, and the two games I just took, basically. Yeah, okay, good stuff. It's going well.
What's your third pick, Matthew?
My third pick is...
I think I know what it's gonna be.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know if you do.
I do.
Really? Yeah. Oh my god, so I picked something weird.
I just know what I would pick next. I don't think there's anything else.
Oh, but this doesn't mean anything.
I just need to do a bit of mind games to spice things up.
What I should do and what I'm gonna do are wildly different things.
So my original plan for RPG wasn't necessarily to pick Final Fantasy VII. I thought that was gonna be a little bit too mainstream, but I thought, you know what, I've got to have a couple of things which I'm really rock solid on. I know people like.
So for my free pick, I'll take Xenogears.
Whoa, okay, that is not what I thought you're gonna pick.
This is what I wanted to pick for RPG.
Right, right.
This, I mean, obviously there's the Takahashi connection with Xenoblade, one of my favorite series of games. This is, as far as I know, this is like Takahashi's first big sort of like effort in control. It's also a bit of a nightmare to find and play in this day and age, legally.
I think it was at one point available as a PS1 classic on PSP and PS3, but not for Old Castle, sadly. So yeah, just, I have played a little bit of it, and an older boy told me how, but I would, I, you know, this is one I genuinely, I would just like to play more of. It's set in a fantasy world where there are people fighting these sort of giant mechs.
A mech attacks your village early on. You play as a young martial artist called Fei-Fong Wong, who takes control of this mech to fight off the attackers and then goes on a quest to discover who attacked his village and why it is that he has this natural affinity with this mech. Famously the story really goes places.
The thing that kind of keeps coming up with this game when people talk about it and why it really resonated was quite adult themes and quite sophisticated plotting in that Takahashi kind of really went big on, there's a lot of sort of philosophy in there and debate about big life issues and religion and he doesn't really spare on any of that. To the game's detriment, famously the first disc of this is the JRPG you're expecting going between locations fighting all these colourful enemies and the second disc is basically sort of like exposition and boss fights. Like, they ran out of time and money and just sort of sped it up so rather than kind of cut out the full story they wanted to tell, they just tell it in a very kind of truncated strange way.
Like, almost more like visual novel-y if you've played this or watched through playthroughs. So it's a real oddity, but a lot of like weird idiosyncratic systems, like because you're a martial artist, a lot of the combat, even though it's term-based and uses the sort of ATB kind of gauge type thing for Final Fantasy, it has like button combos to do different martial arts moves and the way that you kind of sort of store up energy and then unleash multiple attacks has a big factor, a big impact in battle. And then of course you have the mechs themselves which have a whole other combat system based throughout built around them, so yeah, it's definitely a bit more niche but I feel like with Final Fantasy VII I've got the really famous JRPG that everyone loves with Xenogears or Xenogears.
You have the JRPG which, you know, lots of big JRPG heads seem to love but it's quite hard to discover and no one seems to want to remake it probably because of those later game story issues, you'd maybe be on a bit of a hiding for nothing in this day and age. So yeah, and great music from Yasunori Mitsuda who also contributed to Xenoblade. So yes, Xenogears.
I think they'll get back to this at some point. If they've done Chrono Cross and I think the rumour was they'd do FF Tactics, I could see them doing this as well. I think that's probably like the one after that that you'd do.
So yeah, I think it could sort of come back in some form. I do think the fact that it's basically unfinished as a fundamental part of its being does make it a bit more of maybe a bit more of a strange one to sort of bring back. But yeah, an interesting thing, not an angle of attack I thought you'd take like going big on the RPGs, but I guess that kind of makes sense because you're a big Xenoblade guy, so it makes sense you're going to go for that one.
Does look nice this game. I do like the little mech, mech lads in it. Nice.
Yeah, it's got a nice like...
Amazing on PS1.
It doesn't use like the pre-rendered backgrounds, it's sort of 3D models that you can kind of rotate with sort of sprites on top. I did also consider like Grandia, but I thought that was probably too niche.
Yeah, I suppose Grandia is also like a Saturn game, it's kind of like a considered Saturny, isn't it? Anyway, yeah, that's fine. I think that's a good pick though, and I was surprised you didn't tell that, and Wildcard actually would have let you have that for that, but...
Oh really? Oh, yes. Oh well.
That's pretty wild, isn't it? It didn't come out here, for example.
It didn't come out here. Yeah, I don't want to ever push my luck in Wildcard, because I feel like if I try and do that, you'll make some kind of devil's bargain, and then somehow that's why I end up letting you take Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 as a shooter or something.
Well, the thing I want to take for Wildcard is less wild than that, I think, so that's why I say it. But I'm wondering how wild you think we're going.
You're not in the seats for your later drubbing.
It's not croc 2, it's something else. Okay, now I'm going to take the thing I thought you were going to pick. My third pick is category 1 fighting game, I'm going to take Tekken 3.
So this is an interesting one in the sense that I think Tekken sums up PS1 fighting games more than anything else, and I know there are many games from many different series here, but for the broader experience of discovering fighting games on this console, Tekken was it. It was the camera angles, the oddball roster of characters, the music, the way it felt in your hands, the simplicity of it compared to playing something like Street Fighter. Tekken was it.
It was amazing. It's like part of the PS1's DNA, and I think you need a Tekken game in the draft picks to really capture the essence of the console, and Tekken 3 was considered the best game of that series on that system. Having played Tekken 2, which I played the most at the time, I guess in some ways this is summing up that pick too, but playing them, I don't think there's tons and tons between them really, and I think that's kind of common of a lot of series on PS1 that come out in quick succession.
But yeah, Tekken 3 is largely considered the best one. And I think that 3D fighting, easy to pick up and play, like a perfect multiplayer experience, like this is just a huge part of what the PS1 was Tekken. So Tekken 3 it is Matthew, what do you think of that pick?
Yeah, I mean, when I was talking to my, when I was crowdsourcing answers with the PlayStation brain trust at work, I was under strict instruction to get Tekken 3 for fighting game. So that's obviously quite bad, that I haven't got it, I'm not going to lie. At the same time, I was dreading picking it and then struggling to talk about it.
I have very little experience with Tekken. Everyone in the office, we've got, just this week I was part of a Tekken tournament at work for Tekken 8 and I got, I'm destroyed in, it was like speed running. It was like awesome games done quick, defeat Matthew any percent.
Like really, it's amazing how fast you can kill someone in that game. So yeah, I lost that. This is just, this is a series that I know is crucial to PlayStation people and I have just missed out on.
By the time Tekken was on platforms I was involved with, I thought it was a little bit naff. I don't really know where Tekken sits in the grand scheme of things, like it seems to be like...
People love it now.
Yeah, people love it now. It seems quite critically acclaimed now. But I thought there was a period where it just seemed like a little bit like everything but the kitchen sink, like it had a roster of like 70 characters and like, you know, one of them was like a fucking vending machine and then there'd just be like a guy with a top hat holding a fish and they all looked like they were made in the character creator.
And you were like, what the fuck is going on with this roster? I don't understand any of this.
It was like Rick and Morty characters, basically.
Yeah, really, really cursed shit. There were several of them were bears, it seemed. So yeah, I'm glad I don't have to like try and pick that and then do it dirty by not talking well about it.
And yeah, I appreciate that. That probably is the best pick for this category.
Yeah, I mean, I have to apologize for my loud cackle there when Matthew was admitting that he should have picked this or telling that he was in strict instructions to pick this because that killed me. That is the funniest thing I've heard at ages. Yeah, I think that it was sort of like it's dip is basically around the 360 era.
We have like Yoda and stuff as guest characters and fighting games don't feel like they've quite had their moment of revival in the modern age, you know, which sort of kicks off with Street Fighter 4, I guess. And I think Tekken just for a while seemed like it was old hat. Then the last one came out, everyone was giving it nines and I was like, oh, maybe people like Tekken more than I realized.
So yeah, so yeah, there are many, there are multiple bear related characters in this series. I think it's Panda and there's also, is it Kuma, the other bear? Yeah, so yeah, so you have a slightly smaller roster in three.
Like that's not necessarily like the thing they're going for. But I think it's just, it felt like a genuine, I don't know if you would, if like fighting game purists would call it a step forward, but certainly if somebody got into the genre with this series, it did feel like a step forward because it was in my hands. I knew how to do certain moves.
It was like, it was not finger gymnastics to like do some rad shit. And the animations are amazing because the camera could spin all over the place. It was fucking great.
I had a fantastic time. So yeah, Tekken 3, I think that's the right pick for this category. So yeah.
Okay, Matthew, what's your next pick?
For racing or sports?
Yep.
I take Ridge Racer Type 4.
Which I actually have played a little bit of when it came on to the PlayStation Premium service way back when. Whether or not this is the right take, I don't know. But for me, I think this this sits in a in a quite sweet spot between Outrun and Gran Turismo in that it has some of the kind of like arcade-y sort of fun, lots of drifting fun from Outrun, but it also has kind of some of the slightly more kind of like sleek sort of coolness of Gran Turismo and it sits in this this very nice very nice place between them.
Very classy, very atmospheric game. You know, it isn't quite the perfect blue skies of Outrun. It's all sort of like a dusk till dawn racer and there's a lots of like twilight and like early morning light and tearing through city streets in the evening.
But with with kind of like soul music and jazz music and funky music on the soundtrack, it's kind of got immaculate vibes that really really hold up. Yeah and just compounded by just the whole presentation of the thing, you know, it's it's almost sort of persona-ish in the way it's got this very like cool graphic sort of like UI and very striking yellow kind of colour used throughout. And I just thought it was a really really like stylish game, not too far up its own arse and boring like Gran Turismo, not too kind of hectic and throwaway, maybe a bit more outrunny.
It was it was just just right.
Yeah, so this is one of the three games I played this weekend.
Oh, I'm sorry to have undermined your research time.
No, it's fine. I mean, you know, I can use it to benefit you. So that's fine.
Yeah, I agree with everything you say that I think it's that sweet spot between simulation and arcade, right? It's like, yeah, you can't just hold down the accelerate button, but you don't. But you can just sort of like do a gentle tap to go on the break to go around a corner perfectly and, you know, when you get it right, it feels really good.
And yeah, it's sort of like it feels aggressively sort of like tactical as well. Like you just have to be really on it with your planning of how you get around each track. And I think it rewards you memorizing where all the sort of like the big turns are in a way that like isn't it doesn't mean you spin out when you fuck up.
It just means you lose a tiny bit of pace, but it's enough to like put you in third place rather than first and I think that like it's just that again it's just like finding that right space for a racing game is always the key for me. So yeah, so I think this is this is about this is about as simmy as I ever like to get really and just you know you have to use the break button basically but I think the tracks look good. It's like one of the nicer looking PS1 racing games for sure.
I think the music is amazing. They get that drum and bass kind of like music. I like the fact there are story bits in between the Grand Prix where you get berated by like I'm on the Pac-Man racing team basically.
My car is like Pac-Man themed and there's like a dude who runs it who's just a bit like oh you just about made it through did you and I was like I don't know why this story in this game but I quite like that they went for it. Just a really strong end of that generation racing game. So I think this was this was going to be my next pick so I think it is a good pick Matthew.
So well done to you.
Finally.
Good for you so evergreen okay so I guess I will take what am I going to go for next yeah okay I'm going to take for category five license game Die Hard trilogy. So an interesting one in the sense that oh is this the right pick well I picked it now so I've got to go with it it's between this or spider-man on ps1 a game I really liked but in some ways I think that spider-man has been overwritten in the cultural consciousness by insomniac games which do the same thing but way better what spider-man has it as its favor is the flavor of the 90s animated show which was really good but I don't think there's anything else that'd really make you recommend it now die hard trilogy on the other hand is a real kind of like oddball game of the time it's like we will make three games that will represent the die hard franchise there will be Nakatomi Plaza sort of like third person shooting there will be a light gun game and there'll be like a driving game for like a driving around a city game for die hard with a vengeance so I think they're all kind of like I think alternating between them was the appeal of this game like I don't think I don't think any one part of them are super, super strong, but it was incredibly novel. To adapt a series like this into a game seems like such a fool's errand, because they're not really...
They are action movies, but you don't really necessarily see where the game tie-in comes from from those movies. But this is a kind of innovative approach to that. Probably, at a push, prefer the Die Hard, original Die Hard, sort of like third-person shooting, obviously dated now.
But I think as a game that was in everyone's collection, like a coveted, oh, it's a little bit naughty and violent, and really, as the Die Hard movies were perceived, Die Hard seemed incredibly appealing to an 11-year-old or a 10-year-old. It just seemed so, so cool. And this game was just, yeah, just a real notable, interesting artifact of the time, if not necessarily a true classic.
I think this is very well remembered, and I had a very good time with it at the time. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, I remember this being quite a big deal, and my friend in the year above me had a PS1 always telling me about it. The idea of all three Die Hards in one is a great pitch. I think it's easy for people to forget, or maybe harder for them to pitch, and now, like, how big and popular and exciting Die Hard was, you know, still in the mid-90s.
Like, it was just a cool thing, and I was really into it and really liked Die Hard. So, yeah, that makes perfect sense. I mean, you know, after Die Hard 4 and 5, it's maybe harder to pitch of what the appeal is, but yeah, this was, yeah, this is cool.
Yeah, Die Hard had, like, such a sort of, like, a reputation, you just couldn't, I don't think you could sort of, like, understand in an age where, you know, Bruce Willis, who has obviously had some, like, you know, really difficult health issues in the last few years, also made, like, more than a decade of dogshit films throughout the noughties, like, just made so much crap. And Looper, which is amazing, obviously. But yeah, it's, yeah, I think that this just, it was like at an all-time peak, I think, Die Hard's reputation when this game came out.
So, yeah, this feels like a good pick for this category, that there is something I wonder if I should have got instead. Let's find out what happens next.
Your pick, Matthew. See, I don't know if I'm gonna pick it. I found License incredibly difficult.
The License game scene is just total dogshit on PS1.
This is about as good as it gets, I think, so yeah, yeah, it's a tough one. But hey, you could pick FIFA or something, I don't know.
Yeah, yeah, I always think the sports ones are a little, I don't know.
Yeah, I agree with you. It feels like it should be based on a movie or a TV show.
Yeah, that feels like the spirit of the thing, rather than like Tony Hawk. I remember my dad renting me Die Hard with a Vengeance when I was not 15 and, or 18, or whatever rating it was. I think it's 15.
And being under strict instructions not to tell my mom that I'd watched it.
So she'll be discovering this now, leaving a comment on Patreon, no doubt.
Yeah, well that was the, you know, we may not have had different consoles as children of divorce, but you did get to occasionally see inappropriate films. I remember him showing me, like, the first 10 minutes of Starship Troopers. And I remember thinking, like, holy shit, this is the most exciting, violent thing I've ever seen.
But only the first 10 minutes.
Yeah, he got to the shower scene, he was like, off, off! No locker room for you, Matthew. Not until you're 15.
Yeah, I always thought that, I think watching it back as well, Died with a Vengeance is a little bit more PG-13, I think, than the other two. You know, it's a bit more like, I guess you do have some...
It's got some of the race stuffs pretty fierce.
It is, yeah. That's like the only exception to it. But violence-wise, it's a little bit...
Yes, I was thinking, what is that side that Bruce Willis is wearing at the start of the film? Yeah, okay, so that side, but you know what I mean? It's a bit more knockabout sort of buddy comedy.
Whereas Die Hard 2 has got some of the most traumatic playing shit that you've ever seen. So yeah, not great. Okay, what's your next pick, Matthew?
My next pick, I'm just gonna get this over and done with because I don't really know what to do with it. For shooter, I really struggle with shooter. And maybe you've got something amazing that I've just completely overlooked or I was thinking about this the wrong way.
I am gonna take Siphon Filter for this.
Yeah, I think that's a good pick.
Yeah, like it's pretty mainstream. Like I don't think Siphon Filter's got like a great reputation now. Like I know it was popular and they made lots of them and like I think there were several PS1 games, several PSP games.
Did they do a PS2 one, maybe? Anyway, you know, it's a weird sort of first party franchise that seems to sort of vanish, or first party feeling franchise that sort of vanished a little bit, but you certainly did some shooting in it. To me, this sort of scratched the itch at the time of, you know, games that showed realistic violence were always very appealing.
It's why I wanted things like Soldier of Fortune. It's sort of why I like GoldenEye, which I put into the similar category, you know, like shooting people in the head and seeing the little blood splotches. Stuff like that had huge power in the 90s to see like 3D violence working, you know, quote unquote, realistically.
And Siphon Filter had loads of that, like cool head shots, little squirts of blood. The Taser is like an all time classic bit of like, like horrible, but funny game design where when you shoot people with the Air Taser, you press the button and the longer you hold it, like they begin to shake and that knocks them out. But if you keep holding it, they begin to smoke and then they burst into flames.
I don't know if real Tasers do do that. Like if you can set someone on fire by just tasering them for that long, like I think it's implied that you're just like cooking them, I guess. But like, if only for that, I just, I don't think I can have a PS1 mini where you can't boot up Siphon Filter only for five minutes to set a man alight with a taser.
I think, in fact, I think that I'm gonna have it programmed on my mini console, but that's the first thing you have to do to unlock the rest of the console, is have the sort of celebratory, ritualistic flame tasering of the first guard you meet in Siphon Filter. And then it opens up to the rest of the UI. Not every time, that would be weird, but definitely the first time.
Yeah, Siphon Filter is a weird one. There are three of them on PS1. And then there's a PS2 one that is a sort of a bit of a notorious stinker.
I think it was like, it got sort of sixes and stuff. It wasn't very, it wasn't, I think it was meant to have some kind of like multiplayer element to sell that part of the PS2. It's kind of like, you know, a whole deal, but it just wasn't really considered like very good.
So people didn't really care. I think its reputation does dip even a little bit on PS1 over time. But when this came along, this was like a big in-house Sony blockbuster in the way that a Horizon would be now.
Obviously the scale was completely different, but this game was so big. I remember there being like, oh, we had this teacher who later went to prison for reasons I won't go into, but he basically was massively into video games. I remember one day he brought in a VMU to show off that KO mini game on Sonic Adventure or whatever.
But I just remember someone say, have you played Seifen Fielder, Sir? One of like the tougher kids. And I was there thinking, wow, okay, you know, I guess this game is the big deal on PlayStation and I'm missing out or whatever.
What a specific memory.
Yeah, it is, but I think it's just because, I don't know, it was just so rare to hear teachers talking about video games. Do you know what I mean?
I think you were gonna say he eventually went to prison for tasering someone till they set on fire in the playground.
You don't wanna know why he went to prison.
I'm not trying to get out of you. I was just doing a Seifen Fielder bit.
So yeah, like I say, the demo level I played at the time, I just remember thinking, wow, this is so exciting and mature feeling and brutal and all this stuff. And it was a pretty cool game. So I think this is a good pick.
It's not the angle of attack I'm gonna take on this category, but it's a good pick nonetheless, Matthew. So yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with this. It kind of sums up the PlayStation quite nicely, which is kind of the exercise, isn't it?
Yes.
Okay, so it's my pick, isn't it? Right then. Category 4, racing or sports.
I'm gonna take Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 out of manualing so you could chain together loads and loads of combos. Boom, really, really good. So this is, again, a genre that begins on PlayStation, like the extreme sports games, and then suddenly there are wash with them.
There's From Activision with Matt Hoffman's fucking BMX or whatever, I never played that one. The one I did play was Sean White's Pro Snowboarding on... Is it Sean White?
Is it Sean something or other? Yeah, I think it was Sean White's Pro Snowboarding, I think, on PS2. Maybe it was another guy called Sean.
Anyway, PS2 Snowboarding game. But this genre becomes massive and that's because Tony Hawk's so damn good. Just a few minutes to chain together loads and loads of moves, get a massive score, complete other objectives in these cool levels.
Sean Palmer. Sean Palmer, there you go. Thank you, Matthew.
Chain together loads of moves while some terrific sort of like rock music of the time plays. What immaculate vibes and sort of perfect arcade-y kind of experience. Again, just discovering this at a friend's house and just being like, I have to fucking play this game.
Such a big deal. Really important to PlayStation, so it feels like it should be in my list. So here it is under racing or sports.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, a great game. It was definitely in my list of things to play around with. I just felt like I'd evangelized the fourth game so much as the one that I'd played.
I was worried that that would work against me. If I picked it, it would sound particularly false. I know people would probably throw me a bone on that one.
Yeah, I think so. It's a PS1, you work with what you've got, you know?
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm happy with Ridge Racer in that category. You know, a car will always win against a skateboarder.
But lately in a literal like, you know, race, collision, whatever.
By any criteria, it will win, yeah, it's true.
I mean, you could skit along the back of a, is it skitching, is that what it's called? When you hold onto the bumpers.
Something like that, yeah.
But good luck holding on during one of those insane drifts.
I guess there are some advantages though, like you can't drive a car through like a shopping mall, you know what I mean? Like that's sort of like one thing you can't do.
You can't slide a car down a banister.
No, no, indeed, or making up a ramp in a little skate park.
Yeah, it feels like a real draw between cars and skateboards.
Well, I have to agree to disagree on that one. I actually, the thing is, I think on paper, this will look like a strong pick next to Ridge Racer Type 4. However, I did want Ridge Racer Type 4 for this category, to be clear.
Like I think that was kind of like the dyed in the wall PlayStation. I know Tony Hawk's was a PlayStation series.
No, I think Tony Hawk's is up there too, so.
Yeah, but I really like what I played at Ridge Racer Type 4. I'm just licking my wounds basically, but there it is. I got Tekken, Tony Hawk, Die Hard Trilogy, Metal Gear Solid, Symphony of the Night so far.
Matthew, what have you got?
So far I've got Siphon Filter, Resident Evil 2, Ridge Racer Type 4, Final Fantasy VII and Xenoguide.
I think we're both firing in all cylinders here.
I think we're doing all right.
Yes, good draft so far. What's your next pick, Matthew?
This is where it goes wrong. Nobody's joking.
Here's a question. For Wildcard, would you let me have Vagrant Story?
Yes. I mean, by all means load up on JRPGs, my friend. Go for it.
Yeah, I'm going to do that then. Yeah, Vagrant Story. Another slightly difficult to play now game.
I do have this one on my Vita from the PS1 downloads. A Yasumi Matsuno action RPG where you play as the unlikely named Ashley Riot. This, yeah, this is a weird one.
I've had it sort of evangelized to me and I've only tried a very, very small bit of it. So this isn't coming from personal experience. I'll be upfront, but a couple of people, I very much respect their opinion, have sung the praises of this.
Like I say, an action RPG, you play this sort of single character going around in armed combat full of strange idiosyncratic systems in that you can target like any limb on an enemy when you go into combat with them. But combat itself is governed by all these strange stuff wearing away under the hood. Key to it is there's this sort of risk system, which like the more moves you do, you're basically getting fatigued.
So it's like another take on stamina, but you become more open to dangerous sort of counterattacks. The more aggressively you attack and the more moves you use in succession. So there's a big risk ward element there.
But what the game really hinges around is kind of equipment. Like I don't think the hero himself actually levels up. I think everything is based on crafting new equipment and improving the equipment you have and crucially matching the equipment to the enemies.
I think a lot of people's experience with this game is just running into combat, dinging, you know, no attacks ever landing and just thinking like, what am I missing here? And what they're missing is that you have, you almost have to kind of like respect your character out build wise for each individual encounter, you know, breaking down weapon parts, putting together different weapons to make sure that they're strong against specific enemy types. Yeah, like I think very, very fiddly, but very rewarding.
It's the line on this one. And I've just always really fancied having a, having a proper excuse to dig into it. So yeah, this is very much a, a friend of a friend told me it was worth including.
It does have a really distinctive look to it. You know, at a time where Square were obviously leaning into like pre-rendered backgrounds, everything here is made in games. So the cinematography is very, very, I wouldn't say flashy is probably overselling it, it's very artfully done, very, very striking cut scenes, you know, probably up there with Metal Gear Solid in terms of like two games, trying to show a more sort of cinematic vision.
Obviously, this is set in a fantasy world, so it's got quite a different energy to it. I love the character designs in this, they're almost like very delicate sort of models with these face textures on them. You know, it looks like a kind of precursor to Final Fantasy XII to my eyes.
Has a similar vibe actually to XII in a way in that it's quite like low-key sort of serious fantasy. Like it isn't really up in your face, it's like adult characters, there's lots of political intrigue. Yeah, just a very, it seems very sophisticated and ahead of its time given what else is going on at the time, you know, maybe an interesting little experiment, but yeah, I would, I'm quite happy to have it on here and lean into the RPG thing with my console.
Okay, a few things to say about this. So the reason that, like I think that, apart from the obviously sharing a director and Matsuno, Akihiko Yoshida, the artist is why the games feel similar, the same character designs Matthew.
So that makes sense.
The same character designer, I think the characters look great, he also did the designs, the main character designs for Nier Automata. And if you want to know why that game looks like 90 times better than the original Nier, it's because of this guy, but he's a fucking master, master sort of artist, he's fantastic. So he's part of it.
Vagrant story, it seems like a game I should really like. I bought it, played it, I think it looks fantastic and the music is great. I think it's incredibly boring.
It's a very, very dull RPG and I think it's like 12, I think as well, has a sort of like slightly sedate pace, I think this does. And I think that that is much more of an acquired taste than Final Fantasy VII's and like music and then just like fucking animations flying all over the place and quite simple to figure out. This is kind of like the other end of the scale.
And fair enough, it's an acquired taste. I think it's really boring and I wouldn't play it now personally. That's how I feel.
You said the same about Hotel Dusk, which is a great game. So, you know, what fucking rakes your brain's going at where you think Hotel Dusk is boring? That probably deems this to a similar fate.
It's all that fucking Monster Energy drink you're drinking, Sam.
This is what people tune into the draft for.
This is what you want. I'm sorry that all these games are fucking ticked off, you know?
The thing is, though, I didn't have any idea you were going to pick this. I never would have called it boring. If you didn't ask me about it on any of the other episodes, I'd have told you, oh yeah, I played it once, and I thought it was very gently paced, quite hard and just quite boring.
But I was not expecting you to pick three JRPGs. I let the other two go. I was very nice about the other two.
This is broad. I'm sorry that this isn't the high on life game from the Rick and Morty guy. I know that's more your kind of speed.
That's a great diss, that is. That's like an Orbital Strike level kind of diss, that is. I really like that.
That's wipe out a small nation sort of like dunk there. Very good, Matthew.
I know, it's just, it's very difficult for me to defend because I haven't really played it. I don't have a huge experience with this game.
So you have to resort to personal insults.
Yeah, absolutely. Listen, everyone. Aren't you now intrigued by Vagrant Story?
Don't you want to see by yourself? Vote for my mini console and you'll be able to see for yourself and make your mind up.
And if you need a very pretty sleeping aid, I could also recommend it for that purpose. So that's good.
Well, you might need that because the rest of my console is so fucking rad and exciting that you are going to need something to cool off after a day of playing my extraordinary lineup of fucking Typhon Filter and Ridge Racer Type 4. You're going to need something to cool off in the evenings and that's where you put on the adult, sophisticated, vagrant story.
Well, how about I say this? I think the fact that Squaresoft was cooking so much at the time that they made something like this alongside everything else they made was a sign of how great this console was. I mean, that's the best I can do.
But it does look genuinely great. It's one of the best looking games in the system for sure.
Yeah, I've got a lot of absorbed praise for this one. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a making of it, it was a time extent. There was a great time extend on this, innit, years ago.
Yeah, I think I remember reading that one. Okay, all right, good stuff. So that was your wild card pick.
We just about survived that, the podcast there. The partnership endures, hopefully. Okay, let's take category six platformer, I'm going to take Crash Bandicoot 2 Cortex Strikes Back.
It's like the first game but better, basically. You run down mostly tunnel-shaped levels, not always. Sort of like jumping on crates, collecting apples, zapping enemies away with your little spin move, playing as a slightly annoying main character.
But it is the raw essence of PlayStation, beats in the heart of Crash Bandicoot, I'm afraid. He is part of the DNA of the console, as much as Tekken is. And so therefore, I think for the platformer category had to be this.
I did think about being a shitehawk and trying to take Castlevania Symphony of the Night here. I don't really think you can call that a platformer because it's got too much else going on in it. So, and I wanted to have a category that would challenge Matthew a little bit.
That was, I'll be honest, that was a little bit of my motivation for putting this category in here. But also platformers were massive sellers on this console. I think it is appropriate to have a category for them.
Yeah, I think there's a bit of consternation between Crash Bandicoot fans about whether it's this or Warped, which is a bit more of an ambitious game about whether it's the best one. But I think this one, by being almost exactly like the first one, only a bit better, means it's probably like the right pick to represent this series on this platform. Because I think probably the first one is the one people played the most.
But playing them both this past weekend, I was like, well, the second one is a little bit better. So I will take that one. So Matthew, I'm guessing you have no thoughts on that other than jump shit, etc.
You're a classic sort of performer. Great stuff. So what's your next pick?
If you somehow take another RPG under like, you know, a different category, I'd be very impressed.
I've still got 90 on Metacritic.
Load up, my friend. Go for it. You're like Chrono Cross, let's go.
For 90 on Metacritic, I'm going to take Legacy of Cain's Soul Reaver.
Oh, that's a good pick, I like that.
The same, the same boy who had Siphon Filter on his PS1, he also had this on his PS1. I remember going around to his house and him showing me all the horrible ways you could kill enemies. You could set them on fire with a torch and then they'd ride around.
You could pick them up when they were tired and throw them into a fire and then they'd ride around. You could pick them up and throw them onto a spike on the wall and I guess they did some riding there. This was another, like, if you're a teenager in the 90s, you like seeing extraordinary violence done to vampire bug things, this is definitely a game for you.
Has sort of an action adventure structure to it, so you're fighting bosses and getting new powers and then backtracking, so a little bit sort of, you know, Metroid-y, Zelda-y in terms of probably more Zelda-y. I guess the thing it's most like in my head is Darksiders now, in that kind of, like, slightly more full on combat scenarios, but there is also platforming and puzzling and going to and from, but it isn't quite like a big Zelda open world as such. It isn't a series I'm very familiar with outside of this game, like, its reputation, you know, if there is a big demand for it to come back, you know, I think there were things, I think Sam Barlow at one point was working on a game related to this at, when he was at Climax, I swear I've heard him talk about that.
It got pretty far along. I think there's quite a lot of material out there about that game, yeah.
Yeah, that's right. So yeah, where it sits in the grand landscape, I'm not entirely sure, but, you know, this was, you know, very polished, very exciting. I did sort of contemplate, you know, like a Tomb Raider or something here, but the recent re-releases of those just revealed them to be, well, reminded me of like what hard work they used to be, and I'm not actually into them that much as a result.
This, this, I just remember this being a bit more like, you know, playable on a basic level, a bit more accessible, nice and gory, very much a thing of its time. But yeah, I mean, it got 91 on Metacritic, so definitely loved.
Yep. An early, an early Amy Heddard game. I think that's Amy Heddard's first game.
I heard her talk about this on, I think it was Soren Johnson's podcast, there are no other podcasts, but that is a good one. Features Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad in the voice cast, Matthew. Really?
Nice bit of trivia there. Yeah, yeah. Apparently she's in Blood Omen as well, playing the character Ariel.
The thing that was intriguing me about this is the dimension hopping thing, where you go to the same place in a different dimension and then the puzzles would change or whatever. That must have been quite hard to pull off on PS1. Could you change seamlessly between them?
I didn't play this game at the time.
Was it special panels? In my head there's little glowing porters you stood on, because there were then limitations of how you could move around that world. You needed to unlock powers to like phase through walls and things.
So I don't think it let you do it just anywhere is how I remember it.
So it's very much like Ocarina of Time sort of thing, you know, just sort of two worlds.
It's quite similar to, I often think of Shadow Man in relation to this as well, similar kind of like gothic, that branching kind of looping ability led world thing.
Yeah, I remember this being like, like a big deal, like getting loads of really high scores at the time. So I think it's reputation only dipped slightly over time, like the series did, like it only got more coolly received. But yeah, this was a this was a big deal for the moment for sure.
Good pick, an interesting pick, not something I would have taken either. So I like that, Matthew. Okay, so category nine wild card.
So this is going to be my Parappa the Rapper category, right. But I played it again. I don't think that's a very good game.
I think it's got an amazing aesthetic, like Nana Onsha's kind of like combination of music and visuals from, is it Rodney Greenblatt? I can't remember the name of the artist now. Yeah, so amazing looking and sounding thing.
I don't think it's a good rhythm action game. I don't think it's as good as any of Harmonix's games, for example. It's extremely short as well.
It's quite a fiddly rhythm action game, I think. I don't think it holds up necessarily too well. It would be a good pick for this list, I will admit.
But I have to take my beloved Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, a game I fell in love with last year after playing it in NQ64 with Jay Bayliss. We've played loads of since then in Capcom's arcade stadium. Will you let me have this world card, Matthew?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, basically like a conversion of the whole Puyo Pop thing, but it's competitive and different Street Fighter characters have different rules for how you unlock these powerful combos that drop loads of shitty blocks into the other characters' screen. And then it does the three rounds and then you win sort of thing.
While beautiful chibi animations of Street Fighter characters and Darkstalkers characters, I think, beat each other up while music from the series plays as well. I think it's just like the best version of this type of thing I've played. And I've played Puyo Pop, I've played obviously Mean Bean Machine.
This is better than my beloved Mean Bean Machine, I think. It's just fast, furious, has that kind of Capcom gorgeous aesthetic to really take it to that next level. Yeah, it's a fantastic game and one of the best multiplayer games on PS1 and still holds up incredibly well, which is not true for all the games on this system.
So here it goes, Matthew. Thoughts on that, Pic?
Yeah, it's a nice, not like anything else on your console currently. So, yeah, shows the true breadth of it. Yeah, I don't think my console is going to be very representative of the more sort of esoteric corners of PS1.
It's hard to do with 10px, isn't it?
Also, I just don't have a huge amount of familiarity with them. I was looking at things like Vib ribbon and stuff, but it kind of looks like ass to me.
I think the appeal of that one was you could put your own CDs into it to create levels.
Do I really want to jump along to the best of Randy Newman? I can't see his songs giving me like really exciting rides, they're pretty slow.
Amazing. It always comes back to Randy Newman, the sort of obligatory mention on each episode. Okay, good stuff, Matthew.
So are we down to your last two picks? Is that right?
Yeah, sounds about right.
So what's your next pick?
No, three picks.
Okay, sorry.
Yeah. I mean, they're not things you're going to take so I can do them in any order. For License Game, and I preface this by saying I really struggled.
That shows how hopeful I am. I'm going to take Alien Trilogy.
Oh, that's a good pick. I like that.
The other trilogy. I have not played this game. I watched a big chunk of it this weekend.
I was hoping from the name Alien Trilogy it was going to be like Die Hard Trilogy and do each game in an interesting way. It actually kind of like lifts ideas from all three films, sort of mixes them together, but it's very much its own thing. It isn't a retelling.
There are environments that are more like one of the three different films, but action wise it's pretty full on all the time. So it's closer to like an Aliens game, kind of in the Doom mould. So 3D levels, but like quite cool kind of sprite versions of the Aliens and facehuggers.
Facehuggers very, very underwhelming in this game. They like jump on your face and fill up the screen so you can like see all the kind of gribbling sides of a facehugger. But all it is is kind of blocking your view for a little period of time, which is dangerous.
But like there isn't like a, you know, facehugger mechanic or anything interesting. It's basically like the blooper ink from Mario Kart, but like a bit more kind of fleshy and weird. But, you know, if you want to run around like for the time, kind of cool looking recreations of of alien environments, shooting a huge amount of aliens and watching their alien blood go everywhere looks very difficult because the alien blood can hurt you, I think.
So I would probably be quite bad at this game, but, you know, very different energy to alien isolation. If it doesn't feel like it's going for, you know, fear beyond the odd thing jumping out, you know, in in the doom molds of monster closets where loads of aliens pour out. But, you know, for the time and given the state of other licensed games on the console, it's a cool license and a pretty solid attempt to do justice, I think.
Yeah, I think this is one of the better sort of like Duma likes from this time, right? It's very, very similar aesthetically, but I like the way the aliens all look at it. It's like the final fight with the queen or something like that.
I just I've ever looked it up and think it's pretty cool. The size of that thing. I like that.
Yeah, I think it's I think it's a decent pick. It was something that just completely I just didn't think about actually. I didn't think about this as a possibility.
But I quite like it. That's much better than backing yourself into a corner and picking something daft like 007 racing or whatever. So yeah, that's that's good.
You'd blubbered the world is not enough, Matthew. We sort of avoided that, dodged that bullet. Okay, good pick.
Good pick. Right. So I think I'm in a similar boat of like, I know you're not going to take any of these, but let's do category three survival horror next.
I'm taking Silent Hill rather than try and fight Matthew and Resident Evil. I'll let them have that one. I love Resident Evil, of course, but Silent Hill is kind of like the other side of the coin with survival horror games on PS1.
So a bit different in the sense that it doesn't use fixed camera angles, fully 3D camera. Bold choice for the time, but it allows them to do some more cinematic things with it. And I think that the presentation of this is kind of why it's amazing.
It's the sort of Yamaoka soundtrack, the incredibly unsettling sound design of like hearing sort of air raid sirens and radio static and just the most horrible noises you can imagine in the background does so much the heavy lifting to make this, to sort of bring this world to life. I think a lot of what Silent Hill is arrives fully formed here. Like what the fuck is going on with this town?
Who are these really strange people around it? What are these fucked up looking monsters in it? It's more of that psychological horror than the sort of like Resident Evil sort of like, sort of, I guess, gorier, slasher horror, B-movie horror sort of thing it goes for.
Yeah, more traditional monster horror isn't it?
The aesthetic is just so sort of like precise. I think the story in 2 is way better than this and I think that Resident Evil is a slightly better combat game than this. I think it's a little bit, especially these days, a little bit tough to go back to on that level but I do think it's like as scary as the other ones.
It's just a really horrible game to look at and to listen to and therefore I think just to just to have discovered this at the time would have just been so powerful I imagine and even now it's still very unsettling as like more games of from the likes of Puppet Combo have led into this aesthetic. I think it just holds up really well as a slice of horror and what you can do with the capabilities of the PS1. So as a kind of good counter pick to Resident Evil I think Silent Hill is the one.
Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, this is a series which kind of takes off at two for me. I don't have a huge amount of experience with Silent Hill 1. I remember watching a segment about it on a TV gaming show.
I thought that looks like the most fucked up thing I've ever seen but my relationship is sort of that.
Yeah, I mean you know I don't think Takes Off is quite right. It was an acclaimed game but it's sort of like a very acclaimed game but it was, I think it's like two just has that story that stays with you forever I think and this has quite a forgettable story I think by comparison. But yes, I think it's sort of like, it's also in the wake of Resident Evil it was just something trying something a bit different aesthetically like not having the fixed camera angle.
It means you have to do more fog, more darkness, more like going through darkness with torchlight but all that stuff I think just helps to set it apart a little bit. So yeah, really, really effective. Okay, good stuff.
What's your next pick Matthew?
Fighting game. I have very little skin in the fighting game genre, even less so on bit, PlayStation 1. I had hoped to get Tekken 3.
My backup that I'll be taking is Bushido Blade.
Oh, that's a good pick.
Yeah, a game I really covered at the time. Again, I had a friend who had this and was always telling me about it. And the game that they built up in my mind was maybe more exciting than what it eventually was.
But the pitch of a sword fighting samurai sword fighting game with no health bar, because all you had to do was strike the critical killing blow. So, you know, in theory, a fight could be over in one swing of the sword if you like nicked their head or their chest. And like, the realism of that sounded incredibly exciting.
You know, I was like, oh, man, just imagine, you know, stabbing them when they're like bowing at the start of the fight, because that's that's sort of how it was in my head. To watch it now, it's a little bit more kind of like arcadian and goofy than that. But it has, you know, has ideas of its own for sure.
You know, the fact that you can like attack different limbs and sort of like wound or disable them completely so that like they then have to fight one handed or if you like hurt their leg, they're crawling around on the floor, you can actually get to the point where I think if you've disabled both their legs, they can press a button to basically just say, oh, I've lost this fight and like, like sacrifice themselves to you. They just put down their weapon and you can like chop, hit them in the head. So there's like a sort of fighting with honor and the whole thing is wrapped in this sort of code of the, you know, code of the Bushido or whatever they call it in the game.
You know, you're punished for fighting dishonorably. So if someone turns and you stab them in the back, that's technically not a win and ideas like that. Running around these quite big 3D arenas, like a little bamboo forest chopping up the bamboo with your sword, always looked very cool.
So that definitely ticks the, you know, a pop culture fantasy of, oh, I'd like to fight with a samurai sword in kind of cool martial arts style locations. And it does that, you know, whether it's got like the legs to, you know, it doesn't have that. I'm not going to say it's got the legs to stand up to Tekken 3, but it's...
Well, not after a guy chops them off, Matthew.
But I'm not quite at the point where I'm pressing the button to let you just give the death blow to Boshido Blade either. I think it's an interesting pick, hopefully.
No, I weighed up picking Soul Blade for this category because I like the... I think I slightly probably preferred Soul Blade to Tekken, because I like that you could just beat each other up with swords, I think. And it was otherwise quite similar.
And I played probably slightly more of Soul Blade, because my cousin had it, and I played like hours and hours of it. So I like... I respect picking a different thing.
It's true that Tekken wasn't the only thing happening with fighting games. And this is definitely like the definition of like a cult favorite. There are two Boshido Blade games.
Matthew, you're taking the first one, I'm guessing?
Yeah, I'm taking first, yeah.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. No, I have no jokes to make. And after Vagrant Story, we are on thin ice.
So I'm being very careful. No, no, that's good. That's good.
Street Fighter Alpha 3 was the other one that people lose their shit over.
I can't pretend to be interested or knowledgeable in that.
That's not what we do here. So, yeah, come on.
That would ring so false.
It would, yeah. Okay, for my next pick, then, my penultimate pick for shooter, I'm going to take my, the final game I played over this weekend and the best one I played over this weekend, Einhander. Oh, it's so fucking good.
Side scrolling shooter in the kind of R type mold, I guess. You're, you're sort of like playing this basically sort of like floating police car pod thing, I think, that basically can switch weapons on a dime. I think that's how it sort of like differentiates itself.
You can switch between three different subweapons at any one time and you can pick up loads of different subweapons that you basically add to your arsenal as you go. So you'll have like your, your basic vertical fire attack and you'll pick up like a Vulcan gun that will do like a diagonal attack. You'll get like this thing called Wasp, which just fires loads and loads of missiles.
Cannon, which is like a really powerful sort of slower gun. Grenade thing where you just, you can fire behind you as well as in front of you. There's sometimes that's really useful.
There's a one called Hedgehog, I think it is, where you sort of like drop bombs from above. Really, really good. A game I discovered from an edge time extend years ago, maybe even like 10 plus years ago.
But people are like, oh, Squaresoft made a side scrolling shooter and it's one of the best ones. And I was like, right, OK, one day I have to play that. Finally played it this weekend.
Great music as well. Again, that sort of like PS1 genre drum and bass thing. Just really cool music.
And just I think it's just a great example of the genre. I really like R type Delta on PS1. But this is the one where I thought this like I don't have many real like cult hits on my console.
So I thought for shooter, which is a tough category anyway, rather than try and take one of the Medal of Honor games, which I don't think you would recommend to anyone these days, where you can play either the PC Medal of Honor, Allied Assault or like a Call of Duty game. I think that Ironhander is like something you can only get on PS1, long lost, kind of a perfect fit and a genuinely great game. So I played it for myself to check.
So that's my pick Matthew. Do you know anything about this game?
No, I just was looking at bits of it there. It looks cool for sure. And yeah, like the right people seem to be praising it.
Or people who know about these things. Yeah, that's cool. Whether it's enough to defeat the excitement of slowly cooking a man with a taser, who knows?
I mean, it clearly comes from the heart. So I do like I sincerely wish you well with it. But I also know our audience.
Cypher Filter or Einhander.
I think our audience... I think we'll see. I think they might surprise you on that one.
The other thing about this, I think this runs at 60 FPS. It's very, very smooth, which is unusually slick for a PS1 game. And also it does, because it's a 3D game, it does loads of the cameras.
They have these sort of like star voxie bits where the camera gets closer and you see like a big boss kind of like float into view and that sort of thing. Presentationally, it's just really up there, I think. So, yep.
Yeah, it's probably the most oddball thing on my system, but good to have a mix in there. So there it is. Come to your final pick.
Is that right, Matthew?
Yeah, my final pick. I know it's boring when we do this, but I have to do it. For platformer, I am going to take Crash Bandicoot 3 Warped.
You know, I can't undo years of Duncan on Crash, so this is going to seem very insincere coming from me. It's, you know, it isn't my cup of tea as a platformer. The whole kind of linear corridor, sort of always running platformer.
It's just, it's not for me. I know what it unlocks in terms of that focus lets you have gorgeous visuals and some quite fun, you know, gimmicky concepts to the levels. Maybe this is just me lazily doing this because the naughty dog connection, but like I think if Crash Bandicoot 2 is the Uncharted 2 of the trilogy, like the one which like just takes all the ideas and really nails it in the second one, the third one is the one which kind of goes all out.
It's a bit more over the top. It has this time travel storyline, which lets the levels be a bit more varied in terms of like locations. I mean, it is crucially exactly the same thing kind of under the hood.
You know, there's lots of riding along a racetrack, jumping over holes, except, you know, in one you're riding on a motorbike, in another you're riding on a dolphin, you're riding, you know, a tiny lion thing along the Great Wall of China. So it's different skins on the same ideas, but quite snazzy, you know, a company who is showing off all his technical know-how on the machine. If you really get into it and you want to do all the kind of secret hunting, there's all kinds of like weird shit hitting the levels and lots of kind of collectibles.
I think if you do engage with that, it all gets substantially harder. I've always found these games quite difficult. I would blame that on the kind of controls and the perspective personally.
But, you know, people love it.
We got it! That's Simpsons' meme.
Yeah. When you look at like top 10 lists on PS1, there's always a crash somewhere in the mix. And like to my eyes, it seemed half and half between Cortex Strikes Back and Warped.
Yeah, that's why I noticed. So, you know, we'll just see where our audience lands on that great divide. Maybe they'll just cancel each other out and allow us to focus on the siphon filter, iron hand face off instead.
Yeah, I mean, I think it's I agree that there are some people I think were like, oh, they didn't like the changes to three. And then some people are like, actually, they did. They did need some changes.
And I agree. They kind of cancel each other out, don't they? So thank you for putting yourself through that, Matthew.
You really earned your Patreon money this month. I know that must have killed you. So well done.
No, it's all right. You've got to like, I'll definitely take Crash Over Spyro, which I think is like, that's just a whole lot of nothing to me.
Yeah, I agree. I don't think that was... I don't really know why that took off, Spyro.
I don't think it even had...
It was the wings.
Oh, for fuck's sake. This is basically the same as my legs joke for Bushido Blade. Anyway, let's move on to my last pick then.
OK, I'm going out on a high. My category 7 RPG pick is Final Fantasy VIII. If you'd have asked me when I was a teenager, which is better, VIII or VII, I would have said VIII.
These days, I would say VII, but it's still very, very close. Absolutely, obviously, golden age for this series on PlayStation 1. Incredibly important.
And I think all of them are... They're all quite different from each other as well. I think this is a lot of people's first encounter with the fact that they changed the setting and world and mechanics completely between games for Final Fantasy VIII.
And so if you played VII and then played this, you'd no doubt be a little bit surprised by that. Essentially, about a bunch of mercenary teenagers who get brought into a wider conspiracy by this sorceress from the future who wants to destroy time itself because her boyfriend died, I think. No, her knight died.
That was it. Something like that. And people largely speculate that the sorceress from the future is Renoir, your love interest, and the knight in question was Squall.
Spoiler alert, the main character. If you believe that, that's an amazing conceit, I think, that you are basically fighting yourselves in the future as the villains of this game. But a really memorable party of characters from good hangs like Selfie to bad hangs like Zell, as previously explained, with a massive variety of fighting styles, really bold junctioning system that allows you to tag spells onto attacks to give them elemental powers and make them more powerful.
Really kind of great notion that means you have to think about the disposability of the spells you use when you use them in combat, using them carefully. Some of the best summons in the game as well, just really lavish animations. The graphical step up from 7, you don't have the playmobil-looking world map versions of the characters.
It's quite consistent, realistic look between the different characters. Of course, notoriously, Squall's face isn't up to much as people joke about in that meme from him at the ball. But the FMVs were again amazing step up as well.
Great villains in this, like Cypher, what a piece of shit, sort of antagonist, really, really good. I absolutely dug the school setting when I was a student myself. I just thought that was really cool.
My first encounter with a lot of those anime tropes that you encounter many times elsewhere. Again, amazing music as well. Just really, really good.
And yeah, maybe 7 is the one that people remember and revere more. But 8 I think has like the right amount of annoying people who say it's better than 7, that it might attract some votes from them, Matthew. So yeah, I think liking 8 is a bit of a sort of like, people sort of build their identities around that shit.
So I'm going to lead into that here. Thoughts?
No, I think, you know, you need one of these games on the machine for sure. I think having any of them is a bit of a win. You know, they're all interesting, all exciting, all massive.
So I keep thinking about this like it's an actual product and you'll be thinking about, did I get my money's worth from it? And having a Final Fantasy definitely helps that. So yeah, I got no problem with this.
I will finish it one day playing this game. I think I've only played like the first 10 hours or something of it. But yes, very, very cool.
Yeah, yeah, because I was going to do like an honorable mentions, but I feel like we've got so much of what I would value about this console here. And if not, I've mentioned it like Spider-Man or whatever, or Brappa the Rapper, like stuff that was notable. But I feel like between us, we've kind of captured this system quite well.
Yeah, so I don't know. Rayman 2, Matthew, you attempted to pick that for platform. I thought you like Rayman 2 for some reason, but I don't know.
No, I'm not really into it. I like the last two Rayman games. The original run of them aren't for me.
The only other two things I was looking at were Dino Crisis, maybe, in the mix as a bit of a weird one. And for Wildcard, I was thinking about Fear Effect, which I know is a bit naff, but it kind of still looks amazing.
Yeah, nice aesthetic, that one. Yeah, I thought about... There was also Wipeout I thought about for a racing game.
I really liked the Colony Wars games, but I didn't think they were as good as Ironhander for shooter, so that's why they lost out. G-Police similarly, sort of third person, kind of like shooting spaceship kind of games. But yeah, I think we kind of...
I always think we kind of got our arms around the console quite nicely. So shall we go through our draft picks, Matthew?
Yeah, I wish fighting game wasn't number one.
Ha ha.
For Category 1 Fighting Game, I've got Tekken 3.
I've got Pachito Blade.
Category 2 Shooter, I've got Ironhander.
I've got Siphon Filter.
Category 3 Survival Horror, I've got Silent Hill.
I've got Resident Evil 2.
Category 4 Racing or Sports, I've got Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.
Ridge Racer Type 4.
Category 5 License Game, I've got Die Hard Trilogy.
I've got Alien Trilogy.
Category 6 Platformer, I've got Crash Bandicoot 2 Cortex Strikes Back.
And I've got Crash Bandicoot 3 Warped.
Category 7 RPG, I've got Final Fantasy 8.
I've got Final Fantasy 7.
Category 8, 90 plus on Metacritic, I've got Metal Gear Solid.
I've got Legacy of Kain's Soul Reaver.
Category 9 Wild Card, I've got Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
And I've got the Thriller Minute Vagrant Story.
Category 10 Free Pick, I've got Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
And I've got Xena Gears or Xena Gears, however you want to call it.
That was a good draft. I think we both sort of brought it there.
I don't think I shit the bed too badly.
Nah, it was good. Also, I don't think we picked anything where we just had nothing to say. That would have been the worst case if we'd just been like five games a piece that neither of us had anything to say about, which is what it'd be like if we had like a Saturn draft or whatever.
Oh yeah, for sure. Don't even say the words. Don't even give people the idea that's going to happen.
No, the next one we do will probably be the Game Boy draft. I have to negotiate with Matthew when that will happen, but probably in the summer sometimes. So look forward to that.
But I really enjoyed that, Matthew. I think that was good. So you, the listener, can vote for the winner at BackpagePod on X or Twitter.
I'm sorry the polls are still there, but I don't want to put them on Patreon in case people think that I'm trying to blackmail them into backing us. I'm not doing that at all. So it's free to vote.
That is still available, so we'll do that. And yes, we'll talk about the winner in a future episode. I'll also update the episode description to say who won.
