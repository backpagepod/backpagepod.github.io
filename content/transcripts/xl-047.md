Hello and welcome to the Backpage XL, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts from joined as ever by Matthew. Hello. Hello Matthew. How have you been spending this cold Sunday in January? It's uh I don't know about you, but January's are a month where I do nothing. I have nothing in the social calendar. And then all my friendships kind of resume in February. I don't know if you do similar.

Matthew
00:45
Cryogenically frozen all your pals. I say that 'cause I've just been watching the Fallout TV show, so I've got cryopods on the mind. What have they been doing? Uh trying to get through some asshole late missions in GTA four. That's what I've been doing. Oh yeah.

Samuel
01:00
Some Pegarino bullshit.

Matthew
01:01
And yes.

Samuel
01:03
All to all for one episode of a podcast. Is it worth it, Matthew? Is the Patreon money and the adoration for the podcast make it worth it or uh or not?

Matthew
01:12
Oh no, it's absolutely worth it. I'm I'm I'm really looking forward to going into GTA 6 later in the year, hopefully, with these replays under my belt. Like there's so much I'd forgotten about or maybe didn't appreciate or see slightly differently now. So yeah, it's it's a good exercise. So join us and replay GTA 4. before we do that episode.

Samuel
01:35
Yeah, so that episode is coming on the last Friday of January. And then for Patreon next month we're going to do the two DLC packs. uh Lost and Damned and Ballad of Gayetoni as uh an excellent episode just about those to kind of cap off GTA four. And then don't know when we'll tackle GTA five, Matthew, the summer maybe? June, that kind of time? Does that sound about right to you? Yeah, I'll need a few months to take a run at that one for sure. Yeah, it's a fucking long game. It's about twice as long as GTA 4, so um definitely gonna be a bit of an undertaking. And then uh yes, probably I guess Red Dead 2 will try and do just before GTA. Uh six comes out in like maybe in October. Uh it's gonna be a tight squeeze to be honest. But uh and somewhere between there we've got do Wind Waker and Mario 64, it's gonna be a busy year, but um And then all the other new games coming out. Podcasting, eh? What a what a lifestyle. Um no, I I've really I've really enjoyed it. I can't wait to discuss it with you and Jeremy. I've already started working on the podcast plan. I never start a podcast plan. weeks in advance, but I have for this one. So um excellent. Yes. Such is the uh such are the demands or the you know, it just necessitates it, I think, the uh the game that we're talking about and um it's been so long since I've played it that you know there's a there's a lot to discuss a lot I've forgotten also so uh yes. Speaking of old games, Matthew, even further back than GTA 4, ten years before that in fact. This episode is all about Goldeneye 0007 on N64, a game that our listeners are probably quite familiar with. So we have First Light coming out this year. And I honestly thought it would be a good opportunity to do two or three Bond game themed episodes in the run-up, obviously very early on in the podcast lifespan. We did an episode all about the James Bond games, including the NAF PS2 ones. It was a fun episode. Quite brief though. I think we've um got a couple of episodes in us uh talking about the Bond games before. First light lands, the first Bond game in f thirteen years, fourteen years, something like that. It's been a long time. Um so well might as well start with the the best one and uh here we are. And it's also a nice companion piece to uh to Perfect Dark I think. So um Matthew how you how did you feel about the idea of revisiting Goldeneye for this episode. Was it uh a bigger lift than you thought it'd be or or quite a nice uh nice gentle experience?

Matthew
03:43
We we did the replaying of this together. You came around our house and We played it and raced through it and that was nice. Kinda took the pressure off, made it more of a social event. I think if I was just locked down replaying games for the podcast this month, I'd have gone a little bit crazy. So I'm glad that we turned it into a Pepsi Max and Rice Krispy Cake socializing session.

Samuel
04:07
Yeah, it was really it was a really fun thing to do because that's that's the thing. We never ever play these games together when we do these. I mean That was the good thing about Perfect Dark is we did some of the multiplayer modes when when I came around your house. So we did a bit of counteroperative and and that sort of stuff and You know, had Catherine joining with the multiplayer. And so yeah, it was fun to basically blast through the entire campaign in Agent, which is what we did uh yesterday as we're recording this, the Saturday. And uh yeah, very enjoyable. I brought some Pepsi and Rice Krispie cakes around a kind of a a ritual of going around Matthews that you bring a soft drink and um some kind of sweet treat. So uh I gave you some water. You did, which I was very very grateful for. You offered me various juices from your fridge. It sounded like you had about nineteen beverages in there. I always respect a man who's got a lot of beverages at his uh at his command. Um but yeah, so um a game that Matthew is very comfortable with, a game I know really well as well, although I never owned the game at the time, as I've discussed on previous podcasts. Gonna talk about it in more detail and uh yes, we'll uh start with a little bit of the making of the game. I made some notes here. It's pretty well documented the making of this game at this point. It's been Covered in, you know, the likes of Retro Gamer and The Guardian did a really big article on it about uh three years ago, um which is one of my sources here, written by Simon Parkins. So that was super useful. There's been a lot of war stories told from the creation of this game because it was basically made by dudes in their twenties who had nothing but time to chuck into this game, or at least that was kind of what was asked of them by Ray's culture based on what people have been sharing about that um over the years. So GoldenEye 007 took two and a half years to make. It was made by a Core team of nine, um led by Martin Hollis, but uh twelve is the upper end of people who ended up working on it. Um when they started developing the game it was briefly thought about as a SNES game, like uh Maybe a sidescotting beat-em-up or something, but that went away pretty quickly. They didn't know what the next Nintendo uh console after the snares was going to uh going to be like in terms of hardware specifications. And um the game was designed a little bit on the fly when you ask when um people are asked about uh about about its creation in terms of the different ideas and how it came together. Two and a half years was quite a long time for a a game for game development back then. So pretty inexperienced team, only four who'd actually worked on games before out of that core nine, apparently. And Rare very much had a go-with-your gut style approach to making games. This had obviously followed the Donkey Kong Country games when Rare had basically pitched their um fancy um technology um for making the games look pseudo 3D um and which impressed Nintendo, got their funding, Nintendo bought 25% of the studio. And uh yeah, so that relationship was very um was was firmed up at this point. And um yeah, this team worked insane hours to get Gold Night Double Seven done basically. And the soundtrack duties were split between Graham Norgate and Grant Kirkhope. Um David Doak, or Doak, however you pronoun want to pronounce that, quite interesting character in this. He was the oldest member of the team, um, focused primarily on the single player levels and designing AI for those, but before this he was actually in charge of the basically the 3D graphics uh system they were using or engine they were using to make the game and how that was how that was used between the different studios almost quit then got offered a job to um to go work on this instead. And it was initially conceived by Hollis, uh Goldeneye 007, as an on-rail shooter um in uh inspired by Virtua Cop. Um but once they got hold of the N64 hardware, they realized it could be offrails and um Doom was obviously a big deal in that moment when the game the game development started in nineteen oh five. So another influence on the on on that decision to make it a first person shooter. Do you feel like you see the light gun shooter influence in the death animations, Matthew? I went back and listened to um to our um perfect dark podcast. It's an observation I made, but without realizing that VertraCop was a kind of like a point of influence for Hollis. And now that I know that it sort of really connects those dots in my head. Of how things work.

Matthew
08:10
was very ghost squad coded.

Samuel
08:12
It really was, dude like multiple dudes coming out of tiny, um, child sized compartments. Truly it was um an extraordinary feat of um of physics or yes, just enemies spawning out of nowhere for no real reason. Uh uh interesting in terms of the license, they were basically free to use anything from the Bond franchise based on the rights that they had from Eon and MGM. Um which is why there are so many elements from other movies in the game in terms of um the the two bonus levels and also the multiplayer characters, villains from Other films in the series bes besides Goldeneye and obviously the game came along um two years after the film had actually released as well, so that was a little bit unusual. Um yeah, so they watched Bond movies in the office at lunch times constantly for research purposes. They didn't have very long lunch times when you Hear about this more like 20 30 minute chunks basically. So we're watching little bits of Live and Let Die in that fashion. Um that's such a a peak nineties experience, I think, watching those on VHS and little barn um in Twicross Um the team visited the Golden Eye set several times during development. I got the impression this was maybe just one or two of them. Um taking their own reference photos and getting access to the dimensions of the film sets. Um so for example, when it came to something like the archives level, they understood how that set sort of like fit together basically um from the actual from actually being there um while they were making the film. Uh apparently MGM asks for some of the more violent death animations to be toned down, and that's um also why they cut the additional bond models for the multiplayer. approval process at the end of development. Um they also didn't have the rights to Joe Don Baker's appearance, Matthew, his likeness. Um just why you don't see Jack Wade in the game. Um which is I I never really thought about him not being in the game until literally this morning when I was researching this. And um Rare, uh the leadership of Rare didn't want credits in the game, um, attributing the game to individual people, but Hollis fought for them. That's why the game has these quite strange film-style credits. at the end of the game and uh yes that includes like um basically set design and weird credits like that that have nothing to do with game development really but they loosely connected to the different jobs of people working on the game. Yes, and Matthew, um a really a bit of trivia I learned from this um this video I was watching on um Goldeneye, which is by by um on a retro tip, um that YouTube channel. Um I think it's a British channel. And um yeah, apparently um the the the BJ sign that we saw in the in Statue Park in um in that level was a reference to artist Brett Jones, who was um who worked on the game. Didn't realise that until um this morning either, but then I'd never even spotted that BJ or two end it wasn't Bond, comma James. That was great. That was something Matthew said aloud. Who what does BJ mean? I'd never even realized it was there to be honest, but um yes. So almost there now with some um shedding light on this Matthew, but the multiplayer, which is such a key component of Goldeneye, came together very last minute It was added four or six months before launch in 1997, depending on which source you read. Um the team played a lot of uh l uh Land Doom multiplayer at this time and multiplayer Bomberman. Um so there was a lot of enthusiasm for multiplayer in their office. Um they privately made a multiplayer mode in the evenings because there was some concern. um the rare leadership wouldn't go for it. Did sound like there's quite a lot of skepticism from above on multiplayer, which is interesting. But then it gave gained a positive reputation within Rare. Teams in the other barns at Rare wanted to play it. Apparently the to the Conquer team were especially into playing Goldeneye multiplayer um between themselves. So a lot of this is down to programmer Steve Ellis um who went and made uh made a two-player multiplayer mode, then someone said Can you go and make it four play? Because there are four controller ports in the N64. And he went and did that. So um thank you to him. It's interesting actually because Halo has a very similar story of um multiplayer being added at the very last minute and then it becoming obviously a defining part of that uh franchise.

Matthew
11:58
So just play multiplayer would be quite a creepy experience in Goldeneye think. If it's just two of you locked It's becomes more of a horror game.

Samuel
12:06
Yeah, it doesn't quite work having the old um pro proximity mines in um uh in facility. It doesn't really make as much sense to two people. There's no kids when there's only two people. That's true. Um so Yeah, I mean a special mention, like I say, to um Simon Parkinson's piece here, which I'll link in the sh in the notes, along with this um on a retro tip video, um, because it's just good uh good practice to do that. Um so Ray's crunch culture at the time was uh uh quite unbelievable. Um you weren't allowed to uh leave the office at lunch times to do uh little bits of um like you know like getting your car tax basically like that's something that david doak mentioned is something you couldn't do while you worked at Rare. It was Part of the culture. Um, it's interesting because a lot of the stuff I don't think really came out until years later when people in their forties and fifties wondering why they were so tired to their bones. Um Rare apparently asked uh some staff. um to sign a waiver relinquishing them from EU legislation limiting overtime, which is a ma uh unbelievable, but says everything about where game development was at in this moment really. Uh eventually the team worked a hundred hour weeks to get Goldeneye done. Um it nearly killed me, said Martin Oli Hollis, and I was certainly very unhappy once the project was finished, a kind of postpartum depression. that I think a lot of creative people experience. I should have taken a break rather than embarking on another project, but that was the culture. It caused me serious burnout. But the game, of course, was a huge success. Um it was a slow burn according to the developers. They saw a line going up for blockbuster rentals month by month. It became enormous through word of mouth and certainly by 1998, which I think is when I first played it, all the kids I knew were talking about it. Um still the royalties uh off the back of the game highlighted there was a class system at the company. Uh artist Brett Jones made six grand in exchange for thousands of hours of overtime. Um a lot of the team left after development, uh some sounded disillusioned, and um nonetheless the game remained this great calling card for all who played it. Don't feel suit too bad for Brett Jones though because he stuck around for perfect dark and that apparently paid for his house. So good for him really, Matthew. Um any observations on the making of this? Because I know you're not a huge rare guy, but I imagine you're pretty uh familiar with a lot of elements of this story.

Matthew
14:15
Oh yeah absolutely. I I think the the cr crunch culture thing is obviously something that comes out. a bit later and it does explain I wouldn't say like a mass exodus, but there are there are some people, like Martin Hollis for example, goes off and he made a uh a a Sudoku battle game for the DS called Zendoku and he made Bonsai Barber for WiiWare and oh what was the name of his company? It was maybe called something like Zen or something. It was i th a small indie outfit and I remember at the time thinking, why would you ever leave Rare? You know, to go and do that sized sc you know, that scale of games. Uh and yeah, and then you read about this and you're like, oh, well yeah, that makes sense. Um because I think the way these games were talked about and covered by magazines when they were happening, you know, mainly in sixty four, which I was reading, you know, it was just the you know, whatever they're doing, don't change anything, keep on doing it. This is brilliant. We love it. You know, we're always so jealous of everyone at Rare. We'd love to work at Rare. Um, so that was that was a bit of an eye opener. But as with all these things, it's always like a b you know a bit of a r a reminder how most games are a bit of a miracle, you know?

Samuel
15:34
Yeah, for sure. And um I think the the one thing that really sort of made rare. Be as successful as it was at this time was I think that they shared Nintendo's philosophy about keep going with the game until it's good basically as opposed to pushing out the door. And so that was the case with um with Goldeneye. Um they just really they took the time to get it right to find what the game was and um You know, that's very rare for a I mean this is back in the life the days of licensed games when you basically had to hit a movie deadline, like you had to You got the license maybe a year before and development started six months before it launched, then you had it on the shelves in time for the game and uh in time for the film coming out and This is such a different case by comparison and uh yeah, it's um yeah, I I sort of feel bad for them in retrospect 'cause These are the sort of things I think you can you can sacrifice a lot of your young life and it not seemed like a big deal in the moment. But then years later when you reflect on it, you're kinda y your perspective on it changes, you're like, that wasn't okay that that happened actually. And you know, maybe you sacrifice other parts of your your personal life for that and, you know, who knows what kind of experiences you might have had in your twenties that by the time you're in your And PC gamer, uh so Yeah, but I didn't I didn't work quite as hard as they did. A hundred hour weeks is just crazy. And um Yeah, but that is the other interesting thing is they all they all said that Goldeneye has been this amazing calling card throughout their entire careers. No matter what else they've gone to do, like saying you worked on Goldeneye is just uh You know, for a long time it opened doors, so uh yes.

Matthew
17:17
Except now people are like, Goldeneye? Goldeneye Rogue Agent or the Goldeneye remake on Wii. And you have to you have to sort of go, uh well, it was the Wii one, okay, okay. Remind me of your history with Goldeneye, Matthew. Do you remember when you first played it? Yeah, we rented an N sixty four relatively soon after launch. My dad rented it, um uh a weekend that we were staying with him and yeah, I remember playing it on Friday nights. And it you know, just blowing me away. Like I can remember that weekend tr trying to sleep and having the game like burnt into my eyes Which has happened a couple of times in my life when something is so just captures your imagination so completely and is just so, you know, eye-opening and amazing. that your your brain just can't get out of the game, can't leave it behind when it turns off. And yeah, I can just remember like a weekend of just playing it every minute we could before we had to, you know, leave and give this rented N sixty four back. Um but also combined with like the fevered sort of dreaming of, you know, damn on an endless loop. Um because I hadn't re I just hadn't played anything like it, you know. I you know, I wasn't you know, hugely familiar with first person shooters in general, you know, like I I hadn't played loads of that stuff on my PC, so yeah, I it you know it was just uh uh you know, a proper like massive leap. The combination of that and Mario 64, I think we rented both of them, you know, and it was just like a Oh my god, you're just overwhelmed, you know?

Samuel
18:59
Yeah, I feel like the story of you renting the PlayStation and you renting the N64, that's like your pick your origin story and Dragon Age Origins kind of thing really and you you kinda knew you knew which one you were off the back of those two weekends of those two concerts.

Matthew
19:14
One of them was trying to play Final Fantasy VII without dying so you didn't have a save card. And the other one was, you didn't need a safeguard cause it was all on cartridge. That's why they got me, you know?

Samuel
19:25
Yeah. See, I I can't remember when I first played Goldeneye. And I like your le your story though, it's kinda like the stuff of legend. Um but I do remember There were like two sets of friends who had it and I remember specifically biking across town with a little group of mates because he he was like, Oh yeah, m this guy's got Goldeneye, let's go around and play that. I think I just played it at a friend's house and only played it in multiplayer and didn't really understand it. And then there was this uh weird moment at the end of nineteen ninety eight where my uh one of my relatives died and I was deemed I was deemed slightly too young to go to the funeral because it was not it was not like an old person funeral where you're like, well, it's sad that that happened, but they were old. It was one of those funerals where you're like, that really sucks, actually. So um I just got sort of like sent off with a friend of the family basically and her son. had an N64 and um we went to McDonald's and after that she was like, Oh you're welcome just play as games console um for the afternoon if you want. And I just looked at his like little treasure trove of N64 games. The games I remember playing were I played Shadows of the Empire, I played Mission Impossible very briefly, not really understanding how it worked. There'll never be a two giant men play Mission Impossible episode of this podcast. And then play Goldeneye and then relish the chance to be able to like play the single player on my own time. That's the the very visceral feeling I remember because I played the multiplayer and I was like This is really cool, but I don't understand I remember just having friends explain the C buttons to me because I just didn't I couldn't really get my head around how the controller functioned because I'd only ever played with like a Mega Drive or a NES controller, which is so much simpler than the N64 pad. And so yeah, I think I got through dam and facility, and then from that point onwards it was just like an object of fascination. So anytime I was at a friend's house, I just had to had to, you know, get a hold of it and give it a try and learn more about it. And so it became one of those sort of like whenever I'm around around a friend's house, if we're gonna talk about What are we g what does everyone fancy playing? I was immediately like Goldeneye, I just want to play Goldeneye. I just want to learn more about Goldeneye. And it's right around this time that ITV started airing all the Bond films um in sort of like weekly fashion as well. So It lined up perfectly, um, those two things. And uh yeah, that was kinda my um my first touch point with it, Matthew. So On that note really, I mean you're you're like three years older than me. I want to talk about the very specific playground culture around this game, because it's my personal feeling that this game kept the N64 in the running up against the PlayStation, at least in the UK. Just as Sony were offering more adult games to anyone over the age of ten would be excited about playing your um diehard trilogies and your Metal Gear Solids and the like. or even just like, you know, the sheer amount of racing at games and beat-em-ups that they had on that console. This was something they had no decent alternative for. There were no great first-person shooters on PlayStation. Didn't matter who you were, everyone wanted to play Goldeneye and loved the multiplayer. But um I just feel like every element of this game was dissected and talked about in playgrounds, the different cheats, the different levels. What do you remember about this?

Matthew
22:35
Yeah, it it is true, though I'd say it's of an era where being into video games was a super nerdy pastime. And I remember this being the intense obsession of my close circle of friends, but it it wouldn't really break out. Like we never played this at a broader You know, if someone had like a big birthday party with 20 people, there wouldn't be Goldeneye there. But Goldeneye defined every single meeting, you know, I had with my friends like Mark, Craig and Rob. you know, and then at the weekend playing with my brother and the boys across the river. You know, for us that's all we did for like maybe a couple of years, probably even until like Perfect Dark came along, was was play Goldeneye together. Um but it wasn't like I I didn't feel like it was like a cool thing. Uh you know, it's it's still quite kind of private. It was a bit of a s not a secret shame, but like, you know It's it's less of a thing now, but back then like I think you like the girls in A would be mortified if I tried talking to them about Goldenley, you know? So it it so it was it was kind of it was private in that sense. It was super intense in the thing in the magazines I read again in sixty-four magazine. So like you know, they felt like you know, friends I hadn't met who were just on the the same wavelength and were talking about the same thing. But yeah, I mean certainly you know, within our group it's as as intense as I've you know, talked and thought about any any one game for sure. Like the cheats thing, just all of us, you know, racing through desperately trying to unlock the cheats by doing the time trials on the different modes. Not all of us were good at it. I was quite bad at it. I remember having to get my friend Mark to um you know finally unlock you know all the guns by doing facility really fast because I just couldn't do it and was getting too frustrated Um as you witnessed yesterday, I've got a very short fuse when it comes to failure in any game. You sure do. Yes. So um I guess yeah, in my world it was ap it was absolutely massive, but I I still d I don't want to pretend like, you know, i i there was you know, an N sixty four in every house or anything, 'cause there simply wasn't.

Samuel
24:55
Right, but th this is where I think we have a tiny like marked uh sort of generational difference is that the popular kids in my in my year, the boys at least. did play Goldeneye. They did know what Goldeneye was. They knew what I'm I distinctly remember th those kids talking about how funny it was that it was called Slappers Only, for example. Like I have a visceral memory of that. I think that This was like pervasive that all boys uh no matter who you spoke to, they had some kind of exposure to Goldeneye. I do I feel like 80% of them would have either played it or knew what it was. It was really just like a a go round someone's house on your bike, leave your bikes outside. play this game for like two hours and go again. That was happening. And so yeah, um that might just be a yeah, it might just be a My you know, uh our difference in age means that my generation are more like more likely to have grown up with a console in their house when they were like eight, eight or nine as opposed to like twelve or thirteen. You know what I mean?

Matthew
25:57
Yeah, that is that's absolutely true. But it was it was just super, super dreeby. Like if I'd talk to the cool people in the air about any bit of this game, if I tried if I said the word bunker to like the coolest people in our year, I would have just been put in a bin or something.

Samuel
26:15
So um you know it I remember popular kids knowing who Tanya was in Red Alert. Like it's Yeah, video games are so pervasive in my year by comparison.

Matthew
26:25
No, I I re I mean um maybe it's just that, you know, I am was nerdier and more of a loner than than I think I was. And actually there were clusters of other people playing games that and you we just didn't get invited to their houses or we didn't get invited to those parties or we just weren't part of those conversations. But I mean, you know, they were only like whatever like a a hundred kids in my year, for example, um at secondary school, and five of us having N64 felt like like a pretty big pretty big deal but statistical anomaly.

Samuel
27:04
Yeah. Um Yeah, I mean I had uh we talked about this before but I had three hundred and sixty kids in my year. It's a massive secondary school. So um you know, a much broader spread of people. And uh yeah, I don't know, it it's uh there are like there were definitely games though that you couldn't talk about with those people. I've mentioned this before, but Final Fantasy is not a game you could have talked about with those people. It'd either be like Eh or not know what it was or not really care basically. So um yeah, but I don't know, foot yeah, uh football games, racing games and yeah, GTA eventually and actually no GTA around this time 'cause the r the original ones were still quite controversial and Talked about in the UK, but Goldeneye was like a massive staple. It had like uh it ate up a lot of headspace, I feel like. So uh yes. Um So let's talk about why it was so sticky, Matthew. We talked about this a bit with Perfect Dark as well, because they only tripled down with the sticky elements in that game in terms of adding every single conceivable multiplayer option you could ever want on top of what is in Goldeneye, but You've got these layers of difficulty-based objectives where depending on which of the three difficulty settings you pick, the game adds more objectives for you to complete in order to finish the level. There's the unlockable cheats which are based on finishing levels and certain difficulties within certain time frames. And some of those cheats uh make replaying the the games uh replaying the levels very exciting and Um that's that's a cool element as well. The different weapon loadouts for multiplayer and the different modes in multiplayer, the idea of um license to kill as a mode. Again, something that I feel like we talked about loads in my In my school licensed kill was almost a game within the game really because it was such an extreme version of what the multiplayer was. And um Yeah, it really just took up more headspace than the entire game. Some of the modes in this game are the ways you could play it, like doing throwing knives or doing slappers only or you know doing golden gun, whatever it might be. Yeah, so I mean uh this feels like something that we've talked about I think the value of games back then and the idea you could play them m over and over again, but If you compare this to something like Metal Gear Solid, for example, that's really a one and done game. There's no reason to go back and do that. But here it felt like they built it to be played forever. Um what do you think the sort of philosophy is behind that?

Matthew
29:17
Everything which kind of kept me playing ties back to it feeling like a big sort of toy box, a big sort of sandbox. Not in the way that it's like super open world or anything like that but in terms of you know wanting to endlessly replay it with the cheats for example like to see what different cheats did to different levels, the idea of being able to go through the levels with all the weapons unlocked and just seeing how that could play out in, you know. in infinite number of different ways, you know, playing the game with the different objectives from working up from agent all in secret agent and double O um and Just seeing how the levels changed, you know, they could feel like very different places or different run throughs based to that. So, you know, we you know that that already accounts for playing like single player you know, for like hundreds of hours, just the act of unlocking and then messing around with all that shit. I think as an actual single player game, I think the slight stealth leaning of it is a big part of its magic because the levels to me back then anyway felt like quite functioning spaces that you were sneaking around and like rudely interrupting and you could really take your time with them and experiment with like you know, how far could you get through a level without setting off alarm? You know, th the idea of quietly taking out guards without them knowing you were there, you know, it played into the the James Bond sort of fantasy and like just chasing that high of trying to, you know, b be as bond like in a in an in a playthrough Y you know that uh you know, I probably played the single player like almost as much as I played this multiplayer, like half half, just because I was so into that. And I know yesterday we were joking about Every once in a while we'd say, is this level an immersive sim? Just because it had like a hint of freedom to it. But I think back then that that hint of freedom felt enormous and you know immersive sin maybe wasn't a thing, you know, we'd we'd heard of or or like you know, the the rules of that genre weren't as clearly defined back then. But I do think it was s sort of scratching a a similar itch. Um and we just like yeah, absolutely lost ourselves to it. I just I mean there's there's like three or four levels in this that I've must have played, you know, hundreds and hundreds of times. you know, not necessarily to complete them, just to sort of fuck around with them and see what would happen. Like the amount of time I spent just painting scientists red in facilities by shooting their lab coats. Like stuff like that. I mean i it's not like I wouldn't say it's like a super gory game but It almost by not giving you like the full you know, the Turek thing. Once we'd seen like a few Turek takedowns, that game was like instantly boring, like you'd seen everything you could do. But this game here, like y your imagination was always slightly uh engaged by uh the sort of uh restraint of it, I guess. Um and that's definitely That I mean for me anyway, that was that was its stickiness.

Samuel
32:34
Yeah, I mean you're absolutely right. There's I remember the very first time I tried to finish um facility, I think it was when I was at that that guy's house, um and I was playing through his N64 games, but I remember accidentally blowing up Sean Bean with the mines and being like, shit, I didn't even know you could do that. And then telling someone on the playground about that and them telling me, did you know you can kill Orimov in it, but you have to like chase after him and it's really fucking hard to do and all this stuff. And then like um it's the idea that failure could occur, but you could still be playing the game and seeing like the the possibility space beyond that, like um of just like how far can you go before you just it's a bust. And the answer is you can finish the whole level normally unless it's like uh you're you're gated in um by by some some kind of fail state. But that's really interesting as well. And uh yeah you're right it was it's fun to poke at and experiment with.

Matthew
33:27
The f the first time we played The World is not enough. That fa that instantly fails you if you fail any of the objectives. It was so instantly this is bad compared to Goldeneye and you know, uh not being able to 'cause when you fail in Golden Its an invitation for all just to go off and have some fun in that level and see what else you can get up to. That instantly like ducked that game 30 points for not letting me go on a rampage with my taser watch or whatever.

Samuel
33:55
Yeah, I mean I remember I think uh a friend was like, I'm pretty sure I can kill Sean Bean on Cradle by loading him with these grenade launchers and fucking him up when he's up he's up the stairs from you or something and just show me tr trying to do that in front of me and show off and Yeah, I just I don't think any other game really had that sort of like um feeling to it. In fact, I think all the games I liked from this time did have some kind of possibility space element to them. So Uh something like Red Lur as well, where that's basically like uh uh a load of ants in a jar that you shake up and see what happens based on where you've placed Tesla coils or flamethrowers, for example, or dogs. What is if I make a hundred dogs? Exactly. So yeah, I mean it it was it was just perfect for that and the cheats just pushed that even further. Like there was I remember a a a kid just showing me, oh yeah, I was like, what does DK mode mean? Then he he he clicked in and showed me Pierce Brosnan's giant head in the inside the fence in facility and all these memories are quite vivid and that's I think that that's perfect for a kid, that kind of game. It just it's absolutely what captures your imagination and y yeah, you're right. Like it's This the stealth thing, the stealth element of it is quite underrated really, um, as like a part of the actual game mix because yeah, it does mean that There is even though it's like not formalized in a way that like Metal Gear Sodd's stealth is, it's very clear when you've like activated an alarm or whatever Here it's a bit more like you can have dudes spilling into a room without an alarm ever really going off, but it's like known that you are known by the guards. Yeah. Um yeah, it's it is just another way in which the game can vary depending on how you play it. So uh yeah, that's definitely a a key part of it. Um, Matthew, I wondered if you think or to what extent do you think this game is responsible for our generation's appreciation of the James Bond franchise? Because I do wonder how much people under the age of like thirty care about Bond now. Like it's not something my brother is even vaguely interested in or invested in. There might be a load of people who prove me wrong on this, but I feel like for our generation, Bond is still pretty ingrained. I think it helps that around the time this game came out, Brosnan was considered like a you know, he rescuing the franchise a little bit after, you know, some years in the wilderness following Timothy Dalton and those those films like I know Living Daylights did well and I don't think License Kill did as well. It's considered too dark. But Brosnan was considered a bit of a return to form and then Daniel Craig happens while we're sort of young and consuming media. And so it feels like it feels like it's bit it's built in for us now in a way that I wonder if it actually is for younger people. What what do you think?

Matthew
36:34
I w I was definitely into it, besides like in Goldeneye, I was already into James Bond, you know, like fr relatives recording them off the TV for me on on VCRs and, you know, going to stay without grandma you know, up in Hereford and she'd r have recorded a couple of James Bond films. Like I I as uh some of my earliest memories was I was really interested in like spies and detectives. Like that that was just a a thing I was into like as a eight-year-old or whatever. So Goldeneye's just like another piece of of that puzzle. And again, I I always find it so hard to talk about this time because I had such a sort of small circle of friends and they were all exactly like me and it really colours like my perception of the world in m you know, in my head. Everyone liked the N64 in Goldeneye because two people that I knew did. And no one had a had an extra. And no one had it, because none of them did. And likewise Yeah, James Bond just felt like absolutely enormous, but then if I really scrutinize those memories, it's me and my friend Craig. watching them 'cause that yeah, there'd be one on ITV like every Wednesday and they'd basically do that cycle endlessly. So every couple of years you'd get a like a James Bond season again. And it just meant for whatever, fifteen to twenty weeks of that year we'd be obsessively ranking them and re re ranking them every week, ranking the theme tunes every week. So James Bond was like an enormous part of my life, much bigger back then than it is now. You know, now I still enjoy them and I look forward to them, but you know, I haven't Uh you know, if if it wasn't for the having to re-watch them for the pod, you know, I haven't naturally gone back to them. I've just like locked them away as a part of my childhood. But I d you know. Yeah, I mean I guess there will be some people who this game was their first in you know entry point to that world and it's definitely gonna have a huge impact because it was so good as a game, you know. Certainly better than all the other James Bond games. Like I'd be amazed if anyone played fucking Night Fire and then was like, I'm all in on Bond now.

Samuel
38:46
Uh yeah. That just activated another memory actually, which is I distinctly remember in nineteen ninety eight after I first played it going to Mark's video shop in Alvestoke Gossport and renting Goldeneye the film because I think it was I think it was a PG so I could actually watch it and I was like um because I just wanted to know what the basis of the game was to feel like I could understand this thing that my my friends liked and I did really like it, um, Goldeneye. Um I think it I think I liked it more as a kid than I'd like it now to be honest. But um even though I think it's like a fun film. Um it is like quite daft and dated in some ways, as that that podcast revealed. But you are right, like um Bond hasn't really persisted as part of my sort of like lifestyle or interests or anything. Like um I was in a I was in foils in London last week and I saw Casino Royale on a table and I thought Couldn't imagine reading a James Bond book like now at the age of thirty-seven. Because yeah, I don't know, like I I do I am like there's like a latent interest. Um, but and but you kind of like accept I think I just sort of I feel like I've I'm past my peak with it a little bit. And I'm curious about 007 first light I think like 55% for the IO interactive part of it and 45% for the bond part of it. Yeah. You know? Because I really because Hitman is one of my modern preoccupations, you know? Um and Bond was one. So as a a combination it's potent, but I don't I think um I actually think then the Daniel Craig Bonds, while I really like them, I think they're they are a bit of a break in the series.

Matthew
40:23
Like tonally they were They were so different. In Pierce Brosnan there's a a way more kind of shared kind of connective tissue with what was going on with sort of Sean Connery and particularly Roger Moore. You know, it was very silly, over-the-top, gadget driven, and then Daniel Craig came along. Like I don't I think if you fell in love with James Bond through the Daniel Craig films, and then you went back to the Roger Moore films You'd be like, what the fuck is this? How are these the same thing? And maybe that just breaks the that breaks the spell a bit, you know, the the spell that we were under watching them every week, you know, because James Bond was bundled as Here are fifteen films that you watch as a collective and that's just how you understood them. But I don't think That r that relationship is still quite there. Um maybe people will quibble with that, but I think that I think that hop that will hold up to some scrutiny.

Samuel
41:19
I think so. I think that something happens to Bond where it becomes I think maybe from uh sort of Casino Royale onwards, Bond becomes this like Avengers level franchise. Um, where every film is fucking massive. Every product placement in the universe is like hinged up hinged aro upon it. And then the box office grocers start climbing and climbing and climbing. Like It was a popular franchise during Brosnan's day, more popular than it had been previously. But under Daniel Craig, like Skyform made like over a billion dollars. It was unbelievably huge. And so It almost became this thing they couldn't fuck up on a in a on a kind of cosmic level in a way that they used to with the films where like there'd be one amazing one and three shite ones in a row. But it was fine because it was James Bond. It was almost like carry on. Like there's justn't of them so it's fine. Don't worry about it. They'll they'll keep making them. Um or Smurfs films or something. But now it is in that kind of like IP stratosphere. You know what I mean? It's not Just this weird British thing that like Hollywood is kind of invested in it. It's like it's the one of the biggest it's like a crown jewel franchise. Um it's own owned by the biggest retailer on the planet.

Matthew
42:30
That's what's interesting about First Light, because what they've shown of it, I mean, to my mind, feels like a little bit of hybrid of like Daniel Craig, but also a bit of old you know, it seems like it's going for some of the sort of fun silliness of older Bond, you know, when they're being like lowered down into a crocodile pit or something. Um that doesn't feel very uh Daniel Craig coded to me. So I yeah, I'm super curious where they place that in the you know the wider bond. Not timeline as in the chronology of of, you know, when it's set, but in terms of like the tonal timeline.

Samuel
43:08
Yeah, it's it it's why like something that like Goldeneye the game just feels like it couldn't It would nothing like the obviously licensed games have changed so much, but it's such a odd, singular thing, this game, in terms of it's uh based on a film, but it you know, it it has been uh sort of embellished way beyond the film in a way that few licensed games have in terms of there are flashes forwards um so flashes back to you know when Bond was doing this mission at this time in this location, locations he never goes to in the film, uh films where i locations in the film that where other characters are. That's the confusing thing about the surface levels, for example. So that kind of thing. And yeah, just the adding in those additional bond elements on top. It just feels like it's from an era where it was a little bit less managed than it is now. Um And uh to your point about tone as well, like it's uh with Craig, the problem with him was if he didn't have a good Like a good story to kinda pull you through the entire thing didn't work because you didn't have any of those other fun elements to prop it up. Like Back in the day, I think Albert Broccoli was like, uh, this uh this running a bit out of steam here, let's just put another ski chase in, get Roger on his skis and going down the mountain. And in the Daniel Craig ones, like it doesn't have that. It's just dreary and boring. Watching Quantum of Solace or No Time to Die. You get that one little bit in No Time to Die with um Anna de Armas. But otherwise, it's a fucking dreary Dreary film to watch that. So um yeah, I don't know. I like the um I I like that 007 First Lights bringing some of that back. Hopefully that means that the next bond is a little bit less of a Craig clone and more in the realms of A classic bond, a bit of fun, a crocodile pit hill or there. Can't go miss, can it, Matthew? Um okay, so let's go into um revisiting the game, Matthew. Can you remember when you last played Goldeneye in any read real detail before this?

Matthew
45:02
I tried it a little bit when it first came out on the Switch, just 'cause I wanted to see what it looked like, but the Switch controls or trying to get it to work on a you know, the Joy Cons if you don't have the N64 pad, which I don't. It's just it's so heinous and you know basically unplayable I found. So that was a really sour experience. Otherwise I like I We and we pretty much abandoned this game when Perfect Dark came out and I didn't ever go back to it. Like it was it was just a real clean break Um, you know, Perfect Dark was just sort of everything and law really. So I mean it would be yeah since playing through some of these levels twenty years probably.

Samuel
45:46
That's really interesting, because I I went when I went back and listened to our Perfect Dark episode, this was something we discussed and You know, y you mentioned that your little group of friends who your your barometer by which you measured what people in games were doing more generally, which is, you know, w basically what I'm doing as well. Like in my school A very tiny handful of the Dweebius kids had Perfect Dark. Um, like two no one set s set of friends, but like two people in the game in that subset of friends. Whereas I feel like Goldeneye did have a longer tale beyond Perfect Dark for those people who are still playing the N64 up until when like the PS2 came along, for example. Um but yeah, Perfect Dark didn't quite happen um to my friendship group in the same way. So yeah, this um This did kind of stick around. I there was a weirdly a time in 2007 when my dad um brought home an N64 that someone had given away in his fire station where he worked. And the he just came home with The N64, Goldeneye, and Ocarina of Time and nothing else, basically. Um quite strange. Um, but that was fun because that was a chance to like jump in and Uh when I had a friend over, I was like, oh, let's give this a go. And we were playing it on a h on a HD TV and it was look looked like ass. And then we put it on a giant CRT TV and it still looked like ass. And I was like, oh Maybe this is just old now and that's the way it is. Um and then yeah, like two years ago when they brought it back on um rare replay, that version is uh I recommend that way more than the Switch one for the simple reasons that the controls aren't completely insane. Like the they're so crazy on Switch, you'll be like, who the fuck programmed this? Like this is what are you what were you doing? Um and so yeah I played through the entire campaign on um secret agent minus um uh cradle and control. I got to control and I was like, nah. I saw those turrets shredding up the tire. And I was like, nah, I'm good. Thanks, dog. Um and I haven't been back since then. But that was two years ago. That was like January 23 that came out. So um not too long ago, Matthew. Which parts of Goldeneye hold up well to you?

Matthew
47:46
The guns have real personality and shooting people with different guns. Like you can really feel it. Even though it's not a particularly graphic game and you know there's there's not like loads of violence, th the sensation of a s silence PP7 hitting someone and smashing them with the DD4 dust IV is you know, the radically different things. But even even just that little bit playing through yesterday and trying out the diff different guns in multiplayer, you were like you'd occasionally get something where you're like, oh this is just such a a beautiful weapon to have. Um the RCP ninety just like rasping out bullets. It's just so vicious and uh Which is pretty amazing given that the team had no previous experience, you know, working in first person shooters. Um, you know w w you know, we're maybe thinking along the lines of light gun shooters like you said earlier, which have quite a weird relationship with how guns feel because There's no like gun in the game, it's obviously in your hands and then it's just reaction on screen. So for them to get all that right, uh that feels like uh you know, a bit of witchcraft or maybe just very, very lucky.

Samuel
49:01
Yeah, for sure. I love that about the game, like the the fucking like gangster movie uh sounds all the guns make I absolutely love. In general the sound design I think holds up super, super well. Um but the music is obviously I mean it's it's full of like bangers, but in a very specific kind of nineties Almost like club chill out style register. Like it's it's it's of a piece with the Metal Gear Solid 1 soundtrack where It sounds like something you could only have composed in the late nineties, but holds up so well. And that combined with all those sound effects going off is just like, oh, it's so good. That that really hides the graphical shortcomings of the game a little bit, I think, because. your senses are being overloaded by by tunes, basically. So I think that really helps.

Matthew
49:44
That said, I did wonder, do you think the the look of this game and it being a late nineties, or I mean this is a a broader thing, do you think the late nineties are Weirdly a little bit more timeless than like the early noughties. Yeah, so I think there is something to this because

Samuel
50:01
I think once you advance beyond the like Doom original system shock era visuals where it's so tile-based that it it gives you a headache to look at the game for more than about ten minutes going back to it. There is something about Half-Life this Deus Ex where there is that tile-based repetition to it, but there's enough else going on visually. that it's sort of like it's like beautiful in this quite clean way, is that what you mean?

Matthew
50:27
Yeah, I think so. I just think there's like a and just to spin it out into wider pop culture, it's like If you watch if you watch Goldeneye or Tomorrow Never Dies, they feel very different to Die Another Day. They just look like very well-made 90s action films. And there's nothing kind of like there's no millennium like cringe in it. Where like, for example, if you watch, if you go back and watch, uh, what was the BBC? Spooks. that thing feels dated as hell 'cause it was trying to be like ultra cutting edge in the early noughties and capture like the look, the feel, like the mood of the era. Where I actually think there's something a bit more kind of relaxed about the late nineties, before there's too much sort of invasive tech that you know a lot I think a lot of media from from yeah ninety five to two thousand can just feel kinda clean and nice and not embarrassing.

Samuel
51:24
Yeah, I do know what you mean. Like it's yeah. I I think it's also just the fact that Uh maybe this just shows the amount of time they had to make this game where, you know, the there's nothing beautiful about Nightfire. Uh bits of Nightfire that look alright, but like Agent Underfire, for example, the first EA PS2 Bond game. There's nothing visually beautiful about that in screenshot form or to watch it watch it back but there is definitely beauty in gold in goldeneye in some ways I think that The interesting thing I noticed playing all the levels in quick succession yesterday was that some levels do just look way better than others in terms of, you know, like have an exterior location or something else going on visually. Um and then there are some that are just like uh I'm just looking at like white walls basically and like it's that same fucking computer monitor from two levels ago and you know that sort of thing. Oh they got a big screen of the world map on on their on the wall and all that sort of thing.

Matthew
52:21
Like uh sort of silo really feels like cobbled together from a load of other levels, I think. Definitely, yes. Well, because it isn't a location that's in the film. It's just conjured out of like all the other bits of Goldeneye.

Samuel
52:34
Yeah. But it's funny because I I can't really in my head d distinguish the difference between something that's just made with love from this time period and then you know like what I remember of games of a similar art style in the the PS2 days. I can't say I really thought that something like No, I do know what I actually I would actually struggle to really make the comparison here. But like if I think about something like Hitman 2 Silent Assassin, for example. Like that that's got a like three or four levels in it that are absolutely beautiful and that's a PS2 game. But like I think what you're sensing here is the love put into this game versus, you know, so many of the unloved games that follow it and that also operate in the license space and Including EA's own shit games that made loads of money because this game was good. That's another way in which those devs were owned money actually, as they should have been given royalties. from Tomorrow Never Dies and the World Is Not Enough because they only sold copies because this game was good. In I say fucking give David Doak his bag. Because uh that guy did the work so those some EA execs can make a load of money off of it. Like that's that sucks. That's absolutely brilliant. I love the idea of like ripple rewards. Reparations Reparations. That's that's what I'm thinking of basically. Give Noak his repar reparations. Um is there anything else you think is aged well about this game, Matthew?

Matthew
53:50
The very distinct look of the guards and their behaviour is it's just very, very satisfying. Like they're weird as hell and I I think there is still a little bit of light gun energy, like you said earlier in them, the way they jump about and like roll out from behind corners. They're very sort of flamboyant and There's bits of this game where it really does resemble a target gallery more than a functioning space, just the way that everyone's jumping about and rolling around and all this stuff, but uh very, very charming. You know, shooting the guards. The way they slowly die really sells you on the damage you've done to them. Um it's a trick that I hadn't really seen repeated. uh until Indiana Jones uh last year, the year before, where, you know, it understood that to punch someone in the face and there'd be a five seconds of oh, are they going down? Are they oh yeah, they're going down. Um that it's just such a treat to see. I love that stuff. Um and the fact that they've got these like terrible digitized versions of like Just you know, as we kept saying yesterday, clearly very British faces. Very lots of regional British faces in this game. But cool like Russian guard or whatever. Yeah, that's a dinner lady there. Just some big toothy grins and ginger-haired guys and

Samuel
55:15
Yeah, twicross ass looking people basically. Um and yeah, I think you there was like a one character model of a woman. You were like, does she work in HR or something? That was so funny, that made me laugh. Um Ella I I love the girl stuff in this. I think to really appreciate it, you have to remember that Doom came out in 1993, this came out in 1997. And so the idea of guard behaviour that's in in response to what you do as a player that's this distinctive was actually like a ma an amazing bit of theatricality, you know, just think how how much of the visual identity of this game is just guards leaping around doing like roly-polies and rolling to the sides and doing these ridiculous poses. Like it's It just means that the screen is filled with all this like extraordinary movement when you're gunning dudes down. And that uh meanwhile the N64 is brought to its knees, trying to like put it all on the screen at once, and It's such a like for the for the time and how new the genre was, and obviously the genre was you know new to console at this time. Um I think that holds up really well, and I'm I'm pleased that when they did Perfect Dark, they didn't mess with that. They still have the thing where like If a dude has begun a roly poly, he must complete it, even if he dies along the way while he's doing it. If he dies in those animation frames, he still has to finish the roly-poly and then go down. Like I love that about the thing.

Matthew
56:35
momentum carrying a corpse to that roly poly. Showmanship. Or is it a man who knows he's died going, no, I've committed, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna perform this roly-poly. I mean it it's not if it kills me, it has killed me. Uh but this is what I'm gonna do. I think that's one of the worst deaths in video games is dying mid-rolli-poly when someone's just peppered the side of your body with an AK forty seven and just traced your roly-poly with bullet fire. like heinous way to go.

Samuel
57:08
But I I love it because it it does kind of like um, you know, disguise the fact that the game can't dynamically responds to how you play, it has to do pre-canned animations. Like having just played loads of GTA 4 back to back with this, a game where the physics slider is turned up to 150% on every kill and this dude's like flopping over and stuff. It's nice to go back to something like this because it's not You know, just because it's based on physics, it doesn't mean it's more entertaining, I don't think. So um it can be, but not always. So uh yeah, I love that about this game. Um I was also going to call out the specific Goldeneye elements of the game, Matthew, so just the idea of seeing like Sean Bean or Robbie Coltrane um with his with his li with his tiny head and his tiny like a tiny body in this. Um just those kind of bits of like this is where we put in the bond connective tissue and like it's made with real love. And as time goes by, the fact that like It's almost thirty years hence since the game came out, more than thirty years since the film came out. I adore that this era of those actors was captured in this specific form. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

Matthew
58:16
Yeah. I think the Sean Bean, it really captures the essence of the man, because he has like quite a m a mean pinched face and it actually suits the fact that he looks like he's made out of origami Coltrain I don't think comes up quite as well. Um like it's a big laugh moment when you go into the uh shipping container that they keep him in and you turn the corner in there he is and he just looks so awful.

Samuel
58:44
He's like four foot tall, tiny head Just a m and like massive cuboid body. Just like I I have to believe that his agent didn't sign that off. Yeah, it's true. I mean, yeah, PS1 Hagrid, it's re he's really a Hall of Famer with that.

Matthew
59:04
I'm surprised that N64 Robbie Coltrane hasn't got the same kind of legs. I don't see it brought out as often as PS1 Hagrid.

Samuel
59:13
No, I d no, he's not quite got got it. But I think um what you start to re I only realised yesterday playing it with you was that There are like different characters do have different height in this game. So Natalia is quite tall. Quite a beefy, quite a beefy woman. She is massive. She's got a bit of like sort of Janeway energy. She's just quite the character model's quite quite large. But then yeah, like Robbie Coltrane is noticeably like about a foot and a half shorter than all the other characters. And it's like, well what choice did they make there? That's confusing. It's not like You watch the film and Felentin is tiny next to Pierce Brosnan or whatever, but that's strange. Um but I do love that about it because yes, it is a go it is a golden eyed tie-in. And on um the the bits of the game where it does tie into Goldeneye, I think it does do a great job, um, which is one way in which you measure whether a tie-in's good or not. Do you have anything else for what's held up well, Matthew? No, I think it'll probably come out when we talk about some of the individual elements. Yeah, I think so too, because I've definitely got more to say on this front. Which parts of the game hold up less well, Matthew?

Matthew
01:00:14
The classic Sin that everyone remembers from this, even if they haven't touched it in 20 years, is I would say an over-reliance on escort missions and escorting characters in this game is horrible, like it's just very very vague about whether they're still following you, can they be attacked? If they get attacked and they get scared and they run off, like what you're meant to do about it. Those are probably the levels we play replayed the least back in the day, just because you know that you can't have a certain amount of fun because there's this other sort of incompetent person. uh often the talia, though there's a couple of others like Boris you have to lead into a room in the first control level. In the context of what we were doing yesterday, not as much, but When you're trying to do like the cheats and when you're trying to speedrun every level and you're at the whim of whether this like mad NPC behaves, that was soul destroying back in the day.

Samuel
01:01:09
Yeah, that is rubbish. Um I think In general, there's a a big disparity between them the like what I consider the marquee brilliant missions in this. And then the missions that feel a bit more like filler or in between bit. So missions that I'd even forgotten in a couple of cases. And there it does feel like there's maybe four or five missions that are that ha stand head and shoulders above the others. So when you go back to it now it really Yeah. The disparity between what you remember and the bits you dil your brain deliberately shut out. It's like there's a reason that that that that occurred. Um so I yeah, I definitely agree escorts are part of that bullshit. Um Like bullshit sequences where in terms of turret placement or just how d difficult a certain like wave uh wave-based run of enemies are, that kind of thing, like those those are the factors that can really work against it.

Matthew
01:02:03
But then it's also kind of essential in that so much of Bond is James Bond escorting people and being partnered with people. So I can understand why they felt like you can't just get rid of Natalia. That wouldn't make any sense. So they have to they have to like address that. It's just um you know games are so much better at that now or or or not so much better, there are so many better like Sort of cheats and workarounds to sort of say frustration.

Samuel
01:02:31
Like invisible Ellie in Last of Us or whatever.

Matthew
01:02:34
Yeah, exactly.

Samuel
01:02:35
uh or like um characters teleporting into your cab when you're going to uh play darts in GTA four Matthew, which uh I noticed playing it again. Um yeah, so I think it's the main thing for me that age has aged less well is just the the the way in which you interact with it as a first person shooter compared to where the genre would go just like a a few years later. Like it's the reliance on auto aim, for example. Or like how hard it is to aim more precisely when you you tap what would have been the R button on a sixty four controller. Like it's that when you do that is so sensitive. And when you're sort of pointing um sort of Bond around, he's basically like this kind of auto-firing sort of like beast, you just gotta point in the right direction at the right time, basically, because it was built for a game it was built for an era before strafing was real. a thing on console, so the enemies behaviour such really. And so when I was playing it with you, I was strafing all over the shop in single player, basically n almost never getting hit. Um because it's just you know you can just run circles around these guys. So just that very specific how did they solve it at the time for the limitations of the console. That's like that's like a thing that inevitably is aged badly.

Matthew
01:03:46
So um yeah. How do you feel about old fashioned health goes down and then you die? You know, bulletproof armor can improve your health, because th that's the big change that Halo of it feels ushers in. in terms of like how how all first person shooters are gonna behave after that point.

Samuel
01:04:03
I love that about this game and I do sort of miss that. Like I I do think that maybe I had my feel of picking up like when you're playing PC FPS games and you'd pick up those like five health. but tokens or whatever on the ground and like um they would be smaller than the 25 or 20 health tokens you picked up uh and like I feel like I've picked up my last five health token now. Like I w I want to believe that about myself. Um but I think that it's it's pretty elegant here and also adds to the sense of like of of danger or like risk in playing it or of like if you fuck up too many times, that's it. And it's not a game that's very kind to uh to failure like um as you mentioned fail one objective start the level again basically but they're not super long levels and uh yeah I don't know I I think that adds the right amount of tension what do you think

Matthew
01:04:56
Obviously we were playing on a very easy mode yesterday so it didn't really come into it too often. I I think it's fine, 'cause like you say it's like It it punishes accumulated mistakes, you know, across a level and it's sort of as you're going through you do have a read on like Oh this level's gone pretty smoothly so far, you know. I've very quietly taken out these guys in this corridor and last time this room was the first time they got shot. This time I'm through that room and it it it kind of works from that that perspective. And I I I've got time for both setups to be honest. I wasn't fishing for a particular answer You know, it just I I guess also 'cause we're playing GTA four at the moment, which has the same thing, you know, the there comes a point where your health is so low in some of those levels where you think Well, this is just fucked. Like there's there's no way I'm not dying on this because I just can't get it up and then you suddenly find like a first aid kit and then there's there's huge relief and you're like, well maybe I've got a chance again but Uh it's it's just a different mindset and y we're so rarely asked to be in that mindset these days that I th it's In not a criticism, but definitely a thing that takes my brain a long time to kind of click back into.

Samuel
01:06:09
Yeah, I totally get that. I think it's actually a fundamental part of the magic of this multiplayer as well, because when we were playing it yesterday If you just about survive a firefight and live on till, you know, the the person you killed comes back to get the revenge, but you've got some armor in the meantime, then If you manage to kill that person again, there is an intense feeling of shame that for that other person that is lick that that is linked specifically to the way that this health system works. So The idea you can't retrieve health and it's gone forever, but you can retrieve body armours. I really like that. It just means that there are even more variables and multiplayer. That's so much more interesting than You go crouch in a corner too, a health comes back and then you're on even ground. Like I it's much more interesting for this specific multiplayer setup. So I really like it. I definitely wouldn't iron that out as a crease. And I wouldn't I wouldn't mind if more games did this kind of thing again. It's um it's fine by me. I like innovative health systems, as long as they're not too onerous to manage, that's the key thing. Like um I wouldn't ever want to play another game that's got Metal Gear Solid 3 survival systems in it. You know what I mean? Because It's a bit too much menu management for my modern sensibilities of playing games, you know, to go pluck out all the different bits of venom and bullets and stuff like that. It was cool in one game, but that's fine. But um yeah. So um What about what anything else that ages l has aged less well for you, Matthew?

Matthew
01:07:30
The fact that they repeat surface and bunker. Yeah. That's that's that's a strange call because that I wouldn't say that for either is And they're fine, but they you certainly don't need to go back twice. What I really don't understand is that they repeat them when narratively Bond never goes there in the film. So the only place he doesn't go he goes to twice uh in this. That's that's a little bit odd. I don't really know what they were thinking there. Um though Surface does have some like strange vibes, which make it worthwhile I think.

Samuel
01:08:02
The second surface with the red sky. Yeah. Um is so is super like super spooky. I feel like is is borderline a horror game, especially with the And these are Matthews was the white gimps um chasing you in the snow. That's very much what the guards look like in that level. Um Yeah, I think um something I didn't realise until yesterday when we were playing this is that this game has bad writing in it. Like when you encounter characters, there's not much text in it, but when you do encounter characters, like it's quite badly written, the bits of dialogue, and I don't think I ever really noticed. that until we were playing statue yesterday and that's probably the most dialogue heavy game free narrative interactions in that level I feel like whoever the narrative guy was, and I think it was David Doak, I feel like that level is him being like This is my masterpiece because it's got so much specific geometry that you don't see in other levels. And so much story in it that it feels like someone being like This is this is it. I've cracked video game storytelling in a in an FPS level and it's so like a such a drag compared to some of the other levels.

Matthew
01:09:12
Trying to unlock the cheat in statue when you know you've got all these interactions like the idea of looking at someone being like, hurry the fuck up, I've hurry the fuck up. I've got like two minutes to do this whole level. I haven't got time for Sean Bean to very slowly walk up a hill and kind of save you know A couple of lines which feel poorly paraphrased from the film. Um I will say, actually, uh like one of my criticisms of Goldeneye the film is I do find the plot quite confusing. Like it's it's quite hard to understand like what anyone's actually trying to do and w where all the the Russian bunker and all that scene fits into things. Like I I never really understood it, so N maybe the game's just like honouring that this is just a confusing ass James Bond film.

Samuel
01:09:56
Yeah, there's I mean there are some really conf a lot a lot the plots in James Bond films. That was like a major thing I discovered when we did that podcast was Like the Living Daylights plot. I mean, I had to I read like um uh uh three explainers on that plot, and it's completely insane. Like it makes no sense whatsoever. So Yeah, you're right. I mean you have the like fundamentally what they want to do is have a space laser and then have Sean Bean be both like his pal and then later be the villain. That's basically what the plot is trying to achieve, isn't it?

Matthew
01:10:26
But he's trying to rob he's trying to rob the Bank of England. That's his plan.

Samuel
01:10:30
Right, because he's a Leanne's Cossack, Matthew, as Pierce Brosden bellows in Goldeneye. Like it's But yeah, I can't really remember why he's doing that. Is that why he's pointing the laser at them to give it to him? Like him and g Goldfinger both.

Matthew
01:10:43
Just incredibly complicated plans. Uh but that basically come down to let's fuck up a bank. Um and you're like, well why didn't you just say that to begin with, you know?

Samuel
01:10:55
It's very old school. Um in a way, Tomorrow D Never Dies is much more perceptive where it's like, let's have a guy control the media instead. and um and and be a bit racist at the end. That was the thing that also happened in that film. Um yeah, so um that was much more uh sort of ahead of the the curve really. Okay, so Matthew, I did wanna talk about the fact we played on Agent. Do you think we gave the game a fair enough shake? Because I think we did. I think it even though we had a very cursory glance at the levels. I don't think the objective-based design of the levels I mean like it does reveal some depth to the to the design of the maps, but Not always. Sometimes it is just a um a McGuffin chase and an unnecessary amount of busy work. Um what what did you think? Was Agent is still a good way to experience the game?

Matthew
01:11:41
I think so. I think, you know, the harder difficulties, they just make you play it a bit more carefully and fuck up a b a bit more often. Uh so the idea of like You know, we kept saying a lot of these levels, what's strong about them is the is just the vibes of being in the place. So just going through them and experiencing them and you know even on Agent you get the core shape of the the film. If anything, the the secret objectives are where they begin to add all this kind of weird stuff that you don't really understand why you're doing any of it. Which is why a lot of those objectives you know, while I appreciate the layering of the difficulty modes as like a big replayability p factor. The actual nature of some of those objectives are pretty shit because They're not things that happen in the film, so it's quite hard to kind of picture them in your mind's eye what you're meant to be doing. Like when they go, yeah, you know, oh you know what the bottling plant is, because you've seen it in the film, but when they're like you know, you gotta play C four on these four tanks in silo, a location we didn't go to in the film. Um that's like well I don't even know what I'm looking for. You know, th or take a picture of this satellite And then there's so many space adjacent things in that level, like sp uh a rocket and a big satellite and a like a uh sh a pod sort of shuttle nodule from the top of a spaceship That you're like, what the fuck am I with me taking a picture for? We kept debating all through the level whether we were taking a picture of the right satellite. Yeah, I just don't think that happens when it's go and meet Robbie Coltrane in a box and you're like, Yes, I know what that is, you know? That

Samuel
01:13:20
Yeah, I mean it's it's also the fact that they leave all the accoutrement from the other difficulties in the level, even if you're playing on agent. So you're picking up all this random bullshit, that's something that game would never do now. It's like ha have like the things for the hard event difficulty just around for you to pick up and do more.

Matthew
01:13:36
Why have I got a clipboard?

Samuel
01:13:41
And so you're picking up these endless items that you have no idea what they're for unless you you're willing to go on a higher difficulty. So I do appreciate them giving depth and replayability to it. I I definitely did at the time because it was interesting genuinely like as a kid to play Dam on Agent and blast through it and then be like play on Secret Agent then be like oh shit there's so much more to this than I than I actually realized. Um and that is a cool a cool moment.

Matthew
01:14:06
I I'd say that's one of the better levels for it too, as a showcase for it that it is the first level is quite telling.

Samuel
01:14:12
Yeah, for for sure. And so and some yeah, some levels are just not as interesting with how they present that. They just make it go on for longer, but don't really aren't any more sort of like stimulating to really experience. Um Definitely when you're revisiting the game, I think Agent is the way to go just to kind of blast through it, get a taste of it and be like, yep, that was Goldeneye, and it was it was good at the time and that's okay. Get your rare achievements on Xbox, because they're still all rare for some reason. Um, okay, so uh Matthew, I did want to ask on that subject, what are your two or three favourite levels in this? To me, it's really self-evident what the best levels are, and I wondered if you felt that after playing it through again on Agent and seeing them all back to back

Matthew
01:14:51
Well we didn't actually play Dam yesterday I realised. Yeah. Because when you came round I was already on facility. Well I I would say Dam is one of my favourite levels. Maybe because I'll forever associate it with that that wow moment of back in the day of just being like, Oh, I g I can't even imagine there being a game like this. But also, you know, even after the fact and going back to it now, I like that it's quite a snipery level. It's probably the first video game I did sniping in. And the sniping is all right. You know, there are lots of guards who are minding their own business. You can shoot from, you know, miles away with the sniper rifle. There's not many levels in this game where you can do lots of sniping really, 'cause there's so sort of interior or just so foggy that you can't see shit but I feel like Dam is is very much designed for that. So I really like Dam for that reason. Just s sniper's paradise and I love sniping in games. Um facility, I mean it's a cliche, but just like where I learnt to love the idea of stealth in games and seeing how far I could get through that place without messing up and very quietly getting the perfect angle like you know that poor bastard who's in the toilet cubicle next to the cubicle that you drop down into how many times has he been sniped in that tiny portion of his head that is visible over the top of the partition. Um like that guy must have been killed like a billion times. I'd love to see his stats, but Uh yeah, that the s the silence pistol in the you know in this game is just feels so good and the idea of getting through it and and you know, even now it still gives me like a little bit of a thrill, um, sort of taps into that sort of muscle memory. Um For my third level, even though it's got an Italian escort, which which means it's bad, I I still have a fondness for archives. into Oh I thought you were about to say jungle. No no way. No, I I haven't felt very slam because that that was one of our big fucking around in levels. you know, back when I was a teenager, because that opening interrogation room where you grab the guns and kill the guys, like we deliberately make lots of noise, make a ruckus, and then like infinite guards would try and run into that room. And just seeing like how long you could shoot guards in that doorway and taking their guns and the flavour of the violence changing as different people bought different guns. Like, I I I have a huge fondness for that. Um whenever we used to play Perfect Dark, and I probably talked about this on the Perfect Dark episode we did. Me and my brother used to play the multiplayer map that had a a little elevator in it, just to sit in the elevator and shoot Sims as they tried to open the doors. It's the same thing. There's something about like come and get me and doing a last stand.

Samuel
01:17:54
Yeah, for sure. Um I think those are all good picks. Like I think it's quite a front loaded game in some ways. Like damn And facility are so so good. Those are two of my picks. I think facility is like the perfect even now I think it it has everything you want from a single player first person shooter level. It has this kind of like three-act structure where you're in the bathroom, you you drop down into the cubicle and then you sort of progress. Then you you meet Doke and there's like all those um guards and those corridors in between and then you get to the last set piece where you set the explosives and you blow the place and Sean Bean dies and then you pick one of two ways to go out the level. Like it's a per it's like a perfect single player first person shooter level. I wouldn't change anything about it. It's Uh yeah, I think it's just such a good template that the rest of the game doesn't actually follow uh quite as elegantly. Like I I do wish every level was as good as Facility, but then Facility is also singular because of the way in which I think it it evokes it and Dam evoke the film in a way that no other level really does evoke their respective locations in the in the film. Like they're so they're so close to what what it is to look at, you know? Like you get the tiniest bit of damn in the film, really, until you see him jump off of it. Um but it's like unmistakably the same place from the film that you're exploring. Um and facility is like the epitome of that. So I love that. I'm a big train guy though, Matthew. You watched me fuck up train three times yesterday. Um I shot well, first I I paused and let Oromov kill Natalia and when I got to that last train cut Then I got there and overzealously shot Natalia myself after shooting Orimov, so that was my fault. And then I finally did it the third time. Which you didn't know you could do, right, to get the trapdoor off.

Matthew
01:19:46
You didn't know you could shoot I thought you had to use the laser, but No, I remember back in the day that a mate showed me, watch me get all this tape off for the RCP ninety and fuck it up.

Samuel
01:19:56
Um Probably I guess he he would have activated the cheeks to do that. But um yeah, so he d he did that and then um I was like, oh cool. So I always kinda banked that information in my head in case I ever needed it. But yeah, it does give you another way out Um but I love train because it's like a such a quintessential James Bond location, a moving train. You know, it's it's a key it's a key part of like from Russia W uh with love and um Uh Spectre has a a bit of a throwback to it as well and I'm sure there are other films I'm forgetting, but uh It's got a lot of weird textures that don't appear anywhere else in the game. Yeah, it does. And those like break unit things are quite visually distinctive and Like colour wise it shows you a lot of, yeah, like you say, different textures you don't see elsewhere. And also try to work out what the fuck the dimensions of the train are. Where like sometimes it's like a fucking living room in length and then other times it's like a meter wide and you're like what is this train actually?

Matthew
01:20:48
Like what because when you first board it you're like that is a pretty small train but then when you're on it there are carriages which just have one massive dining room table in them. And you're like, how did this how did they get this dining room table in here? This carriage doesn't have doors, you know?

Samuel
01:21:03
Um so I yeah, and I I those would be my suggestions, Matthew, facility damage train. I'd maybe throw in like runway because there are some levels on this that are just like connective tissue to other levels. They're just like, ah yeah, we got to get you from A to B now, even though it's not really a a location here. But Runway is just like a fun sprint and escape and it's it's definitely got its place as a a type of set piece you don't really see elsewhere. So um yes. Um what about your least favourite levels, Matthew? What do you hate now?

Matthew
01:21:31
Depot Which links streets and train. Like you say, it's just total filler. But there's just nothing to I don't know why they decide to show you that space because it's just warehouses full of the same crepe uh designs like it isn't too much for maze like it's a pretty linear route through it and then you get on the train I just don't you know there's a reason they don't show like a great long depot sequence in the film. It's 'cause it's just not it's not a good place to be. I actually think streets is ass. Yeah, I agree with that. I think Streets is ass.

Samuel
01:22:06
I always thought Streets was a w was ass, you know?

Matthew
01:22:08
Yeah The t I just y you think, oh yeah, I get the tank, but actually it's a pain in the arse. Everyone's shooting you. It feels like it's better to shoot everyone with your gun from the top of the tank. Uh the design of it is super ugly. Like it just doesn't look anything like what it's meant to look like.

Samuel
01:22:23
It's an amazing sequence in the film and That it could not be more anonymous the streets that you go down in this.

Matthew
01:22:31
Yeah, so that's bad. Depot streets. Um I I really hate jungle as well.

Samuel
01:22:38
Jungle, I was saying to you, looks like a Banjo Kazoe level because of the there's like one sort of like green plant model that is just the wrong shade of green. And you would when we were you were watching, you just went, this looks so fucking budgy.

Matthew
01:22:53
I just think that like the the N64 fog It just hid a world of sins and something playing that on 360 where it's so sharp and you can just see like, well there's three trunks here and then there's just the flat wall of jungle texture. It just can't do a jungle, just can't pull it off. And it just y it's so you can just see what the space is too much. I remember years ago going to do LaserQuest for a friend's birthday and something went wrong and they had to stop the game of LaserQuest. Then they turned the lights on. And 'cause that you know, you're running around, it's all dark and there's loads of dry ice. But when you see LaserQuest with the lights on, you realise just how shit it all looks. Like it's just a load of like crappy like plywood but with Lots of padding so no one bangs their heads when they go through a little tunnel, but in the dark it feels like you're in some dystopian future. It feels like you're in the future bits of Terminator. But in real life you're in like just, you know, a warehouse full of wood off cuts. And that's what jungle felt like. It felt on on three c on on Xbox it felt like someone had turned the lights on and you could just see it and go Oh fuck, t turn the lights off. Let's get out of Junglu.

Samuel
01:24:07
I feel like that's the same Subcategory of anecdote as I watched half a Mr. Blobby smoke up. Jungle, I agree. Like I think there was something about the fact that it had the fight with Xenia that made it seem more exciting to me when I was younger. Like, but now just going back to it, it's just horrible. And the last bit of jungle when you got you're fighting all those guards and trying to get in that elevator. If you don't move quickly, it it it's just absolutely horrible that section if you don't like just pick off the enemies quite carefully and get out of there. Like it can really spiral and just really sucks. Um yeah, and um I agree with you.

Matthew
01:24:50
Any bit with a turret, it just means you remember where the turrets are from being killed by them as a child. Yeah. And now you remember and you just know to stop and shoot sort of into the foggy distance until something explodes. That is just not a satisfying interaction. To hand you do that about ten times in this game or like I know if I open this door and then stand back and I shoot up there, there is a turret there. And you're like, that isn't fun. Come on.

Samuel
01:25:15
No, that does suck. And uh yeah, it's It's just a bad mechanic in the game. Then the reason that I find uh because I agree with you on streets, that was one of my least favourites. The the the the thing that sucks about that is it's the only time. They ever do the very James Bond thing of you having you be in a vehicle, you know? And so in your head you're like, I wish you'd nailed this, like you nailed everything else. Like that should be. absolutely thrilling, but they go so overboard with dickheads with rocket launchers firing at you and mines and shit and it's like how did you ruin being in a James Bond being in a tank? How did you get this so wrong? Um compared to how good the rest of this game is for the most part? Um anything else, Matthew, you wanted to mention um for levels you hate?

Matthew
01:25:54
No, just just those three. I'm curious to hear what your least three favourite are.

Samuel
01:25:58
Well, I th I mean I had completely memory holed caverns, which is just walk down this corridor, this brown corridor, fighting dudes. That's like a fucking That should be on the old limital space Twitter account that people retweet. Just sort of like, what is that location? 'Cause in my head it just went straight Uh it just kind of like the game just moved on from there, but no, there's just this like little bit of padding out. And then I forgot there was like a multiplayer map version of it as well, and that whole space is just one boring corridor above water surrounded by brown and that's all it is. So that sucks. With like three different door animations weirdly. Yeah. The the door whoever the door animation guy on the team was He goes mental. There's like a door that sort of does a star wipe. And then there's another one that's like an eye, big eye that opens. It's like proper like overboard on the door right now. And there's a giant blast door shutter as well. Yeah, exactly. So that's out of control. Here's a question. Is control a good level?

Matthew
01:26:59
I would say no, because it hinges on that horrible protect Natalia and it just isn't very fun.

Samuel
01:27:04
No, I think that in another game without the bullshit Natalia element, it does It does make sense as a series of objectives, like um, in terms of like a a room, a massive multi-story room like that, where enemies spill in, where they can appear from behind glass and stuff like that, is I think, objectively, one of the more interesting combat encounters in the game. But because of the Natalia thing, it just sucks. But it is unlike any other bit. Like the closest thing to it, I think, is facility when all the enemies spill in after Orimor. But like um yeah, I don't know, like I just feel like there are bits of control that kind of that that would be good in another first person shooter if that makes sense.

Matthew
01:27:43
Obviously a very different game, but Call of Duty Modern Warfares did several very good desperate last stand missions where it feels like the whole world's coming at you and you just have to hold the line and I think that set piece can work and be r really thrilling and exciting, but You just have to be a little bit more forgiving with it than this one is.

Samuel
01:28:03
Yeah, I do really love the idea of like enemies appearing from behind glasses. We found a new way to use this mechanic you've seen loads of times before. So That is cool, but yeah, just two shit. And also Natalia's dialogue during that, um, where she's like, Can you keep the noise down or whatever? Like it's designed to drive children of the 90s to complete fucking temper tantrums, basically Um I'm sure a lot of hardware got destroyed off the back of that uh that mission. Um okay Matthew, in which case we come to the multiplayer. Um so we played about an hour of this yesterday, we did every map, we played all the different modes. Um how'd you find playing multiplayer Goldeneye again? Oh well difficult.

Matthew
01:28:41
I was really bad at it and I f I feel like Whatever mode we played, there was like an extra mode on top where it's just you and Catherine are racing to who can kill me the most times. And that's how you win that mode. You know, almost like I felt like I was a proto-meetsim from Perfect Dark. That's kind of how it felt for me. I didn't until I think like the last two games remember that uh you weren't meant to let auto aim do all the work and that doing manual aiming and shooting people in the head was the key to like a quick kill. Yeah. I so that was really my problem. I was auto aiming with weaker weapons, often against uh Catherine in a bulletproof vest, 'cause even though Catherine also hasn't played this game in twenty years, she seems to remember where every bulletproof vest in every map is. That's hugely frustrating. I just get the feeling she Uh her brothers uh uh the the people she played it with, the quality of game was higher than my quality of game with my brother and my friends. And s I find this with every multiplayer game. I'm like, I thought I was alright at this, but actually I'm not.

Samuel
01:29:53
I mean, she's like I think Catherine's just like one of those mega brain people who just is good at everything and that's just that's just how it is. And so yeah, I mean I in my head it's like uh just my memory from years ago when we played um Smash Bros Ultimate Your House and Catherine absolutely fucking destroyed us. Like every time I get into a multiplayer game now I'm like Well, this is it, more of the Catherine Annihilation. That's it. I do remember me being like holding my own more in Perfect Dark than I did in Goldeneye.

Matthew
01:30:22
I might think so, yeah.

Samuel
01:30:23
So I maybe like I just got used to those guns more or or whatever, but Definitely I was getting uh w the final stats I think were like is it eight maps in the game and you and I both lost six times uh look Catherine won six times. And then you and I wh one once a piece, and that was it basically. Right. So that tells the whole story, really. And I have a different narrative framing on and Matthew's description of um of me and Catherine basically taking it turns to kill Matthew. Oh, here we go. Get a rash him on this, are we? Yeah, I think so. We'll hear the Catherine side of it on another episode, no doubt. Um but I I started to identify that Matthew was waiting for me and Catherine's fight to almost wrap up and then run in and try and finish one us well one of us off, which led to me calling him a kill thief. And um Matthew resenting that reputation by the end of it. But The absolute highlight of playing this, I mean, I I mean I thought it was like loads of fun to play again. If you treat it as like the silly party game that it is, and don't take it really seriously as like a competitive sort of venture. Goldeneye are still great fun in multiplayer. That's how I feel about it. But you gotta play, I mean, to the listeners, you'll never get to play a multiplayer game with Matthew Castle. And he doesn't allow it to happen very often. But when it happens, it's so funny. Like it's so good. It's like when Matthew ge gets killed, all kinds of things are he he'll scream. Like yesterday he screamed Uh after he died, he just went, Shit Valley, that's where I reside. Shit Valley. He said that, which made that really made me laugh. Um, and then like when I I killed him, he just said, Avenge me wife to Catherine. That was really funny Uh that happened. But the funniest thing is when we were playing the license to kill mode, so one hit kills, um Matthew just started singing the Got a License to Kill when he killed me. It was just absolutely preposterous. So All I really all I really do is go fuck off whenever I don't. That's all I really do. It's not that interesting. But Matthew is as animated and creative. i you know, uh in sort of like everything that he does on this podcast, how he talks about games, but in how in how he a much of a sore loser or big baby he is. Uh is this is this why you don't allow yourself to 'cause it's great fun. You were like this when we played Redfall, you were like this when we played um Halo in multiplayer. Why do you shut yourself off when you are a great hang to play multiplayer games with?

Matthew
01:32:41
I don't uh I don't know. I think because it's just a bit of fun and I'm um I like that is me or my best behavior Yeah, I I worry that my inner monologue can be too sour when I'm playing games. Like I normally just go from like naught to sixty into like instant rage. And I'm thinking like terrible things that I I can't shout out loud while Catherine's in the house. So I think actually what you're hearing is probably me swallowing the real frustration and just trying to sort of put out some sort of garbled nonsense instead. Uh it's self censoring is what it is. But Yeah. Yeah. Well I'm glad you I'm glad you enjoyed it.

Samuel
01:33:22
Oh, I had a great time. It's my highlight of playing it for sure. Because Catherine's as cool as cool as a cucumber. She just doesn't I get het up and you get het up in your own specific way, but Catherine was just like, whatever about the whole thing, really. Um well she comf comfortably won each game. Um the funniest thing was when um we both mined up with proximity mines both sides of facility and you were trapped in the middle. And wherever you would spawn, like you had to hope that you spawned in the middle or basically you just spawned into like a like a field of death. Um because I was by where all those like tankers and those two rooms in that corridor are, and Catherine was like uh had f basically made the toilet her base and then fucking like every staircase and corridor around there was like death basically. So what was that experience like for you, Matthew, living in between those two extremes?

Matthew
01:34:11
Yeah, that was stressful. Like spawning into explosions and then instantly dying just feels like and I know that they made it quickly towards the end, but like, come on guys. Um this is this is meant to be a multiplayer classic. Uh the the one that really got me was We played one game of man with the golden gun, which if you haven't played it, there's one golden gun, which is like instant kill. And once someone's picked up, I think do you have to kill them before another one will spawn or they'll drop it and then you can pick it up off them? But basically whoever had it, the other two then instantly tried to form an allegiance against them. I'm trying to think what the phrase was. Shall we art graders? Yes, you kept saying to Catherine, let's arc raider let's arc raider Matthew. And then you were like, let's arc can we ar surely arc raider your wife, you said. Yeah. Which meant t to form an impromptu team and then murder someone in a stairwell. That did happen. The problem is if I get a golden gun, it's not very powerful because I'd I just freak out about it. It's too much power I I You should just be able to stand back and quietly plug people, but all of a sudden like I was wasting like 18 golden bullets and the man with a golden gun. As described by Lulu in the song, not as cool as as me with the golden gun.

Samuel
01:35:34
Yeah, whereas Catherine just had that mega brain precision and just fucked us up a treat, basically. Well I just wondering I just w there's nothing more to morrow. Yeah, exactly. Executing us. Yeah, me with a club. And it's like fuck. I might as well just there should be a button to commit suicide in this because I mean even that's even if you get a club. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, exactly. But even if you got a club Suicide with it wouldn't be very effective. It still takes four shots to kill yourself, basically. Half an hour of clobbing yourself in there. Because a clob is such a shit gun. Um yeah, so that was um that was funny.

Matthew
01:36:08
I definitely missed the it in Perfect Dark, like the level of customization, the fact that you can create like a put you know the exact layer of weapons you want. You know you can you can fit if you want a weapon which is clubs only you can do it where I don't think you could ever do that in Goldeneye. Um Like the weapon sets, it'll be called like grenade launcher, but what that actually means is there's one grenade launcher in the mix and loads of other shitty guns. That's quite annoying, because you're like, oh yeah, let's do a remote mine level, and it's not really a remote mine level, it it means there's a one box of remote mines. and someone's gonna use the RCP ninety on you.

Samuel
01:36:50
Yeah, that's very true. It's sort of like it's hard for these things to really um really commit unless it's something like throwing knives, um, for example. Um yeah, that was good. That was good. I enjoyed our um grenades game as well where Was that in Caverns that one? I can't remember where we did um grenades, but you think that's the one I won. Yeah, and that was like that was really fun because Was You could see Matthew forming a last stand strategy and just standing where the body armor was and just chucking grenades from up on his little perch, and that was It was funny because I felt like I just I f It's like a shitty metal gearbox. Yeah, basically. I finally saw the cogs turning. Who were you in it? Oh yeah, I was a scientist. Yeah, that's right. And um an often very red scientist, if if I recall correctly as well, from the amount of bullet fire you're taking. Catherine was seen seen you on a top. And you were playing as Mishkin? Mishkin, my guy Mishkin, who um has a completely redundant role in the film Goldeneye and I don't even know how he made it to the game really, but um There he is. Um I wonder actually if like um if Joe Dunbaker had known this game would be as iconic as it was, would he have like allowed himself to be, you know, sort of like canonized by this game? Because I feel like These the guys like Mishkin is preserved forever. Like that that actor will be like long forgotten, but Mishkin as a sort of like entity in his face will live on. And I feel like Joe Don Baker, if he'd known that, would have been more up for it. Do you know what I mean? I feel it feels a little bit like of a bummer that he's not in here, but anyway.

Matthew
01:38:17
Um Especially now that we live in an age where if they made a Bond film and wanted Joe Don Baker, they just have like a CG version of him.

Samuel
01:38:23
Yeah, very incredibly bleak. Um Yeah, it's sort of it got me thinking about Perfect Dark as well, actually, because I think we said this on the Perfect Dark podcast, but that there is like a magic to Goldeneye being a Bond game that Perfect Dark can't quite um replicate but in terms of sheer kind of content and quality uh perfect dark is undeniably a better game um it did also get me thinking about like I really wish you could do the counter-operative mode where the other character plays like a different NPC till all the NPCs are dead, trying to kill the main character. How good that would be in facility. You start facility and one guy's in the toilet cubicle and the other guy's Bond about to headshot him. How good that would be, you know? Um But alas, uh yes.

Matthew
01:39:11
That's the annoying thing Catherine did. It just reminded me in facility when we had proximity mines. She was putting proximity mines in the toilet cubicle under the air vent where you sometimes spawn. So you basically couldn't leave the air vent. Unless you wanted to instantly explode and die.

Samuel
01:39:27
Very irritating. Amazing. That's basically someone who went through like local multiplayer Vietnam with her brothers, like applying every sort of like lesson to us basically. She just become Charlie Sheed at the end of Platoon fucking us up basically.

Matthew
01:39:41
She was trained in that place where they trained all black widows in Marvel.

Samuel
01:39:49
She was trained by uh Ray Winston trained her to be evil at Goldeneye. Oh dear. So I very much enjoyed that. Um and I did did it make you miss local multiplayer in first person shooters as well, Matthew? Because this made me think there's Probably an opportunity for an indie game to put such a mode front and center, and it's still such a singular experience next to online multiplayer FPS games. It's so not the same thing. And it's acknowledged that Couch Multiplayer is definitely a thing, but co-op has become the big thing. We talked about the how big split fiction was and the rise of Couch Co-op, but What happened? Did did we all get a bit too nice for Couch Co op? Or sorry, Couch Competitive? Or like is it just online killed it? There's no need for it. Like what?

Matthew
01:40:31
Yeah, I I'd I would think it's more that just the alternative became so much easier and the idea of getting like four people round I mean think of how rarely it is you've come round to our house despite the fact that we live five minutes away and have lived in the same place for like ten years. Um I just think that's an indicator of just how how things are. You are welcome more often, of course. Um But yeah, this this kind of game, it just made more sense in you know, the late nineties, 'cause there wasn't anything else to do. You know, internet multiplayer was it was certainly for us very expensive. Like being able to go online was was a bit of a rarity at home. We didn't have money for new games, so like one thing that you could play infinitely, that just made perfect sense. Like I f I feel like the idea of I don't know, I just think people would move on a bit quicker. And the couch co-op campaign uh almost feeds into that now. Like it's it's a it's a nice shared experience, but it's also sort of nice and finite. It's like as long as the campaign is like ten hours and then there's no more commitment. The idea of this doesn't make as much sense. That's it. I think there have been a couple of Every once in a while s there'll be an indie game that tries to tap into this. I can remember there was one on uh Xbox indie game. I think when I was on OXM there was a thing called Sc screen cheat. I think everyone was like in it it was like a riff on Goldeney, but like everyone was invisible And you had to work out who everyone w where everyone was from what they were looking at on their screen. Alright, yeah. It was like exclusively a f a local four-player multiplayer game, but It but that was like a b it was too meta, you know, it was it was based on that experience that we'd all had and I don't think enough enough like young people have necessarily had that experience to then want like a meta commentary on it. Um So yeah, that didn't amount to much. And I'd be curious if they ever do get round to making another time splitters. It feels like if there is any game that is going to have that kind of mode and maybe make that work, it would be that, but

Samuel
01:42:36
that also just seems like, you know, endlessly doomed, so Yeah, and like, um I don't think uh Halo Infinite had anything like this in it. Um I guess there's like a oh no, because it's just they're just doing the campaign with the new Halo, aren't they? They're not doing the multiplayer. Oh shit. Yeah so It really does feel lost. Like the last time I really recall that, apart from Time Spitters, was playing Halo in multiplayer on split screen. You could even do split screen online with Halo 3 on Xbox 360. That was really impressive at the time. But and so that had a little bit of that feel. But otherwise it does feel really lost. But it does just feel like if something like split fiction can happen, surely like something Like this could happen too, but what form it takes is quite hard to figure out. Like, you know, if you I feel like if you approximate the look of Goldeneye in an indie game, it'll come across as a bit hack and ugly. And I feel like I've seen a couple of indie games try and tap into this, but not really get much attention. And so I don't really know what the answer is other than to think that it is with the right game design of it not being maybe too kind of like nineties uh sort of unvarnished cruelty in the way that Goldeneye can be sometimes that maybe they'll that maybe they can find the right mix of it. But um yeah. Um Okay Matthew, just a couple more questions while we wrap up. How did you find play on Xbox? Do you wish that the HD remaster that was being worked on in the naughty s had had made it out onto XBLA at the time? Because I think it would have been really interesting to have Goldeneye come back about ten years later, um after its original release, and be in people's hands on XBLA just as Halo and got and COD were taking off. Like you could have had online Goldeneye happening while those games existed. Like do you do you kind of wish that we'd seen that?

Matthew
01:44:20
In terms of where I was at, you know, working in the future, it would have been fun, I'm sure, to have played Goldeneye with the writers who covered Goldeneye on these mags, you know, growing up and loads of people who read those mags, you know, th th there would have been an interesting sort of culture for that for sure. It just feels so sort of old in so many ways that it I think it would have looked a bit weird had it had that ever come out, to be honest. I think releasing it 20 years down the line or 25 years down the line as a a c like an Xbox Switch Curio now like a little fun nostalgia play is better than treating it like oh this could l legitimately be a thing. I mean I never played Perfect Dark online, you know it just didn't interest me at all Just it just felt sort of redundant t to what this game is and and how I understood it.

Samuel
01:45:11
Yeah, I can kinda get that. Um I think Perfect Dark just uh i it it was more of a kind of like hardcore apply only thing whereas i think that gold and eye would have made a bit more of a splash because of the james bond Property and it being like and it and it's skipping a generation basically. But um yeah, um interesting nonetheless. Um Okay, last up then, Matthew. Shall we talk about the oddity that is the Wii Goldeneye game? Because you played this more than me, and we you commented on it a couple of times when we were playing yesterday. And um well, it's a very strange thing that happened, isn't it? That that that this that Goldeneye was remade with Daniel Craig um and was kind of a piece of shit. Um it felt like a cash grab of the time. Um but it was well reviewed. So why why don't you speak on it as the authority?

Matthew
01:45:58
It was an Activision thing. It was it was made in the mould of Call of Duty It was a Wii exclusive, so that was kind of exciting. It was nice to see them putting a bit of money into something which, you know, which was only coming to the Wii. But as part of its yeah, big budget injection and the the sort of facelift they gave it, they changed Pierce Boston for Daniel Craig. And you know, like was saying earlier, there is such a break in terms of tone of James Bond. So it was really, really odd having Daniel Craig doing some of Brosnan's lines and then they they changed bits of it. Like it was way more ambitious. Like don't think that this is just uh H D version of Golden Island the N sixty four. Like I c you know, I can remember, you know, for example the dam section, the very first level involved a big sequence where I think you met Alec Trevelyan on the dam and you did like almost like a turret section in a lorry going through that tunnel. where you were like fighting of guards and talking to each other and it was it was just very, very Call of Duty esque every level had like a big cinematic set piece. If you try and go off the beaten path or if you play it incorrectly it will fail you like they do in Call of Duty. Like everything Goldeneye doesn't do this game did I think it reviewed okay just on the grounds that that desperate Nintendo journalists liked anyone who you know, tried a little bit hard and gave us something interesting. It was perfectly playable. They redid the Goldeneye theme tune and it was old oh what's her name? Nicole Old Scherzinger. Yeah, Scherzinger's singing it and uh except remember you jumped off the you jump off the dam at the f the f at that level. As you're falling, you fall into the and then it becomes like a proper James Bond credits with that golden eyed version.

Samuel
01:47:50
Yeah.

Matthew
01:47:50
So like it but it pulled out all the stops. It was just It was just very, very odd to see Goldeneye, silly, stupid Goldeneye retcont with very serious Daniel Craig.

Samuel
01:48:01
Um Bloodstone felt kind of similar where it felt like it was written to be a PS2 era Brosnan game. Um whereas Broston was a little bit of a one size fits all bond, you know, you could sort of plug him into video games and he kinda made more sense. Whereas Daniel Craig was sort of like, this is a serious drama now with some set pieces, you know what I mean? That was the kind of vibe of it.

Matthew
01:48:21
Like he's really wrestling with some stuff, Daniel Craig's Bond. While Pierce Brosnan's just having a good old time and you know likes going to fancy hotels and meeting all these interesting ladies. Yeah, exactly.

Samuel
01:48:34
He's sort of like he's just a it was like a good hangbond versus bad hang bond, really. Um yeah, the i it's it's odd, but then I guess like the the screenwriter they got back. Was it Bruce Feierstein or something like that, the guy? Um and he was like this the guy who wrote Goldeneye originally. So they brought him back. So he was you're bound to get a similar result, kind of approximated really in the script. But I played a bit of it and yeah, I think the Wii thing, the Wii context is important to underline there. Like um by the time it came out as Goldeneye reloaded. Uh Xbox and PS3 outlets weren't really interested and it gave it a bit more of a kicking, I think.

Matthew
01:49:09
And um Oh, it did eventually come out on them then. I couldn't I didn't remember that.

Samuel
01:49:13
Yeah, it did. It was um maybe like a year later, something like that. And they they added online multi No, they added something new to it, but it was more just like a HD spruce up basically. So um Yeah, that did that did happen. It's not backwards compatible or anything though, so um playing it is a little bit a little bit lost of time. But um yeah, we're wee's a good um good place for it. And that's Goldeneye Matthew. We did a podcast all about it. It lasted a bit longer than I thought it would actually, because I thought we'd just be saying things we said before, but there's quite a lot of new stuff in there really, and um it was fun to go back to because when I listened back to the perfect dark episode, you were a little bit like This this supplanted Goldeneye so much in your in your mind that Goldeneye was blotted out instantly. Um which I totally get why that happened and my friends who had Perfect Dark had the same experience, but GoldenEyes lingered in the public consciousness in a way Perfect Doug really hasn't, you know. So um it's it's just interesting to go back to in that respect. And yeah, it was fun to come to your house and play some multiplayer. Yeah, with levels as good as jungle, why wouldn't it? Oh, jungle, yes. Um it was tragic. Um so yeah, I mean Maybe we'll do another Bond game episode in advance of AA7 First Light. I'll figure out what the exact shape of that is. Um I'll give that a bit more thought. I do always love discussing bond or bond adjacent things on this podcast. I feel like in some ways it's what it's what we're for, you know? Um the Austin Powers episode, for example, it's sort of like Well Matthew, people know where they can find us on social media and our episode later this month. Are we not pitching levels to each other? Oh shit, I forgot we had that at the The plan. Sorry, I had the original plan open without that bit. I was about to wrap up. I forgot. This afternoon I pitched Matthew some fun bullshit to wrap up with. Um I said pitch five more GoldenEye multiplayer maps based on other Bond movies. How could I forget? I do have five Matthews, so it's uh it's all good. So um Tell me, did this exercise give you a bit of a headache?

Matthew
01:51:04
I felt like I was too sort of practically minded about it and just picked efficient locations that I could work uh see working as Goldeneye locations, so then I tried to jazz it up a bit. Well fair enough.

Samuel
01:51:16
Um let's take it in turns then. So um shall I go first or you? What do you reckon? Yeah you you go first. You set the tone. Okay, I've given all of mine one word names as the you know as they have in Goldeneye that you know it's the rule I've stick by Um the first one is called Table. It's in and around Lilla Chief um Poker Table from Casino Royale. Um there's lots of tasty weapons on the table, but it's basically a series of corridors that rotate around the table, and then lots of firefights can happen in the middle. Um but to be honest, I just like the idea of um of a a level called table in that menu that just made me like Wait, so you're like a shrunken James Bond on a giant table? No, it's not micro machines, it's It's a full-size it's the poker table as dis as depicted in the film, but like lots of like little corridors around the table. And the table is the kind of convergence point of where all the firefights happen. Yeah, it's a casino, but it's called table. So what this level would actually be called Casino. It would, but table is like the highlight of it. So the table is also would it. It would be the same table from the train. No, it would be a larger table than that. It would have more props on it. But I was thinking a bit about the the restrictions of the N64 processing power. Like I thought it could probably only do like a table and some other rooms, like rotate uh like a around it. It couldn't give you a full like casino experience, you know? So Yeah, that's my first one. But um Okay. What's your first one?

Matthew
01:52:40
Oh well I'll try and give them one one word names as well. Uh this one is Underground. And it's the London Underground from Skyfall. Oh yeah, Thabby. This is the one that I could see m happening the most easiest because it's It's just a load of tunnels with a load of like tiled walls. This is where I was thinking most practically. I was like, yeah, you've got a little bit of escalators going up and down. Maybe that's a little bit of interactivity, because You know, you could put a timed mine on the bottom of the escalator and it would go all the way to the top of the escalator. Maybe that's too much for the N64. I don't know. But um yeah, the London Underground as made famous by Skyfall. You Does is there like a moving train component to it? Sure sure what well I don't want you to have to get on a train and then it takes you to another underground station. Cause then I feel like there's which station are you in? I've got to wait for two minutes to get to that bit of the map. That could be a nightmare. There could definitely be a platform where there's a train that's stopped and you can either fight on the platform or get into the train and fight in there and then you know it's it's like Two corridors next to each other, that's fun.

Samuel
01:53:48
Yeah, I uh I that's uh I do like that. Um Yeah, I just w I wanna believe wanna I wanna believe that the train would be there for the simple reason of I could have I could picture the N sixty four grind into like two FPS. Um just as the game tries to fucking have a moving train and loads of people fighting at the same time. Um that's um yeah, okay. No, I do like that. I think it's it is a pretty distinctive location from that film. So It makes sense. Um yeah, okay, so uh I've got um Island, which is um Scaramangas Island from the man with the golden gun, Matthew. Oh yeah You get a few different bits of this. You get um you get the uh the beach it the beach bit of it where they begin the jewel. And um you are all like um when when you spawn in, you're all on the beach like faced in different directions from each other. You You have no weapons and you have to sprint off and go get the gun. So you will spawn in the same place, but then it's like you'll kind of like scatter and then kind of like basically do a bit of hide and seek throughout the level, um similar to how Roger Moore does in the film. Um you got the fun you got his funhouse um sort of bit of it with the weird mannequins and shit. You got that. And you've got a little bar area where a little hatch opens and you see knick-knack behind it just sort of poke having a little look at what's going on. And um that's it basically, it's island. Um thoughts, Matthew? Yeah, I like this.

Matthew
01:55:04
Uh does Nick Knack become a playable character?

Samuel
01:55:07
Uh I suppose we could chug that in there as a little a little sort of like um taster alongside a little bit of fun. Chug that in there. Well yeah, that's it. I mean I'm not suggesting He would be some kind of like power-up you would use on other players on like a weapon. You like like just pick up Nick-Knack and throw him at other players. Shoot knick-knack to get body armor. Um body armor every single time you shoot him.

Matthew
01:55:32
I mean I like this in that that's the only film that technically does end with a death Death match, multiplayer game. Yeah, it does. That makes perfect sense. Yeah, I like that a lot.

Samuel
01:55:41
That's that's strong. It's weird that uh something like this didn't actually make it into the multiplayer map. So I guess like an outdoor location is the sort of thing they try to avoid with um

Matthew
01:55:49
Goldeneye, keep you indoors a little bit. Well, I guess you gotta put in other iconic things from James Bond films like Egypt. Yeah, exactly. What's your next one, Matthew? hotel, which is the Ice Hotel from Die Another Day. Oh nice. Yeah, I just think you could have a little bit of fun with like I like the breaking glass in whichever map multiplayer map has the breaking glass in it. And so I picture like ice walls maybe having a similar vibe to like you can shatter them or you can blow them up with mines. Like the idea of like a map that can kind of collapse and maybe change different routes. I mean if it was properly cutting edge and not tied to the N64, it could melt over the course of the match. And so like different routes open up as like certain staircases begin to wilt and things like that.

Samuel
01:56:36
Yeah, that's cool. I like that. It's um you know, we we I think we did a tiny bit of Die Another Day revisionism when we um we did that episode because I think my sp stance was, well, this is not good, but it's still better than like three Roger Moore films. So you gotta keep you gotta keep that in mind. But No, I like the idea of that. Like um I was trying to think of some more kind of Brosnan locations, but couldn't really get in the headspace of it other than like Jonathan Price's submarine or boat or whatever it is where he's doing newspapers. I mean even that wasn't very interesting to be honest. You know Jonathan Price's newspaper submarine. Oh dear. Um Okay, my next one, Matthew, is um Lake. This is a frozen lake in a little house um from the beginning of No Time to Die, um when creepy Rami Malik comes up to the glass and starts breathing on it. But I thought the idea of a frozen lake that's maybe got some cool weapons in the middle of it could be quite good. You got a bit of N64 miss, so you can't see where the fuck you're going half the time, but that turns it into a bit of a horror game style experience where enemies just pop out of the mist and um come and get you basically. You can shoot through that glass that Madeline swan's being um terrorized from behind during that um during that sequence. Um and it's like a I think it's like Norway where they filmed it, but um A bit uh it can reuse some of the um some of the surface textures to make it a bit similar. It is kind of similar, but with a frozen lake. Yeah, and a frozen lake, um to be fair Um but yes, I suppose it is, Matthew. Um fair criticism. And uh yes, runs at 10 FPS when you're outside, of course. So um such as it is. What's your next one?

Matthew
01:58:14
Well, my big open level uh is opera and it's the floating opera house from Quantum of Solace where James Bond put you know he that he rings all the people up and he's like, I know you're watching the opera or whatever it is he says. And they all freak out and leave. But I wanted something there's there's not really much sniping you can do in Goldeneye multiplayer maps. Like it's all so tight the little rooms and tight little corridors. So I like the idea of big sort of amphitheatre where you can snipe people across, have some people up in the lighting rigging, just a little bit of height to it. Again, probably be on the N sixty four but um that's okay. You you gotta, you know, aspire to dream bigger, you know?

Samuel
01:58:58
Yeah, I like that one. That's um I mean I I couldn't remember any bits of Quantum of Solace. I'm glad that you did the The sort of thing.

Matthew
01:59:12
And they're all all their phones go off and then they're all like fuck and they all start and and there's an opera happening on a floating stage and it sort of reaches its crescendo at the same time as everyone leaves. It's like it's like one v I think very good minute in that film.

Samuel
01:59:25
It's one of about nine secret organizations in the Daniel Craig Bond films, one after another, who just lead into another one. That was one of the strangest things about that little series. Okay, so my next one is Jamaica Matthew. Um this is in and around Bond's home as depicted in No Time to Die. It's a bit of a um Ian Fleming reference as well because he lived there. Um just got big colonial um curse British energy, um, but like it's like a little Um another house by a lake to be honest, but in a more tropical climb. Any kind of um any thoughts on this? I thought it might just be quite cool.

Matthew
02:00:00
His house was called

Samuel
02:00:01
Goldeneye, right? Uh I think that's right. And so it's got um I thought it could also have a few like references to other Bond stuff in there, like little props and things like that, or mementos from his time um sort of doing it. Just pictures of all the women he shagged. Just something like that basically. Or something less um more progressive. Shagged and knickknacked Guy I lobbed or whatever he did to Nick Knack and that. Um what did happen to Nick Knack at the end of the get he wrestled him in the boat, didn't he? That's at the end.

Matthew
02:00:31
Did he like sneak onto a spoke?

Samuel
02:00:33
I don't think I don't think he died that badly, did he?

Matthew
02:00:35
Did he maybe like died a terrible death? It was not fed into the rotor blades of the uh Powerboat engine.

Samuel
02:00:42
Oh, that's rough. That's a tough one.

Matthew
02:00:44
I don't think he did. Oh, I can't I cannot remember now.

Samuel
02:00:47
I just remember he's like, I'm gonna get on with Ringo Star's wife now. But then like um He fucking pops up out of like a cupboard or something, they just starts fighting him.

Matthew
02:00:56
That I think that's what happens and then I hope we get to see the behind the scenes of this in the Ringo star uh quartet of the Beatles films. Yeah.

Samuel
02:01:06
Just his romancing of uh Barbara Bash or whatever she's called. She was just uh a very beautiful one. Barbara Bash Is it Bash Back? I can't remember now. This makes us sound like she's a Robot Wars house robot. Barbara Bash. Okay, it might have been back. I can't remember. She just is like I think it's back She was just a sublimely look a sublime looking woman, and he just looked like a basically a magazine staff writer. I'm just saying that's like the energy of the two people together, but

Matthew
02:01:34
Yeah.

Samuel
02:01:34
They've made it work, you know, they've been together for decades and good for him. Um shout out to Ringo Star and his wife. Um what's your your penultor one one, Matthew?

Matthew
02:01:43
Volcano. It's the volcano lair from You Only Live Twice. Very good. Yeah, not a funny pick, it's just a a an iconic location that I think would be good in multiplayer mode. I have a feeling this has been done in a EA Bond game.

Samuel
02:01:59
Yeah, I'm trying to think if I've I don't think it's in Nightfire, but I think there's something that's a bit volcano adjacent in Nightfire.

Matthew
02:02:16
It's just got a lot of like in like a nice big space below, lots of staircases, like a an aerial walkway, which is really good for shooting guards and then them tumbling off in that satisfying way that they do in James Bond films. Um, but I yeah, I look at that f floor and that walkway and I'm like that's the st uh classic. It might be a little bit too close to caverns, uh our hated caverns, but uh

Samuel
02:02:40
What can you do? Cabins was alright for um the n uh uh throwing knives bit level that we did.

Matthew
02:02:45
Yeah, we did that's the one we did throwing knives licensed to kill, so one hit kills and it was just loads of people ch you know Bellowing with laughter as we chuck knives around uh a cave. It was good. It was a good time.

Samuel
02:02:58
Um a quick Google would suggest that Goldeneye Rogue Agent was the level that had a volcano um layer. Uh was the game that had a volcano layer level, Matthew. So um I've never played that one and uh I choose to never play that one. Yeah, that did happen, didn't it? But a really like stupid era of um licensed games that um all the good Bond games it could have been making in that time, but Instead EA were churning out some rubbish, but uh alas, quite funny in retrospect, really. Um my la last level, Matthew, is Skyfall, um, pretty um self-explanatory. The big mana of course and as a bonus he can play as Albert Finney in um Is it N sixty four Albert Finney? Yeah, of course, the very same And um anything more than a meter away outside the manor is like fog basically. So it's um it's a good place to go and like hide and then like this would actually be really good if they had a sort of um This would actually be a really good single player level in in Goldeneye is just having loads of enemies spill in to this mana and it's just you and Albert Finney trying to hold him off, basically. That'd be good. But um I thought that's like maybe the most distinctive single location from a Daniel Craig film in terms of like sticking in your mind, but also has level potential. Does that make sense?

Matthew
02:04:08
Yeah, it's got good shout. Skyfall Lodge or wherever it is would make a uh really good zombies map in Call of Duty.

Samuel
02:04:15
That's a great yeah, or like a horde mode map in Gears or something. That's uh bit to a bit totally strange for gears to be in like a Scottish manner, but um Hey, I wouldn't put it um put it past them. Um what's your last one, Matthew?

Matthew
02:04:27
Uh it's Fort Knox from Goldfinger. Again, I was th I was thinking more along the lines of like lots of repeated tiles. Like you just need like wool and then gold behind bars. There could maybe something to do with the bars being electrocuted. I don't really know how that would impact you. You can't touch the walls, which isn't like a particularly exciting limitation in a multiplayer match, but uh as a as an iconic location which I think you could do without killing an N64, plus you've got odd job already made. You just have to make a gold finger model as well.

Samuel
02:05:01
Yeah, and uh I'm sure there's like a an old um uh gold member 3D render from a cursed cancelled Austin Powers game somewhere they could use for that one, Matthew. If um If the budget's tight on this, uh, but yeah. Um, doesn't like quite a big part of the plot of that film hinge on loads of army dudes pretending to be asleep? Is that a thing that happened in that film? No, I think they knock them out. Oh they do actually get knocked out. That's right. Okay.

Matthew
02:05:25
Oh no, but isn't it no, isn't it they knock them out but they uh they know in advance they're gonna do it, so they replace the sleeping gas and they just pretend to be knocked out. So then they all jump back up onto their feet and fight them off. Isn't that like a Not before they've managed to get a nuke into Fort Knox?

Samuel
02:05:40
That's like a mad as shit plot for a film when you think about it. That plot point of Some guys pretend to be knocked out is really strange, really. But um I mean yeah, what what a franchise, eh? Just the the best to ever do it really. Um no that's a good that's a that's good Matthew. So um yeah I I I enjoy that. I wish those were levels in the game. I wish table was in the game, um, but um alas, we could only dream. Uh Maybe Io, once they're into like year five of first light, start adding levels like this into the game. That would actually be really cool if they did like uh A simulation based mode where it's like past past bond um film levels or something. That's amazing. That would be good. So uh yes. Um okay Matthew, well people know where to get to uh get us on social media, like I said about fifteen minutes ago before I forgot this whole last segment of the episode. Um very enjoyable to revisit GoldenEye with you. And like I say, we'll probably do one other bond game related thing before 007 First Light comes out in May. We've got a bit of time. And this month's other Patreon episode is about the films, TV shows, and other stuff we're looking forward to in 2026. So that'll that's coming up in a couple of weeks. Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye. Goodbye.
