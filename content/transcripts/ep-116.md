Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle Hello. Matthew, how's it going? Have you been enjoying the new additions to Nintendo Switch online?

Matthew
00:33
I've got a review game on the go, so every minute of the day I have to play that rather than um Metroid Prime and GBA. I played a little bit of Minish Cap. Just to see how GBA looked on my lovely OLED screen and can confirm.

Samuel
00:47
Very nice. So that's what separates it from the um a dubious uh emulation devices I've owned in the past where uh th it they don't have OLED screens. They um yeah they're they're very much like more sort of mom and pop operations. Yeah this is this is some big boy shit seeing some ancient games running on this thing. So That's good. So you bought Metro Prime straight off, did you?

Matthew
01:06
Uh no, I haven't. That's I actually haven't I haven't bought it yet, um, because I just don't have time to play it. So um maybe I'll hold out for the physical copy. I don't know.

Samuel
01:16
That's what I did. That's what I did. And yeah, it's g gonna be my reward. Like the deferred gratification will make it more worthwhile, maybe. Yeah, I was quite surprised to see how elaborate this remaster was actually, because think you and I speculated that it was kinda like a 3D All-Star situation where Maybe you've been pushed out the door, but it seems like it's been uh had a proper overhaul.

Matthew
01:34
Yeah, it's one of those classic ones that when I was watching the trailer I was like, oh it still looks pretty good. I was thinking this still looks pretty solid, like based on how it was on the GameCube. And then when I saw the side-by-side comparisons and you see actually how much has been done to it and how overhauled it is, it's just the curse of remasters and remakes, isn't it? It's the you know that i it looks how you remember it even though it's much better.

Samuel
01:58
Yeah, speaking of uh the old remasters and remakes, this episode's about the last of us, Matthew, and you've been playing. The last of us. Do they call it part one now on PS5?

Matthew
02:06
Yeah.

Samuel
02:07
Yeah, that's baffling. That's sort of the sort of thing that Steve Burns used to hate when people would call it like Halo One. It's like it's not called Halo One, it's called Halo. And I always found that quite funny as a sort of Um thing to take up the game.

Matthew
02:18
I guess they couldn't do it at the time, like in case it had bombed massively, unlikely for a naughty dog game, and then you're stuck with something which announces itself as the beginning of something um and then it never happens. I guess it's just to tie it into part two which is they did that 'cause it sounds like the Godfather, right?

Samuel
02:35
Yeah, I mean it's the old um Floygen Bros uh volume one problem Matthew, yes. You set expectations there'll be a volume.

Matthew
02:43
See if they just called it Floygenbros, then made Floigenbros Volume 2, and then remade Floygenbros as Floygenbros Volume 1. Ye That would have been fine. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

Samuel
02:53
Um the last of Floygen. Um Floygan Bros is very much the last of us of the Dream Cup. That's everything that uh you need to know about Matthew's views on Sega right there. Views and knowledge summed up.

Matthew
03:06
Well actually Fleigenbrose is about controlling a character with an AI companion. It's not that far off.

Samuel
03:11
Oh yeah, that is true actually, yeah.

Matthew
03:14
It literally is.

Samuel
03:15
And that was a purely accidental similarity. Yeah, absolutely. But uh yeah, yeah. Uh so yeah, uh for people who don't remember what that is, that was a game's court of Very cursed Dreamcast object that someone read in and me saying the word Floygen Bros calls Matthew the crack up because it does sound like a randomly generated game. Um, so this episode, The Last of Us, it felt like a good time to talk about the first game in this series because there is obviously a TV show that's out. That TV show seems to be phenomenally popular, i. e. , my dad is watching it. Um despite he's had the game installed on P on the PS4 I gave him for three years and he has not touched it one Once.

Matthew
03:56
But the TV show that would eat into precious saboteur time.

Samuel
04:00
Yeah, or precious oboe time. Um yeah. That's uh that's time that's that's tough. On Um oh it was a clarinet, wasn't it? I've I keep I keep I forget now what the actual instrument was and what was the one accent. It's out of control. Someone emailed us actually just saying that like uh oh I want to listen to your more recent episodes but I don't want to miss out on any lore so I'm read-listening to them in order and I was like oh god that's that's a bad sign when you made a podcast so people feel the need to do that. Um So yes, Matthew, the last of us, I feel like this will be good territory for discussion. So we kind of got like a bit of background on the original release um and the TV show itself in section one and in section two Nathy's been replaying um the game on PS5 or you know, playing the PS5 version for the first time, and so we're gonna talk about that a bit too. So should be well rounded. We're not gonna try and cram both games into one episode because I think the TV show and the first game is kind of enough and um Apparently, like, you know, the they're going to adapt uh The Last of Us Part Two for future seasons of this TV show, so it makes sense to kind of revisit those down the line, I think, when um a lot of that story comes back into uh sort of like harsh view and you know people talking about it and that sort of thing. So Matthew just start with, do you remember the first time you heard about The Last of Us and what you thought about his whole road to release. How do you think how did you think uh about the Last of Us relative to Uncharted, which was, you know, Naughty Dog's other big series? Or it was like its first big sort of cinematic series, you know, this huge kind of like uh PS3 trilogy um became like this massive deal and then The Last of Us felt like it kind of grew out of that. They split the team off into two teams for the first time to make this Um a cinematic uh sort of horror-infused game. So uh like Uncharted was a huge deal to both of us. We talked about it a lot on the podcast before we did an Uncharted episode. Like what was what was The Last of Us to you in like 2013 or before when they announced it?

Matthew
05:49
Yeah, so as I've said many times on the podcast before, like PlayStation of this era I kind of approach very much as a punter. You know, I never worked on PlayStation, I never wrote anything PlayStation Mags, you know I basically just played the games when they came out and wasn't too involved with the hype cycles behind them. My earliest memory of this is um There was like uh an an Easter egg in Uncharted that kind of linked to this, right? In Uncharted 3. There was a like a newspaper that referenced like a mushroom outbreak which people on the internet sort of seized upon and decided was a hint at something, not necessarily Naughty Dog, but something coming from Sony. And so I think my first sort of memory of this game is like, oh, it's the weird mushroom thing from Uncharted 3. And definitely mushrooms featured heavily in my memory in like the announcement and the kind of chat around this game. this this like lore of this world that it wasn't zombies, that there there was this sort of like uh kind of world reclaimed by nature and sort of mushroomy threat. And I remember thinking, well, I don't really know how that fits into that uncharted template. I couldn't really imagine what the Uncharted team were gonna gonna make, you know the these sort of masters of of quite lighthearted action adventure, you know, was this gonna be some like weird sci-fi thing? So I think probably trepidation is is like The earliest thought on this?

Samuel
07:21
Yeah, so it's interesting for me, I kind of recognize this as a huge deal because, you know, it was um There was this uh first trailer in 2011, I think it was. Um they debuted it at like the whatever the Game Awards was called then. The whatever Jeff Keeley Fest. Spike? Yeah, that's right, yeah. I think that's right. Um so Yeah, and like it was this uh yeah, like sort of like the tone was obviously completely different. Uncharted does this very fun tone and this seemed very sincere, very serious. Um, it was right around the time that The Walking Dead was huge as well. Um, this was the year that season two of The Walking Dead came out, and so uh people weren't um that TV show wasn't mega embarrassing yet as it would become um very quickly. Um and so the I think like there was this idea of like credible drama amid zombie stuff just seemed like it was, you know uh i i it seemed like it was in the air a little bit. Like it's not it's not totally implausible to me that there there's there's some crossover between The Walking Dead and The Last of Us. Um you know, take all the Cordycep stuff out of The Last of Us You could basically set that entire story in the Walking Deads universe. There isn't anything to stop you. You know what I mean? Like it's um very similar kind of like you don't know um you don't have loads and loads of lore details about where this thing came from. But it is a thing that has taken over America essentially. And there there are these different human factions left fighting for survival. Like the the whole thing could be the Walking Dead, basically, minus the mushroom stuff.

Matthew
08:48
The mushroom stuff was qu quite key to their messaging, if I remember. Like I can remember watching a little mini documentary where they were very explicit about like, look at this man who's kind of grown into a wall as a mushroom. Like that image is stuck in my head as like the first thing I saw with The Last of Us and I have no idea where it comes from.

Samuel
09:05
Yeah, well I certainly like it gives it something visually distinct. Um but like fun fundamentally I don't think that you really do anything that makes them function that differently to zombies, really. Some of them are blind is probably the thing. It like the ki that's the key thing. It's like the imagery is different. But like the actual I don't know, the mechanics of the world. And like how they all function is quite similar to a a zombie storyline really. Like it's not massively different. Uh that's not me saying that like you know, I thought that was a weakness of the game. But it just felt to me like I could see why it was plausible that Naughty Dog would make th this in a world with the Walking Dead in it. That's um that's basically all I'm saying. So yeah. And then like for me as well, I worked on uh PlayStation magazine in twenty twelve and I think by the time I moved on to that magazine, they'd already done two covers on The Last of Us. And this is like they're still uh like about a year away from release. So that's how big a deal it was on PlayStation. It was the big thing. Um I think there's a thing as well where like in that first trailer um Ellie's counting bullets out of a gun. And so they were kind of like underlining the whole idea of you know, you ammo is scarce here too, you know, so that's where it's very different to the Uncharted, where obviously you just go weapons-free in a variety of situations. This was very much like um I suppose you had at the same time as um This came along, this reveal came along. You had like survival games kind of taking off a little bit more, and so crafting systems becoming a bit more prevalent, you know, in your day uh day-Z and the like likes of that. Um sort of rise of steam early access things. Now Last of Us doesn't have loads in common with that sort of thing, but it's like it's almost like the most sort of cinematic, polished version of those types of mechanics, you know. It's like A little bit of like what can you find and sort of pull together, that kind of thing. That's that was a sort of uh like a m a game type that was emerging more and more at the time, you know. That's that's what I kind of remember about it.

Matthew
10:50
Um that sounds that sounds about right. And it is it is uh maybe maybe like part of my problem kind of wrapping my head around it was that you know they'd established themselves as this very sort of cinematic, linear, kind of choreographed studio. and the talk around this, you know, without them being explicit about mechanics, kind of leads you to thinking, you know, is this gonna be more like systems-based or systemic in general and i the kind of tug of war between those two kind of uh design approaches is kind of what's at the heart of The Last of Us and what kind of makes it interesting.

Samuel
11:25
Yeah, I think that's I think that is true. It's like it's you know, it is basically a stealth action game, right? It's sort of like, you know, arguably 60% stealth or you know, you can you can play most of it in stealth really. But um I think there is like it's all about the sort of um the tipping point of drama when like um things go wrong and you are forced to use a gun. Like I think that It's not a game I think that's necessarily designed to be ghosted, although I'm sure you can play it that way, but it's more like you are sort of waiting for the moment that something goes amiss and then suddenly you have to fight your way out of this. And like that that's where the kind of more cinematic action element comes into it and I think that's certainly like a deliberate part of the mix and not just like Metal Gear where you're basically punished for you know being caught essentially. Um so that's where I think it differs a little bit to a stealth game. um for example. Um so Matthew, what what do you remember about when you've played it for the first time? Did it register as a massive deal for you?

Matthew
12:18
Yeah, I mean it it w it was one of these ones where like office hype definitely swept me up. I can remember C V G sitting behind us on OM It's suddenly like all they were talking about and it became apparent from people playing the review code and chatting about it in the office that this was going to be you know, as good as or as interesting or as exciting as, you know, what they'd been doing in Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3, which were obviously like a huge, huge deal. I remember on launch day really struggling to find a copy. because i you had to have like pre-ordered it at the game shops. I'm I ended up buying it from Hamley's Toy Store in London. That's random. That is one of yeah, because I was just trying to think, where would people not go to buy a video game? And uh I d I happen to know that Hamley's had a video game, so going to this stupid store which is very for people who don't know Hamley's It's kind of like London's famous sort of like chintzy toy store, but it's it's kind of like the toy stores you see in films with like, you know, big teddy bears and it's It's you know, it's it's you know, not not a place you think video games. So yeah, I got it from there. Um yeah, I was just de I was desperate to see the opening in particular. There was a s I remember there was loads of talk about this sort of astonishing opening, whatever it was. Was this like real technical feat, this real um, you know, emotional kind of sledgehammer blow, you know, I'd I'd been hearing Lots of chatter around kind of how emotional the game had been making reviewers. There was this constant reference to like, oh, so apparently so and so cried when they reviewed it, um was was the kind of echo round the office. You know, and you're like, oh well I've got to see what this is then, you know, this is you know, I can't I can't be sort of contrarian and not not get not kind of get swept up by all this chat. And yeah, and I as as for actually playing it, you know, I th I thought it was like my I think my n sort of initial reaction was was just being really excited, being swept up by that that opening set piece, which is a you know, still still pretty astonishing. And then just b being probably more like intrigued by ha how Like this emergence of this new side of naughty dog, this this sort of like slight step away from entirely sort of scripted thrills into into like stealth and and the particular brand of stealth and we can talk a little bit more about that in the second half I guess. But um, you know, I I I don't think I was ever part of the kind of instant like ten out of ten, this is my favourite thing ever, um, club. But I r you know, I remember being really compelled by it and playing through it like super fast across a week, you know, it it has a really good pull to it. I mean the the whole pitch of that you're going to this place. Like you always have this sort of objective. It it's a really It it's a game that does a really good job of constantly reminding you like you're working towards this thing. There's always a landmark on the horizon you're kind of working towards. It's got a really nice sort of journey and progression to it that way. So it's very hard not to get sort of swept up by that. So, you know, I I found it to be very effective.

Samuel
15:25
Yeah, it's interesting 'cause I I I played it and I didn't love it. I thought I thought it was very good. I I got a I think I got a copy on Games T M. And I took a week off in I think July 2013 and um went to Worcester um very for a very boring week off and Um went to see World War Z one day and got shot on by a bird. That was good. And then a and uh yeah, for some reason I remember The Last of Us in um in r in kind of relation to that because it was that we got where I got shot on by a bird in Worcester. So Good times. Um I think I played through all of it in one chunk and like I liked it. I liked it fine, but I think that how sincere it was and how seriously it was taking itself, I think like Maybe this is a slight age thing. I just I found it slightly pompous on a first playthrough. A little bit self-serious, a little bit like We're doing the road, but with mushroom men and with and except it's like the more uh sort of like sugar pilled version of it. Like it's you know, not as nearly as kind of like heavy as the road, this kind of dynamic between a you know, a father figure and a daughter figure. Um that kind of like rang very s that that that rang very similarly to me. It was like, yeah, you know, I've seen the road, I know what I know what the deal is here. Did like the the sort of physical design of the enemies. Uh found the stealth quite frustrating a little bit. A few too many instances where I thought, is it worth trying to stealth my way around this and then accidentally get like sort of like instant killed by an enemy because I was I'm I messed up once on a very slow playthrough, or should I just like create a kind of like bomb and basically lure people towards me for like one big um explosive kind of like um you know, basically like clear out of enemies. And I I found just a few instances like that where I was just getting I was just getting annoyed by the stealth. I didn't feel like a fully you understood exactly how it worked, maybe found it a little bit opaque and sometimes when one of those things would just start screaming and I didn't really know why they were doing it. Um so I had I had that experience with it where I just thought I didn't like I wasn't like mechanically blown away by it. And I I thought the story was really well executed, but I think I found myself just ever so slightly um at odds with the critical reception 'cause I didn't tear up at any of it. Like it's not it it's not that kind of game experience for me. Like it can Just sitting there doing a manly shrug at all the sadness of the world. Yeah, well it's more like I don't I just didn't think it was showing me anything new, even though I was very blown away by the sophistication of like Naughty Dog's presentation. That that you know that part never really fa fails to amaze me like the Yeah The environmental design, the character designs, the animations, all that stuff, absolutely incredible. And I definitely thought that at the time. But gameplay-wise it just didn't totally click with me. Um and so I th I so I liked it, but I didn't love it. And then I didn't replay it again. until uh eight years later. And um I had slightly different thoughts on it, so maybe we can save that for them for part two. But that was my initial reaction, you know.

Matthew
18:11
Yeah, I I I think like, you know, with regards to the kind of the wider response to it and kind of like understanding where the people were coming from, like I I can completely understand why it is like an all-timer to the people who love it, but I do also appreciate the kind of eye rolls from certain quarters. You know, like on a character level, you know, it's really delicate, subtle stuff and is better executed than than most games in that regard. Definitely. Um but yes, people who are, you know, maybe more sort of I don't know if dogmatically is the right word, but like you know, people who are into the doing of games, the playing of games, which is fundamentally kind of like probably you know, isn't it here what we're here for? I can understand why they find like the puzzles naff or the stealth a bit soft or it a bit repetitive, you know, like I I I c I completely got that too. Um and I feel like probably like you sort of sit somewhere between those two things of kind of like accepting of one but also like, you know Yeah, I don't I don't think you know, st strip out all the character, which is a dumb thing to say 'cause you can't, you know, and that isn't what you know, that is a big part of what this game is, but you know, I don't know if it's talked about in quite quite the same way.

Samuel
19:31
Yeah, I think so. And I think like um as well, I did like all the individual pieces of, you know, different characters you you'd meet and interact with and their little stories. I found them slightly archetypal and like not none of them really got under my skin emotionally.

Matthew
19:48
I tell you uh playing it now alongside like the TV show and we'll get into this in the second half, but like I uh basically I've been playing it per episode so I play up to where they get to in the episodes and then put it down and then carry on with it. So I'm only like halfway through it or whatever, as is the TV show. And like how they've changed some of those characters or made them like a bit richer. or how sort of simple some of them are in the games. Like it it is it is quite striking. Like I mean particularly um, you know, Bill is like a whole different prospect in the game to what you get in the show. In an in the sh in the game it's 'cause he's played by the guy who is the barman Dan Dorothy in um Deadwood. Right. And like now I'm just like, oh of cool, I'm just hanging out with Dan Dority for a bit and you meet this guy and he teaches you to make a nail bomb. And it's Very video gamey, silly character really, you know, compared to what you've just watched in the show, where, you know, spoilers, no one learns how to make a nail bomb in that episode.

Samuel
20:54
No. Um yeah, actually that's probably a good point here. So let's like lay out the spoiler rules, shall we, Matthew? So yeah, let's say in section one here We will spoil the contents of the TV show so far, which is up to episode five, um which is called Endure and Survive. And then we won't spoil the major beats of the game beyond what's in the TV show until part two. Does that sound fair?

Matthew
21:17
Yes.

Samuel
21:17
Yeah.

Matthew
21:19
I may allude to some things.

Samuel
21:21
Yeah, that's fair, 'cause I think we'll need to. But yeah, I think that that that's how we'll do it, just in case like someone stumbled across this or you know, looking for podcasts about the TV show or whatever and they found two grumpy men complaining about a game from twenty thirty.

Matthew
21:32
Imagine if this podcast was your first ever bit of Last of Us content you can see.

Samuel
21:38
So yeah, to to revisit the reception thing, like um I've made this point before, but I got the impression that people who were like five or six years younger than me at the time majorly clicked with The Last of Us in like a massive way. Like I went with an editor on Tet Radar and she seemed to be like It seemed to be a huge part of her sort of gaming diet or whatever. And it reminded me of like how I thought, oh, okay, maybe this is to people what Uncharted 2 was to me when I was like 20 or something like that when I played it. So I kind of wondered that a little bit about it. Um, if that was an element, if there's an age element of like, if this hits you at the right time, maybe it like strikes a a more of a chord. Um I wondered if that was maybe part of it. Um But then what is interesting is I I think the first game's like just just good. And then I think the second game is phenomenal. I love the second game. I think the second game's a lot richer in a lot of ways. I know it's a lot longer, Matthew, and that's probably a longer conversation to have for another time, but I think like viewed through the prism of the second game. The first game seems not primitive, but just very it's very brisk. It doesn't sort of like Yeah, it's just it's just a such a different experience. And then yeah, I think like when you put it through the prism of the TV show as well, like you say, like some of those characters are just super simple. And so To me they were kind of like they were almost like little vignettes, you know. It was like, oh yeah, now it's the story about the brothers. And now it's like and it's like not like a massively inter interconnected thing, but fine, it's this kind of like journey across America or whatever. And I liked it, but yeah, it never like properly stayed with me in the way I got the sense it did with some people. Um it's interesting that age thing, because I think there were like two ends to it.

Matthew
23:11
There were definitely like yeah, a a kind of sort of generation or two kind of behind were really into it. And I didn't know if there was like a kind of like I n like a twenty year old, you know, Ellie isn't twenty in this game, she's like a young teenager, but I wondered if there was some sort of like more connective tissue there with like younger people. And then at the other end of the scale you had this was the first instance of like gamer dads being like emotionally awakened by a game and having this whole kind of oh I can appreciate this better than you because I've got a kid and I can kind of understand you know this This will speak to you all this stuff in this you wouldn't understand if you hadn't had a kid, which I always find a bit naffy discourse. No they were like And you know, in the middle were like childless thirty year olds who are like, I just want to say like ahead disintegrate.

Samuel
24:05
Yeah, but the thing is I am I am prepared to go along, like, you know, and get invested in a story that involves um parents and children, for sure. But I guess I didn't really think it had anything new to say about those things. Like, um I don't know, I can think of like You know, something like boyhood, for example, is like a you know an example of like a parent children relationship, so it really gets to me, you know what I mean? And I don't I don't need to have a kid who likes Iron Man to appreciate that, you know what I mean? So it's like the I find that a really, really false and like I You know, we're talking about the generation here of like dad op eds about, oh I've had a kid and this kid this game's got kids in it, and that's like a whole other thing, you know.

Matthew
24:42
Um I I I think it's more like you know, there's a generation of gamer dads who've been asked to make content and it's quite a convenient thing to like mine, you know? Rather than necessarily this idea that you can't empathize with something that you haven't had any experience of, I think is like preposterous, but absolutely.

Samuel
25:01
But the the funny thing is though, like what I actually thought that um Left Behind the DLC. I actually I wouldn't say I preferred it to the game. But I would say that as a slice of what the game does well, it really excels. Because it does deepen the c you know a a key character in a really important way, I think. Like it's you know, it's a flashback story, but you know, adds to that sense of yes, I'm gonna say, inner life, um to the early character. And so um that I found really satisfying is like not only a distillation of what The Last of Us does well gameplay wise, because it was a a really good setting for a DLC. And i i I really liked how it kind of like um flashed back to that um mall in the present where Joel was basically out for the count and Ellie was just trying to take care of him. Um that worked incredibly well for me. And I I feel like it had the sort of like texture of storytelling that I sometimes wanted from the main game but didn't necessarily get.

Matthew
25:50
Right.

Samuel
25:57
They flipped a switch and did something a bit differently. That was like, you know, a kind of like sting in the tail, as it were. So I r I really loved that about about the game. But I wouldn't say any other part of it I really loved. And then From there I was never really that bothered about there being a sequel. Um so that was me, Matthew, at the time basically. Um yeah. Um how did you feel about Left Behind? Do you remember playing that?

Matthew
26:19
Yeah, I played it quite after the fact. I I think I played it in the remastered thing on PS4. But I think by the time I played it, it it sort of snowballed into this like bigger thing than it than it maybe was. And and also Left Behind has a lot of um the kind of um like naughty dog social beats the kind of uh the yak petting or is it ox petting by it means. Patting the ox, yeah. Patting the ox. There's a lot of ox patting in that DLC. And and people respond really well to that. And like that's probably the time that's probably the moment that they kind of take the kind of proto um petting from Uncharted Three and kind of elevate it into something a bit more you know, there's a there's there's a bit more kind of human drama mixed in with it and like really I feel like like that probably that DLC more than anything has kind of been the model for a lot of what they've done since. There's a lot of that DLC kind of repeated tonally in part two. And in Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy, you know, this idea of like amongst the chaos, a kind of glimmer of humanity in this like you know, animated and designed with this incredible specificity, often humor, very warmth, like that uh that's the stuff that it seems to really really resonate and so it's no surprise they kind of lean into it. But oh yeah, I I did like it. I liked I probably like the the more flashback bits more than kind of running around a kind of sad shopping centre in the present.

Samuel
27:51
Yeah. Though I I've definitely said this before, but the thing that distracted me in the um in the present bits were that like Ellie kept finding letters that were like signed by this guy called Ellis and I thought you can't have an Ellie and an Ellis in this fucking game. That's like outrageous. You have to like not do that. Just call him like Roger or something. You know what I mean?

Matthew
28:12
Maybe they'll have uh tweaked that in Lost of Us Part One. I've not played the DLC yet. They're like one of the key things we wanted to address was the confusion that People thought they were getting letters from themselves early. Um so we've obviously really tidied that up.

Samuel
28:26
Well it wasn't that, it was just they were just a bit too close. It was a bit like I don't know, it's like you have ten seconds to come up with a name Um, you know, or we just need like uh somewhat a generic army man. Uh Ellis, yeah sure.

Matthew
28:36
And like Yeah, I mean uh and people do take that into consideration. Do you remember in Game of Thrones they changed that character's name 'cause there were two characters Is it like Asher and Ashen or something? Oh right, okay, yeah. They changed one of them into Yara, I think, because they didn't want people going like, huh? Um people are stupid, you know, and Ellie Ellis it's it's It's a pretty pretty tight one.

Samuel
28:58
It's like I made a joke on Twitter about the how the character Hosea in uh Red Dead Redemption just call him horse. If you want to call him horse, just fucking go whole hog, do you know what I mean? Like uh let's get on but uh yes. Um So yeah, that was kind of like that was the game to me. It was like, this is this is really good and Naughty Dog are really good at this and the cinematic presentation stuff is is like still fantastic and they sure show me some amazing environments, you know. Uh that was that was the the whole evolution of Uncharted was basically about that. It was about like first you're in the jungle and some ruins and then The second game's like, oh, you know, we've got like, you know, a a sort of like a lost city and then like a city under siege and all this kind of stuff. And then the third one's like, we're taking to the desert and The spectacle would just grow and grow and grow. And then here was this game that like it launched and it had all the spectacle like from day one basically. Like it was it arrived like uh content complete in a lot of ways. Um it was just gameplay wise I wanted it I wanted it to give a little bit more than it had, I suppose. So flipping focus of the TV show Matthew. I suppose before I ask you about what it what you think of it. Like what did you think when you heard they were making a TV show and specifically that they were getting Craig Mason who made Chernobyl um to team up with Neil Druckmann to write this TV show. How did you feel about the whole enterprise, the undertaking?

Matthew
30:14
Yeah, I like it makes sense from a kind of, you know, l license perspective. It's so massive that, you know, it it it has the kind of size to sustain a TV show. Um Again, Craig Mason felt like an a natural fit after Chernobyl just because it's sort of like doomed worlds and people working in very stressful situations, you know, it it Doesn't take a rocket scientist to sit you know link one to the other and see how you know someone who did one show could make this other show. Um Like, I'll be honest, I'm always nervous with like the involvement of original creators because I think that has what ha that that is what has sunk. lots of things in the past, you get the feeling that kind of like meddling or s you know, game studio involvement is what stops a lot of things from maybe kind of becoming the projects that they should be. They're a bit precious about them. But um maybe this is like the slight exception to that, or is turned out to be a slight exception to that you know, because the source material, you know, already draws so much on sort of television and film, you know, i you know, it the the person behind it is is very like pop culture aware. You know, this this isn't some, you know, distant stakeholder in Japan going, This character is important and the fans like this, you know, that's that is what has done for a lot of, you know you know, Resident Evil and Capcom related films and tie-ins, they're always this it f always feels they've sort of been filtered through this sort of layer of kind of bullshit. So yeah, like It it it all kinda made it all kinda made perfect sense. I mean, I you know, I I did think, you know, why bother when you've got something which is dramatically very satisfying as a c game. Uh you know, I didn't necessarily need you know I felt like I I'll just be watching scenes from the game again and that is true of the show. Like there's there's bits where they just lift dialogue wholesale and w when they're doing that, those are the moments I'm like Why why are we doing this? Like this doesn't this isn't adaptation, this is just uh repetition oh you know, it's just a clone, you know, it's it's like a uh a weird kind of sort of sort of cosplay version of the game. Um but you know it it has done other things too.

Samuel
32:30
Yeah, yeah, for sure. So yeah, so it's like so like I say, we're five episodes in. I've got a kind of sense of how you feel about this from what how what we've been talking about on Discord, like behind the scenes, and then also what you just said there. So Is it landing for you so far as a TV show? Is it working for you?

Matthew
32:47
Uh uh to be honest, it varies episode to episode, you know. I I I I am finding it very hard to untangle from the game, and so I f I find it's not a natural watching experience for me. You know, I'm not consuming it like I would any other show. I'm kind of constantly comparing, contrasting, it's always making me think about the game or think about other things and you know, which is kind of interesting in itself. Um I think the the problem I have with it, I think a story which was maybe sophisticated by video game terms is maybe not as sophisticated in the context of all television. And I watch a lot of television. And I feel like it's I feel like I've seen a lot of the beats, a lot of the drama before, and maybe it isn't working as well for me as it is other people because of that.

Samuel
33:38
Yep, I'm exactly the same. I think that like this the part so it's a facsimile like you, I agree. I look at it and go, why why does this exist exactly? Like what was the impetus for it beyond like a a great branding exercise or like a vanity project. Um I mean, but at the same time I'm kinda like, well, I know that there are people who will just simply never play the game, who will watch this TV show and might think it's good. But I agree with you. I think the the the big problem I think with this show for me is that there was never that much thematic depth to the first story. Uh to the f to the game's to the first game's story. It's a bit more like You know, it's got themes about parenthood, but I don't know if it's got loads more going on narrative narratively. Um loads more to say story-wise. And I don't think that's true of the second game. The second game's got a lot more meaty material to sink your teeth into um in a T V adaptation. But Yeah, it's sort of like it's leaving me a little bit cold in some ways, but um go on, sorry, go on.

Matthew
34:39
No, you can't you can't Well like you I I think it varies from episode to episode so

Samuel
34:44
You know, is this me being a grump and saying that like the you know, the gay relationship portrayed in episode three um between Bill and Frank, his partner, like it's not you know, it does not land for me at all. That's not true. I you know, I I admire the execution and I wouldn't I don't begrudge it, you know, not necessarily being related to like the main plot or anything. That's that's fine. It's like, you know, it was Fine in its own terms for sure. But when it like the next episode when it was just like bas that was basically episode four was basically like Ellie and Joel doing stuff they do in the game, I just completely zoned out.

Matthew
35:14
Um Yeah, I th I th I thought that was the worst one by distance.

Samuel
35:18
Um

Matthew
35:19
Though I actually quite liked episode five.

Samuel
35:21
Same, same. For a few reasons. So the reason I really like episode five is the one about the brothers, basically, who They've done they did something quite clever, I thought, which is they basically welded the bit in the game where they have the car crash and the bandits turn up. They kind of welded that storyline to the brothers' storyline. Like they they are kind of like interlinked. There is like a leader of that group who is looking um for like the older brother, um, for for reasons that you know you you you know you you find out in episode five. And that was a really good choice to me because it kind of linked together these like slightly disparate bits of the game where it's just, oh yeah, there's some bandits, and then you meet these two brothers and then you know, something bad happens. That's basically what happens in the game. Um but yeah the idea that it was l it was kind of interlinked and also the actors who played the brothers are really, really good. I like I just couldn't Couldn't begrudge it as a good bit of T V plus, it had a a rad set piece in it, I thought that wasn't in the game and actually quite quite impressed me. So is that what about you with episode five?

Matthew
36:15
Yeah, I I I I like that it deviated. I like that it it there was sort of finally a surprise in terms of like what happened in the story. I was kind of like, oh okay, I wasn't really expecting that. That was exciting. Um It's interesting you were saying about like comparing Last of Us Part One and Part Two where there's more meat on the bones. This to me almost felt like a bit of storytelling pulled more from part two. Right. Um, in that, you know Uh yeah. It's a bit of a both sides. It kind of puts uh a kind of character to the human aggressors, which doesn't happen in the game really ever, part one. Um and you know that isn't the most sophisticated point that you're meant to look at this and go, huh, you know, maybe they've got a different perspective on the action. Um But that kind of like opens up the show, makes it a bit more interesting. Um what what I'm I guess this leads on to a sort of broader point about something I uh I do like about the show is when it's additive and it's thinking about without spoiling the show for people and where it's going You know, the show there is a very important scene at the end of Last of Us, um, which I would say in the game sort of comes out of nowhere in that someone has to make a very big decision and it's kind of about what that decision is and and and kind of how how it comes about. And I think the TV show kind of see is sort seeding that a little bit better. I think it's spending a bit more time with other characters, other perspectives, and particularly other people who make big decisions or sudden decisions. You know, it's about Here are lots of other people who are put in a moment of incredible stress and how they react to it and that is sort of setting you up to kind of deal with a big decision which one of one of the other characters is gonna make at the end of the show. Um which to me does give the show like more of a through line. Hmm than maybe the game has. Um, I think it is one of the big successes of the show. And like weirdly, it's it's mostly attached to stuff that other people seem to hate. specifically makes me think of the opening to see episode two is this kind of um scene sort of flashback scene to Indonesia where basically the y uh a a kind of mushroom expert what's what's the term for that? Mike? Oh. I don't know. She's th th they they they say it loads in the show, but whatever. Mycolog Mycologist maybe? Or whatever. Okay. Um basically sees how sees the problem as it's emerging and you know, basically c concocks this plan to sort of firebomb the city is the only solution to it. And like that I thought was a really, you know I do think in hindsight you'd watch that scene once you finish the show, if the show ends the same way the game ends, and be like, you'd see the parallels there. I think you'd see the idea of like someone who sees something and has the Is it courage? Who knows, you know, as for you to decide to say like this is the thing, this is the terrible thing that must be done, and this is how you live with it, or this is how I'm gonna deal with it. And like that to me, that's that's the way this this sort I feel like the writers have kind of unlocked and kind of grown the show. Um, which is something I think they have needed to do, otherwise it would just be uh a very weird show if it if it was truer to the game.

Samuel
39:39
Yeah. Two episodes in I was really flagging. I was like, oh right, am I gonna be able to keep watching this to even make a Podcast about it. Like I was really impressed by how they've aesthetically recreated the game. Like it looks like the game, like in terms of colour palette and you know the the scale of it is really impressive. It looks like a proper blockbuster TV show. But Like as a HBO show, I found it weirdly weightless and like kind of throw like a throwaway kind of action um adventure show or something, like just with some horror elements. Like I just Like I wasn't um you know, I think people were like, Oh wow, John Hanna man blew me away in that intro sequence in the uh T V studio and I was like, Yeah, you know, it's Uh it doesn't really add anything for me. It's just like it's almost like we just we're papering a bit more texture on top of something that's not really there. But like um I do agree that that second that second episode intro was was was really strong.

Matthew
40:29
Um Yeah, it it's it's quite weird. I've been I've been for like the first time ever. I I don't normally consume accompanying podcasts to shows. and things. Yeah. Like that it's not really how you know, I I watch so much TV, the idea of like doing that would be mad. Apart from I did listen to the ringers episodes about uh winning time. Did you really? Uh yeah I did, yeah, I listened to all of them because I wanted to know like from people who understood sports and knew the LA Lakers, like how accurate the show was. I was I was genuinely interested in the connections between reality and the fiction of that show.

Samuel
41:00
Amazing. You watching Winning Time is like a dark chapter in your TV watching life, I thought.

Matthew
41:05
Oh, it was good. It's a good show. Okay. But like I liked watching it and then listening to the the ring it was on their prestige TV podcast. But I've I've found I found that side of things a much harder hang for this because I I think it's like merely fine, but because it's like a phenomenon show I don't think and maybe this is me being unfair or condescending here, like no one wants to no like it's almost like it's the current like pop culture cash cow Um like no one's gonna dunk on it. So people have kind of gone the other way where they're treating it with like so much reverence and respect and they're kind of like What an amazing turn from that guy who put a can in a bin. And you're like, not really. I mean like you know, like that it's mad, you know. And people are like really powerful stuff from this Indonesian actress at the start of episode two. It's like I like that scene, but I like, you know, this isn't like fucking James Gandolfini and the Sopranos here, you know. Yeah. shorter recaps as part of the Ringers Watch podcast. Right. Uh which is their weekly TV thing anyway. And like they're both very like the games are not for me, dog, you know. Yeah. And I kind of appreciate that about them. But I I am what what does interest me and why I said maybe that last point might sound a bit condescending, is that outside of the gaming bubble, loads of people legitimately love and rate this show.

Samuel
42:30
Yeah.

Matthew
42:30
And TV critics who do have a full diet of TV and quality TV. That's what I don't quite understand, because I'm like, you don't think this is as good as X, surely? Like, you've seen X, you know that it's better than this. Um that but uh that you know We'll just have to agree to disagree, me and the watch.

Samuel
42:51
Yeah, I I really like those guys. I I enjoy their uh they've got I I say it's probably the the closest to this podcast in energy, that podcast. It's a bit um it's quite anarchic and weird and like one of them doesn't have time to watch TV, which is quite funny as well. But um yeah, they they just sort of like when they do talk about games I'm like I'm kinda like watching my it's like listening to my dad try and explain, you know, explain it a little bit and like That's what that's where I'm gonna I'm with you. It's like the if you watch all this other stuff, how can you possibly think this is like top tier? Now I'm not saying this is a bad TV show, it's not, but and I and I do think It would be better if I hadn't played the game and I watched this TV show wholesale. Like I say, my dad's watching it. He's having a great time. He's not even considering playing the game because he's got too much saboteur to play as established. But um but like yeah it just it d it fundamentally lacks something that satisfies me about HBO shows. Like it's actually weird that this is I'm not saying that all HBO shows should be the same, but I do think that maybe this represents like how that network is steered slightly more towards franchising things. But if you compare it as an adaptation to like Watchmen as an adaptation, you know what I mean? Like there's so much going on in Watchmen. And like, you know, and uh it's like real-world kind of like, you know, racial themes that are like, you know, I'm not saying the last of us should tackle, but It has like but has more going on besides that. It's like it's got things to say about like law and order and and like you know who gets to uh define history and like you know Um, that sort of thing. And so I I think like it's weird to see it's maybe I think maybe seeing this and then House of the Dragon last year, is it sort of makes me think, oh, are we kind of slightly more in like the We have to make blockbuster TV shows now, and it doesn't matter if we sacrifice a l tiny bit of intellect in order to do that, you know? Is that too cynical?

Matthew
44:33
N no, I I sort of uh you know, I wouldn't say it's like game over or anything for HBO. I think they're still also making the the White Lotus. Succession. Succession we oversee. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the Watchman one's interesting actually. I didn't really think about that. That's that's a show that's like a lot more in conversation with the source material. This is like a lot more beholden to it. Um but and and it's sort of a shame 'cause I do think where the show is more successful is where they've added to it or like moved it along a little bit. You know, I I I think the way that they have tackled the fundamental problem that that this is a show about two people going from A to B and every once in a while they meet someone who dies so that that person doesn't continue with them A to B. Because that is the structure of the game. Like In the show, this could have very easily been a show where every week they meet someone who dies at the end of the episode. Like in my head, that's what this show is gonna be. And uh you know, it was basically gonna be episode two again and again and again, with like Oh, there's Anatorf. Bye Anator, you know, and and and so like what they did with episode three changing the Bill storyline to make his whole storyline sort of separate from theirs, gets around that problem, which I thought was interesting. And then in episode four and five, adding in the kind of bandits to make the world you know, w w whatever name we're giving those c that collective. Not bandits, rebels, I guess. like opens that world, makes it feel like a fuller place outside of just Ellie and Joel and that's that's really the task of the show is to like make it distract from the fact that it the source material is fundamentally about the same two people leaving lots of other people behind. Um so yeah I'm I'm you know Kind of like juries out on like how they deliver that the rest of it. I mean I would say based on what they've done so far They have some juicy material to play with in the later episodes. You know, like they're gonna do Left Behind as an episode, apparently. Which is which will be a nice character beat amongst it. The stuff with Tommy feels like that could be, you know, an interesting character moment. I I thought they were gonna be more Tommy sort of earlier in the show, you know, because they 'cause the actor's good and they introduced him so much in the first episode and you know, I thought, oh well that's w probably where the interesting drama is in this is is kind of what goes on with that community. So you know, I I You know, I it'd a bit lame just to go wait and see until the last episode. But um I have I've definitely liked where they've broken away and it makes me wish they'd sort of broken away a bit more.

Samuel
47:14
I like that too. It th what what kind of like what concerns me slightly about the rest of the season is this I think it's a nine episode first season. Um I was just looking it up in the background there. So You've got four episodes left. They've got to do Left Behind, right? That's got to be an episode in itself. You've got to do Meeting Tommy. Let's say that's like one episode, you know. Um, but it could have been two. And they gotta do the entire winter section of the game, which is the best bit of the game, I would say. Um, and that's got a lot going on. That would be a lot to do in one episode, I think. And they've got to do the finale, which is, you know, when they do or don't reach the uh their destination, let's say. So That feels quite crammed in actually. You know what I mean? Like it's it's not quite it's not quite enough story to to do to do two seasons. But it might be too much to do in one season as well as it could be, you know

Matthew
48:05
Yeah.

Samuel
48:06
Like and to convey the sense of a journey. Like it's weird thinking they are already more than halfway through their journey from what we've seen. And it doesn't feel like it's really it's like it's really just started, you know what I mean? So

Matthew
48:16
Yeah.

Samuel
48:16
Yeah. I'm sort of curious to see where it goes from there. I'll tell you another thought that occurred to me actually, Matthew, as well. I wonder if this applied to you too, but I feel like if I'd w if this had come out sort of like, I don't know, uh eight or nine years ago, I feel like I would really have appreciated the fact that games were being legitimized in this way where s pe where people were spending this much money and casting such, you know, amazing actors in this in this show that was treated seriously and like you say You know, uh free of the clutches of Paul W. S. Anderson to be like, you know, a a a not terrible um piece of like video game ephemera. But but now I feel like I I'm too old to care about that side of things, you know? I don't care if someone adapts a game well into a TV short film. It's not It's not important to me to see games get that level of legitimacy now. Do do you have a sense of that too? Like is is that maybe feeding into the slight, you know Yeah.

Matthew
49:14
Yeah, I uh I have like no chip on my shoulder about how games are perceived, you know. I've never been embarrassed to like games. I've li I like them on their own terms. If anything, you know, I I don't like the way that games have had to like appropriate the kind of behavior of other pop culture to be seen as legitimate, which is arguably what The Last of Us is. it kind of behaves like, you know, a a long form T V show and, you know, f to me you know Yeah, it's about as far from like Married Galaxy as you can get, you know. You know, you're not running around on giant bits of fruit and in HBO show, that's for sure. Um, for shame. Um so yeah, I yeah, I I don't really worry about that. I know I get why I it's very, very hard to work out what people actually think online because a lot of it is kind of like playing to the crowd. Because I know that a lot of game players do think like that and do have that chip on their shoulder. So kind of like getting really excited about something that feels quote unquote legitimate makes perfect sense. You know that that's just that's just smart website business that's just giving people what they want to hear. Um w y but like if in your heart of hearts do do you actually think that? I you know, I certainly don't.

Samuel
50:28
Yeah. Yeah, it's just ri it's just interesting. I just thought, oh that's where I'm that's where there's maybe a disconnect between me and this entire enterprise is that I in my imagined days would have been invested in the idea of someone taking these things seriously. And now I don't care. Like I just it just It doesn't mean anything to me that there's a God of War TV show coming. Like, I loved Norco last year. I don't need like the Richard Link later version of Norco as a film. You know what I mean? Like I just just don't do it. I just So yeah, this there's that side of things too. It's a weird one. It's the it's like a very rare example of a TV show people have gone like bananas for where I just don't I don't quite see it. That like I've that very rarely happens for me. You know, I watch something that's on like the best of like year endless and I'm all in. And it it feels like knowing so much about games has just like made this murky for me in a way that's quite Surprising and strange. I feel like I'm on the outside looking in for the first time with TV, you know what I mean? Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Kinda weird. I need to watch winning time instead, clearly. Um so Matthew, uh okay, one question Ashley. Like what do you think of um Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey i in these roles? Does that is that working for you?

Matthew
51:33
Yeah, though weirdly there's not been much of them, you know? Yeah. Um because because they have broken away from the game to spend time with like Bill and Frank for a whole episode you know, or um cutting away to the rebels or um Henry and Sam in the recent episodes. Like that they're you know, they are the leads, but They're not the leads in the way they are in the game, um, which I I think feels like a deliberate steer away from it feeling too video gamey. You know, the sections where But if you if you even get twenty minutes of them in a row, kind of like scavenging in a in a petrol station and repeating their dialogue from the game, my mind begins to wander a little bit and go, Ugh, this is a bit video gamey. And like I have seen, you know, people who who haven't played the games, you know, like on The Watch, they will often say, oh, this particular scene, that felt like a video game scene. Like, here is the objective we have to get here. Here is the obstacle, an obstacle is in our path. And they're right, that like the things they're picking up on are literally lifted wholesale from the from the games. Um so that makes perfect sense. So like Y yeah, they're good. Um, like I'm not so precious about the the the original game that I can't see other people playing these roles Like he's they are different, like but like um Joel in particular is like uh I feel like Pedro Pascal plays him like a lot sadder and wounded. than he is in the game. I think you know, just d you talk a lot more in the game. You know, Joel's constantly mattering away and there's a lot more banter. He's maybe frosty in that banter, but he's he's you know, he's just a lot more of a verbal presence where in the show he you know, uh there's a g a much greater distance between him and Ellie it seems. She's maybe closer to how I how I sort of perceive Ellie, I guess.

Samuel
53:26
That's interesting. I sort of like the other thing it threw into sharp relief for me is that like I while I understand the sort of um what the Gield and Ellie relationships function is, I don't know if like that ever really like massively landed for me as a dynamic. Um and like that's in in the game or the show. In the game. Um and this this show maybe spotlighted that for me. I was like, do I How invested was I in that dynamic? Not in like the actual beats of the story. Like I was invested in that because I was invested in each character individually. But how much did the interplay between those characters matter to me? Um, because it's this very gradually it's this gradually growing relationship, isn't it? It's you know, surrogate relationship. There is closeness there, but for some reason it just never spoke to me on that fundamental level of like, oh, I'm so invested in like these two and how they behave to towards each other and things like that.

Matthew
54:17
So it's it's well done. Like I've got I've I I think I appreciate the craft more of of how they kind of seed stuff and maybe this is from watching too many kind of GDC talks from naughty dog writers about the way that they kind of evolve relationships through kind of like in-game patter, you know, th the the the art to it I find probably more interesting than than maybe the kind of like emotional design of it. Um it's it's the way that you know you obviously have these big beats in cutscenes where you're locked into watching two people have like a very scripted acted moment. Um, but they also kind of like chart that growing relationship in the everyday kind of like It barks, you know, it it it's it's there in the you know not just the hey we need to get a ladder to solve this puzzle. throughout. Um and I I really I'm really into that sort of uh the sort of artistry of that. Right. Um but that's that's the you know it's just a a pot a place where it's kinda hard to unplug your I'm interested in games and how people make games, which I do struggle with playing games. You know, it's quite I I find it quite hard to play anything. Just as a purely emotional being, I guess.

Samuel
55:50
Oh right, yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. I I feel like I'm such a fucking grump when I say that, because it sounds like I just don't appreciate the hard work they put into it. I do. But for some re some reason they're just like the dynamic between those characters, you know, it's sort of like I get it, but I du it doesn't like speak to me on some deeper emotional level. I don't know why, it just doesn't. Um anyway, so yeah, but uh anyway, yes, it's uh I do sound too grumpy about this. Um the TV the TV show is fine And I I like the first game just fine. Um but I am curious to know where this is all going. So I do agree actually that like uh I like Bella Ramsey, but I'm really curious to know what's gonna happen when this show tries to tackle material from the second game in subsequent seasons, which they said they're doing. It's already been renewed for season two. I think they originally said season two would be, you know, part two. And now I think they're like, oh, actually it might be like two seasons doing part two, which I would say is wise given how long the game is. So How do you think this is gonna work, Matthew? Like, do you think it's gonna thrive in having part two to adapt off the back of this? Is this almost like a prologue season to what's to come, do you think?

Matthew
56:58
Maybe. I like Part two, as I remember it, I think is like better set up for conventional TV storytelling. You know, it has more of a ensemble cast, it has like this smaller time frame, it's a lot more like tighter geographical focus, you know, it's not this a cross country kind of trek. A lot of stuff kind of happens with sort of two intertwining timelines. Um, which feels like, you know, just to have those people close together, that's how l uh you know, a lot more TV works. I also think season two, like the kind of creature feature element of it with all the zombies is like less important. It's it's more specifically about the kind of human drama between these characters, which this is too, but this game's also part one is setting up the world and there's a lot you know, there's a lot of i The zombies feel like more sort of front and centre, where they're more of a kind of like background threat in part two. So it feels like a meteor thing to get their teeth into. Whether they like f like because you know there's a bit of a time jump and whether they kind of fill in that gap with something or feel the desire to fill in. Like I I think there are stories to be told in that gap which I wouldn't object to. Yeah. Yeah. It's I I have like bigger problems with part two story story, I think. Um I think we almost flip a little bit on how we feel about part one and part two.

Samuel
58:25
Yeah.

Matthew
58:25
I I think that's true.

Samuel
58:26
What why is that, do you think? Like what's the what also how why does it appeal to me in a way it doesn't to you? I don't know.

Matthew
58:31
I don't know. Like I I completely get your point about part two like deals with a lot more. There's a there's a lot of chewy stuff, but I think it part two sort of s sort of central thesis, you know, which is revenge bad and like the extent it kind of goes to to like show you that. Yeah, I don't know. I d I like I I I I almost f I almost feel like part two is kind of two games at once and Both those games make the same point and for for the second half of that game I felt like oh I've you know like I get it. It was kind of my overall feeling and Yeah, I just didn't think it was uh hugely subtle despite being a more complex work.

Samuel
59:14
I think that's true. I th one thing I will say about the the revenge bad point is that like It's the most like revenge has ever been like I think like viscerally sort of like like palpable to you as a player. Like the notion of why you're doing it and like what the consequences are and like Your sort of hunger to see that revenge play out is like I think it's quite relentless as a player, and I think that's that's something that the game just does really well. It provokes you. into feeling that way. And like that that just like uh yeah that that just really worked for me for for whatever reason. Um yeah and like there's just moments in it that are truly nasty where I'm like I know this is bad, but it feels good. And like that's that's okay. Well it is it is succeeding on that level then. Um and also the other thing is the other key thing I'll say about what I like about two versus one And I think the TV show actually echoes some of these problems. Is that the world building for what has happened to Earth, like in the midst of this Cordyceps outbreak? It's not that interesting. It's like the government turned on its people and it's totalitarian and then there are like some outsiders, outsider human factions. That's it. That's the world. Like that could just be the Walking Dead, and it's exactly the same, really. It's not It's not that innovative. But the second one is a bit more like um there is kind of a civil war element and like ideological warfare and like these quite fucked up post-apocalyptic leaders and stuff. And I think that that is meatier and more interesting. Um that's where I think two appeals to me, Matthew. I think it just everything that one does on a superficial level, I think two just deepens. Um from like the themes to like the how much detail is in the story to obviously the environments you see, but also the gameplay. The gameplay is much more expansive. So that's why I prefer to, I think. It's just like One is like a taste of what Naughty Dog can do. Two is like this is our attempt at a masterpiece, you know?

Matthew
01:01:01
So Yeah. It's just it It's just to it's just too bleak for T V. If you did it like blow for blow, I think y uh the end of two is just it's so hard going. Yeah. Like it really wears you down. And you're right about like you know, there's something exciting about how how provocative it is in places. But I I wonder if it would just be like too grueling. It kind of has its misery cake and eats it. That's the problem I have by the end of it. You know, like I c I f I feel like I would have learnt the same lesson if that game stopped halfway through. But, you know, maybe that is maybe that is what's interesting about it. I was rereading some uh reviews of Last of Us 2 and it was quite interesting to see if find a few negative ones where people are Th a lot of people who don't like it, it's cause they they like hate. They like hate the game in terms of what it does for the story and it's it's such an emotional reaction they've had to it. you know, like they almost can't sort of forgive the game itself in a way for some of the th things it does. And you're like, well that is kind of what this game's about You can't disagree with the premise of the story, you know, like Yeah, like it's like yes, I believe the emotion you're feeling is the emotion it wants you to feel. Is that you're incredibly cross and disappointed about some of the stuff that happens in the game because th you know, spoiler that the people in the game are too. So yeah, but I'm but but you must save that like Just in terms of like headcount, part two feels like more traditionally like TV friendly.

Samuel
01:02:35
It it does, yeah. And that's where I almost think, oh was this created with some kind of adaptation in mind, you know what I mean? Um Right. I feel like it's almost like Did a switch get um turned like back, you know, back at Sony HQ where they were like, okay, our blockbusters now have to be so long. And so all-encompassing, see also God of War Ragnarok and um Horizon Forbidden West, that like what was like a 10-hour game is now like a 20 or 30 hour game. Like are we Is that where we're kind of investing our money into making these stories just feel bigger and bigger and bigger? I think pacing is something you can hold against it, Matthew, and I think you probably do, right? You think it's too long that game? Um Yeah, yeah, but about like six to eight hours. Yeah. Yeah, not a short period of time. Um but the thing the thing I keep wondering with it is can Bella Ramsey pull that material off? Because I like her. I like her fine. But it she'll need to like the amount she'll need to shoulder as a lead in this show is a lot. And I don't know if so far I've seen like the capability of someone who could bring a lot of the life to that that it needs. And I'm not saying that she's bad. Um I think she's very good at portraying this version of Ellie. But that version of Ellie is might take a bit another dimension. What do you think?

Matthew
01:03:53
Yeah, but I maybe them having to like meet her as an actor halfway will make that work in a way that it maybe didn't for me in the game. You know, maybe actually that's what it needs to be its own thing on the TV show. You know, it's it's cha you know, the changes they've made to kind of fit their performers You know, the the people in the game don't exist in real life. You know, they've they've been made by a team of engineers to kind of craft these these people who look exactly as they look to get the emotional reaction they want to get out of you. And the idea of like an actual human having to kind of perform it and be that person, like, will probably kind of sort soften it a bit. Yeah, like Yeah, I if anything I think it could I I think it could be more effective for it being her, you know, because it's very very hard to see how this character now could be that character in part two But maybe that's the interesting like acting exercise, isn't it? It's kind of like if they can get her to that point or get you to a point where you believe that about her, um, that would be like a very effective bit of performance. Um I'm excited to see them try for sure.

Samuel
01:05:04
Yeah. like the start of it mimicked in the TV show and like how the real world reacts to that, that'll be um that'll be quite fun. But that might be that actually might seem more conventional to people who have been watching recent TV, so who knows.

Matthew
01:05:19
Yeah, I mean that yeah.

Samuel
01:05:21
That's like the oldest trick in the book, isn't it? Very much so. Okay Matthew, I think that's enough TV show chatter. Shall we take a quick break and come back to talking about the uh the actual PS5 remake of the game somewhat?

Matthew
01:05:31
Yeah, let's let's do it.

Samuel
01:05:50
Welcome back to the podcast. So after a very cautious semi-dunking of the TV show, we're gonna talk a bit more about the last one's game.

Matthew
01:05:57
Uh semi-dunking.

Samuel
01:05:59
Well it was I think it was a fair assessment from people who are like Not all in on the Kool-Aid. Right? Like that's post-apocalyptic HBO show that both of us loved last year. And that just that has loads more going on thematically than The Last of Us does. So that's maybe at work a little bit as well with us.

Matthew
01:06:20
You know, we've seen something very recently that's better.

Samuel
01:06:23
So yeah.

Matthew
01:06:23
Yeah. That's the problem. I've just got too I've got too much pop culture in my head. I can just see the thing, you know, the things where people are like like even the Bill and Frank episode Nice bit of TV. No it's not bad by any means, but like i i the bits of it really reminded me of the um there was that film Supernova with Stanley Tucci and Colin Colin Firth. Alright. where they're like a kind of gay couple basically dealing with one of them is is is um sort of succumbing to sort of dementia. and dealing with what they're gonna do kind of end of life and how they kind of manage that. And when you've watched something very kind of harrowing like that L like t the TV version almost felt like a sort of fast forward version of something I'd already seen. Yeah. Um which isn't the TV show's fault. It's just my frame of reference is cracked because of what I've watched elsewhere.

Samuel
01:07:13
See see also Pixars up. uh the intro to that.

Matthew
01:07:16
And yeah, and they did it in like fucking two minutes.

Samuel
01:07:19
Yeah, the the best two minutes of the film, but yeah.

Matthew
01:07:22
It's like uh yeah anyway That's fine. Like I'm not gonna dunk on it. Come on, let's not we let's not drag the semi-dunking into part two. No, no, no.

Samuel
01:07:31
Okay, so Matthew, you've been ri- revisiting this game on PS5. I must admit I've been a bit cautious about picking it up. It's quite expensive. But it does seem like it's had quite a facelift. So have have you enjoyed going back to it? What what's your impression of it so far?

Matthew
01:07:45
Yeah, I have. Um I've I've not played the game since it originally came out. Um like I say I've been playing it like alongside the show, so that maybe gives it a little bit more like novelty beyond it just existing. Um And I've really enjoyed the direct comparisons and and like some of the kind of Easter egg stuff where you realize actually like the end of the show, it one thing it does do really well is it kind of pulls lots of stuff quite subtly from the games without like forefronting it in an embarrassing way. Um which which I like. Um, you know, like clothes choices or like weird props in the background things, and you're like, oh yeah, that this is like uh uh like a love letter to the show, and and that that seems really legit. It's also quite funny seeing like the how video gamey it is in places. You know, I I said earlier about some of the characters, you know, and you meet them and they just serve such a kind of mechanical purpose that it's quite hard to kind of not see that but just lines where like objectives are said or given are so different to how the sort of show works. You know, there's there's scenes in this which I remember being really deep and then actually it's just Basically someone going, let's go to that water tower and someone going, yep. Um which is you know just a bit eye-opening I guess. Um but yeah, as a as an actual f as an actual like r uh remake rather than remaster. Um like it's a it's a really beautiful thing and It it takes one of the great strengths of the game, which is the kind of the world reclaimed by nature, and does that a lot more justice graphically than the original could. you know, there's something about those buildings covered in like ivy and all the leaves are like fluttering in the wind and all the kind of weird kind of grass and bushes that kind of you know, push out the way when you walk past them and uh the the amazingly reflective puzzles, you know, it's it's a real um it it it's definitely, you know, graphically beautiful and, you know, one of the best things or one of Naughty Dog's strengths is that kind of almost like pornographic eye for detail where things get r you know every mine everything kind of reacts exactly as it should and there's there's just a hun you know, it's a game of like a million neat little touches. and, you know, with more tech and more know how they've only gotten better at that and seeing that kind of layer to it. So, you know, when you're going through water and seeing all the kind of pond scum dispersing around you and stuff, you know, if if you're into naughty dogs tech thing, uh, which I definitely am. This this game has like loads of that. That's probably like the level it speaks to me like most on, rather than any kind of major mechanical like overhaul. Like I'm not reassessing it as a as a piece of design.

Samuel
01:10:36
Is it like largely the same mechanics wise as it was?

Matthew
01:10:39
Is it basically untouched in that respect? Just based on memory, you know, you think Oh, this is actually how Uncharted uh this is how The Last of Us Part 2 was, but then, you know, I boosted that up and played a little bit and and then you realise you know, the characters control quite differently. Like they're they're a lot faster on their feet. Um you've got like a lot more evasive options in um part two venue have here and suddenly going back to it you begin to see the kind of like PS3 bones a little a little bit more. Like you know there's there's nicer animations. There's a lot of like sort of everything they've added, it's nothing that would affect the kind of core game and how it unfolds. Um it's more little sort of side details that you might kind of catch, little fi extra physics objects or things like that. You know, it's It's kind of cute, unnecessary touches. I guess like the the big gulf is that part two is a like a much fuller stealth game than this one is. And you definitely feel that like you can see sort of underneath the amazing textures and particle effects and lighting You can see the like the PS3 limitations of like the size of the areas and how the world is like partitioned into a lot of corridors and rooms. Like Uh that stuff's f quite hard to hide.

Samuel
01:12:01
Yeah, that's interesting. I think it's like the sort of um the PS3 bones thing was kind of inevitable. Um I think like it's What I found revisiting this game, not in the uh part one kind of like remake they did, but in the remaster they did on PS4, um like just a couple of years ago. is that like this game is a lot shorter than you might remember it is. We s we sped through it. Um it just s it's so fast. And I think that like you just don't have that sort of skill curve and excitement curve necessarily that I think that like Uncharted did a little bit better with the terms of the escalation. And I think the second game escalates in such a great way because like you say you've got so many the character feels better to move to move around and like you have so many different tactical options and the Environments are a lot larger for the most part. So you have these kind of like stealth sandboxes basically, like um similar to how Uncharted 4 would kind of like redraw its canvas of like how it would do combat. Um And so it's quite quite interesting. I think it's like yeah, it it's got it's got like some limits, but um that I've got to say uh watching a bunch of it yesterday for this podcast, I was like pretty amazed by the length of detail. It's like Yeah.

Matthew
01:13:21
Yeah, yeah, and you you feel like you know, p part of its reason for existing is probably like str you know, stretching the muscles of certain teams that aren't ready to work on the next game yet. You know, it's It's probably a convenient like you don't need to design it per se, you know, it's it's take this pre-made thing and and give everyone something to do to kind of sort you know, bring it up to that standard and so I I I kind of get that. It seems to happen a lot these days. I remember the the when the coalitions before they worked on um gears for they did the the Gears of War One remake and the idea was to kind of like getting to know you new hardware and tech. So I imagine that's that's kind of where it's coming from. Um yeah and and l like I say I th you know the the the that level of detail is part of like Naughty Dog's appeal, you know, like it you know, they're they're the kind of company kind of like you know, dot every I and cross every T when it comes to these things and there's there's pleasure in kind of luxuriating in in that stuff. Um But but there there definitely are moments where you look at a space and you're like, that is a PS3 ass l bit of level design. Like Just the waist high cover and like the l the the layout of it, the structure of it and how the room looks and works, you can just sort of see it. You know, often from a distance you're like, Oh well I can see, well that's gonna be a combat encounter right there. And I think the second game sort of hides that stuff a bit better. I mean it still has the quite kind of delineated um divide between you know, this is exploration and this is combat. Um but it's it's a lot more explicit here.

Samuel
01:15:04
Yeah, for sure. Um I was curious like on that along those lines. I was wondering if you agree with me on this. The PS4 era I think it represents this massive leap in the quality of gameplay mechanics for Naughty Dog over the Pierce 3 era. I mean I've always enjoyed their games, give or take, Jack 2 Renegade, which was a controversial opinion on this podcast, weirdly, me not liking that game. It was just a your vehicles blew up too quickly, that was the the whole thing. But like this was I think like with Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us Part 2. It's the first time that their gameplay mechanics have been best in class. Everything else has always been great, the cinematic presentation, the visual, sound design, all that stuff. They are amazing at. But I would never have argued that like Uncharted was a better shooter than Gears was, for example. Like I knew it wasn't. I knew it was like slightly slightly worse, slightly more frustrating, um yeah, never quite as good. Um and like The Last of Us I I was curious if you felt the the same kind of like leap in Gameplay mechanics had happened on PS4 for Naughty Dog, and where you think like the original Last of Us falls in relation to that? Like, do you think this is the start of them becoming really good at gameplay mechanics or like, you know, uh deepening their gameplay mechanics beyond just like shooting galleries in Uncharted? Or do you think that this is like This like you say it's got some PS3 vestiges in it, it feels like it's trapped in its generation a little bit.

Matthew
01:16:26
Yeah, uh I I definitely agree about the PS4 thing, I think. Yeah, like Uncharted 4 particularly and then The Last of Us Part 2 have um yeah they they they like move things along and they feel like a lot more sort of sophisticated there's the Everything gets a bit more sort of sandboxy in terms of the the environment design can be like you know it's big enough you've got the tech to do their level of graphical fidelity at that kind of size but also combined with like slightly better AI, which they have bought into this to uh to be fair, um part one has slightly sharper enemies. The combat in Uncharted 4 and Part 2 has like a lot more sort of sp spontaneity to it. It feels like you have this big kind of toolkit of like weapons, stealth moves, environmental things you can use and you can kind of stitch that into a a bit m more of a sort of improvised kind of approach to things, there's less of that here. Like there there are a few kind of systemic kind of tools, you know, like the you know, the fact that that that sound and vision plays a part and you can sort of throw stuff around to distract guards and the the stealth rules seem like a little clearer than maybe the the kind of whatever, passed for stealth in like Uncharted, you know, one, two, and three. Like, it's I I'd say it's a step towards the PS4 without quite crossing the line, but I I don't know if that's Almost deliberate, like I think th the tricky thing about the Last of Us stealth in particular is that almost Like i i I I don't feel like it was designed to be played as a really precise stealth game where you can like ghost your way through, say. You know, to me it it f it feels like it it's sort of designed to go wrong and escalate on purpose because they want you dealing with that moment where everything goes wrong and uh actually to your point about it it being a much shorter game, like I'm definitely making faster progress second time through because when I played it originally I would often Often if I got spotted or it went wrong, I would just reset the checkpoint and kept trying to do it again and again, trying to perfect it. And I don't really know if that's what the game is about. Like I feel like It wants you to get into those kind of scrabbling, desperate escapes where you're smashing people with like bits of stick and you you know, you're using the last couple of bullets you have, you have to nail those last two headshots or you're fucked. Like, I think actually that is the game's sweet spot. That's where they want you. Um if you're very carefully kind of like using bottles to sort of shepherd everyone into sort of safe shiving zones Like you can do that, but that isn't like the tone of this world. No. And part two does a much better job of like putting you into like situations where I I I guess like y you can't hide but you it's more like predatory, it's like fast, it's like it's it's like aggressive stealth where this is more like sort of normal stealth that kind of turns into sort of um sort of surprise messy action every once in a while. So like you know That is to say, I think they're doing it on purpose, but it because of that, it doesn't feel like it has the definitely doesn't feel like it has the depth of those PS4 games.

Samuel
01:19:51
Yeah. The the second one I think is designed It is truly designed to like pull in both directions, I think. However way you want to go with it. I think it's like it's designed to be more be more playable in that respect. I think what The Last of Us is good at tricking you into thinking is that, oh, I can't go all out action because I'll run out of resources and won't be able to progress in the game. But the game is so there's so clearly a hand at work in the background making sure you never run out of stuff.

Matthew
01:20:16
That's yeah. And once you know that, it kind of like unlocks playing that game at a much faster pace. Cause you're like, you know Fundamentally, I know Naughty Dog want me to get through this game and get to the end because they want me to enjoy their story. Yeah. So they're never gonna leave me high and dry. They may be leave me a bit more stressed at times. Um, but I really like like sat on all my supplies the first time I played it. I I barely engaged with anything. Um and this time I'm just like fucking Molotovs left, right, and centre. I'm just dropping nail bombs on anyone, like it's absolutely fine and you know, maybe I could play it on like the hardest difficulty and and that economy will feel slightly different. But um I think that's like I don't know, it fits the characters that that hit Joel is like quite aggressive force in that game.

Samuel
01:21:04
Yeah. Well certainly the TV show, he's not doing a lot of stealth, is he? No No. Um so yeah, yeah. I think that's um I think that's a fair point. Yeah, I yeah, I think you're I think you're right. I think there are like hints at where that additional mechanical sophistication will come from in the PS4 era for the naughty dog games, but it's not it's not quite that. Um yet it is yeah is yeah it is a step along from where the PS3 Uncharted were. So Yeah, really interesting. Um uh not as gory as part two.

Matthew
01:21:32
And I wonder if that's deliberate, like tone a tonal choice, you know, rather than like an engine choice, because You know, in two you're really meant you're like brutalizing people basically and like limbs are coming off and if you shoot people they like die. It takes them quite a long time to die. It's not very nice. And this like limbs don't come off as much. They've you know they've definitely upped it from the original, but I I almost I'd be interested to know what their thought process was in terms of like You know, how far can we push like our Gore Tech without changing like the m the message or tone of part one compared to part two?

Samuel
01:22:09
Yeah, because yeah, it's like is part one meant to be slightly more of a kind of like hero's journey? Are you meant to see Joel as a hero until the game flips and subverts that? Or you know what I mean? Like there's that element to it.

Matthew
01:22:21
People aren't like You know, they're not like crying as they die in this game. They're not lying on the floor holding their wounds being like, fucking cold, and you're like, oh fuck, this is horrible.

Samuel
01:22:31
I was playing Hotline Miami 2 on my PSV ser Yeah Um like I think the NPCs and the second one would refer to each other by name as well sometimes. I think that was Yeah, yeah. So yeah, much more attention paid to that. Obviously they looked so realistic that it was um Properly nasty. But yeah, I do wonder if it's meant to be like, oh, this is a slightly more blockbuster-y first chapter, um, and then a second it's meant to feel like adult but also but the second one's the one where it's like it it's about humans. It's not about clickers. It's about what humans do to each other in a very specific way, you know.

Matthew
01:23:07
Do you remember that quote where like Neil Dropman says Part one was about love and part two is about hate.

Samuel
01:23:13
Okay.

Matthew
01:23:14
Uh and you're like, what a bleak thing to like spend five years doing.

Samuel
01:23:19
Yeah, it's yeah, it's tough. I've I'm glad for that studio that they got to basically finish the game before the pandemic happened because that would have been like the bleakest game to work on in the pandemic times, the last of us part two.

Matthew
01:23:33
Foley guy, and you're like, how do I make these dog wound noises in my own home?

Samuel
01:23:38
Crispy dog dot wav, uh yeah. Um yeah, yeah. So Yeah, I was sort of like I was playing it with my uh my ex at the time and she was very frustrated by how like angry I was getting with the stealth situations where it was just going wrong. I was like, Well, why are we even bothering to do stealth when I can just shoot my way out of this? And like You're right, you are supposed to see the game on that level, but I still have the, you know, Metal Gear Solid part of my brain that does want to kind of like master this stuff. The time jumps in this game are are are so profound that the game the story does move along, feels like it's moving along, but it's such a clip. And then it's kind of just over very suddenly. So where are you up to in the game, Matthew? Can we talk about story stuff?

Matthew
01:24:15
Uh yeah, well I'm up to where we're at in the show. Okay. Um so actually I'm I'm I'm not quite at the end of it. I'm doing the uh like bandit stuff in Pittsburgh, which I think but is that does that become Kansas City in the TV show?

Samuel
01:24:31
Uh yes, I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthew
01:24:33
Yeah. So I yeah, it's kind of weird because like When I watched the show I thought, oh this is quite different. Uh that was it's it's the stretch of the game I probably remember the least. And when you play the game and you're like Uh you know how it all kicks off, how they get ambushed, even like the shop they crash into and like in some ways like the layout of the shop and like some of the props and things are exactly as they are in the game. Like it's quite spooky. Yeah, it's it's pretty like amazing like how how close the show is to it. Um so yeah, I'm I'm I'm fighting bandits, which I must prefer admit is like I kind of prefer that mode of the game to fighting the clickers. Um 'cause uh you know, again by design I I always found I found the rules of like what they can and can't hear or how they are or aren't gonna react. uh a little bit too vague mm um in the f in the first game. But I think that that, you know, they're like They want you to put a foot wrong and then it for it all to kick off. So that's that's that's why it's like that, and I get that. Um but the bandits, I don't know, that just feels like It's more like trad stuff. I know what I'm doing with it. Um and yeah, this is definitely a bandit heavy chapter.

Samuel
01:25:46
Yeah, I think as well like the There's a scrappiness to the combat where it's not like you're pinned down by, you know, loads of machine gun fire. It's like everyone's if there's a feeling that everyone's got three or four pistol bullets. You know what I mean? Like it's even if the even if the game cheats its way to it, it's not like Yeah, it's not like you're in a firefight in Uncharted. It it has a very different sort of scrappier vibe about it. Um Yeah.

Matthew
01:26:09
And there's there's a there's a bit more you know, like there are very There are characters who are explicitly like melee attackers who are trying to get up close. So, you know, they they everything kind of bears down on you. There's not a lot of like just long distance fights where you're shooting things, you know, at the other end of a like a car park or whatever. Everyone's kinda constantly swimming on you. So even if they have got a gun, the likelihood is, you know, you're gonna hit them with a big plank of wood at some point. Yeah. Um and that's you know that's that's quite good fun. It's definitely got its own like look and rhythm to it, which, you know, still to this day like that that kind of uh the ease with which it switches between kind of ranged and close combat I I really like.

Samuel
01:26:48
Hmm. So you're coming up to winter, I guess, like you've got that to to come. Um Uh yes, I guess there's the dam stuff first. Oh yeah, of course, yeah. I always forget that comes earlier in the story. I don't know why. It's like That feels like something you do in the opening chapters rather than like later, but yeah, I guess it makes sense.

Matthew
01:27:05
Yeah, I'd kind of mix together um. the the bill the stuff with Bill and the stuff in Pittsburgh and Henry and Sam like that that had all kind of mixed into one big section. I thought I was working with Bill to fight like against a big armoured car um which is a bit later instead. Yeah, yeah, it's good. I I I I am enjoying it. I'll tell you what it reminds me of that I didn't ever really strike me before. It's quite Half-Life 2-ish. Right, right. Like, on a rudimentary level, like the fact that you sort of start in a kind of city that's under kind of the rule of these sort of jack boots or soldiers It's very like the opening to Half-Life 2 where you kind of walk through it and then the way it kind of sort of spills out through sort of sewers uh into that and and just the way that like mechanically You know, the game does have like this section is a section where you're trying to dodge spotlights, and this section is a sniper fight, and this section there are lots of like uh like the the traps that Bill has laid and that's almost uh you know almost a little bit kind of Ravenholmy um Like, you know, it's just pull it's pulling from the same trick book. It like I can sort of see it a bit more clearly second time round than I could the first.

Samuel
01:28:20
Hmm. Yeah, that's uh that's interesting. I mean, do you think this game would benefit from a hovercraft section, Matthew? What do you reckon? That's like the worst bit of Half-Life 2, isn't it? Is controlling that thing. That feels like it goes on forever, that section.

Matthew
01:28:32
Oh yeah, and you have to keep getting in and out and going into the various barns and Yeah. Yeah.

Samuel
01:28:37
Yeah, it's not out sucks. Um so okay, right. So I guess like, do you feel in a position to talk about the ending of the game? Because That always feels like the thing with this game is like the the you know, it's the it has like such a profound impact on the second game, of course. Um It's like the part of the TV show I'm intrigued to see how they do because they could, you know, it's very likely they will make sure that the T V show ending weaves into what happens in part two more than the first game was able to, because obviously they built a story in retrospect that relies on a on a slight a slight leap of faith, I guess, for you as a player. So the ending, Matthew, have you have you revisited this in any form? I guess it's not where you're at in the game. Do you remember this ending?

Matthew
01:29:19
Um I Ye I remember the broad shape of it. I don't remember like specific lines, but I I sort of remember yeah, what happened and that people agree or disagree over whether Joel is white. Do you do you maybe want to explain it as you probably remember it better than I do. But yeah. Joel turns into a monster, right?

Samuel
01:29:38
Yeah he does. Uh yeah you got like big wings. Um What's that Krager guy? I keep for keep getting that. Lava Lord. Lava Lord, yeah, Joel the Lava Lord. It's um very controversial part of that game.

Matthew
01:29:54
He becomes Joel, Lord of Blasphemy.

Samuel
01:29:58
Lord of Blasphemy. Uh okay. So yeah, they arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is unconscious. Uh Joel takes Ellie into this hospital rammed by the fireflies. And the hope is that of course the whole premise of the game is that um this whole Cordyceps thing, um Ellie is immune to it. She's bitten, but she doesn't um get infected. And so the hope is that they can um synthesize a vaccine out of um out of Ellie. But what they don't tell Joel in like getting him to bring Ellie across this country is that they actually plan on um killing her and cutting into her brain and removing part of her brain to synthesize this vaccine with no guarantee that it would actually work. Um and Joel basically kills the fireflies and takes Ellie and runs away, basically. And then when she With all the Fireflies dead, including Marlene, a key character in the story, basically Joel lies about what had happened and said that there was um they were unable to create a cure and they've stopped trying. And so This obviously, you know, what actually happened is like it's very strongly suggested that Ellie doesn't quite believe Joel's recollection of events, but she wasn't witness to it because she was unconscious. So You only see it from Joel's perspective, and you have this very vengeful moment of like, you know, he's been misled, and so he essentially takes her and and goes. And um

Matthew
01:31:22
Is it implied or explicitly said that there have been other people who've been immune that they've done this to?

Samuel
01:31:29
I I don't remember that bit, but that that seems that seems plausible. I think like It's very strongly relayed that there's no guarantee this'll work, basically. Um and that she is lamb to the slaughter in a lot of ways. It's a sacrifice that she's making. Um The reason I think hashtag Joel was right is that they didn't tell him what they were doing with her. Like they if they had done that They would be in the right, but they had to die, and I think he was right. So, yeah, sorry, Abby, but the whole premise of your revenge was wrong And you should blame your dad. Tough break. Uh tough break there for Abby. Um what did you make of this ending at the time? And like have you kind of I suppose like having played The Last of Us Part 2, I assume you thought about this a little bit in some form, Matthew.

Matthew
01:32:12
Yeah, um I remember th I think I'm roughly hashtag Joel was right. Like I don't the the tricky thing is is is like You don't have any option. You know, you don't have any agency in that final section. You know, it's y there are aggressors coming after you and you have to deal with them. And in that moment, like By you know, by just by the like the r the rules of the video game, like you feel kind of complicit and you have to kind of go along with him. Maybe like That is that like a kind of forced agreement with him in a way? Yeah, I guess so.

Samuel
01:32:48
It's a deliberate mirroring of the intro as well, right? Like it's, you know, he's seen his actual daughter die. Um and like he has the he has the power to prevent it this time um for you know his surrogate daughter essentially and does. And so it's cleverly drawn in that respect, I think.

Matthew
01:33:04
Yeah, yeah. I I yeah I guess sort of I don't know maybe it's a bit of a w like a way of weasling out of it, but it's almost cause you don't have any like say in the matter. Cause you know, that is just what has to that is what happens in the story. Like I've probably just sort of squared that with myself by going, well, then that's what had to happen and we're just gonna deal with that and like live with that and that's fine. You know, I like whether or not I think it's right or wrong, it almost like you because you don't have any say in the matter, it almost sort of seems redundant to argue the point.

Samuel
01:33:35
Yeah, I I do agree with that. I think it's like quite quite brave as an idea because it does entirely dismantle Joel as this heroic figure. Um that you get you know, it is strongly suggested throughout the game that he, you know, him and Tommy have done bad shit in this post apocalyptic world. Like that they are they are not their hands are not clean. But this, you know, the the idea that like he would he would choose her over the even the possibility of a vaccine is like That's a you know, that's a murky grey decision. And it's an interesting one to leave the player with, you know.

Matthew
01:34:07
Yeah. I I like I do remember thinking that Like, it was like mo more more than implied that she sort of knew what the deal was and it was like a silent agreement between the two of them.

Samuel
01:34:22
Yeah, particularly in the second game, I think that's underlined.

Matthew
01:34:25
Yeah, though m that maybe makes like her anger and reaction to sort of finding out about the first game in the second game like a little bit more uneven. You know, that doesn't quite go with Ha uh you know i if she's sort of on board with it, you can't then later be out of sorts about it, you know?

Samuel
01:34:46
Yeah, I I think like it is left You know, there's like a a a lingering doubt. That's what I remember about the ending. It's a lingering doubt from Ellie. It's not like she knows what happened. Like she is like Un sh unclear, but like yeah. But there's a suggestion she gets what what had happened. That's what I I would say that's yeah

Matthew
01:35:07
Yeah. I you know, in terms of their their kind of character art, the idea that at the end point of the game there's such sort of affection or closeness or respect or whatever between them that she trusts like what he's done. you know, to have been in their best interests all right. Um and so, you know, that's that's quite a sort of powerful full stop on the journey they've been on together of like that you can have a c a you know, when you get to the point in any relationship where you can have a unspoken uh understanding between two people. Like that's you know, that's quite a sophisticated way of showing, you know, that you're no longer strangers. Would you um If if it was you and me in this situation and if if I had if I had uh a mushroom immunity and I was on that table Would you kill everyone? Would you kill all the doctors to save me or would you let them cut away?

Samuel
01:36:04
Uh I'd be like, look, this guy doesn't like Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, he's gotta go. You know what I mean? Like it's it's tough.

Matthew
01:36:09
But uh Well I think in a world where like mushrooms have killed everyone, I don't think Captain Toad is like particularly everyone's favourite game right now. If anything, I'd say Captain Toad is persona non grata in the world of The Last of Us.

Samuel
01:36:23
Well, I I would I would need to consider it a bit more. I'd like say to the doctor, look, how likely is it that you'll get this from this? If he's like, look, we have no idea how what we're doing here. We're just gonna cut into the brain and see what happens. Like I'd be like, well, okay, we pr let's maybe slam the brakes on, you know what I mean? Like he's a good guy. I don't think like I'm willing to give him over to like you're meant to just take it as surely the shots at like saving humanity is worth it no matter what. Like that's like the question it's asking you, right? Versus Do you make a selfish choice and save someone? I the other the bigger question is, Joel carries Ellie out of there. I'm not sure I could carry you out of the fireflies. And I think Oh fuck no.

Matthew
01:36:57
Maybe in a wheelbarrow, which would definitely undermine the drama of that situation.

Samuel
01:37:01
Yeah, if it like spills over a couple of times and have to put you back in, that's tough. I mean like Catherine, can you come along and help me with this? It's like quite heavy. Um

Matthew
01:37:10
You have to you have to wobble the the uh dual sense back and forth to kind of balance me in the wheelbarrow. And you're like, this is not how I thought this game was gonna end.

Samuel
01:37:20
Let's face it, our listeners probably would have preferred two hours of that These scenarios than like the what we actually talked about, Matthew, with a very sober discussion of The Last of Us.

Matthew
01:37:30
I was gonna open the podcast by asking you that in the world of The Last of Us, are you Fedra, bandit, survivor or mushroom man.

Samuel
01:37:39
Um I think like mushroom man, because I'd just be to I'd be like I'd be quite nihilistic in the face of apocalypse. I wouldn't be like, oh this is my time to thrive, baby. I'd be like Welp, uh no more Nintendo Switch games.

Matthew
01:37:53
The weird thing as well, like, I don't remember this and this isn't in the game, but the the show adds this weird law quirk that the disease spread via carbs. Oh yeah, that is that is weird, yeah. I don't remember them saying out loud. Maybe it's in some of the documents you pick up, but the idea that like everyone turned into mushroom men because they ate some like tainted cake pancake mix. Yeah. And that's why the the episode has him like Joel very explicitly rejecting uh carbs. He's on Atkins diet. Um and so when I was thinking about that, I was like, Well I mean that would be us fucked. Like we'd definitely have eaten like tainted bread.

Samuel
01:38:31
Yeah, exactly. Like f five weeks of beef jerky, then I'd be like, look, I need to eat a fucking Donut immediately, you know what I mean? Like it's You eat one donut and turn into a bloater. Uh they did they did make the bloater look quite cool in the TV show actually.

Matthew
01:38:47
I thought they were gonna do the whole thing without doing the special zombie types.

Samuel
01:38:51
Well that bodes well for part two, right? There's a good one in part two.

Matthew
01:38:55
Yeah, it's just cause she there's that line of dialogue where she's talking about Aren't there like big exploding ones and this and he's like, no, that's all bullshit. And I thought, oh, this is quite refreshing. They've they've cut it down to like the core zombies rather than the boss zombies. So when that big boy came out of the pit, I was genuinely like, oh okay, we're doing this army. This is very video gamey, but I I didn't hate it actually.

Samuel
01:39:15
No same. Especially 'cause that is like uh Uh I I do wish they looked a little bit more real generally. Like they look very CG, I think, the the uh clickers. But um that was quite a cool moment, especially because I like the whole set piece notion of the armored car collapses into the ground so they all spill out of the house. Like that was really good.

Matthew
01:39:34
Yeah that was that was that was really good. And I guess the kind of a set piece you just couldn't have done on console like from the kind of you know, I think they had a maximum of like eight eight characters or something they could do in the original game.

Samuel
01:39:45
Is that true? Fuck. They really did their their best then. Wow, that's amazing.

Matthew
01:39:49
Um Yeah, st well, uh maybe that's maybe that's not true. Where was I reading that? I think that was in the Digital Foundry breakdown of how part one differed to part two. Maybe it's like they couldn't give AI to more than eight things. Right, right. So that's that's why the combat encounters are the size. They are anyway, I I'm probably misquoting it there.

Samuel
01:40:07
No, that's interesting.

Matthew
01:40:08
That kind of makes sense. Um Yeah, I actually an another quick thing about the show compared to the game. Um I think the game is still quite scary with like the sound editing, like the clickers sound horrible and Definitely Um the the the not really being able to know kind of like what when they are or aren't going to be able to see or hear you is is it adds, you know, a base level of fear to it. And I'd say that I thought the show was going to be quite scary after the first episode. Because I thought the scene where um Sarah in the prologue kind of went into the next door neighbour's house was like a genuinely quite effective bit of like sort of horror. Yeah. Um, but I don't think it has succeeded on that front going forwards. Like I f I found the I found like the clicker stuff in episode two pretty like naff. Yeah. Um Like uh i it wasn't until that season five where episode five where it all went horribly wrong and I was like, oh yeah, this is a bit more like it.

Samuel
01:41:01
Um Yeah. I sort of think that like one maybe slight mistake they've made is they too early give you like a massive horde of them. Um like I think maybe you need to build up to that. But by episode two, they've already got like tons of them running around Boston. Um and like uh I wonder if maybe you needed to do like these more intimate scenarios, first of all, to be like, oh, seeing this thing is kind of is really scary. And then when you get to episode five and they do all come out of the ground, that's like your first time you've seen a pack of them running. Um I would have thought might have worked better, you know.

Matthew
01:41:35
But uh 'cause the g the the you know, the the game still very effectively conveys that like, you know, there are these sort of shambling guys who may get up in your grill but it's not game over and then if these nasty fuckers get close to you with like full mushroom head, you know, then you are basic like instantly dead. You know, there's there's no fighting that thing off if it if it gets close enough. And Like they established them as being very threatening early on and they maintain that, you know, to the point where I am in the game now. Like I'm still always in any stealth scenario. I have to get rid of the clicker, you know, the clicker is the thing. Once like once I get rid of that, my general like stress level drops significantly and I can kind of enjoy it a bit more, but it's always how do we get rid of That busted.

Samuel
01:42:20
That's like um I suppose that is an area where I should probably give the game more praise. Is that that as a kind of a notion to relate to the player of oh it's in your best interest to take out this one thing that could fuck everything up as quickly as possible. Is like good design, isn't it? That is like I should praise that instead of just complaining about how opaque the stealth is, which um um yeah, because there's definitely like things it does well. And yeah, that is true, that's one of them. And they're like the The act of shivving those is a very uh you know, to go back to our XL episode this month, Matthew, all yeah moment. That's like that always feels good. Good use of shivving in that game.

Matthew
01:42:53
Um yeah. Although I th it has that it has that other mechanic where you need shifts to open some doors to like bonus rooms full of treats.

Samuel
01:43:04
Oh yeah, yeah.

Matthew
01:43:05
Uh so I'm always kind of like uh I really don't want to use my shiv 'cause what happens if there's a special like treat room and I'd be sad. I've left so many treat rooms behind. He would just kick those doors down.

Samuel
01:43:16
Definitely, yeah. That's kind of bullshit, but Or use some other item to do it. It's like, yeah, I'm just gonna pop a bomb here, blow the title off, and so there's so many ways of opening a door. Yeah, so oh yeah, shiv shivs are very precious in this world, you know what I mean?

Matthew
01:43:30
So just a piece of metal. So I can get inside and collect those sweet, sweet scissors and rags.

Samuel
01:43:37
Uh yeah, they haven't done that in the TV show yet, have they, where they get to the treat room.

Matthew
01:43:40
Um, there there was a bit in in episode three where um Frank is in the hole and Bill goes and gets a ladder. Yeah. Where I I genuinely thought of Finally, finally someone is doing a ladder puzzle. Actually the game only has two ladder puzzles so far. Um in my head, like In my head, in that game, like Joel is basically carrying a ladder all the time.

Samuel
01:44:03
I barely remember puzzles in that game. Like I barely remember them. Like compared to Uncharted where the puzzles are like set pieces in their own right. I don't really remember that so much about the last of us. Is there a lot more of that than I'm remembering?

Matthew
01:44:21
Um there's quite a lot of plank and well there's not a lot of ladder work. There's only two ladder things so far, but there's you know, really they're glorified loading screens, you know, like it it's it's m it's really no no more offensive to me than squeeze through this tight crack, you know. It's let's gather here, slowly walk about with a plank while we're loading in the next kind of horde or whatever and that's that's fine by me. I've I haven't really got problem with it.

Samuel
01:44:48
Yeah. I suppose the other thing that was kind of exciting about The Last of Us at the time is that um it has the like, you know, the ladder thing, it's one thing, but it's like the idea of the the companion relationship expanding to like a full game. Um, because you always had these moments where it was like you and Chloe or you and Elena or whatever in like Uncharted 1, 2, and 3. Um but then to like take it to the next level mechanically, um, in The Last of Us as they do, where that character is, you know, that that companion is a permanent, you know, a permanent like part of the game. And then in Uncharted 4 it feels like that means that when you get to that game, like the com the you know, the the way that like the characters will like team up together is even more meaningful. You know what I mean? Like it's It's like a little mini project you see them doing in the background, right? It's like how do we make AI really nail AI companions? So there's someone with you who doesn't feel like a faff to like look after. Where it's like it's actually quite exciting to have them in the field with you and you can convey the sense of a journey, you know?

Matthew
01:45:44
Um Yeah, and and actually th that is something they've tweaked a bit for part one. Like there's there's fewer instances of like you know, we have to stay really quiet and then like Ellie's literally running circles of a clicker and it's not doing anything. You know, there's there's there's not a lot of that anymore. Yeah. Um it seems much better behaved.

Samuel
01:46:01
Yeah, that's fucking hard to do as well. Um, but yeah. Um okay, cool. Well, yeah, good. I'm glad you're enjoying it, Matthew. Uh yeah, I would also be curious to know. In the r in the situation you described there where I'm saving you with a wheelbarrow, you get to like The Last of Us Part 2, and what happens to me is what happens to Joel in that game. What do you do after that?

Matthew
01:46:19
Um like to be honest, I'd probably just go and live back at the town where it was safe and nice and there were lots of like barn dances. Yeah, it was nice to be. What happened to Samuel and I'd be like I don't know. I'd pretend that I didn't know about it so that people wouldn't judge me, but I he went out on the Patrol. Uh hopefully he'll be back soon though. Bleak. Pass me more of that cake mix.

Samuel
01:46:43
No wait It's like yeah, remember tasty a tasty scone no no Matthew Not the scones either, Joe.

Matthew
01:46:50
The whole community would basically have to be dedicated to stopping me from eating infected carbs. Come on, they just wouldn't let me live there. That's the truth of this.

Samuel
01:47:01
Yeah, you'd be excommunicated.

Matthew
01:47:03
It's like They'd be like, no one no one should be your weight in this society. Like there is clearly something shady about you.

Samuel
01:47:12
Oh, amazing. Uh good. Okay, well the The Last of Us Part 2 starring us, and it's uh two hours long because uh there is no cycle of violence. because it's just a man being thrown out of a community for eating too many carbs. That's uh we've got to the core of it there. Um anything more to add, Matthew, before we punch out?

Matthew
01:47:29
Uh no, I'm looking forward to doing this again with uh part two when we get to that bit of the TV show. I think that'll be a a a worthwhile exercise.

Samuel
01:47:37
Yeah, I th I really I really do believe that game is like a borderline ten out of ten, so it's um And and I know you don't. Hey, it was a pandsight. It was a shitty pandemic here. What were you to do but have a few spicy takes. You know, that was a you you treat you treated yourself. Um I actually I was curious, do you think that knowing the TV show will do part two? Does that make you want to revisit that game? Do you think you could stand to play that much Last of Us again?

Matthew
01:48:07
Yeah, I'll probably do it like I'm doing this, play it alongside when it eventually comes out. It's c it's quite a an a novel way of playing the game, to be honest. I'd recommend it. But I I'd also hold I I bet part one will be on that PlayStation subscription service at some point.

Samuel
01:48:22
Yeah, I just can't fifty quid at the moment for it. I just I'm not That's not quite where I'm at.

Matthew
01:48:27
Is it not the full seventy?

Samuel
01:48:28
Uh yeah, it is, but it's actually twenty-five percent off on um PS5 this week. So um I mean they've done the very wise thing in terms of getting it out there. Like this game is gonna be I don't know. I think it already sold twenty million copies the original. By the time this TV show is done, that's this is gonna be one of the biggest games ever made, surely. It's gonna be just uh massive Oh yeah.

Matthew
01:48:45
Uh yeah. I mean that's that's when they did it, right? It's just so you watch the show, you fall in love with it, and then you don't play a game that looks like a bit kind of crusty now.

Samuel
01:48:53
So it's like yeah, you suddenly got four million people and you're like, look, before you play this, we just need to explain what the PS3 was, okay? It was a weird time. Just kind of climbing down a little bit at the start. Uh okay, good. Um thank you for listening to the podcast. Next week is the Wii U Hall of Fame uh with Ashley Day, returning guest. That should be good, Matthew. I'm excited about that one. Um we've just done XL episode for Patreon subscribers, uh the four pound fifty tier. Um fifty gaming moments they make us go. Ooh yeah, that was um a really good episode. We were quite happy with how that turned out. Um and uh yeah the XXL episode this month is about Korean cinema. So quite a lot going on with us. Um Matthew, where can people find you on social media? at mrbasil underscore pesto. We're patreon. com slash backpagepod, at Twitter on social media and uh backpagegames at gmail. com if you'd like to email us. Uh I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter, and uh we'll be back next week. Goodbye.
