Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. You've been to the Excel Center, a fate I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Congratulations.
But yeah, quite a Switch 2-tastic week for us. And you know, the less talk about Taris, the better really. How are you doing?
Yes, good. I'm tired. It's been a while since I've done one of these events, and you're on your feet for four straight hours.
I came home and realised that I absolutely reeked, so if I talk to anyone there, I apologise. I think the reeking happened towards the end of the event. I don't think I was reeking through the whole event.
The reeking.
I mean, you're not the first person to reek in the Excel Centre, I will say that, so that's okay. A very common scent amongst the people who go to that place.
It was the reek of industry, Sam.
Yes, very much so. Not industry in the kind of industrial revolution sense, but in the sense of computer games, for sure.
Yeah, or the HBO sense.
Yes, exactly, but less sexy, for sure. So, yes, a friend of mine, Gerald Lynch, who edits shortlist, told me that he has a new core memory from playing Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition with you today. I just wanted to hear your perspective on that and give a little shout out, Matthew.
How was that playing one of your most hated games of the friend of mine?
Well, I'd played basically everything first party apart from that, so I thought I'd try and squeeze it in at the end of my session, but there wasn't a huge uptake for that particular game and I was in the queue and the demo lady said, you can't start this unless you've got a group of people to play with and I was just looking around the queue, you know, I was in a queue of one desperate for someone to come and join me and yes, he just waved and said, hello, I know you through Sam and so I said, I begged him to come and play Mario Party Jamboree with me and and creen in front of a camera, which he did along with another demo guy we roped in who looked so fucking tired. He looked like he'd been playing it all day because no one could make up for players. That poor bastard really earned his keep.
So shout out at him.
Not exactly. My sword and my axe moment, is it really? Playing Mario Party Jamboree at the end of a long morning of Switch 2 sessions.
So yeah, I'm excited to talk about this, Matthew, because like you say, you've played everything, more or less, that is coming to Switch 2 that is available. There's been a lot of hands-on impressions around already about this stuff, but I think that we learned from last week's episode about the Nintendo Direct itself. People do like to hear our perspective, and you are long-term Nintendo fan, professional writer, editor.
People like hearing your perspective on this stuff. I'm excited to hear about it. So I suppose let's just kick off with it and give the caveat that this episode is being recorded off the cuff.
We're not doing our usual edit process. So any arms and other things like pauses, things like that, that's just going to be a little bit more natural than it usually is. But I think that's all right.
We're owed one of these every now and then. It's easier just to get the podcast into people's hands by doing this.
So, yes, I'm also just trying to work out what I think about everything, because I played all these things in quite a short space of time.
Yeah, I mean, I'm aware as well. I'm aware as well of your like your ebbing memory these days and the needs to get it on the record before the information disappears forever. So I totally thought that bad.
It's not like I'm going to be like, the interesting thing about the Joy-Cons 2 is that I think they're made of meat.
Well, no, that's OK.
Or was that my lunch? Something was made of meat.
I'm not suggesting you're going senile. I merely do it for the greater good, you know? OK, so let's start with the event itself, Matthew.
So we went to the Excel Center. I hate going there, as is well documented on this podcast. Was it worth it?
Yeah, I actually went up last night and stayed in London. Bloody hell. It was a very early start.
Right. I couldn't do it. Couldn't get there in time otherwise.
And a guy who was going to the Excel to go to a franchise fair was telling me that I should try and buy a restaurant franchise. That's the classic Excel experience, really. It's just like everything.
There's just so much bullshit going on in that place.
Yeah.
And that you go there to see a Switch 2 and you walk away setting up a where's you pay food restaurant.
Exactly. That's why me and Matthew are pleased to announce that we're going to business' Back Page Pizzas, which is coming to Bath very, very soon. So look out for that.
It should be good. Yeah. It's a weird old bunch of games among the less lucrative things that really go to the Excel Center for events, aren't they really?
Yeah.
I'm just amazed that there are these ten huge expos happening all week, every week. And you walk down there and you're like, it's the Wedding Show, it's the Food Franchise Expo, it's the Conservatory Expo. And you're like, what is going on?
There's one gaming expo a year and our industry feels huge, but it's obviously tiny in the grand scheme of things. So it's got nothing on the Conservatory booth.
Okay. So a bit of context there then. I appreciate that.
What was it like doing a Nintendo event again? Because it must have been a while since you've done one of these, right? More than ten years?
Yeah. I mean, the last Nintendo event was the Switch hands-on. So a couple of months before the Switch 1 came out.
Yeah. Going to this big nostalgic rush, as I said to you once on WhatsApp. A little bittersweet because it was kind of a reminder that I used to do this stuff a lot.
It's quite nice seeing the old faces. I saw Chris Scullion and the VGC boys and Nintendo Life were there. Just seeing these people who still do it as their full-time job, I was like, I remember this, this was good.
But yeah, it was the same as it ever was. You know, some nice Back Page pod listeners said hi. That would never have happened before.
You know, I think Back Page is listened to by more people who have ever read NGamer, so there's actually a bigger chance of being spotted at one of these things. And it always gives you a little thrill. Is that vain?
I don't know.
No, it's nice when people say that. I'm always aware of just not seeming to kind of clown shoes. It's very nice, but I think people, when I worked at Bethesda, found it funny and Frontier found it funny when people come up to me and mention the podcast, but I'm there representing video games or whatever, because I think they rightly see this as my little kind of like nerdy side hustle, which it definitely is.
But yeah, people genuinely really, really like it. So no complaints.
Yeah, and it was nice. Shout out to Steve from Loot Level Chill, who I'd never met before. He was very nice.
Said he listened to the podcast in the shower, which is, you know, fine. You can listen to it wherever you like, but imagine if you heard this bit while you were in the shower. That would be crazy.
Don't slip over. That's what I'm saying.
Okay, good. Yes, washing your bits while Matthew's talking about Donkey Kong Bonanza. It's exactly what the...
Sorry to make you...
I said washing your bits.
Sorry. I can't cut it because it's live, so I'm just stuck with it now. It's like a Black Mirror episode.
Anything I say just stays on the record and gets increasingly worse as the episode goes. Well, that's nice, Matthew. I'm glad to hear that.
I'm really glad you went because I could tell you were getting a buzz out of going. What was the vibe of the event like? Were people excited about the Switch 2?
Yeah, it was fun. So obviously, they're doing these hand-on sessions for the public, and this was a press version of it, but they were still running it like it was the public event. So when we went in, all the demoists gave us a huge round of applause, and it felt very unearned.
I won't lie. I was like, oh, please don't clap me. I literally did nothing but send like a really sniveling email to a Nintendo PR.
I haven't won anything. I'm not one of the lucky punters who probably will enjoy that round of applause. Yeah, it was fun.
There was a little bit of theater to it, in the way that they clapped when we came in. The very first thing they did was you go in little groups, and they get you straight into a Mario Kart world demo, like everyone, so you go in, you play it two player, and then they give you the switch in handheld to finally see a game on that and feel that. It felt very stage managed, but in quite a nice way of like, we want to introduce you to this game in a particular way and this console in a particular way.
So if people are lucky enough to be going to see it this weekend, I think it's not a lazy event, they're really trying to make it feel special, which I did enjoy.
That's cool. I think it's good to do that. It's good to tap into that excitement.
I thought it might also be nice to go to an event where you can step away from the Internet for a bit, and where it's a bit more human interaction, a bit less drowning in headlines and op-eds and pessimism. I don't know if that helps at all.
Yeah, it was just the machine. You could just get your head around it, you could play the games. It was a very well-organized event.
They had the right number of demo stations for each particular title, I would say. They judged it quite well of what people would want to play, and the numbers were just right, that you weren't ever really ever waiting for something. You know, I felt like I was mostly playing games, which isn't always true of these events, you know, where you're like waiting for stuff or whatever, or you're waiting for the one hot demo, but I was pretty happy playing anything.
And yeah, it was just really, really well done.
Good stuff. So does it, how does it compare to any similar Nintendo events you've done before?
Actually, interestingly, putting it against that Switch 1 event, which was really fun back in the day, but didn't quite have the same shape to it that they'd kind of created for this one. Like I felt like they knew how, they knew what was going to make each game look best and were trying to present it in that way. So like the Mario Kart world demo on the main floor was just the Battle Royale mode for 24 people and they had 24 stations set up, which they'd just like fill everyone in and kick it off.
So they wanted to show you it that way. Whereas at the original Switch event, I remember they were just like, yeah, over there's Mario Kart, you can just go in it and play whatever you want really. You know, I felt like they were really, had something in mind, you know, and there was sort of, yeah, just intent and design behind everything, which might surprise people given that it has seemed quite chaotic.
Like these last couple of weeks and the chat around it, were actually in the bubble of this room, I felt like the Switch vision was really, really clear.
Yeah, it's funny because this Tariff stuff hadn't really kicked off when we were recording it, and the price stuff was just rolling out. And so in the time between we recorded that direct podcast and this, it's become just so muddled and all over the place. Like Nintendo itself has never said on its own channels that they are suspending pre-orders from its original date.
And so that became like a thing you can only read about on Gamespot, IGN, a few websites. It's so strange. So I do think it's become so intertwined with all of that headline bullshit that for this podcast, I want to completely rip it apart from that and just talk about the games and the hardware as they are, because that's the only thing that we should really be concerned with other than the actual price, which we've discussed plenty already.
So let's talk about the Switch 2 hardware first of all, Matthew. Does the Switch 2 feel noticeably different in the hands and how are the new Joy-Cons?
When you look down at it, we're talking about the handheld mode here, the screen is just so much bigger. I was literally playing the Switch the night before, I was playing Metroid Prime and you go for it. So to have that kind of direct kind of comparison side by side, the real estate of the screen is that much bigger.
I thought it looked absolutely massive when I saw other people holding it, and maybe I just saw lots of smaller people holding it. It didn't feel that huge in my hands, it didn't feel that much heavier. It fit my hands a bit better, I'd say, like the size of it.
It's kind of what I've always wanted the size of it to be. One of the things I was sort of worried about, and maybe this is just like an aftershock of all the price conversation that dominated the Switch 2 thing, is that it might feel like too precious or high-tech, that it might lose some of the kind of toy energy of the Switch, which, you know, the original Switch, I think, has always maintained in its different iterations. But honestly, it kind of feels, it kind of felt like a Switch to me.
It didn't feel that different, aside from that kind of hit of the larger screen. So it feels quite well judged. Annoyingly, the only thing I wasn't able to do is actually take the Joy-Cons off.
Oh, right, right.
Like, all the demos I had, it felt like everything was very locked in to a particular mode. It was like, here's handheld, here's a pro controller, here's the Joy-Cons in the mouse configuration. So like, I haven't had that.
Now, maybe somewhere in that room, there was a place I could take those Joy-Cons off, and I just didn't find it, which was obviously a bad of me. But certainly, you know, with any concerns that this new magnetic holding system was going to result in wobbly controllers, I didn't have any of that. I played three or four demos in handheld mode with the screen, and as with the regular Switch, you just sort of forget that it all comes apart, really.
Yeah, it just felt nice. I want to say it felt like especially deluxe or in any particular way. I wouldn't say it felt like a, obviously, hugely different.
It just felt...
Iterative.
Yeah.
OK. Yeah, I mean, the slight bump in sort of like it not feeling quite as much like a toy made me think about how that first 3DS model felt very premium compared to the previous DS models. There's also just that little bit of extra kind of like varnish and, you know, sort of like angular look to it, but it doesn't even seem like it's as different as that, you know.
Maybe the size thing makes it feel slightly less toy-like, just because it sits very naturally in like adult hands. You know, like when you hold the original Switch, and especially when you disconnect the Joy-Cons and you hold the Joy-Cons, you know, they look slightly diddly in my big hands anyway. And while I was always fine with it and could adapt to it, I didn't have a problem playing the original Switch.
Just that extra like half inch length or whatever, it just looks kind of big, bigger and more substantial in your hand. God, all these conversations sound like double entendres.
They do, they do. And I know, talk about hardware is not really our area either, so you're doing your best and I appreciate it. But I think the screen is probably the most interesting thing to dig into because we've both owned Switch OLEDs.
They are wonderful things. The screen looks amazing. And even though there's no bump in specs between the different Switch units, playing almost any game on the Switch OLED looks better.
All of them do. It's just you put it in to see what it looks like and it will wow you. This is an LCD screen, but Nintendo went out of its way to say it's a brighter HDR-supporting LCD screen.
It's a bit of a bump itself. So how did you find it stacked up to the original Switch screen and the OLED?
The size thing is like the big wow moment of it. Colour-wise, very vibrant, very sharp. There's obviously a bump in resolution.
So it all feels quite well judged for the size it is. I think it's helped by the fact that it has a slightly glassier finish than the more kind of plasticky original Switch finish, which is like part of the OLED's appeal. It just feels a little bit more premium in that final layer.
And this has a similar deal going on, or it struck me that it did. There is quite hard to describe richness to OLED that this doesn't have. And I am used to it from the OLED.
I'm not going to say, who needs an OLED? It's better than that. But it's a huge jump on the original Switch LCD in so many ways that I don't think it's one of those things.
I just think your eyes would adjust to it after a couple of hours. Like, you don't look at it and go, ugh, budget. You look at it and go, core, the colors, the size, this is great.
You know, while also appreciating that there is, you know, an extra room for improvement there, you know, perhaps down the line, you know, whatever they choose to do.
Okay. So that makes sense. I mean, yeah, like you say, there'll probably be an OLED model in like three or four years or something.
But as long as that there is still a wow factor to that screen, I think that is important.
I think so. Yeah. The size of it.
Yeah, it really does hit. You know, I think there's a reason they hold that back, you know, for like, you know, make you play on the TV in there. And then you're like, oh, this is, you know, it's obviously a drop down, but it's not quite as severe as you think it's going to be.
Right, right. That makes sense. We'll talk about it more in the per game demo chat we're going to do in this episode, Matthew, but briefly.
Mouse controls, are they a bust or are they good?
I liked what I played of them. I think there's going to be a period of adjustment because it is very different form factor to traditional mouse. You know, your palm is not laying on anything and finding a place for your fingers to sit.
I think the problem is if you're expecting to to like have your your second and third fingers sitting on the two trigger buttons, like if you imagine a mouse is the two buttons, that's where your fingers would sit. Like that isn't really going to like happen. I think it's more like one finger is going to alternate between those two things.
I did find a position which was comfortable. I've seen some people going like, this will never work. And it's like, I don't know about that.
Like, I played the Metroid demo with it. Fine. And we can talk about that when we get to it.
But it is different. Of course it is. But I always think it's got to be a little bit give and take.
There was a time where everything that we used to play games seemed alien to us. And just by, you know, of course, it's different to, you know, the Master who have a traditional mouse or an analog stick or whatever. And I don't know, you get your head around it if you want to.
And if you don't want to, I don't think that's going to be a deal breaker.
So I think that's probably fair. I think that the reason that it's getting extra sort of attention is because it's like we talked about in the last week's episode. They don't really, there's no real like new USB to the Switch 2.
It is an iterative piece of hardware. So they probably had to draw more attention to it than they otherwise would if there was like another defining feature to the console. But yeah, it just, I think it means it's probably getting a little bit more extra scrutiny from press than it otherwise would.
But yeah, I'm curious to hear about the different games anyway.
Just everyone uses a mouse or like we're so used to what traditional mouse is. Anything that challenges that, you know, like, you know, you give me a weird gaming mouse with all kinds of extra prongs, my hand rejects, even though it still has like 50% traditional form factor. This is a bigger leap than that, but I don't know.
I think you'll get there.
Yeah. I mean, what do the other buttons do on my Razer mouse? I've got no idea because I never pressed them.
I just press the wheel in the middle and left and right. That's all I'll ever press, baby. It never needs to be more complex than that.
So did you get to try the pro controller, Matthew? How did that feel?
That was really nice. I'm a big pro controller user on the Switch. Like pretty much if it's on TV, I'm using that thing rather than the Joy-Cons as a rule.
And yeah, very comfortable in the hands. The analog sticks are very... Just, you know, I've seen lots of talk about what they are and what they aren't, you know, the tech-wise, I guess to combat stick drift.
But I thought they, you know, felt very, very smooth, had a nice sort of range of movement on them. Very pleasant to play. You know, nice clicky buttons, all very responsive.
Quite a nice, slightly different finish to the current Pro Controller. I mean, for me, like a thing I'm definitely gonna need and want. And, you know, they haven't, like, they haven't messed with it too much.
The rumble in it, bit juicier as well, that's good. Because I always found the HD rumble element of the Pro Controller quite underwhelming compared to the Joy-Cons. But this had a bit of heft to it.
I think most of what we played was using Pro Controllers, which I think is a sort of vote of confidence in it.
OK, interesting. Well, that's good to hear. I love the Pro Controller on Switch as well.
In fact, I didn't even get one until the end of 2023 when I went to Japan and got the Tears of the Kingdom limited edition one. And like, yes, it actually made me use the Switch on the TV more than at any point in the previous three years. So, yep, good to hear, Matthew.
Did you dare tap the C button?
I did tap the C button, nothing happened.
Okay, just, yeah. That's been the subject of a lot of discussion this week because the thing it's tied to is bound to a subscription and all that stuff. But again, I think it's maybe one of those things where it's a disproportionate amount of attention than it otherwise would have got.
But it's one of the new features, therefore it's gonna get spotlighted as all it seems to do with the new hardware launch. Think it's worth $300,000?
You're not touching that thing by accident. Like, it's pretty buried out the way.
Okay, interesting. All right, well, I'm sure we'll learn more about all that stuff when the console launches in June anyway. But do you think the console's worth 396 quid, Matthew, from what you played?
I realize that's a little bit of a kind of, you know, it's hard to make a call on that fully at this point, but did you pick up and think, you know what, this is, I have no regrets about dropping those notes.
Yeah, I didn't pick it up and felt like, oh, this is over, but it didn't feel cheap for that money, you know? I feel like from the sort of heft of it, what it was doing, yeah, it feels okay to me. Everyone's circumstance is going to be different.
Again, like I keep mapping this theoretical six, seven years lifespan onto it, and I think of all the shit that I have to pay loads of money for, that give me no fun. If you think that's too defensive and not a strong enough argument, then that's absolutely fine. You don't have to buy one.
I really do not care. But personally, I see it as, you know, this is the thing I'm going to be playing most for the next big chunk of time. You know, like my train ticket to the event was quarter of the price of the Switch.
That was a really shit 80 minutes. Like, I had more fun with that Switch in that whole event than, you know, 80 minutes there and back.
Well, that's just because GWR, a bunch of fucking grifting motherfuckers, that's why, Matthew.
Yeah, and that may sound like a bit of a sort of bogus sort of school man thing, but I don't know. Like, enough people are saying it's unacceptable, but you're like, oh, I guess it must be. But I held it in thought, certainly on a hardware level, I thought, oh, well, this feels like a whole lot more than the original Switch, which is still being sold for whatever it is, 250.
Feels like a jump to me.
Yeah, I think as well like this price is just going to be sensitive depending on who you are and what your circumstances are. We are people who play games all the time. We are used to spending money on games.
We are engaged with, you know, games overall as a kind of project. So to us, I think that that price tag doesn't seem like loads, but to a family who maybe are buying like one or two big gifts per year for their children, maybe it's a bit more of an ask. But, you know, I think that we're in early adopter territory, right?
And yeah, I agree. I think that price is perfectly fine. Let's get to the games, Matthew.
That's enough hardware analysis. Yeah, so you did your best there. I mean, you're not a digital foundry, but I still give you a solid 8 out of 10 for that analysis.
You know, I really appreciated it. Okay, then let's start with Mario Kart World, Matthew. The £75 for a physical copy, Mario Kart World.
Oh, here we go.
No, that's the thing. I won't try and drown out your optimism in this, but lots to ask about here. I'll start with how many blorkos made the roster for this one, Matthew.
Did you see the character select screen?
Yeah, there are quite a lot of blorkos on there. I mean, actually, it's mostly Nintendo characters in alternate costumes. Coin Coffer, the little frog purse thing.
That guy, Gumburr, I can understand. Coin Coffer, I'm like, has this guy really entered the pantheon of Mario Legends? I'm not entirely sure.
Obviously, everyone's going nuts for the cow. I wouldn't say it's too blorko heavy. If you're interested, I played as Toad as a hamburger.
Right, excellent.
That was one. And I played as King Boo in his, I quote, aristocrat costume, which confused me because he's already a fucking king. Like, doesn't that denote aristocratic?
Like doesn't he set the aristocratic agenda just by being King Boo? He doesn't need a fur coat. But he looks great in a fur coat.
So yeah.
Lots to think about there.
Everyone likes the cow. I get it. It's funny.
It's a cow. But yeah, King Boo, looking at million bucks. That's it for me.
Excellent. I think I've had the toad dressed as a burger at the Greenbird Cafe and bath before. So I'm glad to hear that's represented in there.
How did you find it more generally? Because this is the really interesting thing, right? We discussed this last week.
Is Mario Kart the juiciest thing to kick off a console generation with? It's a very pragmatic choice because Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was just so, so huge. But yeah, I think you had a couple of doubts maybe going into it of just how many racers are on the track and what that does to the track design, that kind of thing.
So what were your general thoughts on Mario Kart World?
Weirdly, the initial demo, so we went in, we played this two player demo of it, and then I played a single player race against a roster of 23AA characters. And I wouldn't say that wowed me. There was lots of stuff that didn't make a huge amount of sense.
Like, it leans quite Mario Kart Wii, I think, in terms of track width, and felt a little kind of baggy. There wasn't much interesting cornering going on. It looked really nice, and there was lots of incidental details, and all those kind of amazing character animations as they fire off weapons and react to their little winds and all that.
It's full of that kind of charming character, very much what you expect from Mario Kart 8. But I wouldn't say, like, in my hands, I thought, oh, this is the stuff, you know? This is necessarily what I'd put out there as my main game.
But I will say so much of it locked into place when I played the new kind of Battle Royale mode, the Knockout Tour, which is... I just feel like that's a mode where the whole kind of open world thing makes a lot more sense, because for people who don't know it's a mode that like stitches together parts of like the existing tracks and the world between them into like a huge route that you're racing with like knockout gates along the way. So you start at 24 and then four players are knocked out at the first gate and then four players and four players until eventually someone is crowd number one.
And through this, you will do parts of different tracks that are on this continent and you will race across bits of the continent that connect it. And it kind of feels like it's basically pulling one massive interesting course out of a landmass. And in that context, actually like the width and tone of the racing make a lot more sense because it's about 24 people cluttered together, you know, trying to squeeze like every drop of speed out of that track that they can.
It isn't necessarily about mastering an individual track, which is what Mario Kart 8 is, you know, like, can I learn all these corners and get my head around that? It's more like it's presenting me with this situation now, you know, have I got, you know, do I know a few shortcuts here? Do I have like good grasp of the weapons?
Can I squeeze speed bursts out of doing stunts or jumping on the wall of zero, zero G, gravity and all that kind of stuff? And all of a sudden you don't really notice the width as much. You just notice like the kind of pull of the destination.
And rather than feeling like a mistake or a flaw, I thought, oh, they've designed this to make this mode happen, and this mode be really good. And this is actually what this game is about. It isn't a traditional Mario Kart game embedded in an open world.
It's a different Mario Kart game that uses an open world.
Okay. Well, that's quite an interesting approach and a thoughtful kind of breakdown of how it sort of works. Okay.
Hopefully, yeah. Hopefully, that makes sense. I just, like, when you're by yourself or in two players, or if you go into it thinking like traditional Mario Kart, I think you're going to think there's a lot of straights in these tracks, and the corners are really boring.
But actually, when you're in that mode, that straight is like, I can see everyone, there are loads of weapons, there are often loads of obstacles coming at you, and it becomes a different kind of jostling. Yeah, it's kind of a weird, I've only played it once, so this is my instant take on that, is that it's about how many different parts of the Mario Kart experience can you master to get ahead in this pack, rather than can you simply master these predefined tracks. So the predefined tracks maybe aren't as important, unless they're really important to you, in which case, I don't know, we'll have to wait and see how this Mario Kart holds up.
Yeah, okay, so the tracks don't differ between the knockout mode and the Grand Prix, is that what we kind of take from that?
In the Grand Prix, you're doing like a track, which is like a predefined bit of the open world, but it feels like the way the knockout track is created, it like blends them into each other in a way that you can't really see the joints. Okay. It is quite hard to describe without like seeing it, but when you're in the moment, you don't really notice that like, oh, I'm actually in a track now, you know, I've shifted on here, or like this is the kind of between ground, because this is so much fucking mad shit going down, and bombs going off, and things flying overhead.
Yeah, it's like quite like wacky racers ish. It's quite madcap.
Yeah. So it's quite quite a different rhythm than for Mario Kart. It's based on that.
Like it's, it just sounds like, it sounds like you've got a lot of time to look at other races and think about what you're doing, which is all those instances are just very momentary in old Mario Kart. So that's, it sounds like, it sounds like it's just a, there's maybe a little bit more strategy going on.
Yeah. And I couldn't, there was like one moment that really jumped out to me is a part of the track went across water. So everyone kind of turns into boats and everyone's boating across this lake.
And I don't know if it was a obstacle in the lake that was throwing bombs or if it was someone sending out like a blue shell or chucking a bomb from an item box. But it was causing like the water waves to splash out. And when you hit those waves, they became like impromptu ramps.
And you could obviously stunt off those to get a speed boost. That's what I mean about it's like really reacting to the moment. And I thought, oh, is that something that's always going to happen?
Like, is there actually a character off screen who I didn't spot who's making these waves happen? Or did we make these waves happen with our specific item usage? Because that latter version, that's quite interesting.
The idea of, can you seize on the moment and go, oh, shit, I can benefit from this guy's downfall because of the wave that's come off him. And that's where I sort of saw a bigger kind of, you know, like, emergent Mario Kart happening. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what was happening.
Right, right.
If that makes sense.
Yeah, sounds like a hard game to suss out then in demo form. Maybe the overall shape of it does take being in the hands, maybe doing the free roam mode and understanding a little bit about how the overall game is broken out of that world, Bill.
The only chance we got to actually experience the open world was when you're waiting for the 24 lobby to fill up for the knockout tour. You could free roam in the demo there. And it is quite a weird moment where I was on a traditional aerial course.
There was a track that was suspended on tree trunks or whatever high above the air. And I fell off it. But instead of Lakitu coming and picking me up and bringing me back to the track, I just kept on falling into a lake.
And then I was just in a lake driving around. And there were giant launchers that would fire me back up to that track. But that's the moment where I was like, oh yeah, these tracks aren't just abstract things floating in a void.
They are all here. And that was quite cool. But like I say, it was only this little pre-race moment.
I didn't get to go off and explore and find out what was going on because the lobby suddenly filled up and we were off. But I think everyone will experience a moment where they go out of bounds and realize there are no out of bounds in Mario Kart World.
Oh, that is interesting and quite exciting, to be honest, because who knows what that moment might look like depending on what track you're on, like where might you land or where might you go? That's pretty cool.
Where are they going to put Rainbow Road? Like is that literally going to exist in space above this landmass?
Yeah.
What?
That's tears the kingdom shit right there. That's interesting. That's exciting.
So you think this knockout tour mode is going to have to stuff? Do you think that's going to be more the main event, do you think, than the actual Grand Prix park? Because it's quite...
They gave it equal prominence really to the traditional Mario Kart experience. I don't know if Mario Kart multiplayer mode will ever quite have that level of like Nintendo pushing them. I mean, it's been so long since they released one of...
I guess I couldn't reputably say without looking up a load of old marketing materials, but it feels like they're big on this, right?
Yeah, it feels huge. I mean, the fact that this was like the biggest demo area of this show floor, it was certainly like the most popular one and the most vocal one. It helped that they had all the demo people there seemed to be the most hyper demo people at the show and they were like whooping and hollering and trying to kind of build a bit of a party atmosphere.
Like that Rocksteady guy who would yell during the Arkham City demo. Remember that guy? The Rocksteady guy who would in the demos would be like, ah, he'd just sort of be shouting over it.
I just, sometimes that energy really works for me and sometimes I'm not quite in the mood, but how did you?
Yeah, I didn't mind it. Like in the moment, I was too focused on not bombing out in like the first round. I made it four parts.
I made it four checkpoints in before I lost basically. I didn't make it to the final eight. I was ninth on the last gate and got cut out.
So that was a bummer. The guy next to me, because they had a person on each station, the Nintendo guy, demo guy, kept saying, you're only ever a second away from getting Mario Karted. That's like his catchphrase and Mario Karted.
I'd never really heard anyone use that as a verb, but I also know exactly what he was talking about. You're like, oh, that's yes, that is true. You know, I'd hit someone with a shell and he was like, you Mario Karted that guy.
And I was like, yep. And then I got hit by a shell and he'd say, you just got Mario Karted.
I don't believe that Shigeru Miyamoto signed off on you got Mario Karted. I'm going to be honest with you, Matthew. That's just my take, but yeah.
But I was so stressed. I was so stressed about like seeing as much of the race as possible, not losing. This guy kept saying I was going to get Mario Karted.
All of that was combining. Like if there's a special mode where they use game chat to beam that one specific guy into your house to tell you you're about to get Mario Karted, then people could enjoy what I enjoyed today. But I don't think that's going to happen.
Maybe he'll get added to the vast roster in like a post-release patch or something. You know, it's just, yeah, we added a Mario Karted guy from the Excel Center in early April.
And they've got to fill that 24 roster somehow. I mean, if freaking Coin Gobbler or whatever his name is makes it up.
I guess this is a question a little bit about graphics in the game, but a little bit about just, I guess, like the game content and how obvious it is that they've changed a bunch of stuff. Do you think most normal punters will be able to see the difference between this and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe? Because I think we get what it means for this to be an open world Mario Kart game.
I wonder if the tens of millions of people who bought Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, will they understand that it's a substantial enough leap? Like if you played the Switch, let's say like 10 times a year, would you get from like playing it in a kind of demo in like a shop or something, that this is a significantly different experience?
Yeah, I think you would. Just from the nature of the design and how it like pushes you to race, I think you know, it feels different. The handling is slightly different as well.
You know, it doesn't just feel like they've lifted, yeah, the Mario Kart 8 sort of model into this. Visually, yeah, it's weird. You know, close up, a lot of it, yeah, it does look like Mario Kart 8, but then you're driving along and you realize that the thing you're looking at in the distance is the spiralling track that you're gonna get to in like two minutes.
And that kind of horizon element, you know, I don't think that will be lost on people. I think people will very quickly get, you know, oh, well, I'm gonna be there in two, you know, if I carry on down this road, we're gonna be at that place. Or, you know, from a distance, it looks like a Mario Kart course, and we're gonna naturally kind of segue into that.
So I think it's got wow factor. It's certainly quite handsome in all the, you know, I don't know if it was 4K on the TV. It looked incredibly sharp to me, and really, really nice on the Switch 2 screen as well.
But it isn't like a, you know, it isn't like you get those terrible things where people remake games in the Unreal Engine, and all of a sudden it's full of like mad kind of textures and shadow and lighting effects. They haven't gone that direction with it. You know, it doesn't look like, you know, you're not seeing like, you know, the individual hairs on the fur collar of the aristocratic kingdom.
Yeah, just the very like realistic mushroom texture on Toad. There's none of that in there, you know.
Yeah, but then, like, if anything, being quite coherent with Mario Kart 8, one of the best selling games of all times, is maybe quite smart.
Well, that's the overall Switch 2 project, right? That's the thing, you know.
Yes, well, it's this world and characters that you're very familiar and sort of safe with and have an affection for and they're gonna behave in quite a similar way, you know. We are only giving Donkey Kong a weird character makeover, not everyone's getting that. I'd say it leans impressive, but it isn't like a, oh my god, I can't even comprehend that this being a Mario Kart, I don't really know what people expect.
Yeah, okay. Well, that's a good overview of Mario Kart World and your impressions so far. Anything else you want to add, Matthew, before we move on?
The only annoying thing about the event in general, I couldn't really hear any of the games because it was loud. There were loads of TVs going, so I can't really speak to how the music is. Obviously, the music in Mario Kart is super, super important, so I don't really know if it's good.
But that would obviously, a good tune can add like 10 percent to a game for me.
It's a shame they couldn't have had me there. I could have been beatboxing the soundtrack for you. I'd just be doing that for like 20 minutes where you play the demo.
Yeah, if it's going to have that. I don't know if it's going to... The world looks like it should have a country and western or road music.
I guess it depends on what part of the world you're in. There'll probably be some kind of dynamic audio where it changes depending on which regions you're in, which will be really cool. So yeah, okay.
Well, that's Mario Kart World, yours for £75, or you can just buy the bundle with the digital version, which is slightly cheaper.
Definitely buy the bundle.
Was it like £430 the bundle or something like that? It was pretty reasonable.
So it's like the game for £35.
That's all right. I've already paid for it. A very sweaty man at Curry's and Bath on Friday evening last week took the order from me.
He had to write on a piece of paper, which seemed very analogue for a retailer. They've emailed me like fucking 90 times since I bought it, so that's good. But I am looking forward to getting my hands on it.
We move on to Donkey Kong Bonanza then Matthew, which is the other big game that we're excited about this year. Of the line up, it's these two, really, isn't it? These are the ones I think are the front runners for us.
This is out in July. I suppose it's been interesting to see the response to this, because it's the game I was the most excited about from the direct. Have you figured out the exact shape of what this game is now from playing it?
No, but I feel like I'm getting there. So I played this twice. It's the first demo I played, and it's the last demo I played, because I wanted to go back to it.
And going back to it with an idea of the basics, and digging into the world a bit more, it really clicked into place for me, actually. Yeah, I'm calling it a 3D platform is weird, because he has got a jump, but his main bit of motion is climbing and obviously punching through things, which, you know, if you are expecting this to behave like Mario Odyssey or something is a little bit jarring. It's weird, there's lots of stuff in it, which feels Odyssey adjacent in terms of pickups, just like interface behavior, things like that.
It really does feel like an EAD Tokyo game to me. And, you know, it feels like a next step along from Odyssey in terms of, you know, you're collecting these bananas and they're quite like the moons in Odyssey. When you get them, there's like a little screen, he says like, oh, banana, and the name of the banana, and then he gobbles it up.
Some of them have big story objectives attached to them. Go to this location and fight a very specific weird boss or creature or something, and they feel like the bigger set piece moons from Odyssey. But at the same time, there's all these other ones hidden for doing weird little interactions.
Like, you go all the way up to this tall point, and there might be a banana. Or, because you can dig in this game, you dig all the way down, and there might be a banana. Or, you figure out an interesting interaction between this weird projectile and that target, and that makes a banana happen.
And that, to me, feels very Odyssey-esque. But what you're actually doing kind of completely isn't. The landscape deforming is at the heart of this.
Everything you do is chipping away and causing huge lumps of earth to remove from this map. And at first you think, well, is this like a 3D platformer where you can just destroy the level design and thus make it suck? And I think that's probably what people are worried about.
Where actually, I think it's like a giant... Well, it's a completely different approach to level design. It's a completely different kind of map.
I think it's designed to be chewed through at great speed and in a kind of world of chaos. I don't think it's about surgically planning a route through. Like, there's so much in the Donkey Kong character that kind of encourages you to kind of be as chaotic as possible.
Like the speed he mulches through rock. I don't know if he necessarily like builds momentum, but it feels like he's really kind of pulled into it. And when you get going, you just end up going on a kind of rampage and then kind of turning around at the end of it and looking at this kind of huge kind of gap you've carved through.
And it is really satisfying, but it's a completely different interaction. You know, it's not the precision skill of platforming. It's the glee of destruction.
And that's really the thing I kind of had to kind of click into. I think the first time around, I was trying to play it as a 3D platformer and not quite understanding it or not quite getting it. And if you kind of go in and you're a little bit more kind of carefree about it, I think you get a better sense of the rhythm that they're going for.
You know, that it is kind of a big playpen and you're just meant to go in there, cause chaos, discover bits where more specific things need to be done or have to happen, and sort of solve those or bits where there's like more of a combat focus or little side rooms where there can be very focused challenges. I feel like the confusion is coming from the fact that it's just quite a new game concept for them. It feels like a new idea and trying to kind of neatly pigeonhole it and say like, oh, it fits into this tradition or that tradition is maybe where not it comes unstuck, but we come unstuck trying to talk about it.
They've made their arms or Splatoon, but they've done it within Donkey Kong basically. They've gone, here's a new gameplay concept, but they've actually used quite a big character to package it and sell it.
Yeah, that's a much better way of saying what I just struggled through for two minutes. Yeah, but in the same way that yes, they've got this central mechanic in Splatoon and it is you can dive in, you can paint the map, but you can dive and swim in the paint. And so the thing you're trying to achieve becomes like the tool to achieve it.
That's absolutely brilliant. Here, the big thing is the destruction. It's not a 3D platformer with destruction.
It's a destruction game. And the objectives and challenges within that are very different, you know, according to that. The thing where this game is really good and what I think it is like more about is the kind of cascading domino effect of what you're doing.
So if there's an explosive enemy and you punch them and they go flying and they hit a wall, they explode, and obviously like blow a huge chunk out of that wall. And that's quite a like basic version of this, but there's a lot of like knock-on effects. And actually seeing all this stuff go flying away and then causing more damage elsewhere, like that is really exciting.
And you know, the tech seems to really hold up, you know, it's got very satisfying, creates these big circular kind of holes, you know, a bit like, you know, when Arnie turns up in his time bubble in the Terminator, and it just like burns a hole in anything it touches. There's a lot of that effect going on, you know, and there's a lot of things that encourage that to happen, like you can pick up bomb rocks and chuck them, and then that causes a huge thing to explode. And there are a lot of different like surfaces and textures and different things happen when one object hits a certain surface.
And you get the sense that there's going to be maybe certain surfaces or certain materials that you can't damage without having unlocked certain powers or certain objects. That's what it sort of feels to me. It's like a sort of destruction texture puzzle thing, which is quite messy to describe, but when it all kicks off is really good.
Like just blowing the shit out of this landscape by chucking around rocks, and then just charging your way through it with your churning fists. It just works, it feels good, it's executed really well. You just need more time with it, I think.
This map, you can barely see a fraction of it before it times out.
Yeah, that's always going to be a tougher way to demo something than a very, very guided hand approach to demoing something, I think. So yeah, that's interesting. Because it's definitely a lot...
Didn't you say you sensed a little bit of a mixed response to this game?
This was the one, like most people you talk to, they loved everything, but they were like, Donkey Kong, I wasn't quite feeling, or I didn't quite get it, or they're like, I just dug myself into a hole and didn't really know what the game was about. And I'd say a lot of what I played, there's always a way out of like any kind of situation you get yourself into. Yeah, I don't know.
I just locked into it that second time. And it's looking at a thing, trying to interpret how the... You know, they might potentially hide a load of these giant bananas there, working out if there's like a weird kind of puzzle mechanic to it.
I mean, on that second round also, there's just a lot more Donkey Kong Country stuff in this than I was expecting there to be. It really does feel like it's building from that world. Like the barrels come into play a lot, and there's a lot of like barrel platforming and barrels kind of spinning around to fire you off in different directions.
The red balloons, the actual iconography of Donkey Kong Country is here. You know, I talked to some of the NPC monkeys, and you know, they start mentioning the animal helpers from Donkey Kong. Someone mentions Rambi the Rhino, for example.
Oh, is all this stuff kind of going to be in here too? Like this feels like they haven't just rejected what came before. Like they've just taken all that stuff and they've put it into this weird new sort of space.
And you know, maybe it's... Maybe they're just trying to work out. Like, you know, I said this last week.
What makes Donkey Kong tick as a character? Like, what is Donkey Kong's mechanic? Is he best used as a more lumbering platformer hero than Mario?
Or is it this? Is it it's about strength and just being a giant idiot monkey tearing up stuff? Because that's what this game does really well.
When you when you like give over to it, I think it's it just it just goes, oh, fuck it, you know, all this stuff can come back with a press of button if you wanted to. Let's just let's just wreck the joint and see what happens. Yeah, it's so weird.
It's so weird as a sales pitch.
Yeah, I'm going to remain curious and optimistic about this because I do wonder if it's it's just going to cohere better to play when it launches and in a demo environment, not every game demo as well.
So yeah, or yeah, perfectly, you know, so I just think it gets a lot of stuff right, like the feel of it and, you know, throwing a punch, smashing a rock, chucking a rock, setting a bomb off. Those interactions feel good. You know, smashing through crystal feels great in this game.
And that's that's what you would hope for from from like the Odyssey team. But yeah, I guess I keep saying the team has to be it just has to be right.
Well, that is that is the key question here, Matthew, is if this is made by the Odyssey team and we somehow still don't know who's made this because this is Nintendo and this is how they roll. Are you OK with getting this instead of a 3D Mario for probably four years or so?
Obviously, I want an Odyssey 2. Yeah. And I know that they could do it and it would be brilliant and it would be even more beautiful because of the extra hardware power.
But I also like Nintendo trying new stuff. I still have faith this is really going to go places. You know, I have faith that they know what they want to do with it.
They've built this tech for a reason. They've taken this approach for a reason. Like, there is a vision behind this game and, you know, maybe it's hard to get to, like, the peaks of that vision in, like, ten minutes.
Yeah. Absolutely.
And that's probably the problem with it, but I… yeah, there's enough moments where you're like, oh, that's really satisfying, or that's really good. And I know that as I get better at this game, I'll be able to make more of these things happen for myself.
Yeah, that makes sense. I think that it makes sense that, as well, that Nintendo is leading with Mario Kart as their one old dependable to kick the generation off. And then you know that Zelda will be probably three or four years down the line, and that Mario will probably be…
there'll probably be something Mario related in the next couple of years, I would say, you know? And that's bound to happen, whether it's a wonderful follow-up, or indeed maybe they're making 3D Mario at the same time, I guess we'll see. But, yeah, I think it's good for them to start with something you feel like you know and something you've never played before.
That feels like the right approach to me as a way to kick off the generation. Okay, well, those are headline games, Matthew, but we've got a lot more to discuss, so maybe it can be a little bit brisker on some of these, but…
Oh, yeah, absolutely. I just wanted to go into those, because I felt like those are probably the two things most people are going to get.
Yeah, I like that you remain optimistic about Donkey Kong as well. Just a 10-minute time demo just… Yeah, it's just near for the environment to get the most out of something.
So, yeah, especially when it's something new.
So I didn't do an amazing job. Like I say, I just haven't worked out how to talk about it yet.
Okay, that's fair enough. Okay, right. So Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which you have to pay for, but not much.
It's probably going to be about tenner, something like that. I don't know if that's been confirmed, Matthew, but this is basically a series of tech demos that show off the game wrapped up in a kind of overall welcome to the Switch 2 kind of interface. Did you get a sense of how substantial this is going to be?
Quite substantial. We explored two areas and they were lettered, like A and B, and I think a character in the game went, oh, this goes all the way up to L or something. So I got a feeling that there's quite a bit to it and it's going to go into different bits of the hardware in different areas.
Yeah, I thought this was, I don't know, pretty neat. And certainly not like a, you know, when people say, oh, it's just the tech demo, it's like, well, it's loads of tech demos kind of wrapped up in quite a fun sort of museum thing. I learned actually quite a lot about the Switch 2 that I was clicking on.
You know, had a slideshow about how the rumble works in HD rumble. It's not for everyone, but I was quite interested. You know, if you read all of a what-a-asks, it's like a what-a-asks, the game, and...
Guess who liked that idea?
I'm obviously into that shit.
Yeah, exactly. Welcome to the one man who would appreciate that more than anything else. OK, so, all right, I do want to talk about the tech demos in it, because I think that will really...
I mean, I will buy this anyway, because it's not that much money. And, you know, it should be a pack-in game, as we discussed, but the idea that it's only going to be a short barrier to entry works for me. So what do the kind of like, like the mini-games look like in it?
And how did they use the... Did they use the Switch 2 in any interesting ways, I guess?
They all used them in interesting ways. So, you know, there was a few that showed off the mouse pointer, and it was just... It was really dead simple.
It was steering the mouse pointer through loads of spiked objects for as long as you can, and it gets more and more hectic as it goes down. Really dead simple. There was another one where you'd move along a line and the rumble intensifies, and you just have to click where you think the rumble is at its strongest to sort of sense, like, how good a judge are you of vibrations, I guess.
And it's quite fun, and then, you know, it reveals, oh, you were, like, two points off perfect or whatever. These feel like they came from Miyamoto, who, like, famously likes to guess measurements of things. This is, like, one of his pastimes.
He's like, I wonder if I can guess how tall that chair is, and then he'll say, and then measure it, and see if he gets it right. There's a lot of that kind of shit in this. There's demos for, like, HD Rumble to show off how they've made it more sophisticated.
You've got to use, like, a pair of maracas, and you could feel, like, all the beads moving around in it in real time as you shifted it.
I have a big sander DME go ahead. I know that's a big deal for you, Matthew, so glad to hear that.
Yeah. You could press a button, and all the beads in the maraca would become rubber balls. And, like, it was really good.
But then I thought the HD Rumble demos in 1-2 Switch were really good. And HD Rumble never really became, like, an integral thing in any Switch game. But it is good, like, it is, you know, it's very impressive shown in this environment.
There was probably, like, the thing which made me laugh or smile the most out of everything I played across the whole day was there was a really silly demo trying to explain the concept of 4K by making you play a level of Super Mario Bros. in the correct resolution that it was made in on a 4K screen. So it's tiny.
And you just play through level 1-1 across the screen, and it kind of, it sort of unrolls as you play it, but it's so small. And I just liked it as a cute, like, hey, get this, this is how big resolutions are now. I thought it was, I don't know, I thought it was neat.
Yeah, I really like that.
If it's got like 50 moments like that, that's where I was like, well, I'm kind of on board with this. You know?
What if it's got 10 moments like that? Is that quite as, you know?
Yeah, but there were like 10 things in what I played, you know? And there's, I felt like we'd seen like a tenth of it.
Well, that's fair enough.
I mean, and as you completed them, they then had like variations on them or like harder versions of them.
I don't know.
Like it's, I think it's a lot of people have dismissed this as like, oh, they should have given me the 10 minute thing for free. And you're like, I think it's going to be a bit more than that.
But I think you can both be right. I think, you know what I mean? Yeah.
I think it's okay to say this should have been a pack in for the console at the price it is.
But yeah, yeah, you got to get. Yeah, I just, it's just, it's kind of boring that the conversation is dominated by that when actually like some people have made some cool stuff. Yeah.
Also something, something to discover, something that might surprise you at launch is, you know, surely something to get excited about, you know?
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think so. It has one of the demos asks you if you can, it shows you some footage or shows you an object moving. And you have to say what frame rate that was just played in.
That is like absolute gold, you know, for the modern internet obsession with frame rates. It's like, can you actually tell the difference between 60 frames and 120 frames? Here's a little test that says you can't.
I love that. That's really good. That's good.
I hilariously, I kept fucking this up. I was terrible at this game. Like, I genuinely couldn't tell the difference between 30 frames and 120 frames.
That's why I will never be on Digital Foundry. But I want to see Digital Foundry stream this and do this test. And if they don't all score 100%, well, it's game over for them as far as I'm concerned.
They will have to resign immediately. I love that. I think that you should get your lifetime sort of like Nintendo fan club pass sort of like laminated for failing to distinguish the difference between 30 and higher frame rates.
Because I can definitely tell the difference between 30 and higher frame rates. But I love that you just couldn't tell. It made no difference.
It gave me a choice of 30 or 120. And I thought, well, that can't be 120. That would be way smoother.
And I just maybe just don't really appreciate what that actually means. I don't know. So I thought it was more a deduction.
I thought, well, it has to be 30 then, even though I don't think that's right. And it wasn't.
Yeah, this is actually one of those games that I've not been reading about too much because I kind of just want to buy it and discover it. Because you could see from the way they were selling it, they're like, oh, there's loads of different things you can discover in this. And so I'm not, I don't need to be too forensic about what's in it.
I'll just happily play it at launch. So, but that has definitely whet my appetite, Matthew. So, yeah.
Yeah, I'll just say it's a very NGamer game. I think that's maybe why I kind of gelled with it. Like, this is the kind of thing that we would have taken all these mini games and turn them into high score challenges for the readers to do and things like that.
It made me kind of nostalgic for like, we play, weirdly. It's that kind of Nintendo thinking, where they get a bit kind of, you know, they sort of strip back and get a bit functional, but there's a little bit of charm to it.
Oh, good stuff.
Not everyone worked for NGamer, I realize. So, you know, your mileage may vary.
Yeah, but so many of those sickos listen to this podcast. So, it's the right audience for it. All right.
The Metroid Prime 4 Beyond. Let's talk about the Switch 2 mouse functionality, which is obviously used for aiming in this game. Did you get to grips with it?
And can you see yourself using it to play this game at launch, Matthew, rather than just using the analog sticks as usual?
I'd say the difficult bit of using a mouse to play Metroid Prime is that, if you imagine the right Joy-Con, you've still got to use the face buttons on it to change visors and things like that. And so you're clicking up top and your thumb's trying to work those face buttons. That was the challenge with this, was like getting a hand position where your thumb could still use the four buttons and your fingers could hit the triggers to shoot.
It didn't click at once, I won't lie, it took me most of the demo for my hand to find a place where it could sit comfortably. It eventually did, and once it did, all worked fine, very responsive. I actually found the mouse mechanic worked very well on the table.
I did it on my jeans, on my leg, and it also absolutely fine. I was quite impressed with both of that. That it just functionally worked.
Whether or not it's better than the gyroscopic aiming, which they did for Metro Primary Mastered, which you can also use, like that feels very responsive to me. And I can sit back with my hands and not have to worry as much. I don't know, like it's...
Metro Prime is, as a game, is just so elegantly made for like the limitations of like not being keyboard mouse, that just because they've made a mouse work, it doesn't mean like the game magically like unlocks or changes. You know, it's a game about locking on with one of the triggers. And that being like a core, you know, part of the experience, you know, a lock on kind of has no place necessarily in a, in a mouse led system.
So that's a little odd. I wouldn't say it's like better or inferior. It's just an alternative that works.
Much like using the, the PlayStation Move controller to play Killzone 3 back on the, back in the day. Yeah, I did, I did wonder if this might be the case, you know?
Yeah, I will probably, I will probably play this with the gyro aiming. But I've, I've, you know, I've literally just played Metroid Prime Remastered through. And so my head is in that space.
But yeah, and it works. It works. That's the headline is, it's absolutely fine as a mouse.
And I think your hand can find a place to sit. You know, you just have to put a bit of time.
Yeah, I think that it's, I watched a bit of this in the Treehouse demos. They did actually. And the way it looks has become a bit of a point of criticism for the game.
But I thought there were some cool things in it, like the, there was like a bit where Samus was fighting next to some Federation Force guys. And there was a little bit of NPC kind of interaction going on and stuff. And I thought, that's cool.
You know, it looks a little bit, that's a little bit more contemporary and a bit different. And I was curious how you found it compared to Metroid Prime, the original, because obviously that's like a 22-year-old game at this point. In fact, maybe older than that, 20, yeah, I think that's about right, actually, 23-year-old game anyway.
But it's...
Yeah, but it had a handsome remaster on Switch.
Yeah, it did. But, you know, the sort of like, like you say, elegant is the right word to describe Metroid Prime. It is literally the 2D Metroid translated.
And it's all about the very similar features functioning in a very specific way. And there's not like much, there's like no jankiness, no kind of like rough edges. It just all works so, so well.
And the environment is just so well constructed. It's kind of a near perfect game, the original Metroid Prime. So I was curious how you thought it stuck up next to that, next to the next to Metroid Prime 4.
It really doesn't feel very different at all. Like, you know, if I walked through a door in my Metroid Prime build and ended up in this game, like I wouldn't be surprised or shocked. I wouldn't feel like, wait a second, we're dealing with a whole different design philosophy here.
It doesn't help that what we played is like the opening 15 minutes, where it's like, here's how you use the pulse, you know, the arm cannon. Here's how you use a mothball. Here's how you scan, which is which is all the basic stuff.
I think it looks a bit nicer, like on the screen. Like it's one of those like Metroid Dread games, where it necessarily doesn't like hit you in a YouTube trailer, but then something happens, you know, in person, where you're like, oh, it's quite nicely done. I'd say there's a few like visual effects and like nicer textures than there are in Metroid Prime Remastered.
So it doesn't, it looks like a little bit of a step up. It's definitely a Switch game which is running really, really well on this Switch 2 because it is a Switch game. It's, yeah, I think it's going to sit, you know, on Switch.
I can imagine the Switch 1 version is going to sit visually very neatly alongside Metroid Prime Remastered, which I think looks really nice. And it is very, very good for the Switch 1. And there's a bit of a wow factor at like, you know, being able to play at like 4K 60 on the Switch 2, but I think the reason you can do that is because it is fundamentally a Switch 1 game.
And I'm kind of okay with that. Like, if it plays well, if they get the world right, you know, what I want from Metroid isn't necessarily the most cutting edge graphics. You know, I just want it to convey those environments well.
I want there to be cool atmosphere. I think you can achieve those things with the visual style it has. Yeah, I thought it was alright.
I was actually a little bit about all the NPCs, just because I'm like, please don't be a Metroid game full of fucking characters. Like, Metroid Prime, it's the isolation that works. You know, as that series went on, they added more and more sort of bastards for you to deal with.
And that was its undoing.
I could hear you reaching for Blorkos then, but you went with bastards to keep it varied, Matthew.
That's... I never met... The Metroid Prime 3 lot was just like, look at this quartet of Blorkos.
Or a real sorry bunch. And then there was Dark Blorko in Metroid Prime 2. I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
It's literally Dark Samus. It's just a big hit.
Dark Blorko is worth it. It was worth it. Even if the logic wasn't there, it was worth it.
So much mileage in Blorko. It's really gone a long way, that one. So let's go a slightly more rapid fire with some of these other games, Matthew.
So Drag X Drive, which is the wheelchair basketball game we talked about last week, and I said looks like a freebie giveaway every Thursday on the Epic Games Store. Wasn't meant to be sound quite as cruel as it did. But also, we didn't really point this out, but it's a game about wheelchair basketball, but also looked like it had the least accessible controls from the way they demoed it, just in terms of how intensive the mouse usage was.
So how was it? How did you find that the way it used the mouse controls held up?
You like drag each Joy-Con in the mouse formation as if it's like your hand on the wheel, and so you pull them both back, you go forwards, you use one more than the other, and you go left and right. It works, and I got my head around it, and the demo was built to teach you the controls and then get you into a game. I don't know if it's hugely fun or hugely interesting.
It felt mega tech demo-y to me of like, look what we came up with for the mice. But it's certainly not like a Splatoon or an Arms in terms of here's a new idea from Nintendo. It was absolutely fine, and I kind of have no interest in playing any more of it.
Did you lose your match and that same bloke came up and said, you've been drag X driven? And then you were like, oh, fuck off, mate. Did that happen, Matthew?
That didn't happen. Though someone did film a video of me looking very unimpressed and then sent it around to some other games journalist going, look at this. Because it was just me dragging the two mice and looking quite tired because it was towards the end of the session.
Not a great advert for it.
Maybe playing with three people who were like into being on a team. I was playing with two Swedish guys, I think, who had like no interest in passing to me and were fucking rubbish at it. That probably didn't help matters, but I just, I don't know.
It's like the mice were, but I don't know if this is necessarily it.
That's tough, that's tough to have a slightly lukewarm, should this have been a tech demo game out in the, out in public for people to play ahead of launch. That's a, that's a weird thing for Nintendo to put out there. Something quite lukewarm like this, but yeah.
Visually, like it's quite ugly.
Yes, that's why, like Nintendo would never make ugly games either.
Yeah, I just, I just don't know what, I don't know what was going on with it. I'd be really interested to read the developer interview that inevitably happens about this. And maybe there's like real intent behind it.
But I, this is currently like big question mark over this one for me, even after playing it. It's just so arduous to play, like dragging your hands constantly. It's tiring.
They should have chucked this in a bundle with the Switch Welcome Tour for like five extra quid or something. That probably would have been the way to sell it. But yeah.
But imagine like you, like you had to play Rocket League, but you had to pedal to make the car go forwards. You just wouldn't want to do it.
I've got to put my energy in Rocket League into swearing at Dave Scarborough. That's more important. Okay.
Zelda on Switch 2 though Matthew, did they have both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom or just one of the other? Okay, cool.
Yeah, they had both.
What did you play and how did you find it?
I played Tears of the Kingdom. I looked over a shoulder for Breath of the Wild. It's that game except running at 60 frames.
It isn't like a particularly like astonishing headline of that game running smoothly is great. Like it's an amazing game. I can now play it without all the things fucking up.
I went all the way up to the sky realm, jumped off, dived down, moved the camera around, all the lighting, the clouds. I just feel like the full vision of that game, you can just appreciate it so much more. Like when it is sort of flawless like that.
And you know what the art style of that game is, you know what its animation touches are, it just, yeah, it just, it looks amazing. I will be going back in and playing that again in this style. All the controls are the same, they haven't changed anything like that.
Like the only thing I came away thinking was like, I wonder if they ever went, do we sit on this for two more years and bring it out as a launch game? You know, there is that big like what if, I would love my first experience to have been this version. Rather than, there is always a tiny little but with my love of Tears of the Kingdom because of the technical woes.
You don't want to engage with the Ultra Hand as much because you know that the more you engage with it, the more the game is going to shit the bed.
I know no one wants to hear this, but it's pretty good that they have done Breath of the World and Tears of the Kingdom, both of them, for like day one on Switch. That's on Switch 2, that's really good. Like it's not like, we're going to do one now, we'll come back to the other one in like 18 months or something, which is normally how Nintendo does these things.
So that at least they deserve some credit for, right? You know, that's good.
Yeah.
Okay.
The funny thing was with this is I was like, how do I test the frame rate in a very limited time? Like it was only a 10 minute demo. So I dived down, I just started chopping every tree down and sticking them together.
And the guy was like, what are you building? Like, I can't wait to see what you're building. I said, I'm literally just building something to try and tank the frame rate.
There is no logic to what I'm doing at all, so don't get excited. And then he just had to watch me sticking random logs together and flinging it around. All worked fine, I will say.
But it did make me laugh that he thought something cool was going to happen. I was like, nope.
I would have just been like, quiet mate, I've got to go find a forest immediately, okay? Just see if this baby tanks, that'd be me trying to do it. Okay.
Good stuff, Matthew. Can't wait to play. I'm going to continue to as the kingdom on there.
I've got so much of that game left to play. And this feels very fortuitous for me. So, looking forward to that.
Into the next game on the list, because I played it, there was what looked like a French news broadcaster of some kind, him being filmed in our group.
Okay. And this was...
So I might be in the background of this guy's footage somewhere.
This is from Mario Party Jamboree, plus Jamboree TV.
Yeah, and Jamboree TV. I wanted to play this because it was the only demo there that used the camera. It's just iToy, isn't it?
Like, that's what this is. We obviously didn't set up the camera. It was in quite a controlled space.
Seemed to work really well. Like, we stood in front of it and there were four of us, one camera, cut us all out, turned us into little silhouettes. Bowser demanded things of us.
So that sounds weird. He made us do mini games for his entertainment. It's quite funny that the four of you, you all pop out of warp pipes.
And so it was me, Gerald, Gerald's friend from from his website and this French broadcaster.
Gerald's got to make these things.
And we were just all there in the pipes. I looked fucking awful sticking out of that pipe. Like I was almost the width of a pipe.
I've never felt more bad about my body than I did in that moment.
I don't want to hear that.
Bowser, why would you do this to a fellow large man?
Well, that's unfortunate. I also hate the Mario Party, of all things, putting this position. I mean, we don't tend to rag on critics too much on this podcast, we're supportive of games media, but Mario Party Jamboree having 82 on Metacritic, I feel like that response empowered Nintendo to put it in that direct and make a big deal about them giving it a new version on Switch 2.
It was such rubbish.
For a game with 82 on Metacritic, there was fuck all people queuing to play that game. That was the most unloved demo for sure by a lot, like no one was interested. Even though it had this interesting tech thing, that's why I wanted to do it.
Yeah, like I said, very functional Itoy-style games. We had to balance a load of Goombas on our heads. There's a mode where you just have to impress Bowser by shouting and moving your body as much as possible, and you're just being projected out of these pipes, shrieking, me and this French guy.
That's funny. All right, well, you know, it sounds like a real mixed affair, playing that one. I'm glad you got to spend time with Gerald, though, he's a good pal of mine.
I'm fond of Gerald.
Yeah, I've never met him before. Seemed very nice. Yeah.
Not very good at impressing Bowser. We won that mini game.
But less sweaty than you, so that's something. You know, that's-
Well, I think this is more of my body to move on camera.
Oh, I hate making- Honestly, I'm such a bummer to hear. As long as it's filming me, I'd be like, don't fucking film me.
I didn't give you permission. I guess maybe I have to sign those forms before you go in saying that like, we're going to film you. I'd just be like, do not film the side of my head while I'm playing computer games.
I won't look good and your viewers will not want to see it. Like, fuck off. That's how I feel about that.
So I totally get it, Matthew. Okay, a bit of a brief ports chat. Yakuza Zero was there, Matthew.
They've done a bespoke edition for this. I can't say I'm really feeling any urge to replay Yakuza Zero. A very kind of like PS3 era, PS4 game anyway, when it launched.
So a little bit weird that it's front and center, but it is one of the best games of the last 10 years. So how do you find it?
I'd just say if you haven't played it, this seems like a really nice version. Weirdly, I think the cutscenes look pre-baked, and so it would cut from the cutscenes looking fine to the game, which looked incredibly sharp in, I guess, 4K. That's always odd when the game begins to look better than the cutscenes, but it has reached that point here.
Again, I don't know if this is one of those ports that they're selling for like 50 quid, 60 quid or 70 quid, but, you know, it might come down in a sale one day and be like a tenner. It looks like a very good version of Yakuza 0. I hope they bring the rest of them to this.
The Yakuza Trilogy, that remastered collection, I'd like to play that properly and that would be a good Switch 2 candidate.
What, 3.5, that one?
Yeah.
Yeah, I kind of get it, but they're just so, they are so PS3 gen, aren't they? They're just like a bit of a...
They are, but...
But you've not played them, so yeah.
Yeah, I'd happily play it in that format. Also, shout out to Paul, who was manning the Yakuza demo station, a podcast listener, very nice guy.
Good stuff. All right. Well, that's lovely to hear.
Cyberpunk Matthew as well, which we last week were like, why would I play it on here when on PS5 or PC, it's pretty much the thing you use to demonstrate the hardware. So how did this hold up graphically, Mr. Digital Foundry?
Well, here we go. Like, it's not like the Witcher 3 on Switch situation, where that was like massively downgraded just to make it work. I'd say in individual frames, it looks quite like a good version of Cyberpunk.
Like, they haven't really dialed anything back. What I played, and I couldn't tinker with the two visual settings, the frame rate was like quite diabolical on it, which like, I don't know if I could necessarily play it like that on a TV, but I think there is a performance mode, which maybe like, dials down some of the fizzy stuff going on. I think it's, I think it is impressive, but it's also sort of like, not impressive enough to kind of get it over the line of acceptability, but like, something that small shouldn't necessarily be able to put that world on screen is sort of where I landed on it.
It's tough, it's not really, this is going to happen a lot I think, with this generation of ports. I think you're going to see a lot that do not look as good as the PS4 and Xbox version, but look fine. Maybe you see some compromises, but no like, Mortal Kombat style shit shows like you saw on Switch.
But a lot of middle stuff that is neither, that you've either played already or like, you can now play a slightly worse version on Switch, you know?
But there were that handful of miracle ports on Switch, of things which shouldn't have worked, but they made work really well, like Doom Eternal, yeah. I'd kind of hoped a little bit more of that, like I don't mind someone dialing down something to make it, be it, you know, perform, behave a bit better on the console, you know? I don't need it to be like the full fidelity to the full cyberpunk experience, if it's gonna run like ass, but that's too extreme.
I played through the mission fine. It wasn't like unbearable or anything. And the guy next to me was like, wow, this looks amazing.
So I was like, well, fair enough, you know, different strokes, different folks.
Well, that's why they're pulling it, right? They want to find that audience who have not bought high-end hardware to play elsewhere. And, you know, yeah.
Yeah. And it's the version with, it also comes with the expansion that they did a couple of years ago, which is a pretty great version of Cyberpunk. So it's, you know, it's at least comprehensive if this is where you want to go for it.
But, yeah, let's see what happens between now and launch. Maybe they'll tighten up a bit.
A few other ports that were there that Matthew Peony saw these over people's shoulders. Street Fighter 6, Hogwarts Legacy, Split Fiction.
They all looked decent to me. Street Fighter 6, big crowd of that. People seem to be really up for it.
You know, not obviously a game I play loads of. You can just tell, I don't know, people are like pumped about a version of that game that they can play on the move or with their mates or me up in a place and play Street Fighter. I completely get that.
Split Fiction looked pretty good. Weird, I was distracted though, because I was watching the demo over someone's shoulder and then I realized it was Dara O'Briain.
Oh, right.
And he was playing it with his kid. Because I was thinking like, oh, God, I hope these people would move on so I can play this demo. I was about to give them a bit of the old...
The Eugene Acker and Luigi's Mansion.
The Eugene Acker treatment. I was going to start tutting. And then I was like, I better not.
This guy's legit. Hogwarts.
I love Harry Potter, mate.
Looked absolutely fine.
Yeah, I need a big Harry Potter guy.
I guess the other one I give a little shout out for is they had four things playing GameCube games on the Switch Online service. And they all look pretty sharp, pretty smooth. Thought F-Zero looked a little choppy in places, actually.
Couldn't work out what was going on with that. Because I hadn't seen that in other online footage of like the Treehouse. So I don't know if it was set up wrong or something.
But there was something going on with that one. And I was like, is that right?
They should add that feature from the Welcome Tour to every game. We're like, guess the framerate, Matthew. Oh, F-Zero, maybe 22 FPS.
They're like, wrong, it's 120 FPS.
But yeah, you should just say like, is this right or is this wrong? Like, do you sense that something is wrong with this game? And yeah, like correct.
Something is going wrong. I thought I saw someone playing Mario Strikers Charge there, which they hadn't announced as one of the games. But I don't know if I just imagined that, or if it was just a video of it playing.
The heat overcame you and you start hallucinating. That's the only explanation.
Well, I wasn't going to queue up to play f***ing Mario Strikers on the GameCube. Like, that's obviously not a thing that was going to happen. I had Jamboree to play with a French broadcaster.
The thing that I'm most curious about with the GameCube is, that's probably actually of everything on the console, the thing I'm most curious about in terms of which games are actually going to be here. Maybe even more so than what the first party lineup is next year. I'm more interested to see what the long-term roadmap for this is.
Is it in a year from now, is it like 10 games on there or is it like 20 games? What kind of games will they be? Will it be a very, very low bar and we do just see the same few on there?
Will we see like Monkey Ball on there? Will we see Rogue Leader on there? I think that's what everyone's waiting to see with this stuff.
Rogue Leader would be good.
If you bother to do the work to emulate these things, you might as well get all the more obscure lost games on there.
It's a really strange service based on what they've done with previous platforms. Some consoles have had quite unusual deep cuts on there. Some have just been the most obvious, like, top ten games that you would imagine.
I don't feel like Game Boy Advance Selection on the Switch Online has gone to any interesting places. The things that they teased in that first trailer were all first party, very obvious things. There was no Eternal Darkness in that list.
That was a bummer. I at least want that. We shall see.
But they look good. Yeah, they look good and yeah, no real kind of complaints on that. I wonder if they've got the rewind function.
I couldn't see if they had or not like that, some of the older retro games have.
Well, I guess we'll wait and see on that one. But it sounds like Matthew, you are very, very pro Switch 2 after playing all of that. Are you super buzzed to get in your hands on June 5th?
Yeah, I am. I think it is a really nice thing. I think people are going to breathe a sigh of relief when it comes through the post on the day and they go, I don't feel too bad about spending 400 pounds.
I really think that is going to be the reaction to the actual hardware. Oh, OK. This feels OK to me.
But, you know, I might be wrong. You can come back and tell me that I'm wrong and that should only be 200 quid or whatever. But I am feeling OK.
I think the games are pretty strong. Good vibes in the room, good energy in the room. It was a room designed to give you good vibes, admittedly.
OK, well, I'm looking forward to Mario Kart World more after hearing you talk about it, so that's good. And Donkey Kong, perhaps, like 1% less, but that's OK.
Oh, I wish I had a good line. I don't have a good take on it.
That's all right. You only play the 10 minute demo.
This is why I could never work for online.
This is why we're podcasts.
I need 48 hours to think.
This is why when Matthew reviews a game for Edge, it drives him completely insane trying to come up with what is the take. It happens every time.
Well, you have to get it right. It's important to get it right and not to splurge bullshit.
No, I agree.
There's too much of that online.
I do agree with you. Okay. Let's definitely do quick fire for our listener questions here, Matthew, because I think we've probably covered a bunch of this already.
Oh, right. I forgot about those. Yeah, yeah.
Then a lot of them, I've probably answered.
Okay. We got these questions from the listeners in the pod questions channel, so thank you to everyone who dropped them in there. Angrika asks, do you think the Switch 2 will get an achievement system system-wide?
I've seen people saying they aren't engaging with the Zelda ones on the app. Have they already confirmed, Matthew, that there's no achievements in the Switch 2?
Yeah, there's no in-built achievement system. I think if there is going to be anything, it will be like the Zelda. Donkey Kong seemed to have some kind of trackers in it.
It said, like, you've collected one-hundredth of this thing and one-hundredth of that thing. I thought was that going to be like a medal system in that game, but aside from that, no achievements.
Oh yeah, I'm fine with that personally. Doom of an Ass can you use a headset for a game party chat or will it only be via the in-built mic slash speaker? Did you learn anything about this?
No, on the site they said it would work with headsets fine, so you know, look at the site.
Google it. Redhole asks, basic question, I know a bit interested in Matthew's general impressions on the screen. I feel like we've covered this.
Extra real estate and upgrading resolution, offset the OLED, I mean, not totally, but it's the screen that will wow you is basically your take, wasn't it?
I'd say just about and it's the screen it's got and it's the screen that you'll use and you'll get used to it.
How much is the welcome pack worth? This is from Balladeer, ultimate Nintendo head of the Discord and main character on Nintendo Direct Day every time, Balladeer. Well, zero pounds obviously, but how much would you be tempted to pay?
I don't like the framing of that. It's worth something, work's gone into it. People should be able to pay for people's work.
Wish it was a pack in, if it is 10 quid, seems good. Seems fine. Let's say fine.
Rather than good.
Another question here Balladeer, my big worry with Donkey Kong is that it will devolve into just smashing everything on screen, which doesn't sound like the best time. I'm sure Nintendo have thought of a way around it. Did you get a feeling as to what that is?
I mean, that's the big question of this podcast really, isn't it Matthew? Just that we don't really know the shape exactly, but there are things to really like about it.
Yeah, the smashing is good. I like the smashing. I want to do more smashing in that game, and we'll get back to on the biggest structure of it.
I'm going to skip this next one, because I think that could just be Googled and not asked to us. Ask Nintendo about Bluetooth, that's not us. How does the new stand seem?
You probably didn't see this, did you Matthew? Because it was all...
No, all the ones I used were quite locked in. So, again, terrible hands on. I couldn't tell you about the magnetic click and I can't tell you about the stand.
Well, thanks anyway, SAFCJack91. Dynamic Calories asks, on a scale of 1 to 10, how good is the feeling of hearing Ooh Banana, Donkey Kong Bonanza? Bonus, how does it rank against the various Star, Shine, Moon, Get moments?
Did the sound being drowned out mean that you didn't get to experience this, Matthew?
I didn't quite hear it. Typographically, the words Ooh Banana or Ooh Banana aren't particularly, like, they don't jump out at you on a screen, though I do quite like it when Donkey Kong eats the banana, or it like shatters and then it eats all the bits. The eating is quite good.
Mario doesn't eat the moon, you know?
Good stuff. Okay, Budge asks, is Monty Mole a playable character in Mario Kart World? Again, could have been Google, this one, but...
I don't see him on the title screen, but I think he is in there, right?
Just side question, are you happier with all the randos over them trying to like dig deep into the Nintendo roster, which will probably do a bit when they do DLC, but were you happier that they did this approach instead?
I'm happy that they kept it within like the Mario universe. Like I didn't want it to be full of like, you know, I don't want like Ryu from Street Fighter to be in there.
Don't want Sora from Kingdom Hearts to be in there.
I fucking do not want Sora from Kingdom Hearts in that ever. Anything. I don't even want it in Kingdom Hearts.
Spooner Sparrowhawk asks, how does Mario Kart feel to play compared to 8? Does the grinding feel natural like drifting or just automatic like the zero gravity stuff?
You actually had to work quite hard to do the grinding, like landing on the grinding bars and there was a weird little hop, which I couldn't quite get my hands around in the time, although I didn't explain it hugely clearly, but I feel like there's going to be quite a lot of like sort of hidden mechanics that you can exploit to go faster. And so I'd say it's less, less automatic than Mario Kart 8. I think you have to work a little harder to really get to grips with it all.
It's my takeoff to playing it for two races.
Good stuff. Well, the last question is about the screen, which I feel like we've covered in depth now. So thanks for the interactions.
And yeah, no doubt we'll come back and talk about the console when it launches. We've both pre-ordered it. Don't know, Matthew getting to the event is good.
Don't know if we can ever get on that much treasured Nintendo mailing list. Matthew, probably not. I know few who have.
But nonetheless, very exciting and very cool that they invited you.
So hopefully this was valuable and these half-formed thoughts weren't too half-formed and irritating.
No, I think it's great that you had a... It's nice that you had a day out that made you excited about video games. You know, that's...
On that basis, it was well worth it. Plus, of course, the pizza franchise that you purchased and that we're going to be running full-time very shortly. So that's good.
Okay, Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and similar name on Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter, BlueSkyLetterboxd. You can get me on all of those platforms.
And I just watched The Conversation, the Coppola film. How exciting. I have a tiny bit of pod admin to do, Matthew.
I've been told that our Discorders raised £343 for special effect. They did it as charity draft event where they all competed to pick the best games. Yeah, it was cool.
We both engaged and voted on it. Superboy won 68% of the vote of the Xbox draft with this list. Oblivion, Halo 3, Bioshock, Forza Horizon 4, Gears 2, Crackdown, Mass Effect, KOTOR, Indiana Jones of the Great Circle and Fable 2.
And Alex won the Nintendo draft with Mario Galaxy, Breath of the World, Pokemon Heart, Gold Soul Silver, Super Metroid, Smash Bros. Ultimate, Phoenix Wright's Attorney, Pikmin 4, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Mario Kart 8 and Tetris DS. And Emily won with 58% of the PlayStation draft with this list, MGS3, FF10, Burnout 3, Gran Turismo 4, Time of Splitters 2, Matthew's favorite game of all time, Wipeout HD, Shadow of the Colossus, Uncharted 2, Tekken 3 and Astrobot.
Immaculate taste there, great list. So I just wanted to shout out the Discord for that, Matthew. A net gain from the Discord among the net losses.
Yeah.
I'm only joking. patreon.com/backpagepod, if you like what we do and want to support the podcast, get two additional podcasts a month. Me and Matthew are about to record the Lukewarm Exclusives Hall of Fame episode for our Patreon Exclusive episode this month, and they're also doing some of the best first episodes of TV shows ever.
So looking forward to that, and we're at BackpagePod on all social media. Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
