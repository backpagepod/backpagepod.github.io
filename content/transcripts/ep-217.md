Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we have a returning guest. It's Joe Skrebels, a former colleague of Matthew's who last appeared on the podcast four years ago on the Nintendo 3DS episode we did. And let's count in recommending Juson on the 2023 Alternative Game of the Year Awards episode.
I don't.
Okay, fair enough. Joe, it's great to have you back. How you doing?
I'm very good. Has it really been four years?
Yeah, it was March 2021 that we recorded that 3DS episode.
And I did the Indie Games episode before that one.
Oh, wait, no, that was, I'm just incorrect. You are right, that was, I think, 2022. I fucked it.
That's still ages. I do apologize. That's fine.
Have you made jokes as well about how you thought that that resulted in you never being invited back or that we killed the Indie Games Hall of Fame?
Look, I've got some faith in myself. I don't think you'd refuse to invite me back because of my choices of affordable space adventures, but I did wonder whether that was so hideously unsuccessful as a format because of my choices that you killed the entire series.
Not true.
It's rare you get a series with part one and part two and nothing else.
That's true. I mean, to be fair, it's because I was worried that my own choices would be too conventional. We may resonate that at some point, Matthew.
Do you want to do another Indie Games Hall of Fame?
Yeah, I've got some indie games in me.
Yeah, we can do that, I suppose. I don't want to just be like wheeling out Norco again. I feel like I'm always wheeling out Norco for these podcasts.
So yeah, I'll give that some thought.
It really is unfortunate for the podcast that trades heavily on Blorco that Norco is such a favourite.
Yeah, it definitely hangs over that game, unfortunately, but such as it is. So, Joe, you listen to the podcast quite regularly. I do sometimes get messages from you about the podcast as it's going.
Any reflections on it of late as a listener?
I'm a big fan of the running out of regular draft ideas and coming up with more off-the-wall suggestions. The sub-80 Metacritic one, that is so my wheelhouse for a draft. Not that I'd want to be on it, just that as a listener, that's where I want to be.
I want to be listening to people get into real struggles to name stuff. That's the love I have for the drafts, is when a category is slim at best. So, yeah, more of that.
If I may speak for the listenership, yeah, I want a bit more of the mad bullshit drafts. That's the good ones.
For some reason, they've all become mad bullshit drafts. I mean, I feel like there was a time where they were all fairly conventional, and we were kind of ramping up to some slightly weirder ones. But now they all have to have some kind of novelty categories, or extra guest, or reason for being.
So now we're going, yeah, exactly. So it just means this is endless kind of like drive to one up ourselves. So yeah, God knows where that will lead.
But certainly the next big one we're going to do is the Nintendo Switch draft with Catherine. But after that, we're doing the mega draft on the Xbox 360 with four people. So yeah, so lots of nonsense to come.
But yeah, I like the four people one because the eye of Sauron, which is Sam, is directed at three other people rather than just me. I don't take the entire brunt of all the shit talking in mind games. So I am all for that.
More people, 10 people. That's what I want.
I did think about adding Jeremy Peel to the 360 draft as well, Matthew. You have five people. It'll take about four hours to record if we do that.
So I just don't know.
You need two categories. Good game, bad game. It'll take two hours.
It'll be fine.
Perfect. I see no issue with that. Okay.
Well, that's good, Joe. It's great to have you back on because this is a specialist subject for you. We wanted to have you on last year for Dragon's Dogma 2 actually, but in lieu of that, we've brought you on for the other big Capcom monster killing game.
So Monster Hunter Wilds is out this week. It's out literally today. If you're listening to this episode when it's released.
So Joe, you're one of the Monster Hunter guys. What's your history with the series?
Look, I want to set my stall out very early.
Here we go.
That I am in no way a Monster Hunter expert. I am a Monster Hunter enthusiast. I love the series and I've loved it for a while at this point, but I just know that I will get something wrong and proper Monster Hunter people will be furious with me.
So I just want to make it very clear.
I don't know if proper Monster Hunter people will listen to this podcast.
Oh, come on. What else are they listening to? This is their podcast.
They've got to love the Monster Hunter chat on this podcast.
I don't know.
They're coming in for it. That's what's happening.
I think there's a lot of crossover. I don't think a lot of Souls-like and FromSoft obsessives listen because they know that we can't give them that. And I kind of think of them in the same way.
Monster Hunter guys are more chill. Come on. They'll just hate me for pretending to be one of them.
You guys, you're safe. It's fine.
Okay. I retract my previous statement. We have brought on a man who is aware of Monster Hunter.
No, no, no. Let's not go all the other way.
Leave me.
Let me set my stall out. I love Monster Hunter. I love what it does.
I love how it looks. I just don't want people to think I'm like a G-rank guy from the old days who played on PSP. I'm just, I'm not fully, I'm not fully immersed.
I just think it's brilliant and I love talking about it. And that's why I'm the perfect person to have on this podcast.
That's perfect for us.
Yeah.
That works for us. You weren't there on the JR line in Tokyo playing with your three pals during your gap year, circa 09. That's not what you were doing.
You haven't written a blog post about it for Kotaku, about how you used to do that.
No, not yet. The only thing I've ever written for Eurogamer was me, in retrospect, possibly unnecessarily aggressive about why Monster Hunter was better than Destiny. That was a pitch I made.
It seems unnecessary, but...
Unaccountably accepted, but good on him. It was money I needed at the time. But yeah, and that's my credentials.
I can shout at people about Monster Hunter, so I will attempt to do that for the next x minutes.
Fair. I mean, I appreciate that anyway. And also, you fit right in with The Back Page coming on and apologising about your expertise in advance.
Yeah, that's exactly what we do here. So, you know, really fitting in perfectly. So I appreciate that.
Matthew, what's your history of Monster Hunter? So we have a bit of context for that going into this.
I had to cover it, obviously, on my Nintendo magazine days. And I would say it was kind of an enforced interest to begin with. Like it wasn't something I'd track down and played.
Like I hadn't played it on PSP. I remember the days, and this is pre-Joe being at Future, way back when there was a Capcom PR called Leo Tan, who was a huge Monster Hunter guy. And he was really into it, and he used to come to the Future offices.
I thought just to play it with other journalists who were also into it, I think Rich Stanton was one of them. I definitely went to the Chinese restaurant round the corner from Future while people played Monster Hunter on their PSPs, feeling completely left out.
Is that the one that looks like an estate agent, Matthew?
Yeah, that one.
Yeah.
Really confusing layout to the front end of that restaurant.
Yeah, you've got to make sure you don't, because there is an estate agent next to it. You need to make sure you don't go in there and order your Chinese lunch.
I literally cannot imagine what that restaurant looks like. That's such a confounding visual image.
Is there something about, there's like images of the dishes, I think, in the picture frames there that make it look like you're buying it?
Are they like hanging on metal wires in strings in the front window?
I like the idea of two customers getting it confused and there being a very hungry guy who ends up owning a bungalow.
Yeah, we can't rule out that that's happened. But yeah, you really have to see it to understand it, Joe. There's something a bit amiss about it.
It doesn't scream restaurant when you first see it. It is a restaurant, but yeah, the ambiguity is not cleared up by the front end of the restaurant, I would say.
A restaurant being described as a bit amiss is really unsettling to me.
That's the title on TripAdvisor of a review.
A bit amiss.
Anyway, that's where I first saw Monster Hunter being played in the wild by journalists, but I wasn't part of that initial wave, which is a very long winded way of saying that I had to get into it because Monster Hunter Tri came to the Wii and was being localised and brought to the West, and we were constantly told Nintendo UK, they're behind Monster Hunter Tri in a big way. They really want to push this one and make it into a big thing. As a result of that, we could do lots of Monster Hunter covers with fancy Monster Hunter cover treatments and whatnot.
We covered it more than we would have naturally covered it, I think, because Nintendo UK were into it, and so we were into it. Yeah, I was just diving in and trying to learn it on console. We imported it from Japan.
Imagine playing Monster Hunter for the first time entirely in Japanese because it is not necessary. Back then, it really wasn't a very friendly game in English. And yeah, I just remember having so many frustrating evenings of like, I literally can't progress the quest.
I couldn't get a monster to appear. The first few quests in those games are like, pick some herbs and kill like a small Velociraptor thing. And I couldn't get the first hunt.
I didn't know how to trigger a hunt. So playing it now is just so far beyond what I originally played. And yeah, I kind of sort of stuck with it, covered various iterations on NGamer, O&M, and now play it for fun, but not religiously so.
Matthew, you've just reminded me, do you remember when you made me play Animal Crossing New Leaf in Japanese? Yeah, that's the least appropriate game to play in Japanese you could possibly have made me play.
Yeah, I'd say its main, maybe only charm, is its beautiful writing, and you're like, well, that dog seems good, I guess.
I just remember a lion being furious at me, and I could not work out what to do.
Yeah, listen, that's the baptism of fire you get on Nintendo magazines.
Yeah.
You have to play some bullshit in Japanese and get cross.
That was the hazing.
I'd love to read the preview coverage that came out of Matthew's Japanese Monster Hunter copy and Joe's Japanese Animal Crossing copy.
I can tell you exactly what mine was. Mine was a diary of me struggling to understand what was happening in Animal Crossing New Leaf. That was the entire thing.
And as is my want on our them, it just became a sort of exercise in me trying to write in a surreal tone and possibly failing.
No, it was good. It was funny.
Yeah, it was quite a bizarre experience. I would love to read the Monster Hunter thing though, because that is fundamentally like, the game doesn't work. That's a whole different deal.
Oh, it was bad. I definitely played Monster Hunter 3 on Wii, online with some readers for the magazine, with the Wii Speak peripheral. You know that horrible microphone you had to put on top of your TV?
Now that was an incredibly cursed experience of just three very rough sounding, not because of the voices, because of the peripheral, that these three grainy reader voices coming through a TV and just feeling like I never want to do this again. I feel like this is a level of openness too much for me. Apologies if any of them listen to this podcast.
I hope you had a nice time.
Amazing. Well, where do you go from there? Let's think.
Monster Hunter's history is a series. Starts on PS2 as this PS2 online, early foray into that whole situation before online gaming really took off on consoles the next generation. But during the next generation, it really capitalizes on the wireless handheld multiplayer stuff that you can do with the PSP and becomes a huge deal on that platform, and particularly in Japan becomes a monster seller.
Sorry, that's a terrible, I've had, it's late when we're recording this, let me try again, a massive seller, and a huge kind of like cultural force, really just like a proper breakthrough PSP game shifted so many PSPs, and then very significantly made the transition to become an exclusive 3DS title, The Next Generation, which Shuhei Yoshida, who's just retired from Sony, talked about that as I think the scariest moment of his career when Monster Hunter moved over to 3DS from PSP. So, yeah, it went from being this home console thing to a bit more of a handheld concern, but then there are still forays into home console play at the same time as sort of documented there with the Wii and the Wii U, but it really takes until Monster Hunter World, about six years ago, I think, to bring the series back to home console in this really splashy way and also to bring it to PC in this huge way as well. It became the biggest game in the series, absolutely huge.
So yeah, it's had an interesting history, but only recently has sort of broken out in the West, which we'll talk about a little bit as well. But Joe, fundamentally, what is the appeal of Monster Hunter? Is it stabbing weak points with pals?
And I'm asking that as someone who's just been doing that thing, that one thing in Monster Hunter Wilds all week. So yeah, what is the appeal of this series, do you think?
There's a few. I think ultimately it's an incredibly solid but idiosyncratic action game. It sits outside of the traditional Capcom canon, or at least it did for a long time, but I think it has so much of their action game history built into it.
It has that unique feel of an action game design that's been created so specifically for the game it's in. It's not just like we need you to be able to kill these things in the most efficient way, it's that feeling of we have created an incredibly deliberate and occasionally incredibly obtuse set of systems for you to work your way through and understand how to be better at this. And I was kind of thinking about how...
So I got into Monster Hunter primarily in very much in a lineage of forced play on Nintendo magazines when Matthew put me on to play some of it on the Wii U version of Monster Hunter. So that was Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, I think. The one where you could play on 3DS and Wii U.
And I really bought into that. On the train in, I'd be doing my little gathering quests, and then when I got home from work, I'd be going out with friends and dealing with it. Dealing with the monster problems.
And the thing that really struck me as I was thinking about it is, there's very few games I can remember where it's so clear in my mind that I was taught how to play this game by another person. And I don't know if you'd count it as a friend of the pod or a rival of the pod, but Sean Bell from the Computer Games Show. Friend.
We're going friend.
We don't have rivalries with TCGS. It's not worth it, Joe.
Because you're so far ahead or I'm trying to start?
No. No. Just war of words with Dave Turner.
It's a bad idea.
That's an incredible point. And I'd like to consider myself Switzerland in this situation. Don't come at me, Dave.
But I remember so clearly, Sean Bell talking me through over a 3DS, again, weird continuation of this, a 3DS speaker mic, how to lay a shock trap and tranquilize a monster. And that is my abiding memory. It's like I was playing with another person and they taught me something that I didn't understand about the game, that fundamentally changes how you approach some many of the fights in that game.
And I think that's part of the appeal is, there's long running, and in many cases, I think, justified criticism of how these games tutorialize. But it happened in the right way for me, in such a way that I'm sort of glad I had to be taught by a person as opposed to the game, because it became so much more of that cooperative feeling. Like, there is a piece of me that still considers Sean my sensei in Monster Hunter to this day.
And I think that's a huge part of it, is playing with other people, but within the context of this hideously complex action game. I just think it's wild that they've managed to pull that off and become as much of a success as they have. And that's not to...
Sorry, this is a very long answer, but that's also not to say... I mean, part of the appeal is, the monsters are fucking dope. Like, they're so cool and so weird.
The designs... And Wilds, I think, they've really taken another step into, like, some of these designs are truly bizarre, but feel somehow rooted in the ecology of this place. That's amazing.
And then, yeah, I will bore you later on my feelings about how armor systems and loot works in these games. Yeah, I just think it's a series of very odd, very singular decisions that kind of coalesce into a shape of game that has remained fundamentally unchanged for this long and yet continues to add new pieces and new ways to think about it. I just think it's like it's a fascinating like experiment in how they've made these things.
That point you make about how it exists outside of the traditional Capcom sort of hack and slash action game ecosystem is such a good point. If you go into, you know, Wilds' Week expecting that it's only really about 25% that and then you kind of understand that really they've built this whole other thing. It just exists in a kind of like parallel sort of evolutionary chain really to anything else Capcom has made.
Yeah, so idiosyncratic, a good way of putting it. Matthew, what do you think before we get into armor systems and other such business? What do you think?
Does Joe pretty much hit the nail on the head there?
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, you know, I definitely written down just the strength of the monsters. Like, you know, if you sort of zoom out, it's just a series of incredible boss fights and, you know, the monster design, the framing of them in the environments, the music, the different like waves and behaviour changes through the fight.
It's not just a, you know, here's a thing you're going to fight it for five minutes. You're given, I think, traditionally, 50 minutes per hunt. And, you know, they're meant to be quite drawn out.
The way it kind of surges and then weakens and looks a bit tired and you feel a bit sad for it at times. And then it suddenly reveals that it can do something really horrible when it's cornered. And that's just really thrilling.
And each monster, you know, of which there are, you know, tens in each of these games is an opportunity to kind of go through that little kind of narrative arc with them, which is just really, really exciting. I think it has quite a goofy sense of humour as well. You know, around the edges, there's quite a lot of weird iconography, like the felines, the little cats that kind of help out.
There's like a little pig mascot. Is it Poogee? Puglet?
Something like that. You know, there's these ridiculous cooking animations where these cat chefs make you a meal, which you then gobble up with your mates beforehand. There's lots of weird little touches, like the sps...
Like, I don't know if this is the same in Wilds, but in the old games, like if you'd sort of sprint away, you'd do like a quite panicked, like, ah, shit, there's a monster chasing after me kind of animation.
I've seen that a lot.
Yeah, and that's, you know, that stuff's just great. And there is, you know, maybe Joe will get into this with some of the armour stuff, but I do like the sense of ownership that builds through the game. You know, that everything you get and craft is made from things you've hunted, and so you're kind of wearing the spoils of those previous fights.
And things just become a bit more emotionally resonant because you're like, well, I had to really grind for that hat, or, you know, the ability to do this, or, you know, I set myself a goal to sort of improve myself in these particular stats and worked hard for that and to sort of see it come to fruition and pay off in your tactics payoff is really satisfying. Like when you manage to conquer any bit of this very idiosyncratic world, it just feels like a huge victory. But, you know, that doubly goes for sort of co-op and having friends kind of talk you through it.
And, you know, I've definitely... What little grasp I have of Monster Hunter is largely, you know, Rich Stanton explaining a couple of basics to me 10 years ago or whatever. So you do carry that stuff.
Every one of these games needs like a Rich or a Sean in it. Just pops up at the start. That's how I tutorialise it.
Yeah.
Think to your point about, to go back to how the Monsters work as well, the best way of being able to sort of think about it in my head is, you know, Monsters are classically pattern learning exercises. And this is sort of, if you want to be highfalutin about it, it's sort of the next step in how you think around that. Like, I've seen it described as a dance a lot.
You learn how a Monster moves. You learn what its steps are and what it's telegraphing to you. But then, at the same time, because there's 14 weapons, of which most of them are fundamentally different in how they work, you're effectively having to learn the steps of your own dance at the same time as managing that against what the Monster's going to do.
And that feeling of mastery, as you go through a game, the first time you fight in Monster Hunter Tri, like Legiacrus or Legiacrus or however you're meant to say it, they didn't have voice acting in that one that I remember. They probably did. The first time you fight it, it just seems insurmountable and you muddle your way through and hopefully beat it.
And by the last time you fight it, you're just sidestepping everything it does. You know exactly the steps you need to take to beat it. You know exactly what elements and what armor to wear.
And the way it's sort of quite quietly builds that in you is, I'm not a fighting game guy. I'm not a pursuit of perfection like gamer. I don't enjoy sort of setting myself the challenge of being incredible at a game.
But I think it does it really quite seamlessly in the background of how you play these things. You just slowly learn it. And I find that more satisfying than most games of this kind.
Partly just because of repetition, but partly because it does such a good job of showing you what they're going to do. It just takes learning to realise what it's showing you. It's kind of...
It's masterful.
My favourite dance move is called Stab Them Up The Arse A Million Times. Absolutely, yeah.
That's... I think that's a Spanish dance move.
You roll down the length of their body, and then you stab them up the arse, and you do that over and over again till I die.
Classic.
Classic stuff. I've seen that strictly many times. Always a smash.
Just Len on the end going, Ten! Oh, I love it!
You stabbed him up the arse a million times!
RIP, Len Goodman. Okay, so why do you each think it took Monster Hunter a minute to crack the West well over a decade after it became this PSP phenomenon in Japan? Is it because it's so complex, seemingly from the off, and there just isn't quite that onboarding ramp to the earlier games?
Because I played Freedom Unite 2 on PSP and just thought this is so abstract to me that this would sell millions of copies somewhere else, but come here and I would be completely baffled by it. Just feel like it's confrontationally sort of obtuse. And yeah, I would never have predicted that the appetite for it would exist, but obviously, taste in games have evolved over the past decade.
And I think people have never had more appetite for more complex types of game experiences. And yeah, whether it's... I don't know if it's partly that or something else.
What do you think, Joe?
I mean, it's Dark Souls, isn't it? Is that what we're saying? Like, to a certain extent, I genuinely think the success of Dark Souls just made people a little more open to going, yeah, I'll take something that will kick my ass for a while, because it's probably good if people tell me it is.
And I honestly think that's a huge part of it. I also, I have this kind of theory that, like, the Monster Hunter series has effectively been developed backwards to most series. Like, the classic example is Assassin's Creed 1 comes out and everyone's like, wow, OK, story is unexpected.
The way that this works is unexpected. It looks amazing. And then Assassin's Creed 2 is when everyone's like, cool, right, they nailed what Assassin's Creed is.
Whereas, for so long, Monster Hunter was this, like, immaculate set of ideas that were presented in quite a hard to get to way. And it feels like the last few have been an exercise, and Wilds is 100% part of this continuum, are the point at which they were like, and now we've made it a game you understand, as opposed to this set of individually brilliant settings and systems. It's now like, this has a modern format.
And so they kind of got themselves into a position where it became accessible enough to people looking for something new.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's it. That's my answer.
And I think that's a great answer, actually, because they definitely have thought a lot about the player onboarding experience in worlds like tons and tons about it. And we'll talk about that. But yeah, it's a really good way of looking at it.
It started in its most pure kind of complex form. And over time, they have reached out to more and more players with that first kind of touch point and making sure it feels like they know what's actually going on. Matthew, what do you think?
Is that pretty much on the money? That it's just that mix of, you know, like a yearn for something more complex in the wake of the Dark Souls series taking off?
I can definitely see that. I realize my job on this episode is to speak after Joe and just agree with everything Joe just said.
You can say other things.
This is how it should be when you have probably the defining Monster Hunter expert of his time.
Did you believe we rolled that back to Guy Who Is Aware of Monster Hunter?
No. Yeah, I'd agree with that. That harsher, purer version of Monster Hunter succeeded in Japan before it did here because it was built around local carp and there is a much bigger local carp culture in Japan.
I don't know if it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing. Is that local carp culture, does that exist because of Monster Hunter? Or does Monster Hunter exist because there was an appetite for it?
I don't really have the answer to that. But before Monster Hunter was a thing in the West, you were constantly hearing about train cars full of people playing ad-hoc multiplayer with each other, or business meetings, companies who'd shut down for an hour at lunch and go and play. Monster Hunter in a room together, it was just a huge cultural thing.
In that environment, the weirdness of the game and the fact that it needs to be explained to you by another human often, it makes perfect sense that it could blossom in that environment. As it comes to the West, does it become slightly more traditional? There are now online modes that aren't just local, you know, you can play remotely and that's part of it.
They begin to add more story. I mean, I think for me, it felt like Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate broke through a little more, you know, having covered Try and then Ultimate 3 Ultimate as well. It felt like 4 had some more cut scenes.
It presented the monsters as more of a like narrative antagonist for you, added a few more flashier elements which you could say were going to appeal more to the Western sensibility, like all of a sudden it became a lot more vertical in the arenas and there were jumping attacks and you could mount monsters and it was just a little bit more spectacular in a more cinematic way. That feels like the trend the games have followed since then, with more and more of that in each iteration and they are growing more popular in the West with that. So for me it feels like a combination of those things, just getting away from that local culture by making it more doable.
But the Dark Souls thing I think is definitely true. There are very few games that I play which have a big online information component where I have to research them outside of the game to have any chance of playing them. And Monster Hunter is definitely one of those.
You know, like, how do I, you know, I have already searched for weapons guides for Wilds to be like, do I actually know what I'm doing with this thing? Like am I missing something cool here? And that feels, that isn't a flaw.
People like being part of that. They either like creating that content and being the expert who shares it, or people just like the thrill of discovering something through the community. So it's kind of the perfect game for the times really.
And I think that's part of it's, that sort of tutorializing an evangelist, the benefit it has to that side of things. Like the YouTube channels that have sprung up around it, like I've watched a lot of that channel, Aarex, because they're so adept at explaining Monster Hunter in simple terms, but showing you how wild you can get with those weapon systems. And that's sort of an extension to what I was talking about with someone explaining the game to me while we played it together.
It's all part of that. I don't know this, I think it's very valid that people consider that a flaw. But for me, I think I like the game even when I don't understand it so much.
That, yeah, there's an element of that where I'm like, oh my god, there are so many hidden depths to this, I don't understand it, and it doesn't feel like it was kept from me. It felt like it was there waiting to be discovered. And yeah, to your point about 4 being sort of a tipping point there.
So 4 Ultimate for a long time was my favourite game of all time. And that was partly because it did that thing where it opened up just enough to kind of show you what it was doing a little more clearly. You know, especially when 3 was the first one that I had gotten into.
You were like, right, okay, I feel like I'm in this a little more quickly. I feel like I'm getting here. It sort of parceled out its quests a little quicker, I think.
I may be getting confused between some games, but I feel like it got you into the meat of things a little more smoothly. And that evangelism is there as well, because you have those moments where it's like, with every new game, it gets a few more fans and a few more fans until it becomes that sort of doubling effect, where you have this feeling of, okay, now loads of people are talking about this one, so the next one's going to be even bigger. Yeah, it felt like it sort of grew and gathered people as it went from that point onwards.
Which really chucks out my next question, which was going to be, was it MegaGraphics that made Monster Hunter World a big success?
Well, that is part of it.
No, 100%. It was, like, I saw that for the first time as an offscreen, sorry, like a non-playable thing at E3, whatever year that was. And I went because I was into Monster Hunter, but what I came out going was like, holy shit, like, they've finally done it.
You know, they've added graphics to Monster Hunter. Like, it used to be, I'll definitely shoehorn this in later, but I think it's like a triumph of animation as a series. But that was the first game where the visual fidelity matched that sort of, that animation prowess that they'd always had.
And no doubt that unlocked a huge number of people who were like, OK, I'll give this a go. It looks like a AAA game. When it didn't act like one before, it always acted like a niche concern.
And suddenly, it sort of got some swag, you know? It's like it was the guy joining a new school and deciding he does his hair differently and wears sunglasses. It's like he's like, you know, this is the guy I am.
And everyone bought it, you know? It was great.
That's interesting. That's actually like triggered a long sort of dormant memory of asking for a Monster Hunter world interview at that E3 and being told the only one for the UK has gone to Joe Skrebels. Hell yeah.
I remember that as a thing that happened. And I was like, of course, of course, that makes perfect sense.
Me and Sujit and Most Po-San were pretty tight at that time.
Yeah, so that was so huge that people I knew who'd never played the series were suddenly getting into it and became, you know, had racked up hundreds of hours with it. And I just thought, well, it's finally happened then. For a long time, it felt like it was a relentless Nintendo push to make Monster Hunter a thing.
And then it was, you know, and they succeeded to some degree. But then, yeah, it takes a step forward when it when it looks this good on modern hardware. So, yes, I did want to ask that about Monster Hunter Wilds.
So out now, they're probably going to be the best selling game of the year unless GTA 6 comes out this year. You know, it's a huge deal. It's the, I think, number one most wishlisted game on Steam.
Just unbelievably massive in a way that would have seemed inconceivable 15 years ago. And yet here we are. So, Joe, how has it been treating you so far?
Obviously, I love it. It's just, it's what I want these things to be. And I think it is, it's another step from a world in that sense of presenting the same ideas in more and more sort of traditionally explicable ways, with the notable exception of all the cats doing mad shit all the time in there.
But it is, it begins with like a blockbuster action scene effectively on rails. It throws you into this situation with a bombast and a flare that are familiar from sort of Monster Hunter cutscenes, but not many of the cutscenes. And it really goes, it kind of sets its stall out early of like, this is the Hollywood Monster Hunter to some extent.
It has this vibe of, yeah, all the complex stuff is there, the menus still have 4,000 words on every single one. Don't worry, we're going to get there. But for this bit, you're firing sonic bombs at sand snakes chasing you through a desert while you ride a giant bird and do crazy tricks.
And I just think it's a great introduction to this balancing act they're doing, where they have this feeling of, this is Monster Hunter packaged in a different way. And that leads into this kind of, I guess you want to call it like what would traditionally be the low rank quests in a Monster Hunter game, where the campaign effectively takes you through the easy parts of the game. And it's a little more, and the reviews are out.
I think there's some debate between, particularly between hardcore fans as to whether this is like streamlining too much. For me, I think there's a vibe of, it's a little more, it's a little more paced in how it gives you those creatures and the, and you're kind of playing through this story to get there. I think it works.
Like I'm enjoying just mainlining that story. There's a little more, sorry, there's a little less of me stopping and absolutely caning one monster for ages until I have all the parts I need for all the armor sets that I want. And a little more of me just kind of going with the flow of it because I know I'm going to get to a place where I'm sort of set free to do all the normal Monster Hunter stuff.
So, yeah, I mean, I just think it's great. Like it's just, and it's just one of the most extravagantly presented games I've ever seen. Like even the main menu is a reactive cut scene.
Every time you turn it on, like there's this giant mug of tea and it zooms out and your guy in his armor is having a cup of tea, then he goes out into the region you're in and looks over this vast landscape of crazy bullshit. I just love how wild they're being with everything. The cooking animations, Matthew mentioned these earlier, they're always good.
In this one, every single ingredient you include in a piece of cooking is represented in the tiny cut scene of that dish being made. There's individual cheese melting animations, and prawns sizzling and stuff. I'm just like, no one needed this to be put in, and it's the best thing in the world.
I love it.
Yeah. I just had a steak with mushrooms and honey, and he put the individual slices of mushrooms on it, and then at the end just drizzled on the honey, and I was like, yeah, that is triple A, baby. GTA 6 ain't gonna have that.
And again, this is that weird evolution of like, yeah, we nailed the game 15 years ago, so now we just get to add as much as we like on top of it, because we're rich now, and I just love that.
Yeah, it is, extravagant is such a good way of putting it. It feels so deluxe in terms of rolling out these monsters. It treats each one like they're this huge event, and makes a big deal of presenting them in the most dramatic or exciting fashion, whether it's like the weather or the lighting, or the environment, whatever it might be, turns each one into this huge event, and just seems to have like an endless array of them.
As a campaign experience, it's pretty satisfying to knock those down one after another, knowing that at the end of it will be what hardcore players consider the actual game, that kind of high rank sort of like content that will probably be rolling out in free updates and eventually probably paid, a paid expansion as well. And yeah, I think a friend who plays the games a lot gave me really good advice, which was, don't mess around with repeating any of the story content while you're still doing the story. Just go through the story and you will learn everything you need.
And then when you get to the point where the story is done, that's where you can start repeating stuff and really figuring out what you're doing in that kind of like end game experience. And yeah, it's like a kind of a miracle of onboarding this game. It's like, it's got this like probably a stronger narrative component than most people would expect, I would say.
I certainly even like, people I know have been paying a lot of attention to it. I may be surprised by just how many cutscenes there are in it. But I think that it's, I think that was the right choice on balance because anyone who picks up this game will have this very gentle kind of like hand leading them through the experience and gets to see lots of cool shit in like a very short space of time in this game.
So yeah, I think that they've made all the right choices in bringing that to life. And yeah, it's extravagant. It's just amazingly presented.
And you might think, oh, we're in this little, we're in this desert land. We're going to be here for 10 hours, are we? Nope, you're there for about an hour and a half.
And then you are off to the forest and then you're off somewhere else. And then you're off somewhere else. They're just constantly showing you new stuff.
It really is, you know, a fucking, a fucked ton of assets have been made for this game and they will show them off to you.
What I really like so far is this, it kind of zips you. You start off and you're like, right, desert, forest, then there's sort of this oil zone. It's very sonic.
And then it sort of zips you, the story zips you back to some of those places along the way as well. And you see them in different weather conditions or like a monster has moved from here to here and you've got to chase it. But of course you run into a different monster or they're having a big fight.
And those sort of blockbuster sequences are there as well. And become less handholdy. There's one section where you're riding to this sort of, what feels like a very important battle across the horizon.
And you end up in this stampede of smaller creatures running away from it. And I just was sitting there being like, I've never seen anything like this. Like, there's gotta be 60, I mean, someone's gonna look and it's gonna be way less, but it felt like there was like 60 huge stegosaurus flying by me as I was desperately running to kill a dragon.
I'm just being like, this is just astonishing. And those moments and those little touches are throughout, like fighting a big flaming monkey and chasing him into a pond. And the whole room fills with steam because his pond is evaporating under the sheer heat of this molten monkey bastard.
Right down to today, I was sprinting to get from one place to another, sprinted down some stairs and my guy just does this like dainty run because he's trying to keep balance while he's going full pelt downstairs. I'm like, again, no one needed to make this. And yet, I'm so delighted that I've noticed that it's in there.
And there's got to be so much of that in there. It's just so rich with that stuff.
Yeah, for sure. Matthew, as the chief aggreer with Joe, is there anything else you want to add on how that's been treating you so far?
Yeah, I mean, so I've done... I finished the campaign, the basic campaign. I don't know what the correct term for it is.
I've hit the first credits and I'm now in the kind of higher rank stuff. And it was interesting reading the reviews and seeing some people kind of call it out for being too streamlined or simplified, whereas maybe for like someone with my level of Monster Hunter expertise, which is I probably haven't put more than 50 hours into any one individual of these games. Having a campaign that kind of ripped me through the meat of its of its new Monster roster and gave me astonishing fight after astonishing fight and then left me with probably more game than there is in the campaign to then explore at my own pace.
I kind of, I kind of on board with that. It kind of shows you the game at its most sort of accessible and cinematic and exciting. And then lets you enjoy the more kind of organic part of it.
You ride these bird creatures around called secrets. And they can basically be told to find the monster for you. So you're just riding this bird kind of on the rails.
And a lot of the campaign is played like that. You know, it basically pulls you from fight to fight on the back of this bird. And because of that, I don't think you necessarily get many invitations to just stop, get off the bird and be in the world.
And now in the part of the game, I mean, there is more of that invitation where there's less story pressure to move forward. And you begin to realise, oh, yeah, these weather systems, they have a huge impact. And the way different monsters are different places and things that you think might be scripted can actually happen organically.
And that set piece you saw in the campaign, well, here's a slightly different version of it somewhere else, because the right monsters were in the right place with the right weather. And I haven't played, you know, a vast amount of the post credit stuff. But in the bit that I have, like I'm, you know, jonesing to see more.
I'm like, this is so exciting. You know, like it's, it really, it almost hides its best trick until then, which is that this is alive.
Matthew, have you played any online yet?
I actually haven't. So the other thing I will say I quite like about it, if, you know, people are kind of on the fence, are wondering about, you're like, oh, I don't have online pals or whatever. In the single player, they've added the ability to send up an SOS flare, which calls in random human players.
So like a, you know, like a from software asking for one of those ghosty boys to come and do the boss for you. And if human players aren't available, they send in like AI guys. And I've been doing a lot of the fights with a squad of four AI guys, become quite affectionate and attached to them because they've often got the same, they're the same people.
They've got the same names.
God bless Rosso.
Rosso, Alessa, my guys. Yeah, Rosso, one of them has got a huge fucking gun, and just stands there pelting it from afar. When I hear that gun go off, I'm like, he's here, the guy's entered the fray, which is good stuff.
It's like the end of The Avengers where they all turn up. It's like that, except it's just like some bloke with a huge gun on a worm and with a big sword.
The reason I ask is, I was playing with someone the other day, you can do the traditional like build a party, someone sets a quest, you all go off on that quest. There's a separate, once you've got them in a party, there's a separate option called Environment Link, and that effectively sinks all your open worlds. So someone comes in, your party comes in to effectively your instance of the open world.
And when I did it, I was much earlier in the campaign, I was like, okay, cool. That's nice, you just go for a walk or whatever. But now understanding what I do about that post campaign, for want of a better term, section, that's how I want to play this game, is a world absolutely stuffed with monsters and events and organic opportunities for them to get into ruckuses while I watch.
But doing that with a bunch of people all coming around with you, that to me is that kind of next step for how Monster Hunter can do multiplayer stuff. That's fascinating where you're just like, oh yeah, let's just go out and see who's out there. And part of how they've organised this open world now is, whether you're doing it alone or with people, if you see a monster in the wild, you then, you can hit it a few times or whatever, and it's just like you're hitting a monster.
But if you hit it enough, it's like, right, this is your quest now. And it literally sets it up as a side quest, with all the attendant rewards and what you'd normally get for killing that monster by clicking on it in a menu and heading out to find it. And I love that idea that it's like, I get to do the exploration, I get to see the stuff the game wants to show me, but at the same time, I'm not sacrificing what it is to go out and do a Monster Hunter hunt, whether alone or with friends.
I think that's a super smart way of pulling those two things a little closer together. And yeah, to your point about the end game, end game, I think, is an unfair way of putting it.
No, it's not, because it's the game. I would say the campaign is the tutorial for what the game is. Yeah.
Weirdly, the best comparison I can think of is Death Stranding. You know how that game ends, and you've had this, in that case, unbelievably long story about going from one side of America to the other and then back again. And then the end of, like, I loved the post game in Death Stranding, where it's like, cool, now you're just in the world, go for a walk.
And that's the bit where I'm like, oh, right, okay, all the mechanics are open to me. They've showed me everything I can do, and now it's about doing them in interesting ways. That's what I'm really excited about here.
Yeah, it's just, it's just fabulously exciting. I love it. It's so cool.
Basic bitch question. Of the things you've thought, what is your favourite monster so far?
Oh, I'm not going to pick anything too far on, because I feel like some of them are sort of reveals. Like there was one I just fought at the Forge that I'm not going to talk about that was like, well, I wasn't expecting to see this creature in this place. But I think that fight I was talking about, where you race across the desert and you get there, and the kind of main big bad monster is having a fight with this electric dragon called a Ray Dao.
And just for sheer spectacle, it's this weird thing where you expect an electric monster to sort of just fly around and shoot you with lightning. And in this case, it's this like, melee focused, like really brutal, has this move where it like, rakes its wing through the ground to get to you. And it's amazing.
Like it just kicks up all this gravel and like, wild, just huge particle effects happening. But then it's one major ranged move. It just fucking turns into a mech.
Like its horns come down in front of its face and just fires lightning out of them. Like people just having so much fun designing these things. So yeah, of the earlier stuff, that's certainly up there.
What about you?
I just did that bit recently. And the best thing about that attack where it turns into a mech, as you say Joe, is that the rest of the sky goes pitch black while it's firing it. And so the color palette of your entire screen changes as it does this one attack.
It really is visually spectacular. Sorry Matthew, go ahead.
Yeah, I mean there's some properly amazing, not to be that guy, but there's some properly amazing nuclear option kind of attacks that come in a bit later where you're like, I don't know if I should run away from this or just watch it because it looks good, which I really like. But I won't spoil it, there's a new animal type of the game I don't think has done before, which just on a technical level is really amazing, like the actual construction of the thing and the AI of all its body parts. Well, it's like, oh, fuck, that is a complete nightmare.
But I think that is the one I'm talking about at the forge.
Yeah, but it's a thing which you will also be very excited to chop up. So that's that's fun. I quite like early on, there's that sort of spidery thing.
I think it's the La La Barina.
Yeah.
Who's like ass is like a flower. It like turns, it like blossoms like a rose and it shoots loads of poison out. It's in the forest area quite early on.
You fight it in like a like a chamber where all the water is like blood red. And it wasn't particularly difficult or anything, but I just it just looked like a really perfect pairing of creature and arena. And it was so sort of ornate and delicate, you know, you know, you just couldn't sort of help but marvel at the the character design itself.
I've actually I've got to find this. I think it's Lincoln Carpenter for PC Gamer described one of the monsters in their their review. And I just absolutely loved it, which it's a I think it's called a romper polo.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And the description they had for it that I am now obviously not going to be be able to find. Give me one second. Cut this out.
This is great. It's not building the tension. Is it going to be good?
Is it going to be as good as he says? There we go.
A couple of hours into the game, I'm fighting in the oil drenched ruins of some massive derelict engine against a monster that's one third mosquito, one third velociraptor and one third thrombosed hemorrhoid. And yeah, that monster, the first time I saw it, I was like, what on fucking earth is this thing? It like pumps gas into the ground to create explosions underneath you and has these horrible like jerky movements where it's trying to slash at you with its tiny hands and its big beak.
Oh, it's just, it's wonderful.
That thing is really gnarly. When you like really beat it, it goes all deflated and its skins all baggy. You know like when you see a really fat person who's lost loads of weight and it's just all like hanging off them and they've just stretched themselves out.
It's like Fat Bastard at the end of Goldmember.
Oh, God. Not Austin Powers again.
It looks like that. It's absolutely disgusting.
There are some good alternate states to Monsters in this when they're having a bad time. Or like when they're really trying to fuck you up, that do give them a lot of character. You see a bit of a desperation in the animation, but normally there is some kind of visual change that denotes what's going on.
It is so lavish.
That is something we haven't talked about as well. One of their new systems is this wound system, which sounds horrible, where certain attacks, I don't know exactly what triggers them, but will create effectively glowing weak spots on a boss, like in old school games. You can use specific attacks to exploit those, which breaks off pieces of them.
I think it feels to me like you're picking up materials at a faster pace in this one, so you're kind of not waiting to get armour sets necessarily. I'm sure it will change in high rank, but certainly in low rank, it feels like you can kind of accumulate the materials you need pretty quickly. And by the end of a fight, some of these monsters are just absolute wrecks, and you feel awful about it.
Like they're just covered in horrible scars that you've left on them. And it really sells that. You know, it's always had that feeling, as you say, of those transitions between exhaustion and anger and sort of desperation in the monsters.
But now you're getting this sense of... It's like when Burnout came out and everyone's like, oh, car defamation. Like, you can really see what happened at the end of a race.
And yeah, now we've got monster defamation. So yeah, it's pretty special.
Living the dream.
Yeah, it's sort of, I don't want to be too reductive, but every now and then I do have this thought flash in my head of, is this whole franchise, like, what if Shadow of the Colossus was Bantz? Because there is just this element of it of like, oh, I shouldn't be enjoying this, but I am quite enjoying it. And sometimes the characters are quite enjoying it too.
And so, yeah, it's sort of, I think every now and then the characters try and sort of like morally ground it by going, you don't need to hunt everything, you know, we just take what we need and all this stuff. But I'm like, yeah, but also we are sort of going into the habitat and having a great time stabbing these things in their glowing weak spots. I mean, you know.
This story is effectively like, people enter Australia and immediately collapse the very delicate ecosystem. This is an isolated area of the world and they are not respecting the kangaroo population. Yeah, it's pretty full on.
But as you say, bants. So it's fine.
Absolutely. So I was curious what maybe you two think this will represent in the trajectory of the series. I mean, this in the sense of, do you think this leads to even more people discovering this?
Is this really the kind of like where Monster Hunter becomes the sort of 30, 40 million selling massive series that it becomes a huge deal every generation when it comes along? Like, Joe, do you think it's like getting to that point now where it's going to have that explosion in popularity? And do you think it's having this kind of like, you know, this very sort of like gentle onboarding experience where it teaches you every little thing about the game, sort of chapter by chapter is going to help with that?
I don't know if I necessarily believe like, this is the one. And like I said, I think this has been more of a sort of trickle turning into a stream, turning into a river sort of situation. I mean, the Steam wish lists alone would tell you this is a bigger deal than the last one and the last one before that.
I'm very interested to see how big this becomes. But I also don't think they consider this the end of that journey. It feels to me like they are on a sort of trajectory of we have progressed into what you could call AAA and so we're going to keep adding to that.
I don't get the feeling that this is sort of a climax for those developers. So I'd be super interested. Honestly, what I'm interested in is what is the next step because they made that very conscious decision after World to make Rise, which was a similar format but sort of paired back and more experimental.
And you can feel pieces of that in here as well as the sort of, the fundamental sort of backdrop of World. And so I do wonder if their next step is, let's try that again. Let's do a smaller scale one with where we chuck all our ideas at the wall and see what sticks and then how do we graph that onto the next mega lavish one?
Not least because presumably a shorter development time to make that notional next one. So that's kind of where my interest lies is. I'm sort of not answering your question by answering it with something else.
But that to me I think is, I think they have slightly different goals. Like obviously selling loads of copies is massive. But the evidence suggests they're kind of more interested in like what do we do with this series than how do we make this series succeed?
Yeah, that makes sense. I guess as well there is this whole other component to the series' popularity that's tied to Nintendo handheld specifically and Rise is definitely part of that story. So yeah, that's interesting.
Yeah, they sort of like Capcom, maybe more than anyone else know exactly how to sort of like look after a series really and sort of like grow it over time and know what to add to it creatively, know how long to take to get it to the point it needs to be and that kind of thing. They do just feel like such a steady hand with this stuff. Matthew, what do you think?
What do you think this will represent in the series lifespan?
Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree with Joe. I always feel like there are sort of two tracks to the series. There's this sort of AAA, bit more user-friendly, bit more cinematic, bit more traditional upfront, but still incredibly deep version of it.
And then in my mind, Rise is a little bit closer to, you know, sort of your Monster Hunter 4 or something like that, you know, not just on the technical level, but it isn't as, it doesn't quite as glossy and as smooth as this. It's still a little bit more sort of idiosyncratic. And I don't know if that's just because of like a tech limitation or what's going on with that, but you can definitely, you know, pitch a Nintendo wanting to continue that relationship.
It's worked really well for them. I'd be almost ashamed if, you know, they're a super productive team. I like that they make, you know, a new Monster Hunter thing every couple of years, really, between those two tracks and the expansions and whatnot.
So, you know, it's exciting to see them cook up lots of new stuff.
It's kind of the 2D, 3D Mario thing, isn't it?
Where it's like, yeah, kind of, you know, and they are, they've got form with this elsewhere. You know, they've got like 2 Resident Evil teams kind of working in sort of tandem. It's the impression you get from the rate that things come out.
And, you know, like one thing I will say, it's very, very hard to picture a world where Monster Hunter Wilds is going to play on, like, definitely not Switch, but even Switch 2. Like, it's a big technical ask, you know. It's a pretty next-gen feeling thing.
We obviously don't know what the Switch 2 is yet, but I don't know. I don't see this being on a handheld anytime soon and being fine. But yeah, again, I haven't answered the question either.
I just agreed with Joe.
I will offer something of a kind of newbie perspective on this, which is I do think that you really couldn't ask much more from it for a new user experience. It is clever how it takes all of its component parts to build these scripted set pieces which seem like they're not really what the DNA of the series is, but are the flashy things that will get you interested if you're coming to this from a more traditional action game background or cinematic, you're God of Wars or whatever it might be, whatever might be the thing that you're invested in. The amount of narrative in the game speaks to that as well.
Narrative is not necessarily the most buzzed about in this, but in terms of the structure it gives the game, it's just such a good drip feed. I can't ask for more in terms of being talked down to in a good way. It's just spot on.
In lieu of Sean Bell, this game is just such a generous onboarding ramp. It layers it in so gradually, it never ever overwhelms you with things. Even if you might miss something, the game will either remind you or you'll eventually experiment with what happens if I start chucking these things in my inventory, these monsters?
I can do this sonic effects to make this dragon thing just calm down for a second while I batter it in the head. It's really good at just helping you figure out how best to use the different menu screens to get the army you want. OK, I don't really know what I'm doing with this big tree.
I'll just go to this recommended tab and build something here instead, and I can bypass a more complex interface to get to where I need to be. And yeah, it's even just the fact that rank by rank it introduces more functions to it. Like you could right away, you can't customize what your mount looks like or what your camp looks like.
But eventually you can because they give you a character that lets you do that. But they obviously don't want you to be at any point overwhelmed by everything you can do. And so, yeah, it just feels like very smartly laid in.
And so I feel like that's just going to do more to create a new generation of players than anything else because it's just so... For that second wave of people who come to this, who don't know the Monster Hunter hype and might pick up in a sale or something over the next couple of years, this is perfect, even if they don't have anyone else in their lives who play this. They too can just call in Rosso to do all the fighting for the Matthews.
So I think that's great. And I haven't even dug into the online stuff myself yet, and I really want to. And it's also really good about giving you the way, you know, to give you the option to play that the way you want to play it.
Like, do you want to have human players in your game? If you don't, you can play online single player and functionally just play it the way you would play it offline, basically. And it's just really, really well done.
And yeah, even though there is, you can see all that complexity sort of like bubbling to the surface at all times. It's right there, the number of stats for all of the different armor and stuff. It's just so good at keeping it gently, kind of like gently layering in.
It feels like so much hard work has gone into what is the correct way to teach this to all the players while showing them lots of cool shiny things in between those tutorials.
I think it gives you enough of that feeling, like you say, of rewarding experimentation to a certain extent. Like, it gives you all these options. It doesn't necessarily teach you what every single one does and then kind of lets you play with it to a certain extent.
You know, and that goes from, oh, in this area, I remember there's a thing that I can pull over and like crush a monster with it. And it doesn't necessarily tell you that. It just appears on the side of the screen like, oh, you could probably pull this pillar on him, which is nice.
But then it goes down to pretty tiny incidental details. Like, I fought a monster for the first time today that left behind these sort of weird, sort of wispy structures on the ground whenever it fought. And I was like, well, that's a nice visual effect.
And then I missed with a slinger shot, like firing fire at it and hit one and it fucking exploded. And I was like, wow, okay. I didn't realise that it let me have this ability.
It's kind of effectively creating traps for itself. And afterwards I was like, oh, so those things explode, I'm just going to fire something else at it. I fired a frost bit of ammo at it, and it like created giant spikes of ice that came out of it.
And I was like, oh shit, right. These react to the element that is fired at them. No mention of this at all.
And that was an entirely organic experience of me just discovering this entire new system based around this monster. And perhaps other monsters that I haven't met yet that create the same effect. And now when I play online, I get to go and tell someone that and be like the guy who told them this specific thing.
That to me is the really exciting thing about this game is there's all this stuff under the surface. And you can trust it's there because you can see how much work they've put in and how much detail they like including in these things. That's almost as exciting as creating a full armour set with beautiful armour skill synchronicity across it, to me.
So yeah, it's just, I just, you know, that point you make about how it teaches without over-explaining I think is so key here.
Yeah, the reactivity is just a huge part of this as well. Like Matthew says, you're really going to get the sense that the consoles are just sort of like grunting to kind of like keep up with a lot of the things that can be going on at once, whether it's multiple monsters fighting and you pulling off bits of the environment in order to cause damage or whatever it might be and multiple characters, you know, doing bits and pieces, but it all kind of looking spectacular. There can be a lot going on at once in this game and it is exciting to kind of want to witness that spectacle and yeah, that reactivity is definitely something they've gone for here and pulled off very well.
I also like how even things like how early on, I was bristling slightly at the guided, I think they're called secrets, secrets to your little bird companion things. You go faster in the environment, but not too quickly. My conspiracy theory there being, again, this is too much stuff going on in these worlds for the game to like load it in any faster than it already is.
So that's why I think it moves at a gentle pace. It's purely my conspiracy theory.
The loading bird.
But there are so many things you can use your hookshot on as you're going past on your bird. So it becomes this almost theme park light gun experience of just grabbing everything as you go. And that alone, there's a few types of interactions that Capcom thought so carefully about what is the best feedback for this, like the sound, the noise, the feeling of it in your hands, like entering your inventory.
And the hook gets up incredibly right when you smash through like a hive to get honey or whatever with it. And you're just going past on your bird and you catch something at the very last minute before you turn a corner and can no longer reach it. And they thought about that interaction as much as they have the kind of like feeling of hitting a weak spot and all the sound effects that pop off from that.
And so, yeah, I don't know, just everywhere you look, there are great touches in this game.
This just sounds like the musings of a man who wishes he had a hook to grab honey across his apartment.
Yeah, definitely entering my sort of like fat guy years. So there's a bit of that energy, sure. So yeah, those are kind of like my sort of more basic bitch, kind of new player experiences.
But I'm very much having a good time with it. So far, Joe, I did want to ask if you can draw any connections between your love of Dragon's Dogma, which you talked about before in this podcast and these games. Is it offbeat Capcom games where you climb and stab big monsters that really speaks to your interest?
Definitely.
I did write this question down before I properly understood what Monster Hunter was. I was curious if you think there's any connection there.
I think the thing that connects both of them that I know I love is that deliberate approach to combat. It's not high-speed, which suits me because I'm bad at high-speed action games. It's very much a thoughtful action experience where you have to contend with a lot of factors, but at a pace that sort of lets you react to them to some extent.
The thing I've definitely talked about this when I spouted off about Dragon's Dogma for half an hour on an episode that was not about Dragon's Dogma, my favourite spell in that game is pulling meteors out of orbit around whatever planet that game takes place on. But it takes 30 seconds to wind up and you have to place yourself in the perfect place so that people don't hit you while that happens and you need to make sure that that's all been thought through. And there's nothing like the wind up on that in this, but there is some of that feeling of I need to approach this, I need to understand my weapon, I need to understand what I want to do with it, and I need to approach this fight with that in mind.
That's so rewarding to me. So my main weapon is a charge blade, which is a sword and shield that can turn into an axe the size of a hatchback. And it's like the greatest video game weapon of all time.
And in this game they've deepened how this thing works. You have to charge it with sword and shield, and then to do the best attacks, you need to then charge your shield by like pouring whatever juice you're extracting with this giant blade into your shield so it starts glowing. Then you need to hit a weak point to charge up the axe element.
And then when you... The new feature is once you charge your axe, your axe turns into this fucking buzz saw. So it spins around on the edge end of the stick and like saws through monsters.
But the process of getting to that point is like three or four different steps of like, right, I have to charge it doing this, then I have to put it in the shield, then I have to charge it, then I have to hit a weak spot, then I have to get into axe mode, and then I can start having fun with the buzz saw. And it's... I just think like that just ignites something in my brain in every fight where I'm like, I have to learn what he's doing and I have to counteract it with the stuff that I know I can do.
And there's definitely a lot of that thoughtfulness to how Dragon's Dogma approaches combat as well. So I think... I think that's the thing.
Also just they're both weird as fuck. Like they're such strange games and they're very happy to me. There's no self-consciousness about how weird they want to be.
So that's very exciting to me. Yeah, just... they're just nail it.
They know what they're doing over there at Capcom.
Yeah. My wish list is that for Dragon's Dogma 3 is that they basically go into the asset library of this game and just like at least take parts of Monsters to stick in the next Dragon's Dogma game. I feel like some From Software style asset reuse would like, you know, absolutely go Weapons Free and see where it takes you.
I would like to see that.
I want to get one of those Cyclops' Cyclopi from Dragon's Dogma. Stick them in this. Let me absolutely rinse one with a heavy bow gun.
Yeah. I'm up for both approaches. Cross-pollinate cards.
Yeah. My last question I was going to ask on this actually was, I think that something that was useful for me this week was Matthew said to me, maybe don't try all the heavy weapons straight away. Like the sword and the shield is a great starter weapon if you've never played one of these games before and that turned out to be true.
It's a very zippy weapon and quite easy to understand. Joe, do you have your own recommendation for what a new player should start with?
I think Matthew's right in that the more recognisable the weapon, the more it will map onto your expectations of how a weapon in games should work. So dual blades are quick and you zip about and you do a lot of dodges and you do a lot of attacks and you charge up and then you can do stronger attacks. And like you say, sword and shield.
I also think one thing we haven't talked about in this game is it's the first Monster Hunter game where you can bring two different weapons out into the field with you and you can swap them on your sacred, which means you can experiment with what you want to do. By the time this comes out, we'll have published something on Xbox Wire with developers talking about it. And I said, is the obvious thing to do with this, is bring a ranged weapon and a melee weapon so that you can attack them with a melee weapon, then when they start running away, you can keep raining fire on them from the back of your big lizard bird.
And he was like, yeah, but maybe you want to think about packing two of the same weapon you like but with different elements on them and like be able to take on monsters in different ways. Or like, if you don't know what monster you're going to run across, then you have an option. If you have a weak weapon, you would have a stronger one as well.
And so it is worth thinking about your set in this game for the first time.
Double Haunting Horns like a madman.
Oh man, I love the Haunting Horns so much.
Just two fucking tubas.
If you haven't played Monster Hunter, there is a weapon that is a hammer that is also effectively bagpipes. And it's the best thing in the world. I would say also if you want to kind of take a step towards like the mad heavy weapons, I think hammer, like straight up, just normal hammer is a good way to go.
It kind of, it's slow, it's deliberate, it works the way you'd expect it to. But it has these like crazy charge up attacks that mean you can do some really wild stuff. And it also teaches you that there are different types of damage in this game.
And if you're playing Monster Hunter and you have a hammer, you're doing a lot of blunt damage, which will stun monsters very quickly, and your pals will love you for it. Because the monster is falling over constantly with concussion, and everyone else gets to have their fun. So I'd say hammer is a good shout as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's great.
That's a good recommendation, because I feel like the game does tell you straight away that you can change weapons at any time, just go into your tent and you can carry two at a time, you know, on the secret. But it actually encourages you to go to the training arena to understand how they work. And so it never really goes out of its way to tell you this one weapon is better than the other.
It does leave it to you to figure out. So yeah, some experimentation well worth doing.
Joe, you promised us earlier an incredibly in-depth expert take on armor sets that you got for us.
So this is my secret reason for loving Monster Hunter. The cool reason for loving Monster Hunter is that you get to batter a T-Rex. The uncool reason to love Monster Hunter is that I think the way it approaches loot and crafting, and those are such sexy words, is just so...
So it's the most rewarding take on that idea. That very simple idea of like, I beat something, I get something for beating it, and I get to use that thing to make more stuff. Because...
And Matthew, you covered this earlier, there's this feeling of you earn these materials and you build something out of them that reflects that thing you've beaten. And the armour sets, particularly in Wilds, are crazy. Like, there is some really weird shit in here.
The term for the aesthetic of Monster Hunter that I desperately tried to make my big thing when I was writing about Monster Hunter more frequently was that it had a cave punk aesthetic, which in retrospect, horrible term. I'm really glad no one paid attention to it. Cave punk.
Yeah. Cause it used to have this, like, weird pre-historical vibe. That is so far out of the window at this point.
Like, there is like a plague doctor costume with all sorts of pipes all over it, like samurai arm, like just all sorts of wild stuff. But each armour set and the weapons attached to them are this, if I'm going to be stupid about it, they're like a story of where you've been through that game and what you've beaten, particularly when you get to the higher rank stuff. And if you unlock, if you play enough and then you walk into a multiplayer lobby and someone's wearing this armour that you have not got yet and you're like, holy shit, how many times did you fight that thing?
It instantly visually tells you what direction that player has been on through the game. In 4 Ultimate, there was a set that made you look like a huge prawn and that involved killing no monsters. It was gathering really specific rare things from various different spots across all the maps.
And so I just walk around proudly in my prawn armour being like, this took so much work to wear this really underpowered armour. And I love that. I love that it has this vibe of you can instantly, you can instantly communicate to someone else who's playing that game where you've been.
And I also love this idea that monster materials can be used to make, they can be used to make loads of stuff, but primarily it's weapons and armour. And I just love this, this vibe they create where it's like, yeah, okay, so I've beaten a fire monster. That means I can make armour that makes me better at fighting it, because I will be naturally more resistant to fire.
But I can also make a weapon that will be weak against it, but will make me stronger against anything else that's weak to fire. So it gives, it kind of, it has this two-toned approach where it's like, I'm making myself better against that thing, or I'm making myself better against things that thing would batter. I think that's such a good, like, inbuilt story to how all this stuff works and how this ecosystem fits together.
And they're really selling more and more over the course of these games that these are ecosystems. Like, these things can run into each other, they can fight, they can be territorial, and you're sort of fitting into that by wearing their skin. It's great.
So yeah, that's my screed on armour systems.
I don't know if this has been in the games before, but this one lets you, you can set, like, your visual armour can be different to the armour you're actually wearing.
Yeah, I think they introduced that in World, the layered armour stuff.
But that's quite good, because sometimes you've got something which is amazing stats, but, you know, some of them look a little goofy, or you don't necessarily want to wear that armour, but one set looks particularly cool, like that spider with the rose for an ass I was talking about gives you this almost like sort of musketeers, sort of like a red musketeer hat, and like white and very, you just look very slick, you look like a fencer or something, you know? So that's like, that's my, that's always my skin, but then I've got all this kind of like amazing stuff going kind of wearing away under the hood. Well, when you, so, sorry, some of the, sorry, just very quickly, some of the, you've got this cat companion, and you can customise that as well, and give it weapons and armour, and some of those armour sets are so fucking cursed.
I don't know what monster it is, so I can't spoil it, but one of them, like the cat's head, it just becomes a floating brain in a jar. But the brain is shaped like a cat's head, it's got like ears. And when I started playing, Catherine made my cat look like one of our real life cats, Maple.
And she was getting really like cross with me every time she came in the room, that I decked it out in this horrible brain in a jar outfit. She thought it was some kind of slight against the real Maple, which it was.
There's another one that turns your cat into a mech, but it's got, it's like an exoskeleton, so it's got little cat legs hanging off the front, but the actual animated part of it is just a mech suit walking around with these little flapping legs on the front. Oh, it's so good.
Amazing. Sometimes you've got armor sets that I actually didn't know the thing about. He can change the appearance so they don't look quite as incongruous.
So I've got, I would say one part dark souls to one part certain soleil going on at the moment. And I'm delighted with it, but also I never ever want anyone in public to see that my character looks like that. So I will investigate this option to change the appearance.
Clown cave punk.
I think that layered armor thing really helps, because later in the game, when you really start sort of min-maxing stuff, every piece of armor in the game has an armor skill and those skills are sort of multiplicative. So if you have two poison resistance, you get a bit of resistance to poison, but if you have five, you're, oh no, wait, four, three, however many, you are completely resistant to poison. But most armor sets will not give you the full complement of skills.
So you have to start mixing and matching between those sets, at which point you do get into like nightmare mode. I'm wearing like a unicorn, a unicorn's horn on my head. I've got like big fluffy shoulders and then like no pants on.
And you're just like, I look like a dickhead. I'm going to switch this to the samurai armor. So I think, you know, again, it's just that.
A little bit more of that thinking around. We want you to engage with the systems, but we understand that you might be someone who just wants your guy to look cool. So yeah, it's smartly done.
Good stuff. That feels like a good place to wrap up there, Joe. Very delighted to have you back.
Can I make one tiny, stupid observation, Sam?
Please do.
So when you beat a giant monster in Monster Hunter, it will say, with a kind of unmarked metric system, how big that monster is. And some of them are like alphas. And when you beat them, you get a little crown next to their name in your field guide.
And in this discord, you have a little crown next to your name, which makes... Immediately, I just looked at it and was like, oh my god, it's an alpha Samuel Roberts. And I've been thinking about that for this entire time.
So I just had to get it out before we go.
Well, I appreciate that. And the listeners in our discord will see both me and Matthew have that crown. So an alpha Matthew Castle will also be roaming the waste of the discord.
That's very exciting for the listeners, I'm sure. I appreciate that. That feels like a good way to wrap up.
Yeah, Joe, thank you so much and I hope you can come on again at some point. We'll find an excuse to bring you on. Love to hear your commentary on how you think the podcast is going.
Always good to ask a guest how to review the podcast as it's being recorded. That's another thing we like doing here. Where can people catch you on social media these days?
On social media, I am 2plus2isjoe on BlueSky and on your favourite and mine, Letterboxd. So I listen and I've been enjoying both your content on there. It's been good.
Yeah, it's one of the better platforms to put your time and energy into these days, I find. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, good stuff.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
Mr. Basil Pesto. Yes. On both of those.
Okay, good stuff. Yeah, Samuel W. Roberts on both of those.
