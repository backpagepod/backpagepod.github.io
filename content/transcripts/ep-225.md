Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, as we're recording this, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remaster has been revealed and released, and it's one of the games that won't be covered on today's episode, because it's literally installing on my Xbox Series X as we speak. So, yes, that's not going to happen. I thought I could cram in the first 10 minutes of it, which are kind of like the 10 minutes I remember the most from playing it back in 2007 or whenever I first got it.
But it's not happening, Matthew. However, we have all the other games to discuss in this episode. How do you think about this week's What We've Been Playing?
Yeah, good. Of the four things that I've played, they all feel like they could be in Game of the Year lists at the end of the year, or definitely in contention. So, you know, maybe you could give it a hooky title and call it four Game of the Year contenders.
Yeah, I was...
Or Game of the Year contenders special.
Yeah, because I've been thinking, you know, along quite similar lines about this, because yeah, it's suddenly a glut of sort of, I guess, like deluxe Indies, you know. I guess they all kind of fit that to some degree. There's definitely like a difference in scale between the development of each one of these games.
But certainly, yeah, like a load of games that you do suspect maybe would have benefited from being spaced out a little bit more, but across the year, especially because nothing seems to really be out after after June when the Nintendo Switch 2 releases, other than your favorite Switch 2 title, Donkey Kong Bonanza, Matthew, which I know you're excited to discuss again. So yeah, it's weird, isn't it? Why do you think it's happened?
Why do you think this glut has sort of occurred in this, like, kind of end of spring period?
I mean, spring's increasingly become, you know, a busier season. There was always this sort of fear of, fear of autumn winter for, that's when the sort of big boys come out to play. But now that seems less of a case, and now everything's gathered here.
I can't offer any deep industry analysis. I'm not the editor of gamesindustry.biz.
Yeah. And you know, on this podcast, officially, I'm not either. So I can also not, for contractor reasons, not offer that analysis.
No, that's not true.
Please don't ask me to do it, because I can't.
That's fair enough. No, I think that what's happened is that basically, a load of devs probably planned this at the end of last year or even last summer, not realizing that a load of other games that would be in a kind of a similar mold would come along at the same time. I think one of the games we're going to discuss in this episode moved literally because the Switch 2 reveal was happening the week that they were going to release originally, so moved it back a week and ended up clashing with another game that we're going to talk about.
So, yeah, it's a real grab for Mindshare. Truthfully, I want all these games to do well, and it's kind of a bummer that they are all fighting for attention at the same time.
I was surprised that Microsoft announced Oblivion today and released it because they've been pushing Expedition 33 quite hard. They included it in their last whatever they call it, Spotlight Showcase thing. It's a big Game Pass game.
That obviously comes out in a couple of days, but now they've put this huge, iconic RPG on everyone's doorstep. I am slightly puzzled by that, but who knows what makes them tick.
It's certainly a very good time for Game Pass more generally, because Doom is next month as well. There's like that Taunty Hawk, Pro Skater 3 and 4 remaster, that's coming in about July, something like that, I think it is. There's really just something to play every month.
I've not played South of Midnight yet. I have downloaded it, but haven't got around to it, partly because of the games that we're going to discuss in this episode, Matthew. I suppose we'll just jump straight into it.
Actually, you know what? I will ask, how was your Easter, Matthew? Did you have a good time?
I broke a tooth, which was annoying. I bit into a stone. I was having an incredibly pretentious sounding pudding.
I was having a Dampson crumble. You know Dampson's?
I don't even know what that is.
No, I didn't either. They're like weird little plums.
Right. Okay.
But they've got like almost like plums stones in them, and I bit into what I thought would be a soft mushy fruit and crumble and my teeth clanged off a stone. And I thought, oh no, that's going to break my teeth. And then nothing happened.
And then the next day I was eating a cheese straw at my mother-in-law's house. And that's when my tooth decided it just couldn't take it anymore. So off to the dentist this morning.
Yeah.
Had that put in by a new dentist. So that was, you know, great.
Okay. So you're suffering a little bit.
Great weekend. Didn't eat any Easter eggs. Did lose a tooth.
Exceptional. I just bought some half-price cream eggs. And the listeners got to learn what Dampsters are, which I'd never heard of.
That's like in that 30 Rock joke where Jerry Seinfeld makes up a country that rich people go to. It's very similar, like Gorgonia or something like that. It's now you're just making up fruit that goes in crumbles.
You know, I've never even heard of this stuff, these rich people fruit. So, yeah, very good. I can't talk, though, because I just had much reduced at Sainsbury's Plum Duck Legs for dinner, which again sounds very Henry the 8th.
Plum Duck Legs.
I'm worried that my dinners always make me sound a bit fancier than I actually am. I always tend to go and get something a bit better on Mondays because it's just a fucking miserable day, isn't it? So, normally during the week, it's some variation of like chili or salmon.
Again, you think that's posh, but it's not. I keep claiming this with increasingly frenzied defense of my salmon consumption. But I have pretty straightforward meals you can eat over like two or three days, but today I just saw some plum duck legs and thought, fuck it.
So, I am Henry the 8th, I do have gout and I'm on my sixth wife of the year so far. It's going well, Matthew. So, with that in mind, let's get into this week's games.
Let's start with the... Sorry, we're going to say something, go for it.
I was going to do a bit about the Henry the 8th rhyme about the wives. I was just going to say, except with you, it's beheaded, beheaded, beheaded, beheaded, beheaded, beheaded. And I thought there's nothing really to it.
Brutal. It just implies I hate women, which is just not true. Anyway...
Well, that's why I didn't say it. Well, I did say it.
No, I'm glad you brought it up. I think it was important to litigate that on this episode.
I just like people to know what my thought process is.
At all times. No, I appreciate that. Okay, let's get the one...
Probably going to be the longest conversation out of the way first. Blueprints. This new puzzle, rogue-like, rogue-lite...
I never really know what the distinction is, but people on forums sure love to bicker about it. And as everyone listening to this podcast knows, I don't care about genre classification. Who gives a shit?
Actually quite hard going to pin down what it is, but basically involves... I mean, you probably know what it is at this point. It's become one of the anointed indies of the year for sure.
Massive reviews. I think it's the highest rated game of the year so far on Metacritic. It's a game where you go into this mansion that you have inherited, I think, and you basically have to explore.
Looking for the 46th room in this vast mansion. The twist is the mansion's layout changes every day, and as you go enter a new room, at any time you get a choice of tiles to choose from, which open up a new room for you to go into and explore. For example, a nook, which is sort of like a corner room.
It's like at an angle, you kind of turn left when you go into it, pick up a key or turn right if you position it differently on this big grid where you're assembling the mansion, and then open another door, and then again, choose another tile. Keep exploring the house based on that. If you've played, there's a bunch of board games that do this.
Is that house on the haunted hill or something like that? I can't remember what it's called, Matthew, but there's a bunch of board games that do this. We basically build the mansion as you build a large building as you explore.
In this game, you are indeed looking for that 46th room, which is elusive, while also piecing together clues for how to solve other mysteries that are going down in this mansion, getting bits of story and gathering different forms of currency in order to progress to your goal. And it is, I think, wildly compelling, but there's a lot to it. And I don't think it's perfect.
So I'm really excited to hear what you make of it as someone who you just finished it, right?
Well, I say finished it. I've done the task of I've made it to room 46. I feel like there was some mega karma involved because my tooth had just broken at lunch and then I decided to play around after lunch.
And yeah, a lot went right. So what's the best way of talking about this one? It is tricky because it goes in so many different directions.
I guess the thing which I've constantly been wrestling with through playing it, which kind of captures two sides of this game is that I feel like one half of the game is this rogue-like where you're drawing the rooms and trying to build a path to room 46 and managing various resources. So steps in and out of rooms, they go down over time. There are keys, there are jewels, and that's more like a traditional kind of rogue-like structure that I can understand in that it all resets when you start a new day.
But then on the other hand, there is this very deep puzzling element in that there are sometimes, you know, explicit puzzles nested in rooms, there are bigger puzzles that kind of spread out across the mansion, there are puzzles that are unlocked almost by room placement, like certain rooms can do things to other rooms if they're near them. And what I found throughout all of this was I was constantly in a kind of tug of war about which side of the game was interesting me at a given time. Basically, every run of the game, I never really knew which mode my brain was going to slot into.
There were runs where you're like, oh, I think I've actually got a shot at making it to room 46, and all of a sudden that just completely consumed everything I was doing. And there were other runs where I thought, oh, this doesn't look like I'm going to get anywhere near room 46, and so I'd maybe drill into the puzzling a bit more. But I found that quite interesting, that kind of, it seemed to be very different games at very different times on very different runs.
And I don't know if that kind of echoes for you at all.
Oh, God, it's such a hard game to discuss, isn't it? Because I went through that long description of what it is, and completely forgot to even mention the fucking step mechanic, which you went into there. It's very true, and I actually, something I've been thinking about in a kind of larger sense is I don't think this game was ever meant to be played by this many people at the same time, all talking about it on the internet.
And so I think it's created this a bit of a like pressure cooker, I've got to get to the end feeling to it, and frustration when other people are just like basically reversing into the end, because they've got some kind of weird karmic perk from their tooth shattering, or as it might be, or indeed the RNG of the game just fell in their favour. Whereas, yeah, I think you are best off being locked into that mindset of like, however the run pans out, I'll get the most out of the run that I can. And I will say that even in those runs where you don't necessarily, you know you're not getting anywhere near room 46, like you say, there's still plenty of runs that I would say end with no progress on anything, and just dead end rooms.
And those runs are like the biggest bummer in this game. However, I would do agree that when you find a new room type you've never drafted before, or you upgrade a room, or something like that, there's different ways you can make sort of gradual progress in this. Or unlocking, there are like several permanent areas that you unlock that give you boosters to basically help you progress in the game.
And they do give you a sense of progression that you otherwise might not feel from that rogue-like structure. I think once you sort of put aside the idea of like, just get me to this fucking room, which is definitely something I had to fight in the first half of playing this. I think you do lock into this mindset of, yeah, like it's, that you realize it's like a meta list of objectives that you're slowly ticking off in your head.
Right.
Yeah, really an interesting game. Here's a question. Is this actually a puzzle game?
Because how many puzzles do you actually solve? Other than every day, you do a parlor puzzle, we have to guess which gems are in one of three boxes, and the boxes each give you clues as to which ones which. But how many like, quote unquote, puzzles are actually in this game?
Is it loads?
I'd say it depends on your definition of puzzle, and the kind of puzzle you're expecting. Like, if you're expecting, you know, like an adventure game puzzle, where there's like a huge inventory of items, and those are achieving different things in different places. Like, there's a little bit of that, but it's definitely not that outright.
If you're thinking, oh, is it going to be like a detective game, like deducing loads of stuff? And I've seen lots of people quite crudely, I would say, lump this in with like Outer Wilds and Obra Dinn, which, like, they're all games that use your brain, I guess, but I don't think it's quite that either. I found it all quite logical and mechanical.
The thing it probably reminded me of more than anything would be like Myst, or something like that back in the day, where a lot of the mysteries in the house, like you don't really necessarily know that you're surrounded by mysteries, until you go into it, like you might go into a room and find like a document and you read it, and then you suddenly realise that this prop or that prop had some meaning, and there's like secretly a code embedded in the house that you've been walking past all this time. And there's a lot more of that kind of stuff, kind of keys and codes and things that like decrypt other bits of the house for you, rather than if you're just simply very intelligent, you can't just brute force your way through this game, like you have to find a bit of information in room A and apply it to room B. That said, there are also like literal crate pushing puzzles at one point, and it kind of…
One time though.
You're one to… well, that I found.
Yeah, that's true.
And I got the sense that it was made by someone who had played lots of different kind of puzzle and mystery games in their past, and was kind of cherry picking lots of different sort of sensations. The ones I really disagree with, I've read lots of reviews where they're like, oh, this is the new Outer Wilds. I just don't agree with that at all in terms of the satisfaction I got from it.
The Outer Wilds is pretty much like all information management, which there is in this too. But I found this was a lot. Kind of clean a cut, like when you'd found the thing that unlocks the other thing.
Very hard to talk about without spoiling the rest of this game.
Yeah. So, by the way, it was Betrayal at House on the Hill was the board game I was reaching at earlier. So, yeah, I think that the fundamental sort of like tension, I think, in some of the more negative discussion around this game is how RNG-dependent it is.
And I think it's a really interesting case where the RNG is kind of the making of the game, but also its fundamental weakness in your lowest moments with it. So, without it, if you did just make a more straightforward missed game and maybe you made it more obtuse to find all the different rooms, I just don't think it would be anywhere near as satisfying. I think the not knowing which rooms you'll get on a run has an inherent excitement to it and tension that is worth the price of admission, I think, even if it will definitely lead to spells where you've not had the room you needed to find the thing that you wanted.
For example, I think I'd reached the 30s or at least late 20s when I first got the study, which is quite an important room in the game, has quite an important bit of information about how you reach your objective. And a lot of people found that room way faster. And I found that seemed to be the case for a lot of players where the thing that they needed or the thing that they were looking for, the game just held at arm's length for such a long period of time.
And I think that in some ways it's borderline unreasonable with how stingy it can be about certain things, whether it's currency, items, or rooms that it gives you in a certain moment. And let's say you get to, there's a, basically, is it nine ranks in total, Matthew? I think that's right, isn't it?
Or is it ten?
Yes, as they got, yeah, as you kind of go up the tiers of the plan, they're called ranks.
The top rank has the room square with the anti-chamber on it, which is what leads to the room 46 objective being completed. And so you're always going towards that on this big grid, basically. And there's at least three times where I got to the final, I just need the right room here, moment for the game to go, nah, you're not having one of those.
There's no room that goes right here. Fuck you, basically. And so I think that at that point, players will either wrestle at it or be like, ah, well, I'll have another go then.
And I think in some ways, this game is like a litmus test of your patience as a player, because loads of people have the stomach for this kind of thing. And I ultimately did too. But there are definitely moments where that RNG kind of tested me, I would say.
What did you make of that side of the game?
For me, there's like a big sliding scale of how many threads you have going at any one time. Because at the start, like the only thread you have is, you got to go to this room at the end, so you're playing it quite pure. But then, you very soon start to find keys or objects which obviously have a home and have a place they need to go.
And so, that stuff starts registering. Problem set in, if you easily succumb to tunnel vision, which I definitely do in games. When I'm playing mystery games and detective games that I like, I tend to be like, I'm holding on to this thread, come hell or high water, and let's see where it goes.
And I kind of brute force my way through by doing that. I'm not like, oh, I'll just jump over to this instead. Where actually, I think to be able to like maximize and get general enjoyment out of blueprints, I think you have to be able to like, let certain things go at certain times.
Very early on, I basically solved one code puzzle in a room, which told me that I, you know, how to use a machine in that room. But that machine needs to be powered by another room that has to be drafted. That happened on like day five that I cracked that code.
So in my head, I'm like, well, I've cracked this early on. This is something I need to do. And I've dedicated quite a lot of time to getting that and failing.
I, you know, I got to room 46 without ever actually completing that combination of rooms. So I don't know what that thing does still. But I probably wasted like five runs, so five days in the sort of parlance of the game, trying to make that happen.
And if I didn't get that room again, then I was like, well, this runs a total bust. And that's the mentality which I think can really nobble you in this game. Because you have to, you know, you have to be open to like other things happening for you.
Or like, like I said earlier, like, well, maybe this time I'm not going to try and solve that puzzle. I'm just going to try and solve the thing I'm actually here to do. It does create this like weird effect that even though I've reached that basic ending of the game, my head is full of all the things that I haven't been able to do yet, which I assumed doing those things would help me reach that 46th room, you know?
Like I assumed I have to take all these baby steps because, you know, a lot of the bigger puzzles that are nested in the house, when you complete them, you know, some of them can give you like permanent benefits for your subsequent runs, so the game is gradually becoming quote unquote easier. The idea of those baby steps being harder than the main step, that's something I still don't quite understand if that's good or not, you know? I didn't need whatever that machine did to get to room 46, but I feel like the game was telling me you should probably do this because it happened to me so early, but that's that you start reading stuff into what is the game asking me to do, and is it secretly trying to convey information, and there is so much more, I'm led to believe, beyond that core goal of getting to room 46, that that thing you found potentially on your very first run, you know, could be the end of a thread that is the game's biggest, deepest puzzle, and you just wouldn't know until you'd gone mad trying to get it.
It definitely taught me a kind of flexibility which I would not normally apply to these games.
Yeah, this is a weird and possibly self-serving sounding question. Are you surprised that I played this game and got into it? Because I feel like you have, in the time we've been making this podcast, played like maybe two to three games a bit like this.
Not really any game that's exactly like this, but you know, you're a bit more open-minded to things that are in the kind of like point-and-click mold or involve going around a house of some kind to solve a mystery or whatever it might be. And this is something like the kind of thing I never play. So I was curious what you made of me trying to play this.
Yeah, I thought the rogue-like elements of it would probably work for you, because you're probably more into that stuff. Certainly like deck builders and deck management, you've played a lot more Bellatro than I have. Even though I really like it, you've played more of it, and you have played other games with those mechanics.
There is a version of the blueprints which you can almost look at the game just like that and ignore a lot of the mystery stuff. You can play it as quite a pure exercise in drawing rooms and clever resource management to get to the end. That is ultimately how you get to the end of the game.
I'm not surprised that kind of clicked for you. Yeah, I'm kind of, you know, just through DMs or seeing you on Discord, like your ups and downs with the game, I thought, oh, this is heading towards like, did not finish territory because it was like annoying you. But then you seem to push through that and find like another 20 hours of it.
So that was kind of wild. Like, you've played this a lot more than I have. I mean, you know, I can't remember if I said this.
So I finished it on, it was my 32nd run, day 32.
Yeah, it was day 82 for me.
So that's just an indication of like how different these two things can happen, you know? Yeah.
And when I reverse engineered it, I realized that basically there's like a room with many doors. And if you unlock all of those doors by what feels like wasting loads of keys in the moment, you will basically get the resolution for what you're looking for. But because I had no clues to suggest that, and keys are treated as this very finite economy, I basically skipped out on that and then didn't find the other two places that you need.
I waited until a long time to get the study, which basically helps you unlock Room 46, gives you a very key clue or a couple of key clues. And then it was just a long wait for the same rooms to come up. So for example, the greenhouse is quite a pivotal room.
I think I got that three times in those 80 plus runs. And so, and you need another item to make that room do anything. So it was pointless each time.
It might have been four times, but yeah.
And so I had that item so many times. Like I probably had that every day for the first 10 runs.
Yeah.
And then when I finally worked out where I needed to use it, I never ever had it again.
Yeah. I don't think I have like 20 hours more good times to show for all of that time investment in Blueprints. And there's a few mysteries that I did solve.
I was quite proud of myself. Like the gallery one. But the gallery has like one absolute bullshit.
I've not even been to the gallery.
Yes. That's something I've done, for example. And I've got another item from that that basically can unlock another mystery.
Where I have to continue with it. However, I'm not going to because I feel like it's ultimately, I think it's just a wall you have to push through where you just accept it's going to use your spare time as it sees fit. And I felt like it had just taken enough of my time for the returns it gave me ultimately.
But I still thought it was excellent. And there were definitely some runs I ditched because there's like a little side room you can unlock pretty early on, one of the permanent unlocks. And I didn't like the room options it gave me that day.
So I thought, oh, fuck this, I'll come back tomorrow then and see if they got me anything then. Definitely a few runs I just gave up on like that, for example. But many, many more hobbled runs caused by RNG, I would say.
So I don't know. It's weird, though. I've seen some people say they finish it in 17 days.
Some people say it's taken them way more than where you're at and into like the 40s. So it just seems to be fucking variable, you know?
Pretty sure I've seen the designer of the game say that, like, yeah, you can complete it on the first run. Like, there's nothing stopping it from happening.
Bollocks!
He says there's nothing stopping it from happening. He said it's just unlikely, because you don't know any of the rules, but he said it could happen. There's nothing different about that run from the other runs.
I just don't believe that. I don't believe that can be true. But, but that's the interesting thing.
I mean, the things you tap, like knowing the certain steps that have to happen, the chance of you stumbling on those things are, I mean, so small. It's absolutely preposterous, because I keep thinking about certain bits. What do you think about thinking a bit more in, like, rogue-like terms?
The kind of permanence of certain things, you know, the idea of what you carry through? Because for some people, that's a bit of a deal breaker with these things. They want to have a sense that they are chipping away at something.
Did you feel like it had thrown you kind of enough, like, locked in enough bones and thrown them to you? Well, the confusing level.
I kind of know what you're asking. The answer is, I would say it didn't. For the simple reason that there's just some ways...
I was quite frustrated to see some people saying that, oh, the thing is, once you see the Grand Tapestry, once you get deep into it, you realize how easy you can make it for yourself to come across certain items, gather a certain amount of currency, that kind of thing, you will see what the masterpiece of this game is. I think this game is very, very good. However, I felt like that was someone just lying.
And I think that it's, because like, for example, there's one item you can get that reduces, that can control the rarity that a certain type of room appears. And I got that item twice in 80 days. And like, the idea that you would keep playing it, hoping you would come across that item in tens, potentially tens more days, I just think is completely unreasonable.
And I think it could have done a little bit more to like, well, A, I think they should have let you, one thing I would definitely do, they should let you control which rooms you upgrade with those disks that you get. Again, if you want to tally those, I think I got six the entire 80 days, so not many.
Did you ever have a run where you got upgrade disks and no computer?
Yeah, I had at least two of those. That was fucking shit, so it's rubbish. It's true that you can like take steps to get like more keys.
There are certain things you can manipulate to get more keys that kind of make it work, and it becomes easier to get items and things like that. But I wouldn't say where I got to, I ever felt like I'm in control of the mansion. It's still like, I'll still get to like a bit where I need a room to turn right and the game has not given me one, and said, fuck you, the runs are over.
Yeah, that's a heartbreaker.
Yeah, and that is just part of the DNA of this game, like it or lump it. And I think that the truth is, I don't love all those decisions, yet I think that again, if you don't have this in the game, it lacks a certain spice, a certain tension. I think it's part of what makes it good, even if it can annoy you sometimes.
Just go back to the permanence thing though. I think it could just do with meeting you halfway on a few more things, a few more permanent elements of the game. For example, you unlock a room called the freezer, and that freezes your currency till the next day.
It could be quite useful, and it's super good. However, as soon as you build the room, it locks your currency instantly, and you can no longer gather keys or currency on that run. You're just, that's it, it's done.
Basically, the effect of the room is instantaneous once you've placed it, even if you're not walked in the room yet. That seems to me like they could just let you walk in that room when you're ready. There's no real reason to be that stingy, other than the game designers going, ha ha ha, you thought this is like a devil's bargain you made.
You thought you could freeze your currencies the next day. It's a lesson you learn for the next run. But also, it means that I don't know about you, I got offered the freezer most of the time, about halfway through a run.
So there's no reason to do it while you're still exploring the mansion, hoping to reach the end. So why freeze it at that point unless you've happened to come across loads and loads of jewels, I guess, or loads and loads of currency. Things like that where I just felt like the game was like, you know what, it would be good if we did this, wouldn't it?
However, we're going to kick you in the balls instead. And that's like just, I think, part of the design ethos of blueprints, for better or worse.
It's funny, you mentioned the item that upgrades the rarity of a certain kind of room. My brother-in-law, Nick, has been playing this loads. He did finish it well ahead of me.
But he said he'd really painted himself into a corner because he got that item. And he just misinterpreted what he did. He thought it was increasing the rarity of items that would appear in those rooms.
So he ramped up all the rooms to rare. And now he never ever gets them. And he's never got the item to ramp their rarity back down again.
Like the chance of him getting that item and the room spawning, because he set it to a rare, and they are like quite integral rooms to how the whole house functions. Just absolutely knobbled himself. And it does let you do that.
Like, I feel like that there are certain things in this game. And actually with relation to the permanents, you know, again, without spoiling it, there is like a permanent room that can be placed somewhere in the house. And I feel like if you put that in a bad spot, you will really fuck yourself.
But you may not even think about it in those terms, because you don't know how important it is. But you know, it's given to you completely context free. It just says like, this will never move.
And you have no idea if it's sensible to put it midway or right up the house. And you know, I am interested if people have properly painted themselves into similar corners and just had to restart it again, because that would be a heartbreaker.
I think, because I did briefly start it again as an experiment to see what would happen, how much I could get quickly. The thing that you can get really quickly is the permanent unlocks, because you know whereabouts they're oriented in the house when you're going to draw them, basically, as tiles. So it becomes easy to figure out where they're supposed to be.
Still took me a few runs, but got them relatively quickly. However, I do think that certain rooms do not tend to appear early. At least it didn't for me.
And so, yes, it is wildly variable. I feel bad for Nick with that, because I personally found, understood what that item meant. But if you misinterpreted it, I mean, that's just a nightmare in a game that's already pretty stingy with how it gives you some of these rooms.
What do you think of the permanence aspect? And I guess, like, how do you feel about that? Because I think that in some ways, like you say, it feels like Room 46 is the thing that everything's pointing you towards.
But I would say that the laboratory is almost like the most disgust element of the game, because it does require those two rooms. And you can't just place one room next to another. It has to be in a specific positions in relation to the other room.
And it's like, it's just, it's so, it's like, it is borderline unreasonable, I think, that requirement. I have, I've done it. And I did the thing and then went down there and I was like, you know what, this is too much busy work.
And I just uninstalled it from my Steam Deck. That was my experience with finally activating that. I did it.
And then I was like, you know what? Nah, this game's had enough of my time. But I was curious, what, so what do you think of like the permanence aspect to it?
And yeah, do you think something like The Lab is a reasonable ask of most players?
Generally, for the first chunk of time, the first half of my playtime with it, when I felt like I'd cracked a big mystery in the game, it tended to give me a permanent upgrade of a kind, which made me feel like, oh, I understand this game completely. If I put in the work, it will reward me in a way, which is going to make the general thrust of the game easier. I grouped The Lab in with those mysteries.
Like, I feel like I fully cracked it. I know exactly what I'm meant to be doing. I've just never been given the rooms in the right locations to have them.
Because like you say, it's not just a case of drawing the room that powers The Lab. It has to be, you know, connected in the right way. And that's like a whole other thing.
I know of what I've seen, that's the only one which I feel like it like arrived at the same time as the other permanent kind of puzzles. And that's why I kind of got into my head like, well, I'm definitely not getting to the end of the game before I've unlocked these four things. Because I'd unlocked the three things pretty quickly.
And then this one here is still sort of stuck in my craw. The other one that really bugged me is there's like a housewide puzzle, which one room kind of unlocks. It's a brilliant aha moment when you realize something's been kind of hidden in relatively plain sight.
But actually doing that puzzle takes ages. It's a pain in the arse. And once you've got it, I don't think the thing actually gave me was particularly, like I'd already kind of worked that out.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
I felt like it was step one and I'd already done step two and I was like, I can't believe this is what this was for. Like this was absolute horseshit. But that to me, and that's when I was like, well, if they're going to throw away a puzzle of this complexity on such a nothing burger of a development, then it just made me very suspicious of everything I was doing.
Like, is this going to be a huge waste of my time? And often there are lots of things which I would say is a waste of my time. I spent ages working out how to drain water from places and drain water from a place and go there and realize that all was hidden under the water was like one coin.
And it's just like, fuck you, fuck you for wasting my time. You absolutely suck. Now, I know water draining is going to be useful somewhere, but it can't be quite cruel.
It's quite hard to play this game and not like project a personality onto it. Because of the RNG and because of like the mischievous nature of the puzzles, you are sometimes like, I cannot believe you're doing this to me.
Yeah.
And like that's just such a dumb way of like interacting with the game.
It really is. I will say that I, that's, there was like several puzzles in this game that I just gave up and thought, that's a waste of time. I've got a feeling that's a waste of time.
And the larger house wide puzzle you're describing is one of those. I thought, right, I've got a few of these words figured out. I've got a feeling this is going to be bullshit.
Looked it up and was like, I'm so glad I didn't go through every fucking room looking for this. Because, yeah, I'd already worked it out. But if you drive one of the classrooms and you just pay attention to the numbers on the wall, for example, and loads of ways in which a certain number is used throughout the mansion, you don't need any of that information.
It's pointless. And so, yeah, it's like, why? Why have you done this?
It's just, yeah, that's what I mean about-
The classroom things, that's, that, but they're like a really interesting set of rooms because they basically teach you a load of rules, which at the point I got them, I thought I'd figured all those things out via other means. And maybe that's the genius of the design that you can't, you know, that there isn't just one route to certain things. Like there is an element of brute forcing with certain things or guessing something and not really understanding why it worked.
And then you go in that room and it's after 20 hours, it can give you something that you worked out on day one. And it just it feels a little silly in those times. And that's, I guess, part of the risk of the randomized room thing is that certain things you're going to see, certain things you're not.
And, you know, like to go into a room and have it explain like the dartboard puzzle when you've done 20 of those motherfuckers. And you're like, yeah, I get it, you know, like this isn't the aha moment you think it's going to be. It's like, I can't imagine people getting this far and not already knowing that, you know?
Yeah, it's interesting because there's not loads that would change about the game, despite my reservations with it, playing like backseat game designer for a minute. But the things that I thought got silly and quite crap as deep into the game as I got was the dartboard, which does start quite logically and then starts coming up with the most batshit symbols for mega brain maths that no sensible person would figure out. And so I just thought, and after a while I was like, you know, I'm just going to guess these because this is wasting my time.
And it will be faster for me to guess it than trying to actually figure out what the fuck two, like two sets of like swirly lines means in the centre of this dartboard. Like, I think that if I could change one thing, it would be like a room that resets like the dartboard puzzles. It's like, oh, yeah, Uncle Christopher installed this so you could just press this.
And then the dartboard difficulty would go down again. Oh, Tally Ho, which is what all the writing is like in this game. It's, yeah, it's that sort of thing.
How do you get on with the... So there's a room called The Parlor, which has three boxes with two truths and a lie, or two lies and a truth. And, you know, they're kind of like logic statements of the gem is not inside me, but is inside the blue box.
And then the blue box says, I never tell a lie. It's this. How do you get on with it?
I'm not even blue. It's just one of my favorite ones.
Yeah.
I like those because they don't waste your time like the dartboard does. The dartboard is a... The dartboard by the end was giving me like, I think nine sums in a row to solve.
And it's like just fucking... All you're doing is breaking the pace of the game at this point. It's shit.
I've stopped doing it. You can't really... The parlor game, I mostly got right, but what do you think?
So the problem with the parlor game is I did like 15 of them, absolutely like no problem, really easy, and thought, this is always like a free couple of gems. If I get that room, no problem. Then I upgraded it into a funeral parlor, which...
I know that was a thing.
Oh yeah, you can upgrade the parlor into a funeral parlor. And what that means is...
There's always a dead person in one of the boxes.
Well, it's... For every red room in the house, you get another prize gem added to the winning box. But if you get the box wrong, you lose half your steps.
What?
I suddenly got incredibly shit at doing those puzzles. Just as I put this absolutely horrible stipulation, I lost half my steps so many times.
Fuck. That's rubbish.
Because I suddenly, like... Like, they just ramped up in difficulty. And I was like, oh god, to the point where I wouldn't touch it, because I was like, I just can't.
I can't do it.
Again.
Because I'm, like, scared of those boxes.
It's kicking the balls game design, I'm telling you. That's like part of the ethos of this game. It's like, wouldn't it just be funny if we kick you in the balls, though?
And like, the funeral parlour is exactly that. Why take away half your steps? Most of the room upgrades I've got.
Yeah, but I did opt for it. Like, one of the other things was basically, like, we'll give you two goes at this puzzle every time. And I went, hahaha, no, my mega brain doesn't need this.
I want to increase the risk because it's so easy.
Do you know what I love in this game, though? Green rooms, lovely green rooms, Matthew. Oh, lovely courtyard, I love a courtyard, you know, love a, yeah, go on.
So I don't, I can't remember what triggered it, but my winning run involved basically five court rooms, courtyards, and all of them were just full of dig spots, full of rich treasures. I had gems and, like, keys coming out of my ass. It was amazing.
Yeah, I had that as well. Like, I got so paranoid about the RNG in this game, that on one run when I got within one room of reaching the end, I basically thought, okay, rather than, like, go to next day, I'm just going to quit the game in the Steam menu, start this day again and see how close I can get. And in three out of the four times, I got the keys I needed, the gems I needed and got within one room of the Room 46.
And I thought, are there just days in this game where they're like, you know what, you can just do it today. Because again, the mistake is to assign authorial intent to what is basically RNG. We talked about that.
But yet, you do wonder what levers have been pulled in the background to sort of prompt a certain amount of progress. I will reiterate that I really do like this game. And I'll be talking about it for years to come, I'm sure.
I'm not interested in the larger mysteries. I don't care about the story. I don't care about posh people in their big house.
Sorry. I don't think from... It makes you work too hard to piece together the narrative anyway.
I don't care about the three made up countries. I don't care about the shapes associated with these three made up countries. None of that is interesting.
However, exploring the house. Bonanza. Unlocking new room types.
Bonanza. Great stuff. Really just like so, so compelling.
I say that, Matthew, so we can talk about some other games this episode. But what are your sort of like closing thoughts on it so far? Do you think you'll keep playing?
I probably will go back to it. I need a break from it now because it was what I was doing. Like I've seen people say I've played 200 hours of this, whatever.
And I just, I can't, I can't really do that.
No.
You know, I have some grudges I need to settle. Like I want to get that laboratory working just once. Just so I can see what it looks like or whatever the fuck it unlocks.
So I've been really disciplined with not looking up like walkthroughs and solutions. Yeah. I want to have the surprise of whatever it is.
So yeah, I probably will go back to it. It's a weird one to recommend. So I think it does such a specific thing.
And I think some of the mega review scores it got and some of the write ups that went with those scores suggested this is for everyone. And that couldn't be further from the truth. So true.
Like I really bristle at that. And also this attitude of like, well, if you don't get it, you're like, dumb. Or there's something wrong with you.
And it doesn't, that isn't true. It's just an incredibly specific game made for a subset of people who are going to be absolutely obsessed with it. And that's absolutely fine.
You know, like if you play this and think it's absolute dogshit, then that's fine as well. I've not got a problem with that. Yeah, I know I said it earlier, but like seeing people lump it in with Obra Dinn and Outer Wilds did bug me a little bit, because those are two of my favourite games.
But I think what I like about them is that they are like finite, you know? Like I've done them and I can kind of put them to bed where this sense of, oh, I've probably only seen, I don't even know what, 10% of this? The way people talk about it, I feel like I've seen fuck all of this game.
And that bums me out a little bit.
That's how I ultimately felt as well, as it's just not quite generous enough for the time it demands of you. And just too many of those runs ended in a dead end or me just feeling frustrated with it. I had like five dead end runs in a row where I was like, I just, that was the closest I got to ditching the game.
That was somewhere in the 50s that happened. I was just like, what is the point? Why am I doing this?
This is like I've got so many other games I can play. But did ultimately persist. The lab thing, I finally got, one of the more satisfying things I got was the lab thing, because one of the upgrades you can get for the aquarium is to add electric eels.
And therefore, the aquarium becomes a power source. And so that is immediately what I did, because I wanted to get into that fucking lab. Spoiler alert, it wasn't worth it.
But if I did want to continue with the game, it is key to another layer of the game. So it's there, but I'm unlikely to, because I feel like I've got all the pleasure I'm going to get out of it, I think. And I wish the Clever Clocks well, as they performatively make big notepads with all of their observations about the game in it, all the information they've accumulated.
Because I found that side of things a little bit tiresome after a while as well. But it is good, isn't it? It's a good game, Matthew.
It is, it is good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. Well, that was quite an epic discussion about one game, but I think it was justified, to be honest.
I think it's the thing which is eating our headspace the most this month.
Definitely. And certainly it's the game I've played the most from this set of games. So yeah, interesting stuff, Blueprints.
It's on Game Pass and one of the tiers of PS Plus, a premium one, I think, Matthew. So people can go play that quite easily if they have a PlayStation or Xbox. Hopefully it will come to Switch 2.
I can see the original Switch would probably struggle with this. Not quite sure why. The art style is quite simple, but on Steam Deck it's even a little bit choppy, so I can imagine that being an issue.
But yeah, I'm sure that game will come up again later in the year, Matthew, and I'm sure we'll have lots of banter to go along with it as well. Okay, so next up then is Claire Obscure Expedition 33, a game from developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive, who have put out quite a lot of interesting stuff in the past few years. That Metroidvania game Ultros, for example, or Sifu, one of my favorite games in the past few years.
It's one of the two games that they've released recently, that we're talking about in this episode. So interesting outfits, and I think they have some of their own developers who co-own the publisher, and then some games they just publish from external developers in the same way any indie publisher would. This is one of their core internal dev teams, Sandfall Interactive.
As I understand it, they are mostly former Ubisoft people, quite a young team, and this game is basically a Japanese RPG. It's made in that style, not made in Japan, obviously, with a sort of French visual palette to it. I think they've described it as dark fantasy, Belle Epoch.
I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I know what that means. Basically, it amounts to a lot of ornate looking French things.
Curly, whirly bits.
Curly, whirly bits. It's very visually stylish. It's got quite an interesting hook where there's basically this evil goddess figure who is picking off people of a certain age to die each year, and the remnants of humanity send an expedition each time to try and stop this from occurring.
So far, they've been unsuccessful. I think that's the overall plot of the game, isn't it, Matthew? Yes, but what it really amounts to is like the kind of game that I think people have wanted Square Enix to make for a long time.
If one of your major frames of reference for Japanese RPG is Lost Odyssey or Final Fantasy XIII, or even maybe like Final Fantasy X, kind of like PS2 era Japanese RPGs, it firmly feels like it was made by people who love those kinds of games and understand what makes them great. In terms of the world design and the combat, which we'll come back to in a second, but also just a story being quite involved, the music being fucking amazing, the art direction being incredible, it taking you to some amazing looking places, it having a world map in the PS1 Final Fantasy style. It feels like a lot of people are like, you know what's missing from the world is a game that's exactly like this.
And my personal feeling on it from what I've played so far, and I think we should discuss it when we've both had a chance to play a lot more of it Matthew, because I think it's like a 40 plus hour game. Is that it achieves what it sets out to do? And I think that if you like those games, you absolutely should play this.
It's on Game Pass, so you have an easy means to play it. If you have an Xbox or PC. What do you make of it so far?
Yes, I've only played a couple of hours. I would agree with that. Absolutely like what it's drawing on and what its strengths are.
I really didn't like the opening section of this game. And I felt like I had to punch through that a little bit. I found that the opening isn't really reflective of what the game is going to be.
It's like a little narrative section where you're walking around a town talking to all these people. And I feel like it's trying to be a bit clever, clever in masking what the threat of the world is. And it could probably just kind of cut to the chase, set it up a bit better and then send you on your way.
Because once you're actually into the game proper, you know, exploring the maps, engaging with the battle system, you know, that's where this game's strengths lie. Rather than, I don't know, like a town with a load of sort of slightly nothing ENPCs, that threw me off. It's like, it's not a strong opening beat, but it is only like, I don't know, 45 minutes or something.
So it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty painless in that regard. Well, like the weird thing about this is I know the story set up from the promotional material, you know, and how they've talked about it in the past. And it is strong, like it's quite an intriguing one, but I feel like they don't really like make it super clear.
Like in the game, I felt like if I hadn't actually seen all the trailers and whatnot, I don't know if I'd 100% have a kind of clear take on what was happening. Yeah. But then I don't know if that's sort of deliberate.
It's meant to be a bit kind of confusing and, you know, these people are in this situation, but the situation they're in is enticing enough and hooky enough that I think they could just say, it is the deal. But like I say, I'm through that now and I'm into the game proper. I'd say like the thing it reminds me most of is probably like Final Fantasy XIII in terms of structure.
Like it's quite a linear world so far. Like the actual levels are kind of beautiful paths with like amazing background art, you know, in the same way in Final Fantasy XIII, you would constantly look around going, wow, imagine if you could like touch this stuff. And it wasn't background art.
But I don't really mind that, you know, as long as you're kind of moving forward fast enough, the battles are interesting, there are enough story beats, you know, I don't really object to that. I don't know if it does open up more as it goes on.
It does.
Wouldn't be a problem. It does. OK.
Yeah, I've reached like a second area, which has got like a few more like branching out paths and things like, you know, there's a sense you can kind of explore it a bit more. Interesting to see a nostalgia for early 3D JRPGs. That doesn't really exist really in any other form anymore.
Like people don't really make these things. They just make big open world games. Yeah, I'm quite fond of it.
Like I remember like reviewing tens of things like this for like half pages in Games Master from like 2006 to 2010. And yeah, it's quite nice being back there.
Yeah, I think it's I think it's generally better than a lot of the games from that time were because, oh, definitely, because the combat is really sharply done. It's got a heavy focus on, you know, Mario and Super Mario RPG style, sort of like counter mechanics and basically pressing button prompts in time with attacks to increase the level of attack. There's a dodge command, which is a little bit easier than the counter command, which has more risk.
But if you counter a bunch of like powerful attacks in a row, it can lead to your characters doing like this great rush attack. I would say it's just a really smartly designed system because you can, here's the key thing, you don't have to tap a button every time you do a basic attack. You can do a basic attack and your character will do it.
I think it's well judged the amount of button presses it asks you to do. And so it doesn't feel like hard work. I think South Park, those games maybe start to feel a bit like hard work in the way they incorporated that sort of combat system.
This is done better than that. It's not quite as linear as 13 in my opinion. It's a little bit more like, I'm sure you noticed this, but early on there's an area where it basically, if you go off the beaten path, there is a super hard enemy you can take on quite early.
Oh yeah.
And then you can beat it because you can get a mastery of the dodging and the counters in order to defeat it, but it's not easy. And that's the kind of thing that I think this game defines as like, it's non-linear bits where it's like, okay, you've gone a little bit down this path instead of this path, but there is something there for you to find. And so that combined with the world map that will usually have one or two things you can go and interact with on any given continent that you're on, with more, I think, as you get deeper into the game, means that I think it feels a little bit less linear in the first instance than 13 does, which is just corridors.
Plus, you can go back to places as well in some cases. But I think the 13 comparison is fair, because I do think that must be one of the major points of inspiration. And if they're a young team, it makes sense that a 15-year-old Final Fantasy game would be a frame of reference to people who are getting into game development now, right?
So I find it really interesting because it's such a maligned game. But it's cool to see It and Lost Odyssey inspiring things like this. And I think that there is a clear through line there.
Yeah, they also… I think the crucial thing about the combat system, I really like combat system with extra actions and button cues to hit, but it moves really fast. So even in like fights against enemies who you've kind of worked out all their base attacks and you've basically got them kind of pegged.
The battles happen so fast, which, you know, if you ever play like a Mario and Luigi game, you know, as delightful as they are, there's a real kind of ponderousness to a lot of the animations because they want you to like admire all the beautiful animation work and you're like, okay, well, we're going through this. And it just feels like a chore where this, you kind of charge through and, you know, then when you get to a boss fight, you know, which is a bit more involved and maybe has a few more like almost puzzle elements to like where certain attacks should be deployed to kind of knock them out of an attack animation or something. You know, you can spend a bit more time kind of getting your head around those and it's just very well paced.
It kind of gets you through the less interesting stuff quite fast so that you can like really drill into the more interesting sort of standout fights.
Yeah, I think that your criticism of the opening is fair. There's a few things that I wish it didn't do. Like, I don't like that...
One of the very first things you see in the game is that your character's sister, Mael, basically sprints off across these rooftops, but it's clearly running way too fast, like the animation looks too fast. That is too like... that feels unpolished.
Just there's a load of bits in that first area where it feels less polished than the game actually is. Like it front loads some of the least polished bits.
That's absolutely it. You see like five of the same NPC talking to each other in a group and you're like, ugh. You are reminded, oh, this isn't like the biggest team in the world making this game.
And also you're going to a place where these NPCs aren't going to be. You just have to kind of get through that. It should have just started with you turning up, because the actual arrival on the continent is quite exciting because it all goes to shit.
And then you have to kind of get your bearings quite quickly. And why didn't they do that and then just flash back to that a bit later or something?
Yeah. I think there's maybe something in that. It's also just things like the NPC interactions again.
I would say there's some... The major cut scenes in this game look fantastic, have great facial animations and stuff like that. But those basic NPC interactions in that first area are like a tier below that, or maybe even two tiers below that.
And so again, because the game is front-loading, some of these slightly cheaper looking bits, and I don't think the game looks cheap generally, just in this one area, there just happens to be more of it than there is elsewhere. I think this will be like a massive bounce rate thing for game pass people. I think they'll get to this.
Oh, it's a shame.
It is, because they should keep going until they get to the meat of the game. Because I agree, once you're on, the story begins basically and something bad happens, which I would say is very effectively done. It very effectively sets the stakes.
I think it's like pure magic. I really do think that people who have even like a, I remotely love these games, the games that inspired it, should absolutely play it. The combat system is top-notch and the world is beautifully designed.
It's also got a total range to it that is not obvious from your first few hours of playing it. It's much more fun and goofy than you think it's going to be. I would say that Nier Automata is a very clear point of inspiration for the tone of this game.
That too only really becomes clear as you get deeper into it. Like I say, some of the music is fantastic. One of the standout areas of the game is quite early on.
It's one of the areas they used to show off the game when they announced it, I think. It's basically an underwater area. And it looks amazing.
Loads of coral moving around you. And there's bits of it to explore while you're down there. Looks absolutely beautiful.
As gorgeous as anything you would find in a Square Enix game. And then there's a boss battle at the end of that section that has one of the best pieces of boss music I've heard in this genre. You know, it's just something that just really like...
I heard it, I was like, wow, that really kind of goes. But in general, I think this game is great at creating earworms. Again, just demonstrates that sort of like knowledge of what made the games that inspired it great.
And so I'm really, I'm super positive on it. And at the time we're recording this, the reviews haven't gone live yet. I have no idea what the critical reception is, but got a feeling that Final Fantasy fans are really going to dig this, Matthew.
I certainly want to play more. I just needed to find a big chunk of time. Like it wasn't a good one to juggle with the blueprints.
I also, I was curious how you felt about, is it Charlie Cox is the lead voice? I'm not entirely sold on him as a voice actor.
I like him because I think that the performances deliberately dial it down in a world that is so heightened. And I think it almost needs a bit of a careful touch to, like I think a bit more of the Final Fantasy melodrama wouldn't necessarily fit with this game. I think it is trying to go with a bit more sort of like, I don't know, this is, these are real people experiencing this very heightened situation.
But, you know, it's an interesting note. I don't think I even really know his, like, normal English accent outside of, I haven't seen Stardust, which I know is one of the, like, key films he was been in, but I've heard his dead in a voice so much.
I'd say this is more him in Stardust mode.
Yeah.
You know, he's quite sort of humble. He's quite sort of subtle and a quiet character. I just don't know if it was necessarily the voice I expected to come out of, out of the character.
Yeah, I think the main guy really looks like Robert Pattinson.
Oh yeah, he majorly does. Absolutely.
And because of that, because it isn't Robert Pattinson's voice coming out of it, that's maybe what's throwing me off in hindsight. Because the other characters, I don't really have that same problem with, you know, the couple that I've met so far. They've been pretty strong.
The second companion you meet in the game is instantly very, very cool. It doesn't feel too tropey, but you're like, oh, this person seems like a badass. Actually, one other thing I was going to say about the combat system.
I like that, I don't know if they keep doing this as they add party members, but so far each character has a bespoke combat ability or approach. So the main guy, his whole deal is about charging up this charge, which he can then do an incredibly powerful one hit kill with, whereas the magic user character, by casting certain elemental magics, layers up. I can't remember what she calls them, if they're skins or something, but the idea is that she's building up a currency of elemental force, which she can then use to amplify other attacks and things.
So I do like combat systems, where everyone has a little something different to do.
Yeah, for sure. And it's a combat system that really promotes the idea of exploiting weaknesses of enemies and stuff like that, in that very elementary, literally, Final Fantasy style way, where it's not super complicated to follow, but there is a certain amount of loadout management that goes into the game's progression systems as well. Like, you can't do everything at once all the time, for example.
But I agree, the characters complement each other really well. And the characters that come into it a little bit later are a bit more... They, too, have their own way of doing things.
It's a bit different. And so you, again, have to think a little bit laterally about, well, what's my ideal party setup for taking this one particular enemy, for example? Yeah, really good.
And also, I will say this about the game. Like, the combat animations are fantastic. It is very generous in that respect.
I think it's just got loads of visually spectacular things to show you when you're in the actual combat arena. Yeah, really, really, really good. And some great kind of weird monster design as well.
It just doesn't feel like you've seen all the things in this game before. It feels like it's drawing from a slightly different set of visual influences, even if the actual game design influences are quite obvious, you know? So, yeah.
Yeah, reminds me a little bit, not as in it's similar to, but like what happened with Castlevania Lords of Shadows, where you had this like interesting Spanish team bought like their own vibe to this sort of Gothic thing. So even though the hack and slash ideas, you know, were all quite kind of familiar, there was this extra like artistic flavor that you don't normally get in that game. And you know, it felt like a kind of team announcing itself a little bit with Lords of Shadow.
And there's definitely, you know, the same thing is happening here.
Yeah, I think that's true for sure. I think that, so there's an interview that Kepler did on the website that I now work on, the website that I now run, where they said that basically they deliberately work on games that don't use things like Star Wars as frames of reference or just the same four to five references that inspire everything. They deliberately don't do that or look for games that don't do that.
I think that's just really obvious here. It's a good approach because I think in video games, we are sick of seeing a lot of those same influences. You get to Summer Game Fest and then you end up seeing like five or six games that look exactly the same in a row.
You're like, I fucking hate looking at these after a certain point. I think it's really great that they've gone with something so visually distinctive in style. Another thing I'll say about this game, Matthew, it's 40 quid.
And it's my growing feeling that the 40 quid game is going to be like the big winner of this year. Split fiction, also 40 quid. I just think that the people want to spend 40 pounds on a video game again.
And so, yeah, I think it's that thing where, like we say, it doesn't have the same... It doesn't have an FF7 Rebirth polish this game, like, no way. But I will say it's...
It might... But it might be closer to what you want from this genre than you've been getting in recent years. So I will say that about it.
You know, I was... But I've got...
I can hear that you're... You've played a lot more of this than I have. And I can hear that you're, you know...
I know when you're excited by something and it's like very much in your wheelhouse. So, yeah, that's good.
Yeah. Intrigued to hear what you think because you get deeper into it. There's loads more to talk about.
So we can come back to this in a month and see if we've both finished it, see how we both feel about it, Matthew. In the meantime, let's move on to another game then. So Bionic Bay.
This is also published by Kepler and an old pal of mine, Matt Handrohan, pinged us a couple of codes just to check it out. I've played about two hours of it, Matthew. You've played a bunch more hours.
It's a precision platformer with a little bit of inside slash limbo to the visual style. Have you got any kind of better frames of reference for it?
It looks like it's going to be a limbo I like in that it's very sort of silhouette-y and there's some physics-y puzzles in there as well. It's got a slightly more developed central kind of concept it keeps coming back to, which I'd say limbo particularly doesn't have. But the actual character himself, you can really throw him around very sort of, when you get a bit of momentum behind him, you can do these amazing great big long jumps.
He's a sort of little jumble of sort of physics-y limbs. The actual movement of him, it reminds me a little bit of that, what are those really fucking difficult platformers about, like a little ninja? Is it like N?
Yeah. That's sort of what his movement reminds me of. I haven't played that game in a long time, so I might be really wide of the mark here, but it's quite generous with steering him around once you've jumped.
You've got other moves, like once you're jumping, you can press another move to do like a dive out of that jump, which can be used in quite a precision way to sort of power you through tiny gaps. As the game goes on, there's some quite nightmarish platforming where you have to jump over huge fields of explosives and then do this little last minute dive to kind of go through a crack in some other explosives. It looks like it should be impossible, but actually you feel like you're in full control of this thing, and the mistakes are kind of down to you not reading the situation rather than it being very fiddly to control.
So yeah, sorry, that wasn't a succinct way of describing it at all.
No, I think it's right to kind of feel around it like that, because I agree that it has some things in common with those games, but it's not quite as... I didn't find it nearly as fiddly from what I've played so far as what M Plus was. It's not quite that demanding.
The checkpointing is very generous, you know?
It's not like a Super Meat Boy or even like a Celeste in terms of some of the jumping difficulty. It does slow right down for more puzzly rooms where you just have to work out what's going on and how to manipulate the rooms. But there is also, I haven't tried it yet, but it's got online modes which are like speed running modes.
So like speed running is built into its DNA. Like they obviously have this in mind that they want you to throw this character through these levels as fast as you can. Once you've mastered the character and understood the levels.
But on your first go through, you know, this story campaign, you know, there are bits where you have to be really on top of the platforming, but then there are bits when it slows right down. And the main sort of puzzle mechanic is you have this ability to tag objects and then press another button to switch places with them, which I don't know if I've seen that necessarily. I was trying to think of other games which had mechanics like it.
Has The Swapper got something in common with this?
Some of the principles of The Swapper in that when you move to a location, fundamentally the Swapper ability is about putting you in a different place, as is this ability. But because you can tag any free moving object, basically the nature of those objects comes into a lot of puzzles. So if there's a gun turret, for example, if you tag an explosive that's nowhere near the gun turret, jump towards the gun turret and then switch at the last minute, the explosive will take your place and hit the gun turret and blow it up, for example, and as it goes on, there's a bit more using the power to build new platforming bridges out and moving props into different places or building like makeshift shields in a way which feels quite like organic and, you know, because it was all governed by physics, it feels like you can kind of wiggle your way through certain situations, I guess a bit like the physics puzzles in like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
You have this skill and if you can apply it, you can solve the problems in lots of different ways. That's kind of the energy of it and so that's quite a different flavour to the you must run forward, you must dodge all the explosives and it's very well judged in how it switches between those two modes, I think.
Yeah, I think it's really well done as well because I did fear, maybe it's from seeing like the online challenge thing in the menu, that oh, this is going to be like the Spelunky motherfuckers every day getting like amazing scores kind of thing and it's just not, right, it's not, it's not really that and then again, like I mentioned the checkpointing, I think that just, it just, it lets you trial and error quite generously and yeah, that's so my preferred way of doing it. It feels like a lot of those, there's like a lot of small creative decisions that stop it from being a game that I wouldn't enjoy and make it into a game that I do enjoy, you know?
Yeah, I mean, the checkpointing, like it often surprises me how generous it is. So I'm like, oh, I can't believe you deemed that platform safe, but like, thank you. I really appreciate that.
And there's only been two or three sections. I think I'm quite close to the end now, about five hours in where I've felt like I've had to like pull off, say a 30 second routine perfectly. The rest of the time, it's quite happy to let you chip away at a problem, which when something has some of the difficulty of this game, I really appreciate that.
And it acknowledges that if you want to do it perfectly and race through it, then yes, have a go at the old leaderboards. And that it caters to both crowds, I think is really nicely done.
Yeah. I think it just allows you to enjoy the experimentation of some of the physics-y puzzles in it as well, or the chain reactions you set off of sending a missile crashing into a load of explosive objects and just seeing what the outcome is. I think it means you don't fear that, and it means you can enjoy that.
Yeah. And they know that it's very funny when their little scientist guy dies, because he can die in really specific ways. So with the swapping, you can often set up chain reactions that end up crushing you to death under your own object or whatever.
And there's always a comedy splat, and then you instantly re-spawn back in. But there's some stuff with lasers where they burn you at the very precise point. They touch your body.
The way he comes apart seems very reactive. I've had bits where I've been holding on to platforms. I've been doing a ledge hang, and the laser has just touched, only just touched my hands and burnt my hands off.
And then he's fallen off the platform because he hasn't got hands to hold on anymore. And that kind of specificity sets up some quite dark shit. And maybe that's why they don't need the checkpoints, because they know that you're going to put this guy through hell.
He just burns and burns and burns.
And slides around, legs just going everywhere. It's just like a proper ragdolls in places. It's just, yeah, it's physical comedy, right?
It's funny to watch. So, yeah. Yeah, just a lot of decisions, so yeah.
But I think make it just like surpass my expectations a bit, because not many press have covered this. And I guess I maybe played it thinking, oh, I feel like I've seen a lot of things that look a bit like this in the last 10 years or so, but I don't feel like I've experienced this precise combination of elements before. And I do think it's visually very appealing.
Looks great on the Steam Deck. It's a good game, right?
Yeah, it's really good. Like, I had exactly the same thing. Like, when Matt sent it over, I thought, I don't really know what this is.
I haven't been following this at all. But yeah, I've kind of done it in almost two sessions where you just sort of plant yourself down on the sofa and it just pulls you through because each puzzle is small enough that you can probably do it in five or six goes. But then, oh, there's the next big thing.
And I can't say I'm particularly bothered about what's going on narratively or like this guy's little journey. Like he's basically jumping through quite abstract, sort of mechanical contraptions.
Techno-organism kind of stuff.
But you know, the way that each area does have a gimmick to it. Oh, this was going to be about lasers or this is going to be about gravity. And the gravity section does some of the kind of 2D platforming tricks that Mario Galaxy did, which I always really love.
Where you end up like orbiting around a little planet in an endless jump and things. That's really, really nicely done. Quite a highlight.
And it does also, I don't know if you've got this yet, but it does mix up your powers occasionally. There are some sections where you can slow time. You get like a really powerful punch.
And a lot of the puzzles are about punching props and then slowing time. And as all the props fly crazily over the screen, they become like stairways for you to climb. And that's quite satisfying.
There's a lot of, you know, I can't believe I'm climbing all over these missiles or whatever. Thrilling moments. It's just well paced, really well judged.
You know, I feel like I've got like another hour or so in it probably. And then I'm hoping for something spectacular at the ending.
Satisfying. Well, I've only played a couple of hours of it, like I say, but definitely going to finish this and do very much value when people listen to podcasts. They're like, oh, I think people might, I think the people making this might like this and send over keys.
That's cool. I think that's how you ended up playing the Golden, what's it called, games, right? The Golden Idol games.
That's how we ended up first getting those games. So yeah, I do appreciate that.
Hopefully Nintendo will listen to this and go, oh, maybe we'll send them a Marriott World and Donkey Kong Bonanza.
And I will apologize to James at Raw Fury for saying that Blueprints is a game that kicks you in the balls repeatedly. That's, I'm not saying that's like my greatest game criticism ever. You know, it's not my finest hour necessarily.
So yes, yeah, enjoying that. Bionic Bay, then that's out on Steam and PS5. If you want to go play that, hopefully one day we'll come to Switch 2.
Maybe it's kind of perfect on there, to be honest. It's great on Steam Deck. Again, I feel like between Blueprints and Bionic Bay, Matthew, the Steam Deck is sort of doing now what the Switch used to do for me.
You know, it's not quite as comfy to carry around, but you know, it's definitely got the stuff technically to play these indie games that are a little bit more demanding. Okay, a very brief bit on this, then, because Matthew's not played this game, and it's certainly not his kind of thing. Tempest Rising is a real-time strategy game.
Oh, I want to hear about this.
Yeah, so it's a real-time strategy game on PC. I think it was published by 3D Realms and made by a Danish developer, I believe, called Slipgate Ironworks. And it is a riff on Command and Conquer, for sure.
It's been a very up-and-down few years for the RTS genre. Like, not many of these games have properly cut through. Then the last sort of one that everyone agreed was really good was Age of Empires 4, which was good, but it was also a bit like this, I guess, kind of a retread of something you've played before.
But it's been so long since anyone's done an RTS in the Command and Conquer vein, with a bit of money behind it, that I think that it's reason enough for this game to exist. Plus, it's super polished. It was announced a couple of years ago, and I think that they've delayed it while they've been polishing it.
I think that's probably why they've waited as long as they have, because maybe they just felt like they needed to get it right off the back of maybe things like Company of Heroes 3 just bombing and that kind of going wrong, and there being Homeworld 3 as well, which again people didn't really like, and in the Steam reviews people are a bit withering about. It's just been such a tory time for that genre that you've got to get it right, and it feels like this has. It basically comes down to a couple of C&C type factions.
Ones like the, they call it the GDF or something like that. It's very much like the GDI, kind of like RIF. They're basically the Americans of what they're doing in this game.
And then a kind of like vaguely commie-ish alliance on the other side, kind of like very just broadly drawn, but have different sort of like unit types basically that kind of function together in that sort of Rock Paper Scissors type way, classic RTS fashion. They've updated the units and the types of buildings in some ways from the Red Alert days, Matthew, but there's also like, so you've got things like drone operators for example, and they are super satisfied to use even if drones in real life are just such fucking horrible awful things in the in the theatre of conflict.
That's an official back page stunt.
We'll be listing our sort of like policies on, you know, numerous sort of like methods of war in the Patreon posts accompanying this episode. Yeah, it's, but they're really, it's just like these little drones that basically tear apart buildings and and vehicles. And again, in real life, horrible.
But in this game, pretty enjoyable. And then you got like your grenadiers, which all sound a bit like Tom Bane. Sorry, Tom Bane, Tom Hardy's Bane.
So they got a bit of that when you first said, yeah, so a little bit like that. And you're like, OK, well, I appreciate that touch. There's just a bit of a bit of heightened sort of like voice acting going on across the board in this one that gives it that command and conquer flavor.
But, yeah, the units are just quite fun. I've just I've just I've done three missions so far of one of the two campaigns, the the GDF campaign, and that third mission was definitely the best one. It gives you basically a Tanya kind of equivalent, who's just like this this sniper and her whole thing is like she'll just if you get to like a high point on the map, she'll basically just fucking destroy everyone from that high point.
But if units get up close, they can do a lot of damage very quickly. So you have to sort of protect her. She's going around this map.
Classic kind of Command and Conquer star mission, but really, really enjoyable. And yeah, just looks fantastic. Explosions look great.
Vehicles look great. Animations are nice. It's just, I think that if you just feel like no game has got close enough to what those games felt like, this is the game that does that.
And I think it's something like 35 quid. So again, in that 40 quid range where I think people are just quite into paying that sort of money for this sort of thing. I assume you've noticed a bit of discussion around it.
I did wonder if this was going to kind of be to the sort of 90s RTS games what Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics were to like Commandos. Does it have enough of a lick of paint 2020 sheen to difference it? Or is it trying to be kind of truer than that to the originals?
Truer than that. Without feeling so derivative. In fact, you know, I think the ultimate test of how good this game will be will come down to how weird the units get or how like sort of extravagant or exotic they get because that was the appeal of Red Alert, right?
Was just how silly the units to get your Mammoth tanks, your Tesla tanks, your Tesla lads going in. Just slightly preposterous. Tanya, of course, is also preposterous.
Just, yeah, yeah. So you kind of want it to have that. I would say it's not quite as goofy.
The cutscenes in it are Unreal Engine 5, so it's mostly like a guy or a bloke, sorry, a bloke or a lady just explaining the objective to you with a series of additional options you can ask about. But even though they get a little bit silly, you do wonder if they've gone full C&C pastiche and filmed it with 90s cameras and presented them in 320p, if that might be more fun as a way of presenting the story. So in some ways, it maybe feels like it's riffing on that without going all the way.
I would say it's more trying to be that more than something like Desperado's and Shadow Tactics in reinventing that formula. It's definitely trying to tap into your nostalgia for C&C because they rightfully thought, well, EA is doing fuck all with this series, so why don't we do something, which is what it feels like.
Is the music good?
Yeah, it's got Frank Klepacki, who worked on the C&C soundtrack, so it's got an authentic Command and Conquer soundtrack. I don't know if he does all the music, but massive Red Alert hell much vibes to some of the music I've heard so far. Yeah, even the menu screens, the front end will remind you of the C&C games.
It's just there's a lot of love for it. Americans made this cool, weird game that we like these games years ago and we want to make our version of it because we loved it and feel like it doesn't really exist anymore. They're going to do similar things, really.
They're building on what came before, but this is definitely tapping more into the tonal identity of Command and Conquer, I would say. Yeah. Okay, Matthew.
Final game, then, for this episode is Promise Mascot Agency, a game where Yakuza lads called the Janitor is basically chucked out of the Yakuza. It has to go into exile in this town that is apparently quite cursed and run a mascot agency, sending these themed characters to various events and managing a business while exploring this PS2-esque, but it's prettier than that, open world, this little town. And it's, yeah, let's start with you on this one, Matthew, because I had some first impressions of it that I completely sort of did a 180 on, but I'd like to hear how you've been finding it so far, because I know you're enjoying it.
Yeah, yeah. So I'd seen the trailers and was obviously interested. It came from Kaizen Gameworks, who made Paradise Killer.
And a lot of the stuff that they are into just from reading interviews with them and having met them at EGX a few years ago. You know, I am also into, they love sort of Suda 51 games. They love Yakuza games.
They love those 7 out of 10 games. They're very much on that wavelength. And one thing that's really cool about this game is that the voice cast is basically full of people that they like and admire from other games.
So like the lead character is voiced by the same guy as Kiryu, which, you know, for a Yakuza fan, to be able to work with someone, that's fucking rad. But also, you know, the cast is full of like, game developers they admire, you know, figures from the games industry.
Shuhei Yoshida, of course.
Shuhei Yoshida, that's who I'm thinking of. So yeah, I like the idea that this isn't just like a love letter to a certain kind of games, you know, it has people from a certain kind of game world in it, which I think that's just interesting in and of itself. The actual game is, it is a management game, but not in, I wouldn't say in like a huge, like serious or scary way.
It's probably closest to one of the sort of side hustle games from the Yakuza series. So it's quite like the real estate management, for example, in Yakuza Zero, in that you're going around this town, you're collecting mascots who come and work at your company, but like everyone you meet is also kind of adding to your network of connections and the jobs you can do. And it has that Yakuza-y thing of like everything's kind of interconnected and everything kind of feeds back into this sort of central thrust.
So you do a silly little thing here and then you'll get a bonus over there. And that stuff's really neat. But the thing I didn't really appreciate about this game is it's kind of like an open world collectathon at the same time.
You send these mascots out and while they're out on jobs, you're kind of driving around this town in your little truck, going to meet new mascots, new contracts and all this. But at the same time, collecting objects to take to people, which will get you certain stat buffs. There are these huge quest lines to kind of...
It's a really mad game when you sort of say it out loud, but you get rewarded for knocking down the mayor's promotional posters and you get rewarded for picking up bin liners of trash and cleaning the town up. And there are these sort of paper dolls, sort of possessed paper dolls. And when you collect those, you know, that's helping.
And everything you collect is adding sort of stat multipliers to the kind of business of the promised mascot agency. So the games this ends up being is almost the mix of or collision of business management, but almost like crackdown at the same time, in the way that you are collecting these things, these little trinkets, and all of those have a tangible impact on like the power curve of your business. Also, just on the simple like brain chemistry of seeing another trinket 10 meters down the road, there's so many things to collect in this game, you basically can't move anywhere in the world without making some progress, and that's incredibly compelling.
I'm not going to say it's hugely deep, but it has that basic, oh yes, must collect another, you know, it's almost like a clicker game or something. It's, you know, all vampire survivors. Like it moves at that kind of pace, but it's also this open world exploration thing.
And like I say, everything you do is feeding back into how successful your business is. And there's some pressure on the business. Like you have to pay certain fees at the end of the day, and you're trying to send money home to the head of your Yakuza clan to kind of keep her from getting, so she can kind of pay off people who are trying to kill her.
And if you don't get that money, like you'll fail the game and it will be a game over. To be honest, what I've played so far, which is only like four or five hours, everything you do is just increasing the speed of everything else, that it's quite hard to like fall behind that curve, I would say. And that isn't a criticism.
You know, I don't think I'd want a game where I'm having to like meticulously manage all these mascots so that my business doesn't fail. But it just creates this whirlwind of improvements, which that's a lot of games, but never at this speed. You know, especially if you've just played in Assassin's Creed Shadow or something.
In those four or five hours, I feel like I've achieved all this mad stuff just by driving this little truck around. Yeah, it's just super compelling. Yeah, and I'm completely locked in on it.
Yeah, it's interesting. When I first started playing it, the whole mascot element of it means that I think this game is sort of a visual novel that's smuggled in as a management sim or an open world game combined. I think a lot of what it wants to delight you with are the interactions of the different mascots who all have their own personalities and weird themes, and Pinky, who's the main one in there, and you just have so many instances of Key's voice actor, Takeo Kuroda, going, Pinky, in this very distinct way.
That guy, by the way, is like a fucking titan of voice acting. I hear that voice. That's like a special effect, that voice, isn't it?
You hear it, you're like, whatever you paid him, it was so worth it. I mean, that guy, I salute you, sir. You are a megawatt talent.
Well done. But I thought that the things it was riffing on were a bunch of maybe anime and manga that I just have no real frame of reference for. In some ways, it feels like the starting point for the game was all those amusing photos of Pikachu mascots getting stuck in turnstiles and stuff.
I wonder if this is actually just a bit too weeb for me. But it's genuinely funny. And the fact that it's got this combination I feel like I've not seen before of Japanese pop culture sensibilities and a British sense of humour is that's quite cool, the way those two things meet.
And so I think that at first, I thought, I feel like Pinky is going to be my least favourite character of any game this year. About an hour or two in, I was quite won over and just found so much to dialogue, so funny, so many of the drawings and the visual novel bits so amusing, just Pinky wearing glasses whenever there's like time to do work or some thinking.
Yeah.
So funny. Looking like really sort of like deranged when talking about revenge or something. Just again, very, very amusing.
And then, yeah, so I think that in some ways, it's like all the management stuff is a container for that stuff. So there's no real reason to slow you down. But we're so conditioned by open world games into our time being wasted, that it feels unusual to be treated out of the gates with, here's a speed boost or here's how you can go and unlock gliding and basically turn this game to Pilotwings, you know?
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Interesting.
Yeah. It's the characters are, they are brilliantly drawn and it does this very clever thing where they've all got like side quests, which all boil down to, I've lost a load of objects around this map you have to find for me. As you bring more of the objects back, they sort of power up as allies and there's like a little card game when the mascots get into trouble.
You can like call on these allies to come and help bail the mascots out. The more you help everyone in the town, the more they power up, the better they are to play in this game, which is one benefit. But the bigger benefit is that, you know, each like side quest milestone, you get a conversation with them where you learn a bit more about them or their back story and it kind of fills out that world.
And they're so well drawn that when you're talking to one character and they start talking about another character, you're like, oh yeah, I completely know that guy. You know, like I've met that guy and I completely get why you'd think that about him. And it creates this really convincing sense of community.
The fact that everyone's aware of each other and has opinions of each other. And you know, you meet a guy who's like, oh, he's a bit bashful. Because I've got a crush on the English exchange student who works at the school.
And I've met her an hour ago. And I'm like, oh, that's funny that you have this little relationship. And through visual novel style exchanges, it does paint this kind of cohesive and massive sketch of this community.
So well done. Like I've not really seen it done that well before. That the sense that everyone kind of knowing each other and the fact that everything you're doing at the mascot agency is kind of improving the town and, you know, you're invested in this town itself and the people there and the way they kind of interact.
There's something very sort of sincere about that goal and the kind of impact it has on everyone. But at the same time, it's completely stupid and funny. Like it's never earnest at all.
And that's, yeah, what a weird sweet spot to like land this story in. That is also a game about sending a piece of living tofu to open like a sex video shot, you know? Or, you know, or chasing a load of sort of ghost wolves so you can improve your van or whatever.
But you don't question any of it. It's got this mad, no logic, but also complete internal logic, which I think is absolutely brilliant.
I got a slight whiff of No More Heroes about it as well, you know?
Yeah.
That's sort of like Suda, one of Suda's kind of like weird places. You just sort of drive around. It's got, you know, just a sort of like a feeling of an author or authors wanting to create a specific community of strange people who you get quite into.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's got that about it. And like I said, yeah.
The building interiors are really like buildings in Santa Destroying. Yeah. They're kind of like an idea of what a video shop would look like or, you know, this is what this bar would look like.
And some of the assets in there are a little funky, but, you know, and it's always banging music throughout as well. Lots of weird little ditties. Great, very Suda 51, like screen transitions with like weird logos and animated bits.
And yeah, it's like, wears its influences on it on its sleeve, but kind of is also sort of wholly original in so many ways that it doesn't just feel like it's, you know, a tribute act.
The other key thing is, and you were saying, you were sort of like getting to this as well, I think, is that it is played for laughs, but you know that the people making it respect the genres they're in and the culture that they're dealing with.
Yeah.
Because I think what I'm saying is it comes from a place of love. It's different to the parody visual novel that comes out on April Fools' Day that I know fans of visual novels are fucking sick of, for example. It's like the inverse of that, where they clearly love the things that they're dabbling with, and they want to show you how much they love those things, you know?
Yeah. The fact that they have cast the people from these games or the people who make these games, you know, it does feel like they're sticking their flag in and saying, this is the stuff that matters the most, you know? Like, these people fucking rule and deserve your kind of respect.
Yeah.
I don't know, that's the thing I keep coming back to, like, how awesome is it to love a thing and get to a point where you can put money in those actors' pockets, because you respect them that much, but also have them be part of your thing? I mean, that's got to be like the dream, right?
Yeah, it reminds me of a Ken Levine anecdote about the original Bioshock, where he was like, they were casting the voices of the little sisters, and he was like, it'd be great to get someone who sounds a bit like Drew Siller from Buffy, and then they realized that video games are at the point where they could just go and ask Juliet Landau, the actress, to literally come in and do the voice. And yeah, it feels like that sort of thing. It's like you get to a certain point where you can ask, then why not get the real thing?
Because when you get the real thing, it has such an impact. So yeah, I agree. It's interesting.
I'm really curious to see what I make by the end of this, because some of the cooler reviews are like the open world. The actual loop of it gets repetitive and people burn out on it a bit. Some critics have.
But some people really love it. PC Gamer gave this a monster, monster score. And so far, super into it.
I've played less than you, but those two hours just evaporated. And every instance I thought I wasn't going to get into it, I did.
Yeah, it was just the perfect chaser to Blueprints for me. Yeah, because you can't help but succeed in this game, which may sound like it's brain dead and it's just throwing rewards at you. But that every time you drive through a poster for the mayor, it gives you a few fans and then those fans get multiplied because you've cleaned up a few shrines and every shrine you've cleaned up it stacks your fan gain or whatever.
Even right down to the fact that the sound effect and the animation of driving through the mayor's posters is nice and good, you want to see it a thousand times and you probably will see it a thousand times. It gives you a percentage. It says, oh, you've cleaned up 0.02 percent of bin bags, and then you hit the next bin bag and it goes, you've hit 0.03 percent.
It's just like catnip. I want to see that number go up. What happens when you hit 100?
You know that something's going to happen. You know?
Yeah. Well, that says a lot about you as a player, I think, and how you're able to finish Assassin's Creed Shadows in a relatively short space of time and still have a good time without feeling like you had Stockholm Syndrome.
But if you're going to do the map collectathon a la Ubisoft, it's like that except it's in like 1% the map size of shadows and has a 1000% more stuff to collect. Like it's so overblown. Yeah, I'd love to know what the actual kernel of the idea was for this.
Like what is the core thing? Is it the management or is it that sense of driving around the map? Or what was that rate of collectibles?
Was that created just to fill the time between the mascots going on jobs? I would really like to know how this thing came to be because it feels like properly original and it really, really works for me.
Yeah, for sure. I hope they get to keep making their stuff. In some ways, I think that maybe this has lost the Mindshare battle with blueprints, even though they're so different from each other.
I agree that if you have both, and we're very lucky we got sent both, it's worth saying that, then I agree one is an amazing palate cleanser to the other. But I feel like this has maybe had to fight a bit harder for attention, whereas blueprints has become the game, the indie game that everyone's talked about. That's a bummer.
You just wonder if maybe three or four weeks removed, more people might have discovered it.
This was the game that moved to avoid the Switch announcement, right?
Yeah, that's right. So unlucky, very unlucky.
Very unlucky. But I don't know. I feel like Paradise Killer had a growing following around it.
They're quite a good word of mouth studio, and the game's full of weird things that make you laugh that you then tell your friends or people on a podcast. Sorry, that makes you sound like you're not my friend. That you tell your friends or listeners of a podcast.
Appointments you reluctantly record 200 episodes with.
Let me underline that. Listeners does not equal friends. And they go, oh, I'd like to see a bit of that.
Especially Yakuza fans who get through these games, chew through them. And like you say, this is the number one observation I've seen about this game. It's like a Yakuza management minigame blown up into a full game, right?
And yeah, I do think that it's adjacent to Yakuza tonally. And so you'll probably enjoy it on that basis, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. It's funny.
So I skipped some of the dialogue in this, but I never skipped the Janitor's Dialogue because I just want to hear that voice acting. I'm like, well, they spent the money. Let's fucking hear it, basically.
So, yeah. Good stuff, Matthew. Goddamn.
Some great games that we talked about there. Did you want to touch on your efforts to play the entire Metroid series before Metroid Prime 4 comes out?
I just want to throw out there that I've started what I thought was going to be a very long and arduous journey towards doing a big Metroid episode for Metroid Prime 4, and actually just turned into incredibly pleasurable couple of weeks where I wanted to play all the older retro Metroids on Switch Online for this episode. So I did Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, Metroid Zero Mission. Then I played through Metroid Prime, and I was going to call it a day there, but then I thought, no, actually, I really want to go completely all in.
So I got the Wii U out, plugged in the Wii U, and now playing Metroid Prime 3 on that. Plan to play Metroid Other M, like go all out, do a proper big Metroid deep dive some point later in the year. But it also triggered that we're going to do a Metroid Prime Remastered XL episode next month.
That's right. So May, you can download that and we'll probably put two hours discussion into just that one game, Metroid Prime.
Yeah. I just wanted to get that out there so people could play Metroid Prime Remastered in time for that episode if they wanted. But also, god damn amazing time I've had playing those games.
They are all excellent and still excellent. You know, even going back to Super Metroid where you lose some of the quality of life stuff that they add in over the years, it's just such a banger. And yeah, of all the big replays I've done for the podcast, it's been one of the most rewarding ones, for sure.
It's just like playing six 10 out of 10s, you know?
Yeah, I've put up the J. Bayliss flair for this one. So yeah, he's a big Metroid guy.
Yeah, it's exciting. I think my excitement for Switch 2 has just manifested as this desire to play loads of Metroid because of Metroid Prime 4. And I just really, really recommend it.
I also really recommend playing them on Switch Online and using all the rewind function and quick save functions to get through any bits which are assholes, like all the bosses. And yeah, no shame. Great way to play.
Yeah, I almost finished Zero Mission on my Amburnic handheld. And the one downside of playing them on Switch is the screen is a bit too big for the resolution of GBA games, but it did look so beautiful on my Amburnic handheld. Just that it was like, I think it's the right screen sort of proportion and sort of pixel density.
It just looked fucking incredible. And so I would like to say before I die that I've played these games, Matthew. So I will follow you down this path and play the Metroid games.
I won't play Prime 2 and 3, but I will play the rest.
So Prime 2 is the only one I'm like, I don't know if it's currently going to get a replay, because I did not have a very good time with that originally.
But Other M, you've, did you get the Wii U out to play Other M?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Other M, yeah. And Metroid Prime 3, because as part of the collection, I wanted to play, because Metroid Prime 3 is made with the pointer aiming in mind and it's been so long since I played that, like literally since it first came out on the Wii, that I wanted to just remind myself.
And it's not as good as Prime 1, but it's still pretty good.
Well, an older boy told me that the Metroid Prime trilogy has been put into some fancy thing you can boot on Steam Deck, where you can play versions that have calibrated the controls for the analog stick. So we're an older boy to give you that information. That's something that I've heard about.
Don't ask me, I'm just a kid. That's a Link's Awakening reference, Matthew.
That feels like a crucial power up that you'd collect in Metroid to then go and enjoy a load of other Metroid Prime games. I only think of things in terms of Samus' power curve now.
Yeah, okay. So I only think of things in terms of did I get the aquarium on this run now? So that's my thing.
When I walk into any room, Matthew, I'm like, what fucking room is this going to be? That's where my brain's at basically. Did you see my hilarious gag about a Mr. X collaboration with Blueprints?
You don't know which room he's going to turn up in. How would you rate that joke on Bluesky?
Oh, I mean, I don't know. 8 out of 10?
That's exactly what I wanted. It's what I'd give Blueprints itself. So I appreciate it.
Thank you. Okay, this episode is done, but there'll be many more episodes in the future as there always is. And Matthew, it's a pleasure discussing those games with you.
What a fucking banger month of stuff.
Yeah.
Really, really good. We'll do another What We've Been Playing episode next month and probably try and squeeze a bit of Doom chatter into that one, I imagine. But maybe also circle back with a couple of these games.
I definitely want to hear more about what Matthew thinks of Expedition 33 as he gets deeper into the game. So that'll be interesting. But yeah, in the meantime, you can find the podcast at patreon.com/backpagepod.
We're Backpage Pod on Twitter and Blue Sky as well. And yeah, if you want to fund us £4.50 tier and get two extra podcasts a month, you can. And as Matthew mentioned, Metro Primary Master, that's coming in May.
And this month we just did an episode about the Lukewarm Console Exclusives Hall of Fame, which seemed to go down pretty well in the Discord. So that was cool. Matthew, by the way, looks like he's going to win the 360 redraft quite handily.
Good for him.
I feel bad about it.
Why's that?
I thought they were way more evenly matched than that. I don't really know what's going on with that.
Do you think, though, that I kind of feel a bit less competitive about the four-person drafts for the simple reason of like, it's too much you can't control? You know, I had one pick.
I feel like I sneak under the radar every time because you three, you have more of a history that allows you to kind of snipe at each other. And I go kind of untouched.
Yeah, because you're like the nice guy of the drafts. They're voting for that.
Next time, you basically need to tell, like Dave is allowed to go weapons free on me if he wants.
I mean, that's the funny thing.
The missus might not like it.
It's like, you know, you're a very good friend in the same way Dave's a very good friend, but our dynamics are completely different.
Very different.
We're just not.
I'd be furious if you spoke to me the way you spoke to Dave.
That was funny as well because there was one listener who did bristle genuinely at how antagonistic I was. I mean, I will say that in day to day where me and Dave hang out is very mellow. We're not like that at all.
We are definitely playing out for the podcast, but also I'm doing it in the name of good podcasting. But the idea it might be negatively affecting us draft wise. It's worth considering, I think.
It's part of it. Yeah. I just very quietly, very frictionless candidate.
You know, it works. If anything, I feel like I've unlocked the formula a little bit of like how to do drafts and I've stopped making, I'd say the mistakes, but maybe the mistakes made it a bit more characterful as well. You know, like I don't really go as much with the heart picks these days.
Yeah, I actually thought, I thought your list was really good. It was a bit like a switch draft where I was like, well, you know, I sort of, I was a bit annoyed more people weren't excited by GTA 5 as a pick. That was my one annoyance because I feel like.
Yeah, that's I mean, that I fucking love that game.
Well, I feel like when you pick that in the PC draft, people went nuts for it. But when I picked it in this draft.
People are sick, Sam, they just can't.
The Discorders. But again, if I rag on the Discorders, they'll just vote against me in the next draft. But no, I thought you had 11 good picks.
I think Ash deserved more votes than he got though as well.
I'm surprised that just Dark Souls alone hasn't helped him a bit more. Like I said, quite an untested tactic in our drafts. When it all went a bit lost via domus with Dave, that's like me drafting circa 2023.
That's you drafting Red Faction, the original PS2 draft basically.
I get what you're trying to do, but people don't respond well to that. They'd like Halo 3. That's what people want to hear.
You're right though, in the sense that we've both gotten very polished with our drafting strategy. So I think that either when we're doing a draft that's just us, we need to come up with something quite high concept, like the Metacritic sort of stuff. That one was really good, I think, because we had such a good angle to pull out some slightly weird picks.
But yeah, I think in general, I think you and I almost can't do vanilla drafts ourselves now, because we've gotten too good at them.
We're just like two bored gods toying with the mortals.
Two bored overweight gods with declining teeth. That's us, basically. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
MrBazzlePesto on the various things.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter and BlueSky as well, and Letterboxd if you want to read my review of Alex Garland's Warfare. You can go check that out now.
That's us done. Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
