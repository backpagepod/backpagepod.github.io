I'm Samuel Roberts, and joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, our first guest of the year is a returning guest. Ash, how's it going?
Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm the first guest of the year. That feels like such an honor, or more likely a reflection of me badgering you late last year.
Did you badger me? I don't remember you badgering me.
I think what happened was, I'm sure we'll get into this, there was a little bit of like, Sam, there's been far too many comments about Sega. It's time to set the record straight.
Yeah, and there's also just, I think the most disappointed contingent of our listeners are British people who like Sega and just hear us either not understand it or not engage with it. The thing is, me and Matthew both have a background with Sega consoles, but we don't have the sort of multi-layered background. I think every kid in the UK kind of had a Mega Drive, but we didn't have Sans or Dreamcast, so we've been letting people down.
How's that been from the outside looking in, Ash, to hear that going down?
It is, I am one of those British Sega fans who's been a little bit frustrated about the commentary. Yeah, it's really weird. Like in the games industry, I'm often labeled as a Nintendo fanboy.
And for understandable reasons, I do love Nintendo, used to review all of the Nintendo games when I was a journalist, worked at Nintendo. And I keep saying to people, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, I'm a Sega fanboy. They just haven't made a console for me in several decades.
So yeah, I've been sitting here going, guys, please play Crazy Taxi again, and you'll realize it probably is the best game ever made, I assure you.
But I like Crazy Taxi. Maybe it's Matthew is a bit more down on it.
No, I think it's fighting in short bursts. It's not a spicy take. There's only such Crazy Taxi a man can have in his life.
I think we'll get into that as well. But I think Sega games, they're from the arcades. Short bursts is what it's all about, right?
But for me, it's been a series of short bursts over about 30 or 35 years, and I've kept coming back, and maybe other people haven't.
You've been micro-dosing all these years.
Yeah.
Well, I sort of have these bursts of going into a bunch of old Sega stuff that I've either not played or not thought about for a while. So I think Ashley might even have been you who pointed me towards the mod. You can get The Crazy Taxi on PC that adds offspring back into it.
So yeah. And yeah, so I try to be engaged, you know, wherever I can. But I do agree that it's something that we do sort of fall down on.
Actually, the most Sega commentary we've done was in one of our Excel episodes we did on 16-bit games, which I think was actually quite a fun one. But it was a little bit like two people who don't really know what they're doing that episode. So yeah, fortunate to have you, Ash.
Ash, I have to ask. When Sega revealed that spread of whatever we're calling them, remakes, reboots, whatever, at the Game Awards, what was the instant Ash take?
Oh man, I mean, obviously delighted, but then with a hint of kind of cautious optimism in there, because it doesn't really matter which video games company it is. When they're marketing a comeback, there's an element of risk there, isn't there? Like, do they understand what made these games great to begin with?
Are they understandably going to try and layer in some modernization elements? That's always a risk, and it'd be a risk not to do it as well. Like, I don't think they can just fully replicate what was there before, and everyone will be truly satisfied.
So I'm just kind of waiting to see what they come up with. But I am really excited, and I think it's nice for me to see Sega acknowledging their roots and acknowledging their fan base.
If you were in charge of that grand reboot project, would you have included Golden Axe amongst them? That's the thing I don't quite, because I was looking at them, and some of these I get, you still hear the chatter now, but is it really such a canonical thing that that would, that gets an instant pass?
I know exactly what you mean, and there is something, in my opinion, a little bit bland about Golden Axe. However, I have a mate who I went to school with, and I play Xbox games with him every Wednesday night. We're playing Baldur's Gate 3 at the moment online.
We have done it for weeks, and every couple of weeks, up until last year, he was like, when do you think they're gonna make a new Golden Axe? And he's been saying that for about six years. So, there are these people out there.
I know them very well. Is that nostalgia? Does Golden Axe still have anything to offer?
I don't know, but also, I kind of believe, you can take any concept and inject life into it. A good co-op scrolling beat them up with some fresh ideas. Streets of Rage 4 wasn't even made by Sega, and they absolutely smashed it, knocked it out of the park, in my opinion.
So, let's see.
Yeah, I don't know. Do people know who's making all those games? That's the, I think there's a bit of ambiguity there.
Yeah, so, yeah, no idea about that, which is interesting. I assume they'll reveal that at some point, but yeah. I have more to ask you about those revivals, Ash, but I'll save that for the wider Sega discussion, because I'd like to put that in a bit of context.
So, how are you doing generally anyway? How's the working game dev treating you these days?
Well, I'm not going to drone on about 2023, but I think it's a pretty dark year for most of the games industry. So, if I'm optimistic about 2024, I just want to say I'm not taking it for granted that I feel like I'm in a pretty good situation right now. If anyone doesn't know, I've been at Team17 for, I don't know, six years, something like that.
A company I loved very much as a kid and a teenager, so I've really enjoyed working there and in a really nice position where I'm helping indie game developers bring their games to life, bring them to market. We've got some cool stuff this year, most of which I can't talk about. And I am, the really frustrating thing is I'm working on a bit of a pet project that I can't talk about yet, it's not announced, but I'd love to be able to talk about it because when I do, and when we reveal this, you guys are gonna be like, oh, that is the most Ash thing ever to be doing that.
So I'll leave it at that, but yeah, suffice to say, exciting stuff.
Are you getting a full torso Worms tattoo? Is that a project?
Oh my God, that's really funny because we, our new group CEO did a presentation to the entire company this week and he showed a Worms tattoo as one of his slides, not on his actual skin, he found it on the internet.
Wow, my only guess is that you've made some kind of like indie chibi-robo alike. That's like the first thing that comes to mind is like, what is the exact Ash Cross session? But if it's not that, I hope it's a Yu Suzuki in 1999 style sort of like project that is like so ambitious.
It basically takes Team 17 out of the games industry. That's what I want it to be, secretly.
We're gonna sponsor Arsenal Football Club.
I'll look forward to that. Oh, that's exciting. So yeah.
Okay, so Ash, I was sort of alerted to how much you love Sega when I went on that trip with you, when we, the famous negotiation.
We've got to talk about that, haven't we?
Yeah, I suppose so. Like it's come up a few times now, but I can't remember if we talked about it on the podcast, but that trip, I was trying to remember all the games that were on that trip. So Sonic Unleash was on that trip, wasn't it?
And that was our first encounter with Valkyria Chronicles as well, which I know you, that was a huge game for you, wasn't it, that game? And then was there a Bleach game on DS and then maybe some kind of dinosaur game involving cards?
And yeah, and then Yakuza 2 infamously.
Yeah, we couldn't play Yakuza 2 even though it released in Japan, but we got to interview Nogoshi and he was reading a magazine upside down as my recollection.
He was reading a Swedish games magazine and I'm pretty sure he doesn't read or speak Swedish. And you were lucky to get a one word answer to your interview questions. So I remember feeling pretty down about that.
Because I was looking forward to meeting Mr. Monkey Ball, one of my favorite games of all time. I was so excited. And then, I don't know what happened.
We can only speculate. I suspect they were working on probably Yakuza 3. They'd done the kind of ancient Japan, like historical Yakuza by that point.
Kenzan, yeah. So I suspect he felt a little bit kind of cajoled into talking about something that for him was years ago and not the most exciting thing. Maybe he just had a bad day.
I don't know what it was. It's worth me telling my side of the story on this one. Do you remember the article I wrote about it when we got back?
I do. Is it like lead news in Games TM?
So yeah, I was feeling really dejected about all of this. And I remember when we were still in Japan, I went down for breakfast in the hotel the next day and I was having breakfast with, I think he was a journalist from The Times. And I was telling him about all of this.
I was like, oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do because basically I can't get any content out of this interview. And this has been a really important trip for us. And you know, he was a smart guy, a more kind of roundly experienced journalist than I was as a specialist and as someone in my 20s.
And he said, look, you have got a story there. You've got a story about meeting your hero and he turns out to be a bit of a disappointment and he behaves like a jerk on the day. Like you've got something really interesting to talk about there.
I was like, oh gosh, I don't know. I don't know if I would be allowed to write something like that in a video games magazine. And he gave me his business card and he went, well, if they don't let you, like come and write it for the Times.
I was like, what? Really? And I don't know how serious that offer was, but I sat and thought about it on the plane journey home.
And I think Imagine Publishing had some rules about you can't write for other publications. So it would have been super risky to do that. But the idea was in my head.
So when I got back, I wrote this like two page news piece for Games TM. I kind of like, don't meet your heroes sort of thing. And it caused quite a stir.
Let me tell you, I don't think Sega were particularly pleased.
Poor Stefan. Yeah, poor Stefan McGarry, who was the PR manager, and who I count as a very, very good friend of mine. I think that probably put him in a pretty sticky situation, having paid to fly a load of journalists out to Japan for a few days, which was an awesome trip.
And I don't know, I saw some commentary online from a few readers, and some readers thought it was really cool for a games magazine to do something that wasn't a promotional piece. Quote unquote, real journalism. And then I think there were some other people who were a bit like, well, how can you have a go at this man?
He's a national treasure, all this kind of stuff. I think in retrospect, I'm glad I did it, because it was a nice opportunity to tell an actual story in a games magazine, rather than a traditional preview of a video game that is useful in the moment, but won't be interesting a decade later. Another life experience.
It's before that sort of stuff was captured on camera as well. Now you might have an awkward interview at like an E3 or something and be filming it, but that just wasn't really the time for that. So yeah, the funny thing is though, I don't know if you had this Ash, but that put me off the Accuser Games for, no kidding, like more than a decade.
I think it was until the pandemic happened. I was like, okay, I'll finally play Accuser Zero. And it was really good, but I just, all he had to do was give us more than nothing and he wouldn't do it.
That was the thing. Like it, that's why I think in retrospect, it was the right thing to do even now, you know?
I would love to know if any of that got back to him. If anybody gave him a bit of a pep talk about how to do interviews in the future. We'll never know.
Cause he's done like a collected works in Edge since then. I think Nathan Brown did the interview and he seemed like he was really up for it and really game. And that's obviously looking back.
So maybe it's just because Nathan just seems cooler than being you Ash, which is a possibility, honestly. But yeah.
I do like the idea of an alternate timeline where there is now a Sunday Times front cover with Negoshi Jerk.
Yeah. Yeah, wow. So yeah, actually I didn't think I knew all that stuff about the Times.
So I suppose that leads us into, what's your history with Sega games, Ash? I was kind of a, I'd also been reading a few issues of Retro Game in the last few years. And they do those, is it like complete guides or whatever they're sort of like, how much you pay per game.
The collector's guide.
And you tend to do a few of those, right? Cause you are a big video game collector. And I think I've read your Saturn one.
And then maybe it was at about two years ago, something like that.
Oh yeah, it would be.
Yeah, so you know so much about the hardware, the software. So what's the foundations of your interest there?
Well, the Mega Drive was my first games console. I'd had a Commodore 64 prior to that. And that had like opened my eyes.
I used to go to the arcades all the time, but the Mega Drive was just this, like blow the doors off moment. You've got these like really for the time, flashy bombastic video games in your home. You know, the culture of Sega at the time.
And I think, you know, quite a lot in the, in the Saturn and Dreamcast era as well, was about bringing the arcade experience into the home and then adding extra value, adding like console games on top of that. The only reason I had a Mega Drive as opposed to a Nintendo was more of an economical thing. You know, it was quite expensive for my parents to buy a games console at the time.
And they asked me, what do all of your friends at school have? They all had Mega Drives. They didn't know anyone who owned a SNES.
And they were like, right, we'll get you a Mega Drive because then you can trade cartridges with people and get a few more games that way. Because, you know, we were going from the C64 where a tape might cost you a couple of quid to cartridges, which could be, you know, 20 to 50 pounds. Like, really expensive for a working class family in those days.
So, you know, there was no more kind of logic to it than that. It was just an economical decision. But I absolutely loved it.
I suspect I would have loved any console I was given at that point in my life, but it just happened to be Sega. I didn't, you know, never really went away. That love of Sega, you know, I didn't get on board with the Saturn straight away.
You know, their marketing for the Saturn, you were lucky if you knew the console existed when it came out, to be honest. Everything was about PlayStation, as we all know. But I did eventually get on board with Saturn.
It's, in terms of traditional games consoles, it remains my favorite games console of all time. Just that mix of pure arcade experiences, just tons and tons of great arcade conversions, particularly if you had a Japanese Saturn, where more releases came out. It lasted longer, well into the late 90s.
And then that rolled into the Dreamcast, where the Dreamcast is, you could write a book on the Dreamcast era, really interesting. It was like Sega, against all odds, just spending so much money on a console that was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Doubling down on, not just arcade conversions, but arcade-like experiences, at a time when Grand Theft Auto 3 and Metal Gear Solid 2 were rewriting the rules on PlayStation.
It was kind of like a console that felt like it was made for me and my mates and people like us, but we were a dying breed by then. So it was really strange to be catered for. Eating so well on this console, Jet Set Radio, Space Channel 5, REZ, all these amazing games coming out, that even then, I couldn't fathom, how could they afford to do this?
How can they afford to make these amazing games that nobody's buying? It turns out they couldn't afford to, of course, and the writing was on the wall for them. But how often in the history of the games industry do you get these, an entire console and library of games that feels like a passion project?
It doesn't feel like it's made for the money, it feels like it's made for the love. Of course, that can't be true, the big global business. But I think that's why, I think the Dreamcast remains one of the most loved consoles of all time, even though it didn't sell lots of copies.
And I think that's why, just because of that really deep bench of special, imaginative games, lots of new IPs, they didn't really lean too much on their classic franchises in the Dreamcast era, which is something a little bit strange about the kind of revival movement that Sega is having today. They're trying to recapture that Dreamcast feeling. But what made the Dreamcast feeling so great to begin with was it was new idea after new idea all the time.
Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shenmue, they were pushing the boundaries, and now it's kind of a nostalgia piece. That's an interesting thing, but that's probably a commentary about the games industry as a whole, to be honest, right now.
Well, it's interesting, though, because I think, like you say, there's not really the sense of them chasing trends, like whatever's happening on PlayStation. It doesn't feel like they're living in the same reality as such. You say there are all these kind of like arcade-adjacent experiences, and that even counts for Shenmue, right?
Like it's, you know, the combat is very arcade-y, obviously.
Well, Shenmue started out life as Virtua Fighter RPG. So I think it was like, how do we take this arcade game and flesh it out and make it a longer single-player experience that people want to play? So yeah, you're right, it still had that kind of fighting game system at the heart of it.
Okay, interesting. So I suppose that's like the Sega experience in real time. So what happens to Sega after the Dreamcast then?
Because it seems like a lot of their DNA is spread out across the different console manufacturers. So GameCube becomes a de facto Sonic home. Some Dreamcast ports end up on PS2.
The Xbox seems to get a load of original Sega games. What sort of do you think the strategy was after that?
It was an interesting time. I remember there was an Edge cover, really bold. The cover line said, Dreamcast is dead, long live Sega'. One of the best cover lines of all time, in my opinion.
I can only speculate to a certain extent, but I suspect moving from a hardware manufacturer to a third party would have been a huge calculated risk for Sega. And I suspect part of the strategy was just spreading their bets. All of their software had been on one platform, the Dreamcast, that hadn't worked out well for them.
It wouldn't equally make sense to then go and say, right, we're just gonna be a Nintendo developer. You're swapping one silo for another there. So I think it made sense to do that, explore those opportunities.
I think partnering up with Nintendo on things like F-Zero, GX, putting Super Monkey Ball on the platform really early made perfect sense. I think Sega were a very different company to Nintendo. They were more kind of rock and roll compared to Nintendo's pop, but they're adjacent.
They had the color and the fun to appeal to Nintendo gamers, particularly with Sonic. And then they always had this interesting relationship with Microsoft. Microsoft had collaborated with them on the Dreamcast.
It had supposedly powered by Windows CE. It had a little badge on the front of the console that said that. The Xbox controller, it just is a Dreamcast controller.
So you could see that synergy there. I think the fact that Xbox was online, out of the box, made it a natural successor to the Dreamcast, even if most of Sega's Xbox games weren't online. You can see that lineage.
I think you could see that a lot of Xbox personnel either came from that Sega world or were big Sega fans. That was a fantastic time, to be honest. I was really sad that the Dreamcast had ended, but that creative energy that Sega had, it still continued and they were still making awesome creative games spread across all of this different hardware, which of course I owned anyway because that's the sort of person I was.
Yeah, Monkey Ball was amazing. The PS2 version of Res, arguably even better than the Dreamcast version. You get that trans vibrator adapter on the PS2.
Panzer Dragoon Autor on Xbox took that Sega Saturn series and just took advantage of the Xbox power to look even more gorgeous and create these fantasy environments. They took Shenmue 2 to Xbox. The list goes on and on.
That idea of eating well if you're a Sega fan, it still happened. I think where things started to change was a generation or two after that, where their focus was less about which console should we be on and more about which global market are we aiming at. Sega seemed to become more interested in the European market.
They started to invest in European developers, Total War, Football Manager. Games that, I'll be honest, don't really appeal to me very much and didn't feel very Sega. To me, they don't have the arcade quality, but clearly that worked out really well for them from a business perspective.
I think it's one of the more successful examples of a Japanese publisher reaching its arms out across the world. I tip my hat to them. I think it did really well and continues to pay off for them in a few ways, but also really pleased at the same time that their Japanese division really never lost what made them Sega, particularly with the Yakuza series.
Everyone knows Yakuza feels a little bit like Shenmue. It's also got roots in the Spikeout arcade series that Nagoshi did, and then they would fill their games with really good versions of classic Sega arcade games. The fact that the latest Like A Dragon game has the only ever home version of Daytona 2 on there, in my opinion, makes it worth buying the game alone, just to play the arcade game.
So they've still kept to their roots all the way through it.
Yeah, that's really interesting. So what you're saying is Football Manager 2016 won't be in your top 10?
Until you can unlock Virtua Striker.
I'm waiting for a future Yakuza where enough time has passed that you can play Total War or Football Manager on a PC in that world.
Just have a quick cheeky 200 hours of medieval Total War inside Ichiban's apartment or wherever. I look forward to that too. Okay, cool.
That's great deep knowledge, Ash. I suppose the other angle I wanted to ask was, how did you go about excavating Sega history after that? Because you are a big-time video game collector.
I get the sense you've got quite a vast Saturn library. Yes. What's your continued relationship to that stuff up to the present day?
I still own my Japanese Sega Saturn that I bought in 1998. I'm still collecting games for it. It's got a really deep and wide catalog of games as a Japanese Saturn.
That makes it perfect for collectors because there's always something new to try and get. There's all these hidden gems that even as a really big fan, you might not know every great game on the system. So you can go to a retro game store or browse eBay and take a chance on something.
You might discover something really interesting. It's got a lot of rarities as well. I think a big part of being a collector is as you get older, a lot of it is about buying the cool stuff that perhaps you missed out on the first time around or couldn't afford decades earlier.
Saturn is perfect for that. Radiant Silvergun is probably a prime example of a game that is enormously high quality, but also has this kind of like collector's allure to it. It keeps going up in value.
There aren't that many copies. I know not everyone is into that element of collecting, but for people who are, those consoles that have the kind of crown jewels in them just makes them more interesting to collect for. I've also got a nice Mega CD collection.
We haven't talked about the Mega CD, but that's another great collector's system because it's a piece of hardware that was ignored, but actually once you get into it, it has some really nice titles on there. For example, it is the only console that has an English language version of Snatcher. Not a Sega game, but a Sega platform that has all these cool things on there.
If we're talking about third-party support, I consider the Sega Saturn a Capcom console as much as I do a Sega console, to be honest. The Saturn is a really interesting machine because it was designed to be an arcade at home experience and competing with PlayStation was more of an afterthought. It was designed as a 2D powerhouse first and foremost, and then they threw these 3D chips in, which made it really complicated to program for.
It did mean you got some really great 3D games like Panzer Dragoon, but you got the best quality versions of the hottest 2D arcade games at the time, various Street Fighter, Street Fighter Alpha, Street Fighter Alpha 3, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, these fantastic high-quality 2D games that Capcom were making. They brought some of them to PlayStation, but PlayStation didn't have the raw power, didn't have the RAM to run these games properly, so they would drop frames on PlayStation or the tag team games wouldn't allow you to tag on some of the versions.
You're like, well, that kind of defeats the purpose. But the Saturn could do these, especially because the Saturn was expandable. So the Saturn has this large cartridge slot at the back, and you could, a little bit like the N64, you could put a 4 megabyte RAM cartridge in there and make the machine even more powerful.
And that was great for all the Capcom and SNK fighting games. It just meant you had as close to arcade perfect versions at home. So yeah, love my Saturn, it's a little arcade machine.
A question on the kind of like, you know, arcade being so intertwined with the Sega experience and your love of it, where does your, where does the JRPG side of things come into it and fit into it?
Oh, yeah. Oh, it absolutely does. And I think, you know, that's, you know, Sega have made a few RPGs over the years, and that's probably an understatement that goes all the way back to the Master System and the original Phantasy Star, which, you know, was made by Sonic Team, I think before they were called Sonic Team, and was a real smash for Master System fans.
I've owned a Master System, it's probably my least favorite Sega console, but you can't underestimate how important Phantasy Star was for Sega fans and particularly American gamers as well, you know, led to a long history of really high quality JRPGs that kind of carved out their own space as well, you know, while Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy were doing the fantasy thing. Sega were providing a space RPG, which was, you know, felt a lot more unique at the time and obviously paved the way for Phantasy Star Online, which kind of introduced a little bit of MMOs to console gamers, paved the way for Monster Hunter as well. So they've always innovated in that space.
Sega brought tactical RPGs to Europe with the Shining Force series many, many years before we even knew what Fire Emblem was in the West. We had the two Shining Force games on Mega Drive. And that lineage keeps going, like Yakuza is really an action RPG and has all the depth and breadth that you would expect from an RPG.
So it's always been there, and I think they were very conscious of that in the Saturn era. I think they were very careful to ensure that as well as bringing these arcade experiences home, they were also trying to compete with PlayStation by giving you these single player games that had lots of depth and lots of longevity. Shining Force 3 is on the Saturn.
It's my favorite game of all time. It might be in the list. Panzer Dragoon, Sega, this kind of infamous game now, I think that there's probably more people who would love to play it than have played it because it's kind of landlocked on Saturn and there weren't many English language copies made of it.
It's not easy to emulate, but it was this amazingly innovative game that took a Star Fox-like 3D shooter and made it into an RPG. No one's ever really done that before or since.
Star Fox Adventures.
How silly of me. For me, we're talking about the Nintendo difference. There's also the Sega difference of a real difference.
Going in their own direction, not following trends, and combining their influences as well. Like Panjabi Kun Saga, I think, is a really good example of it has that Sega arcade quality to it, but it also has that depth of single player experience that you would see in Shenmue a couple of years later, and you see in Yakuza today. I think they're a very inventive company, and I think they don't get enough credit, actually, for how much they balanced the arcade at home and the way console games were going at the time.
They were just so overshadowed by PlayStation that they were pushed out of the conversation, really.
Interesting. What a comprehensive overview there, Ash.
Now I understand why people were so cross with our previous Sega coverage.
So I suppose out of that, it sounds like the Saturn is probably your favorite piece of hardware by Sega. Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay.
So that's pretty much dead set, then. So I suppose then, why do you think there is such a strong connection to Sega in the UK? Do you think it is because it was cheaper and therefore more affordable if you were a working class in the 90s?
Do you think that is genuinely a factor to why people got into Sega consoles?
I think anything I have to say on this topic is more anecdotal. I haven't done lots of research into it, but I think about the dominance of the NES and the Famicom in America and Japan, that it just didn't have the same foothold here.
I think the lack of a presence for the NES kind of left the door open for Sega to come in and give people a cool console experience. We did have the NES, but it launched later, initially it wasn't distributed by Nintendo, it was distributed by Mattel, who simply would not have been invested in it in the way Nintendo would have been. It was very, very expensive for an 8-bit system when at the time it would have been much more economical for people to get a Commodore 64 or an Amiga.
I think that left the door open for Sega, who also had, let's not forget, Sega had the sports games, so they had EA on their side, where for a while Nintendo really didn't, and so, you know, FIFA was a big part of why, you know, let's call them normal people, would buy a Mega Drive. I knew a lot of people who had John Madden, even though that's more of an American thing.
Yeah, I read that.
I thought John Madden was a video game character for the longest time, because he only existed in my world as a video game thing and as adverts in games magazines.
I think it's outlived him in a way, like it is, yeah, that's his legacy.
And he seemed like, not to like ding him or anything, but like, he's quite an unusual looking guy. It was like, oh, is this like a mascot they've made?
Is he the boss?
Yeah.
Yeah, he does look like he was sort of created by a marketing artist in 1985 or something. You know what I mean? Like, mascot does kind of make sense, I think.
So when he popped up in the Simpsons, I was like, oh, he's a real guy. How strange.
I often feel that way about the Colonel from KFC. Every time I remember that he was a real person, I think, surely not. That can't be true.
He's a cartoon.
The other thing is that Sega culture was just so embedded in the 90s, like, you know, obviously Sega World, but also just the fact that, you know, I had the Sonic, one of the Sonic animated shows on VHS. Like, they were just all over Wolbers. It was just, it was just, there was just a hot minute there where Sega was everywhere in the mid-90s and then it was just sort of over very quickly.
Yeah, you can't underestimate the power of Sonic, everybody talks about Sonic very much. We should do, it's important. You know, PlayStation and Wipeout, they get all this credit for making video games cool, which they did, but you go back a few years and, like, Sonic was this, like, aspirational hero for kids, they called him the Hedgehog with Attitude, which I find hilarious.
What does that mean, Hedgehog with Attitude? But yeah, they capitalized on cool in a way Nintendo didn't really feel able to with their kind of, you know, chubby plumber and his dungarees, and certainly, like, the home computers, everyone had them, but they weren't cool. Like, you can't be cool if you got a keyboard built in, it's impossible.
So yeah, I was in the right place at the right time when Sonic came out, I think, you know, 1991, I was nine years old, I was in the playground, people were talking about Sonic the Hedgehog, they were like role playing as him running around in the playground. It was a phenomenon, so yeah, of course, that like pushed Mega Drive into the forefront. And it's just a very Sega thing that they had that head start in the West.
The Genesis did really well initially in the States as well, mostly because of the sports games and just brilliant in a way that Sega could have that dominance and then just lose it so completely. That's a topic for another podcast really, but the way they confused consumers with the Mega CD and the 32X, they had the Western arm of Sega telling people they should buy a 32X instead of a Saturn, which is mind-bogglingly stupid. I think they just never recovered from that confusing period really, despite the quality that was there.
Yeah. No SEO list on the internet is working harder than best 32X games, because I've played a bunch of them, because obviously you can emulate them quite easily, and you always see Knuckles and Chaotix on there. That is the worst possible version of a 2D Sonic game, and that's always one of the top three hits on there.
Your big 32X, Gaiash?
No, I bought one once and I sold it. Even years after the fact as a collectible piece, it felt a little bit like, what is the point? Okay, it's got Virtual Fighter on there, but I've got Virtual Fighter on the Saturn.
It's got Virtua Racing, fine. I've had Virtua Racing on other systems. It had a lot of games that ran really well, but nothing...
It didn't have that must-have title, exclusive title that you would find. Even the Mega CD, the Mega CD has Sonic CD, a really viable and fun Sonic the Hedgehog game. 32X didn't have that.
Ashley, there's one other thing I wanted to ask before we get to your top ten. Is there any Sega series that you just do not get along with? Something where you're like, I don't see the appeal or you've never really engaged with it.
I always wondered if Sonic was a bit like that for you, actually, Ash.
Oh no, I love Sonic.
Actually, I'm just misremembering now how much you like Sonic remembering. Yeah. So is there anything where you don't quite click with a series?
It probably is Yakuza, to be honest, and not just because of our encounter with Nogoshi. I've tried so hard to get into the Yakuza games and, like I say, they do appeal to me because of the retro connections they have, but I find them so front-loaded with story and tutorial and a slow pace that takes a while to open up that I just... I don't have time in my life for that kind of game right now, and maybe if those games had come out when I was a teenager, I would be absolutely obsessed with them.
I really love the Shenmue games and they're not that different, but yeah, I just haven't been able to penetrate that Yakuza bubble, and I feel like I don't have time as well. It feels like they release a new game in the Yakuza, like the Dragon series, even more frequently than one a year, and they're such long, deep games, I'm like, how could I possibly catch up now? But yeah, they look great.
Interesting. Matthew, is it too early?
No, because the game comes out today, right?
Yeah, right. So that's what I thought the embargo would have lifted. So you've been playing the latest, that was actually why I put this podcast in the schedule, because I thought this is the biggest Sega release of the year, right?
It's, you know, the sequel to Yakuza Like a Dragon, so infinite wealth, Matthew. How's it been treating you?
At the time of recording, like I'm still early on in it. It's a massive game. I think I've played it for about 20 hours and only just unlocked the Animal Crossing style mini game within it.
Right.
It's really taking its time to kind of drip feed that stuff in. It's very like Yakuza Like a Dragon, you know, if you played that. It's an ultra-trad sort of JRPG under all the all the kind of modern day kind of contemporary trappings.
There's a very, very big focus on equipment. Crafting better equipment is how you get the big power jumps in the game. So I don't know if it's particularly electric on a mechanics level, but as a story and a collection of characters, I think it's where it really shines.
You know, as much as I love Kiryu, I think they've used the JRPG and the concept of the JRPG party to really craft a story about close relationships and friendships, which was true of the first one. It just feels like much more of an ensemble piece than the other games, and it's so affectionately drawn. Like I love the relationships, you know, you really, really buy into that group of people and you know, maybe like more so than in most JRPGs because they are recognisable everyday people and not like, you know, fantasy tropes.
There's something very, very relatable. So just as this big kind of friendship game, I'm really, really digging it. And one of the really fun things is that Kiryu is in your party as a party member and they've kind of made a turn based version of him.
So he still has all his different fighting styles, which you can switch between on his turns and it kind of changes how he performs in battle. So it's this sort of a much better kind of meeting of old Yakuza and new Yakuza. Yeah, it's really strong, but it just feels like it's going to be like 150 hours long.
Like it's an absolute monster. But yeah, it is good.
Interesting. Yeah, I suppose like, have you fought the big shark yet? Have you done that, Matthew?
I haven't fought the... I think that might be quite late game content.
Great screenshot though.
Oh yeah, it makes you want to play. I fought lots of dark things. I think the fight choreography is absolutely amazing.
I think the way they make these games so fast is there's obviously a huge amount of like asset recycling and they also have this tiered approach to sort of fidelity. Your average encounter with something is just two static character models unvoiced. And then if something's a bit more important, there'll be a little bit more animation and it will be partially voiced.
And then very occasionally you get like the proper cut scenes, which are all like motion captured, have the amazing fight choreography, have all these really big sort of shouty performances. And those scenes are so glossy and well produced that you come away thinking, how the hell have they made like a hundred and fifty triple A game where actually they haven't? They've just…
they really know when to deploy their efforts to make you feel like you're playing something bigger?
Yeah.
Which is the way they make three of these things a year. 80% of it is actually incredibly basic, right, but it impresses enough that the overall feeling is much bigger. They're doing more interviews now about that process, I feel like they've been a bit more open this last year about…
They say, well, if a guy working on The Man Who Erased His Name is working on a minigame which is also going to be in Infinite Wealth, we basically tick it off in both games at once and that's the way they kind of make these things in tandem. A triumph of project management?
Producers are working overtime, for sure. So Ash, I was curious if that strand of Like A Dragon, as it's now called, was not more your sort of thing, because turn-based JRPG combat, there's only two of them, the second one's yet to come out. Were you tempted to start again with that part of the series, because that's kind of what I've done, because there's just too many of the old games to play.
I was, and I did give Yakuza Like A Dragon a go when it came to Game Pass. Yeah, the fact that it leans even further into the RPG stuff, and even, is that, that's the one that has a character who's like obsessed with Dragon Quest?
Well, that's Ichiban, like, the whole thing is it's set in, you know, regular Yakuza world, but in his head he thinks he's in a Dragon Quest game, so all the fights, everyone turns into like crazy monsters, because it's from his perspective.
There's even a bit where, like, he, another character asks him, why do you just stand there and take hits, and it's like, well, I play Dragon Quest, and in Dragon Quest you get hit, and then it's your turn again, basically. He's kind of explaining the concept of a turn-based Japanese RPG to someone, and then that's basically how it plays out.
So yeah, I did go, I started that one up on Game Pass, and I was so excited about it, and then I just, you know, what I was describing earlier of, like, trying to get through those first initial hours, waiting for it to open up, is, I don't think it's a fair criticism of the game, because that's what it takes to get into this kind of game. It's more just an acknowledgement of, I'm just incredibly busy, right, a full-time job, dog, baby, driving myself crazy, trying to review retro games on a blog as often as possible. These kind of big experiences fall by the wayside.
I've only played the first hour of Spider-Man 2, and it seems really cool.
I keep looking at the Yakuza series, and I keep asking myself, where is the right jumping-on point? It doesn't sound like it's the most recent two games. It still feels to me like Yakuza 0 or the remake of 1 would still be the right choice.
Yeah, I think people are generally in agreement on 0. If you want to do the whole thing, 0. But I do think you can get in on Ichiban, like a load of characters turn up.
And then, you know, sort of Marvel kind of, you know, Cinematic Universe style come in and there's like, who the fuck is this guy? But I think they explain themselves, like enough that you can get through it without being too confused. And, you know, the focus is a new bunch of characters, and it kind of presses reset on the kind of history of that world in a sort of clever way, which I won't spoil for people who haven't played it.
So I do.
I guarantee I will load up and play the man who erased his name, but it's a little bit disingenuous. I will skip as many dialogues and cutscenes as I can, make a beeline to the arcade, play Daytona 2.
The thing is, I love the story. If anything, I'm like with these games, I wish there was less fighting in them. I wish I could skip that somehow.
One of the good things actually in Infinite Wealth, they've added is that if you are sufficiently over-leveled for a particular encounter, you can just insta-kill those enemies and you just press a button and your team just kick the shit out of them in two seconds. You don't actually have to go through the fight, which I'm quite into as an idea.
Even despite that, it's still fucking monstrously long.
Yeah, but I don't know, just good vibes. It's really funny, properly funny. There's loads of dodgy stuff in it.
This has got a whole Pokemon clone in it called Tsujimon, which is what they call the fantasy versions of people that Ichiban sees. But it's basically Pokemon, except you're collecting deranged perverts instead of monsters. So you build a party of these pervy characters, and then you go and fight them in these underground clubs.
But it parodies the whole thing with all the gym leaders and the leagues. They're not called the Elite Four, they're called the Dangerous Four or something. But just as a side game, it has what feels like is going to be a 30-hour Pokemon game.
And you can just shoot once it's introduced it as part of the story, you can just ignore it. It has nothing to do with anything else. It has no bearing on how you level up or how your characters behave.
It's just a, well, we had all these assets. This is a way of reframing this again as this mad mini game. Same for the Animal Crossing.
It's just there if you want to do it. There's a whole island to manage, a whole holiday island.
There must be people out there who, they get a new game in the series, play it all year long, and then just play the next game and go straight into it.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I work quite closely with some of my teams, like a huge years ahead and is like, yeah, this will just be my thing for like 200 hours, even more. I mean, that's just, there's completing these games and then there's, you know, if you want to get like trophies and all this kind of stuff, you have to max out like all the side distractions, which considering you're talking about entire arcade games, you know, learning how to play fucking Shogi, which like no one, I am, I'm just, I think Phil when he was on was talking about having to play, you know, the nightmare of like, if there is a Shogi related objective in the achievement list, you're like, fuck me, I've got to learn Japanese chess.
Just tick this off. It's just, it's wildly overblown, but yeah, people are just, I think people are just Yakuza fans rather than necessarily like, I'm a gaming fan. I just, this is the thing I do.
Oh, so interesting. It really is, of all the series, the one I wish I could make more time for, you know, in a parallel universe where I wasn't making this podcast, maybe I would play them all, but yeah. I think Yakuza Zero is still the one, Ash, if you do fancy it.
Like, Yakuza Kiwami is actually really disappointing. You realize that maybe the first Yakuza game on PS2 wasn't really all that. Yeah, Zero is just so much, so much better.
What, I mean, how old is Yakuza Zero now? It must be getting on a bit.
2017, I think, over here. 16, maybe, in traffic.
So, 2027, I can think of it as retro and I can cover it for the blog.
Perfect, okay, good. Well, that sounds like a good compromise. Okay, let's take a quick break, then, Ash.
Bye Welcome back to the podcast. So in this half, we're going to talk about Ash's top 10 Sega games. We're going to correct years of sort of like misinformation on this podcast about Sega with a well-balanced sort of take on their immense back catalog of games.
Ash, do you want to talk a bit about your selection criteria for this top 10?
Yeah, if the exercise of this podcast is to make all of the UK Sega fans happy and stop complaining, I'm not confident we're going to do it with this top 10. I really wanted to concentrate on the games I personally love as a Sega fan. The games that I keep coming back and playing decades later, the ones that make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside when I think about Sega, and they're not necessarily the ones that, if you were writing a more objective list for a games magazine or an SEO list, they're not the same games.
Spoilers, there's no Sonic the Hedgehog game on this list. There was at one point, I had Sonic CD on there. It had to go.
There's no Yakuza game on there, but as we've established, I'm not particularly qualified to talk about that anyway. And I want this list to reflect the passion that I have for Sega games. So purely and simply, they are pretty much my favorite Sega games, but I have reframed from putting my favorite Sega game at number one.
That's where I've jiggled things around again. And the number one is a game I absolutely adore that I think is a real universal crowd pleaser. So yeah, that's what I've done.
Hmm, interesting.
Well, what I will say before we get into it, I have got a list of honorable mentions that I wanted to rattle through. No commentary whatsoever. And I raised this just to illustrate the point of how many awesome Sega games there are.
What are the companies with just the deepest catalog of really cool stuff? So if you'd indulge me, I'm just gonna run through this list real quick. I'm just gonna name some games and then people can go, people can't accuse me of saying, oh, why didn't you mention Choo Choo Rocket?
Well, I did.
It's funny to say that actually, because we're doing best games of 2002 in a week and I made a list of like 50 games that would be eligible and worth talking about for a top 10. And the first thing someone on Discord said was, where's Gothic 2? And I was like...
Where is Gothic 2?
Which made me laugh. But yeah, fair enough, Ash. So yeah, kick off by all means.
The honor of emotions.
This is a list of games everyone should play in their life. F-Zero GX, Daytona USA, Sega Rally, all amazing racing games. Panzer Dragoon, Rez, Space Channel 5, Skies of Arcadia, House of the Dead 2, Billy Hatcher and his giant egg.
Yes, even that one. Choo Choo Rocket, Phantasy Star Online, Jet Set Radio, Virtua Tennis, Sonic the Hedgehog, Alex Kidd, Samba the Amigo, Virtua Fighter, Fighting Vipers and Fighters Megamix. You'll have a good time with all of those, including Billy Hatcher, I promise you.
Not even Sonic CD on there, Ash. That seems like the most Ashley Day of all the different Sonic games.
Sonic CD was in my top 10. It's bloody brilliant. You can read about it on my blog.
There's a plug. It's all on there. Go read about it on there.
Where is your blog, just to remind people to go check it out?
gamesfromtheblackhole.wordpress.com.
Nice.
I played Fighting Vipers in Judgment, the Houser spin-off.
Oh, of course.
Were you not sort of like... Skies of Arcadia is an interesting one because it's the game that's most brought up as, probably, you know, of everything, of the different Sega games that hasn't been posted.
Needs a remake.
Yeah, so that not being chosen is interesting. And also I was gonna ask, does Panzer Dragoon being here mean that that rules out the whole series for your top 10 or is that just-
There are, I absolutely adore the Panzer Dragoon series, but none of them are in my top 10.
Oh, interesting. So you big saga guy, that's like, I bet you've got that on Saturn, right?
I do own a PAL copy of that. I've played it all the way through to the end. One of the cool things about Panzer Dragoon Saga, by the way, in their dying days, future publishing Sega Saturn Magazine gave away the entire disc one of Panzer Dragoon Saga on the magazine, which that's how I got into the game, played that free disc.
You get about 20 hours of content. It's amazing. And then I was ready to jump in to the full game and it was nowhere to be found.
It had already sold out everywhere. But yeah, absolutely amazing series. But really, if I was talking about all of my favorite Sega games, you could do a top 100.
I'm not exaggerating. So I've had to be very selective.
Okay, so last question I'll ask about this then is which of the Panzer Dragoon games would you pick? The original on Saturn or would you pick Orta? I love Orta.
I would say the Panzer Dragoon Zwei on Saturn. That's the second one. The original Panzer Dragoon is really good, but it feels quite limited now.
There's not much replayability to it, whereas the sequel is more packed with secrets, alternative paths, or all that kind of thing. The stuff that made Star Fox 64 really replayable is why I did the same.
Quite a list of overall mentions. With all that in mind, Ash, do you want to get to your number 10?
Number 10 is Streets of Rage 2. We talked about Sega's arcade heritage. This was a really great example of taking the arcade feeling, but making a console exclusive game.
Streets of Rage series obviously owes a lot to the likes of Final Fight by Capcom. Scrolling beat them up. Massive in the 90s, this genre.
I think Streets of Rage 2 is by far the finest example of this kind of game, the kind of belt scroller game. As is often the case with Sega games, the appeal is like 50 percent style and attitude. I think, I might be wrong, I think almost all of Streets of Rage 2 takes place at night.
So you get these incredible backgrounds where lighting plays a really important part. The city skylines, the little dots of the windows in the high-rise towers, and then in the foreground, the lighting of the shop windows and bars, colored street lamps, decorative almost like Christmas lighting as you go through the park, really made it quite an atmospheric game to look at. I think looking at a game when it's a scrolling beat-em-up is really an important part of the genre, because you're literally moving through these dioramas.
Part of the appeal is what am I going to see next as the game scrolls? Of course, the music, Yuzo Kishiro, one of the greatest Japanese game composers of all time, a master of the FM sound chip. He famously composed his music for Streets of Rage using Mega Drive hardware to do so.
They're like these almost like dance club anthems, and I'm not into dance music at all. But in a video game context, I really love this kind of music, that synthy feel. I think it's right for this genre, where you're constantly moving forward.
There's a rhythm to the punching and the kicking and the throwing. That music keeps you pumped, keeps you going forward. Some of the track names for the music in Streets of Rage 2, you wouldn't know them from playing the game, but the soundtracks out there on Spotify and iTunes.
I think the first track is called Go Straight, which is a command you're given at the beginning of the game. In case you've never played or beat them up before, you need to walk forwards. The second name track, if I've got my numbers correct, is called Never Return Alive.
I just think that that's the coolest name for any track ever. I don't think there's much need to talk about the gameplay too much for Streets of Rage. Everyone knows what it is.
I think, suffice to say, it's a really well-honed, finely-tuned set of fighting game mechanics. The amount of flexibility and player expression that they squeeze out of a D-pad and a couple of buttons is brilliant. I think it's a game you can keep returning to over and over again and have a great time.
It's got that Sega quality of you can pick it up for five minutes and you're going to instantly have a blast. It gets to the fun as quickly as possible.
Yeah, I definitely have played this at some point because it was on the 360 Sega Mega Drive Collection which I was pretty experienced with. I guess I was going to ask Ash if what's the best way to play this, but Sega games are so widely available. You could just play on PC, you could play it on Switch.
It doesn't really matter massively where you find it, I suppose.
If it's a Mega Drive game and it was published by Sega, chances are you already own 10 copies of it.
Exactly. Okay, cool. What's your number nine?
Number nine is, you could argue this is another Scrolling Fighter, so maybe I've contradicted myself again, but it's also a platform game. Another Mega Drive hit is Comics Zone. Now, this is a bit divisive.
I know there's some people who really do not like this game, but it's one of my all-time favorites, hence it's on this list. Comics Zone, made by the Sega Technical Institute, which was an American studio made mostly of kind of ex-Atari people. This one was made by, I think it's the team who later went on to make Vigilante 8, of all things.
The conceit of this game is you're playing as a guy called Sketch Turner, who is a comic book artist who gets zapped into his own comic, a bit like Tron, you know Tron, he gets zapped into the video game. In this, you get zapped into a comic, and you have to fight your way through all of the baddies he's designed, and the big villain is the boss. The central gimmick of this game is that the stage layouts look like comic book pages, complete with the panels.
So the very first screen is the first top left panel of page one, and you can just see the borders of the panel. You can see what is beyond to the right. You get a little bit of a glimpse of what's beyond there, and as you move to the right, Sketch will grab the page and vault over the border of the panel.
So it really buys in to that illusion of you exploring a comic book. But you can also see what's below, a little hint of what is in the panels beneath you, and it makes for this, in some places, quite non-linear game where you can explore the page in different sequences. There are puzzle elements, so if you interact with the environment in certain ways, you will discover a different way to move through the page, get into panels that felt locked off before and have a unique kind of set piece moment in them.
Other ways they commit to the conceit, you can rip a piece of the background off, turn it into a paper plane and then throw it at people. You have a pet rat in your inventory, you can get your pet rat out, he's called Roadkill, and he will sniff around the page, and if he sniffs a secret, he will rip the page and get you the power up out of the back of it. As enemies enter the screen, instead of just walking on from the right, they are drawn onto the screen in real time in front of you by the hand of the villain, who as a sketch has gone into the comic, the villain has left the comic, so he's in the real world drawing enemies for you to fight.
So...
It's got quite Monty Python energy, that big hand.
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Or, you know, Duckamuck, if anyone knows that cartoon. So yeah, a really innovative presentation at a time when video games weren't really doing this sort of thing, like this sort of thing was more common in the PlayStation era, I think, that kind of like self-reflexive feel and exploring the form as much as the content.
So, you know, a really clever game and that cleverness also translates into fun. I think the reason a lot of people don't like this game is it is incredibly difficult. I don't think I've, I've never finished it.
I don't think I've ever got off like the third or fourth stage. It has a strange kind of lives or continue system. So I think you get a couple of lives.
It's quite stingy with them. And then when you, you know, die for good, you can get a continue. How it decides whether to give you a continue or not seems really vague.
Basically the villain who's out in the real world and drawing enemies, sometimes he will take pity on you and give you a continue. And sometimes he won't. And there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why that is.
So sometimes you'll get pretty far and you're like, oh, well, I have to start all over again and I don't really understand why.
Interesting. So I have played this and I will say that I think the presentation is fantastic and I can see why it appealed to you as you're like a big 90s comic guy, right Ash? Like, you know, Spider-Man.
Oh, absolutely.
I know Spider-Man is like a, you know, you're a big Spider-Man guy.
I was there for the image comics, boom and all of the attitude that went along with that.
Yeah, how many variant covers did you have of, you know, the sort of like X-Force one or whatever, I have no idea. But yeah, so I can see why this appeals to you. I found the gameplay a little bit, I found it quite tricky to, I think I picked it up in the early noughties.
I might have had this on one of the, I had a PS2 Mega Drive collection as well. I think I might have had it on there maybe, but in any case, I found it like quite challenging gameplay wise, but really liked the presentation. Matthew, did you play this one?
Yeah, I think I played this on Virtual Console. Yeah, and I basically agree with everything Ash says. It's conceptually amazing, very, very difficult, but it does seem quite ahead of its time.
It's funny you still say, oh, people got more used to playing with the form later in PlayStation games or whatever, but I think even now, if you put something out like this, people would go quite nuts for it. It reminds me a little bit of this year, you've got The Plucky Squire coming out, which is that big storybook and the metamess of it and the idea of going in and out of the page. I genuinely think that would have a bit of a wow factor today.
At the time, crazy. There were a few things like this on Mega Drive, which just seemed so ahead of the game. Another World is another one of them, actually.
I was just like, what the fuck? This is cool now. Yeah.
I will say on the difficulty piece, if anyone is listening to this podcast and they're going to play this game for the first time, I'll give my top games master tip for this. You really have to vary up your attacks. There's a little bit of artificial intelligence to the enemies.
If you keep spamming the same basic punch or kick or whatever, the enemies learn that and they will just block them continuously. So you have to vary it up. You have to switch between punches and kicks really quickly.
Switch between crouching, standing and jumping attacks. That can make it a little bit of an exhausting game to play because you're very quickly and repeatedly cycling between different attacks, but that's the only way to really move forward and stand a chance in this game. I think the people who get frustrated are the ones who they're finding they're just punching, punching, punching and not doing any damage.
It's one of those old games where there's nothing in the instruction book that tells you you need to play in that way. It loses people. It's not a perfect game by any stretch.
Actually, most of this list is made up of imperfect games, which is interesting. I think that's again part of that Sega appeal of they try new things, they don't get it completely right, but in doing so, they are trying things no one else has ever tried.
Yeah, I think I said that makes it a good pick. Yeah, okay, interesting. Maybe we'll go back and give this another go.
Again, I'm sure I own this ten times on various different things.
Sam, just a quick question on Comic Zone. So the concept of a man getting pulled into his own comic book work, which real life comic book artist would have the worst time if they were pulled into their comic book?
Oh, it would probably be Dave McKeon, like being trapped in Arkham Asylum. That's like the Grant Morrison book. Just the drawings of the Joker and that are just really so, so horrible.
But I guess actually on the X-Force note, Rob Liefeld having...
I was going to say Rob Liefeld...
.being confronted with his own out of proportion creations. A side booby Captain America, that would be tough.
Rob Liefeld would get into the game, his oversized chest would be so much weight for him to bear, and the fact that he can't draw feet would mean he would just topple over.
I do think the real Rob Liefeld, though, could kick the shit out of all of his characters. He seems like quite a feisty dude.
Well, I'm glad we went down this avenue.
I did have an answer ready to go, fortunately. The reason I paused slightly was to check. I always get Michael McKeon and Dave McKeon mixed up, so it's good to just get these things right and not confuse it with a Berkel Saul actor.
What's in number eight, Ash?
Number eight, we mentioned it earlier, Valkyria Chronicles.
Oh, of course.
Now, is this a game you've both played?
Not the last amounts of, but...
I'm a massive, massive fan of tactical games, tactical RPGs. It's my favourite genre. For years and years, there wasn't that much innovation in this genre, particularly in the tactics RPG space.
You'd have a load of units on a grid. That grid might be completely flat. It might be isometric 3D, but it would be a grid.
I'd have a great time because I love the genre, but it was never really moving forward that much. Valkyria Chronicles came out, and it was a complete breath of fresh air for this genre. I think there's a couple of reasons for that.
It's the two engines that they were promoting, their fancy names for these engines, the Blitz engine and the Canvas engine. The Canvas engine was the graphical engine they had, which set the scene. It's an alternative World War II game.
If you imagine World War II, but it looks nice and some people are happy, that's basically the world of Valkyria Chronicles. They used the Canvas engine to give this 3D game a hand-drawn watercolor world look to it. Really striking at the time, and I think still quite unique today.
You're a beautiful looking game that's really inviting. It really suits this anime version of World War II. Then the Blitz engine was all about the tactics and the gameplay.
There's no grid in this tactics game. It's completely free-roaming. You have complete freedom of movement within a certain amount of space.
It still gates how far you can go, essentially like action pointing, how far you can go. I think if anyone's playing Baldur's Gate 3 right now, they will understand this system of being able to move in any direction, but you can only move so far. The camera, instead of looking top-down, god-view, you were kind of more behind them over the shoulder, like a Gears of War view.
You were in the action. When bullets whizzed past, you felt it, and the characters would cower and hide from danger. So it made what is traditionally quite a somber kind of board game-like genre into more of an emotive action-packed game without losing the depth of tactical systems that are in there.
I think one of the cool things about Valkyria Chronicles is it's all about the tank. The star unit of your army is this tank. You only have one.
It's there in most battles. It's obviously very, very powerful. You're going to take out bosses and walls with this tank.
It has a limited weak point at the back, like a little engine that snipers and grenadiers can sneak around and disable your tank if they play smart. You have to be quite tactical about making sure, right, I'm always going to try and keep an engineer walking behind my tank so they can repair it if it gets hit. I'll keep a couple of gunners back there as well who can keep an eye out for snipers and shoot them down.
So it's got exactly that depth of decision making, planning out a strategy before you deploy and go ahead. One of the key components of this game is the map. So between each turn it will show you a map of the battlefield.
You know, like you would see in war movies where they're moving units across a real model map on a desktop and strategizing from afar.
Or the dad's army opening credits.
Exactly like that. It does look like that. So it really encourages you to think about the landscape, the ruins of these nice little French towns.
It's not France because it's a fantasy world, but yes, it's France. As you should in this kind of game, making use of the environment to eke out any little tactical advantage you can. Because if you don't, if you don't think like this and you don't make use of every resource and every little advantage, it can be quite brutal and it will utterly destroy you.
It's also got this personality system. So you're recruiting these. There's an element where you're back at base and you're training up new recruits.
And you bring these individual personalities into your team. A lot of them are like the main characters who are part of the story, but others are just kind of like B characters who they've all got their own likes and dislikes, fears and hopes. So, you know, some might be agoraphobic.
So if you send them out into the open, they lose their bottle and they can't function and they just kind of freeze on the spot. There's like a race system where some people are like, oh, I really like blonde haired people. So if you take that person and you put them on the battlefield next to another person that they're likely to be pals with, you know, they'll get a little like buff.
It starts sparkling. So, yeah, like just a really, really beautiful game with depth of systems, move the genre forward in a really significant way. Of course, it was by Sega, so nobody played it, but it's still got like four sequels despite that.
And I think a bit of a cult hit these days. It was re-released a few years ago. There was like a Nintendo Switch version.
Valkyria Chronicles 4 came out around the same time.
I don't know how it did on Switch, but I definitely heard that it did really well on PC. Like they had, I did hear off the record that they had like sales expectations. Actually, they might have said this publicly, but it just blew away their like multi-year sales expectations in like a few months or something.
So it really did find that XCOM kind of audience that is most likely to be interested in it.
Yeah, so it's worth mentioning Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 were both PSP exclusives.
Yeah, interesting choice.
So it went from PlayStation 3 for the first game where it was making use of all these fancy graphics and an epic scale down to PSP where, you know, the battlefields were more kind of broken up into small rooms. They doubled down on kind of persona-like relationship stuff which slowed the pace a lot. Valkyria Chronicles 3 only came out in Japan, so really nobody played that one.
And the series was kind of dead apart from a spin-off that nobody liked. I think that Steam release probably spurned on by Sega's European arm. I think that revived the series.
I don't think there would have been a Valkyria Chronicles 4 were it not for the success of that PC version.
Yeah.
Do you think Valkyria Chronicles 1 is still the one to play?
Yeah, absolutely. That's the one to go in on. It's still just as good as the day it came out.
It's still very inviting. And then if you like it, go straight to 4.
Yeah, it feels like that's what... The numbering there might actually not be doing them some favors. It goes 1, 4.
They might as well have given it a subtitle or something. But yeah, I suppose the context to remember is that at the time, the PSP was huge in Japan. So it probably made sense budget-wise to move it on to there.
It is one of the great mistakes of this podcast. No one picked this in the PS3 draft, Matthew. I just completely forgot about it.
I made a lot of mistakes in the PS3 draft.
You mean the Jack and Daxter collection?
Yes, the puppeteer.
Yeah, good pick. You can tell, Ash, from how you're talking about it that you are incredibly passionate about this game. Really love it.
Good pick. And yeah, it still looks beautiful, I think, as well. The canvas art style.
What's your number seven?
I think this is the first arcade game on my list. It's a game I think you two really love. It's Ghost Squad.
Fucking love Ghost Squad, mate.
Love it. Excellent. Sega are really well known for their light gun games.
House of the Dead, Virtua Cop, Confidential Mission, all great games. I personally think Ghost Squad is the pinnacle of the light gun genre. I think it's still a little bit underrated.
It's not a household name in the way some of those others are. It's not as well known as Time Crisis by Namco. But it kind of just...
I spent a lot of time this morning thinking about Ghost Squad and thinking, how am I going to articulate why this game is great? Because on the surface, it's just another light gun game. It doesn't particularly innovate.
I think its biggest innovation is that it has opportunities to take different routes through the game, depending on either decisions you make or opportunities you take, which lends it a load of replayability and makes it quite exciting, so you never quite know what's going to happen. But I think about the moment-to-moment gameplay and why do I love it so much, it's Sega leaning on years and years of making this kind of game and just making every small moment count, right down to little decisions of how many enemies are in the room, where are they popping out from.
It answers a lot and everywhere.
Yeah, everywhere. They do pop out from everywhere. It's quite comical, actually.
I think on the first stage, you go into a bedroom and it's like one little bed and a desk in this bedroom. There must be like 30 soldiers that pop out from cupboards and behind pillows. Yeah.
The camera does a really good job of making you feel like you're in this 3D space. It's not a shooting gallery where you're either scrolling left and right or constantly moving forward. It turns, it tilts up, it tilts down.
You look under tables. There's a sense of like you are actually a person in this world, even though it's first person. Sometimes you'll drop onto the floor or onto your side.
You'll hang upside down from somewhere. So it feels really dynamic and 3D. Fantastic game.
I'd love to hear you guys talk about it a bit more. I will say there's a really fantastic home version of this game on the Wii. Uses the Wii remotes to kind of simulate a light gun.
You can plug it into that like plastic gun they did for the Zelda game if you like. You don't really need to. They added a few unlockable extras, a silly mode where it's got girls in bikinis.
Let's just gloss over that. That never happened.
They're carrying anonis instead of guns.
And like a kind of like leveling up mode that rewards you for coming back and replaying it over and over again and for exploring all of the different routes. It kind of checklists off, like have you seen everything this game has to offer? I think, you know, like 15 odd years on, I still haven't seen every little detail this game has, which makes it quite rewarding to keep going back to.
Yeah, I think the multiple routes thing is the thing that jumps out as like the innovation. And in some ways, actually, the last time I played this, I was COVID riddled in Torquay about two years ago. I didn't know I was COVID riddled at the time, but I was doomed by COVID.
And it is always a treat I have when I go back to Torquay is there is like one arcade that has a machine cabinet of this. But I do also now have to untangle it a little bit from my Time Crisis 2 memories because that is the game I played more recently. And I know that they've both got like really good river set pieces in them as well.
So I have to do a bit of that. But I think what I like about it is that there is, it leans into the special ops thing a little bit more. So you get like a bit where you just have to like, I think you got like there's a night vision goggles bit, which is really good.
There's like a sniper bit where you have to snipe sort of like a few different guys. And then you'll get like a rocket launcher specifically to deal with like a chopper or whatever. And I think it just, it maybe just feels a bit more sort of like inventive on the set piece side, just like chucking in like one-off gameplay elements to just make that specific set piece seem exciting.
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know how I'd articulate it any better really. It's just like, and it is the replay value of the different routes, I think.
It just means that when you've played Time Crisis 2 a few times, you do start, you become so familiar with the beats that I think it just, you know, you just get so used to all the ins and outs of it. And I think with Ghost Squad, just those multiple routes means that it never quite feels exactly the same. So, yeah.
Yeah, I know this best from the Wii version for sure, which I played for tens and tens of hours. And yeah, the branching routes and like that you had like a, you kind of leveled up and unlocked new guns and new things and that kind of persistence, just leaning hard into, yes, we know this is like a 20 minute experience. So, you're going to play it a hundred times.
You know, gets you over quite a big mental hurdle because like definitely when I was younger, you know, reading about like home, like gun games or home versions of them. I love the idea, but at the same time you think, oh man, can we really risk like one of our big game purchases this year on an hour long thing that we're just going to do over and over? But yeah, Ghost Squad just, I mean, really, but you know, I must have played it for like 30, 40 hours on the wing.
Yeah, the other thing is as well, I forgot about the, this game has the mechanic where you can like arrest some people as well. So you have to hold like hover the sort of cursor or like the light gun over the characters, then it will chuck some handcuffs on them like that. That's those sorts of one-off touches, I remember from this game as well.
I think there's a bomb defusal bit as well.
Yeah, I think there's a sense as well that going down those different paths just takes you to different sort of versions of those kinds of like twists on the light gun shooter. It's just, it's like the most all-encompassing of those types of games that I've played really. So that's probably as best as I can do to articulate this.
It's just such a good game. What's your number six?
Number six, I am looking at a copy of this game right now on my shelf, it's on the Sega Saturn and it is signed by Matthew's best friend, Eugene Acker.
Oh no.
Night of the Dreams.
No, it's not. It's Burning Rangers.
Okay, oh right.
One of my all-time favorite games. I went back to it last night as one of two games I played just to refresh my memory. Burning Rangers, not a game that a lot of people have played or are aware of, so a little bit of explaining will be required.
It's by Sonic Team. It's from this era of Sonic Team where they didn't want to make Sonic games for some reason. On the Sega Saturn, they made Nights, they made Burning Rangers.
That continued into the Dreamcast. They're making Choo Choo Rocket, Samba de Amigo. Yeah, they made Sonic Adventure by then.
I think they've had a slap on the wrists for it. But Sonic Team were in this really creative space where they were making the kinds of games no one had ever made before. Burning Rangers came out really late in the Saturn's life.
It remains exclusive. It is a futuristic firefighting game. You play these kind of anime heroes in a 3D game in a space station.
They are equipped with two things. They have all got a jet pack and they have all got a laser gun that has the ability to extinguish fire. I can't explain why.
They just do. So you are exploring these 3D space stations. You have to find...
Hostages. You have to find survivors. You will find them kind of like crouched down on the floor in the space station.
Later on in the game, after you have completed it and you replay the levels, it randomizes the stages and it randomizes the locations of the people you have to rescue. So tons of replayability there. I think one of the really cool things about this game is the kind of heat system.
So in this 3D world, before fire kind of like explodes out of nowhere, you will get like little warnings. So you might see like a panel on the floor that was grey, but now it is kind of turning red and yellow as it heats up. So you've got a little visual clue of, oh my god, like that is about to explode and fire is about to go everywhere.
Just before it does, there will be a little audio cue of a kind of like whistling noise of like air being sucked out of the room. And this fire will like explode in front of you and you've got a split second to kind of dexterously manipulate the controller so that you like backflip away from the fire, like to react to it and if you don't, like you're basically dead and restarting the game. So you're using your acrobatics and these jet packs to react to threats in the level and then blasting them with your laser, kind of like a third person shooter to get rid of the fire.
Because you're in a space station in space, the level design is very three-dimensional, so you've got your jet pack, you have to think about what's above you and what's below you, almost like quake level design, I would say. Really good 90s 3D thinking. So, yeah, I was playing it last night, and I was thinking, yeah, this is a real maze that I'm exploring here, and you've just got that basic enjoyment that you get from exploring a 3D space, which is a bit of a lost art these days, I think, with things being kind of more open world.
You don't really get so many games that are kind of inside a series of boxes anymore, and it probably wouldn't fly these days if somebody made a game like that, but there is a kind of like puzzle-like appeal to that kind of game. So, yeah, just something a little bit different. Still has that Sega cool, like the anime design of the characters is really kind of fresh and appealing.
The music, which I believe is done by the Daytona guy, you know, the guy who sings the Daytona theme, he did the music to this, so there's a lot of like jazz in it. There's a rap. The Japanese version of the game came with a soundtrack on a second disc, and there's a guy rapping on the soundtrack.
There's an immortal line on that song where he says, giving nightmares like Wes Craves. Like we all go around calling Wes Craven, Wes Craves.
Amazing.
Yeah, wonderful, quirky, cool Sonic Team game. Never been released on anything else. A little bit ahead of its time, like it should have been on the Dreamcast, really.
You can see the Saturn like creaking at the edges, trying to make this fast 3D game work. Desperately needs a port, desperately needs a remake, but very few people have played it. You don't really see people crying out for Burning Rangers in the way they do for, say, Jet Set Radio.
But it's a great game. I don't know if you guys have got much to say on this, what it's going to be more about. Ask any questions.
I mainly know it from the Sonic Racing level.
Well, I think that there's a couple of things. So I have looked into this game before. I can't remember what episode we did where I ended up looking this up.
So the name Burning Ranges is an all-time great 90s game name, I would say. But it also has the profile of game that Sega were quite big into getting onto the 360, onto Xbox Live Arcade. So it is disappointing they never did that because I think there's a few from this era that did end up making that transition.
But yeah, this is regrettably trapped.
I do think we'll see it eventually. I think the problem it had for a long time is that the Sega Saturn is notoriously difficult to emulate. And remaking it, you know, they did do a remake of Knights on the 360, but I think spending money remaking Burning Rangers would have been money down the drain when Sega couldn't afford to do that.
But the emulation side, you know, there are a few Sega Saturn games that are now emulated. You can get them on the Switch. Once it's cheap and easy for them to do, I think you're going to see it, because I know there's a lot of affection for this game internally at Sega and at Sonic Team.
I've interviewed Yuji Naka about this game. I know he's really, really proud of it. And I think they see it as this gem that should get more recognition.
It will happen.
To your point as well about Sonic Team, what they are up to at this time. So they go Sonic the Hedgehog, Knights into Dreams, Sonic Jam, which they're technically part of, and Sonic R, which they're the co-developer of, Burning Rangers, Sonic Adventure, Choo Choo Rockets, Space Channel 5, Samba de Amigo, Phantasy Star Online. What a run that is.
That's pretty amazing really. There's completely different types of game encompassed within all of that really. It's pretty impressive.
They were completely on fire. And I think that creative spirit, I think that transferred with Yuji Naka when he went to ProPay. I think you look at what ProPay were putting out.
They just didn't have the budgets that Sega had. They didn't have the console that needed supporting. So those games were much lower budget, but the creativity was still there.
Things like Let's Tap, where you put the Wii Remote on a cardboard box and tap the cardboard box. That's so cool. Ivy the Kiwi with a question mark in the title.
Commercial suicide, but it's the kind of like no, we're not going to do a Sonic game philosophy that Sonic Team had back then. Such a shame. Whatever happened to Yuji Naka, I don't know.
But I would love if he was making some games again.
That guy is like racking up an all time great sort of like biopic story, I will say.
He's literally in jail right at the moment.
No he's not.
He never went to jail. That was a joke that we made on this podcast. I think he was found guilty but just had to pay a fine or something.
So he has a suspended sentence which I, I'm not a legal expert but I believe that means he serves his time out in the world because he's not a threat to anybody's safety. But if he commits another crime in a certain amount of time, I think the consequences would be quite serious. So he needs to behave.
So what you're saying is a sequel to Balan Wonderworld would get him back in jail. Is that basically what you're saying there, Ash?
I think most of the world except me would consider that a crime.
I know you're a fan of that game. But yeah, okay. So I do hope they excavate this at some point.
I would also, maybe I'm the only one who thinks this, but I would like to see those Saturn games preserved with their original aesthetic because that is nice. You can play Nights on modern formats, but it doesn't really look like Nights did on the Saturn. And that specific kind of like, here's the 3D we can do with this hardware.
It's kind of why those games are quite appealing to me in retrospect. You know what I mean? I don't necessarily want to see them just restored in modern graphics.
We really need a Saturn mini console. And I think they considered it at one point, but they ended up doing the Mega Drive Mini 2. Instead, they got hit hard by the pandemic and the cost of manufacturing rose so much that it made, I think they've gone on record saying this, that it made doing a Saturn mini just unprofitable for them at that time.
But I think there is a little bit of a desire among them to make that happen, if they can.
So what's your number five, Ash?
A GameCube game. It's Super Monkey Ball.
Of course.
You guys must know this one.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
Of course.
Big Matthew game as well. Yes.
So Super Monkey Ball. Actually, it's an arcade game originally, just called Monkey Ball, where you use a banana shaped controller to guide a monkey in a ball, a bit like a hamster in a ball, around a series of kind of platform game mazes. Effectively, you're not really controlling the ball.
You're tilting the environment to roll the ball around, collect bananas, try not to fall off into oblivion, sending your poor little monkey to certain doom. Get to the goal and then on to the next stage until you've cleared a certain number of stages to finish the game. Really simple but really good fun arcade game that translated really well to the aesthetic of GameCube, translated well to the GameCube controller.
That analog stick on the GameCube controller, it gave you full 360 degree movement, but it also had that octagonal perimeter where you could lock the stick into one of eight directions. What a great innovation that doesn't really seem to happen anymore for whatever reason. That made controlling 3D games really kind of, like you put the power in your hands and work great for Monkey Ball.
The basic kind of arcade gameplay of Monkey Ball, I think is still very appealing, but I think GameCube version took on this extra life more as a party game. They threw in loads and loads of extra mini games, like different ways of playing with these monkeys in balls. There was a kind of very Mario Kart-like racing game where you roll down these half pipes.
There was a snooker or pool game where all the monkeys are in balls on a pool table. The highlight of all those mini games, I think most people would agree, is Monkey Target, where you roll the monkey ball down a huge ski slope. There's a ramp at the end.
It flies into the air, spins through the air, and then you can press a button to open the ball so that two halves of it form wings with your monkey dangling from them in the air, and then kind of glide the monkey through the air, through little targets that are going to score you bonus points as you go through these rings, with the aim being to then aim for these islands in the sea that have targets with points on them. If you can close your monkey ball at the right time, land in these targets, score a load of points, taking it in turns, playing against other players, trying to get the most points. Just a surprisingly good fun mini game that certainly me and my mates, we put dozens of hours just into Monkey Target alone and coming up with our own strategies, our own skills for how to get score multipliers, how to land in windy conditions on the tiniest of islands, using the physics to your advantage so you can stop on a dime and get like a hundred point score that's then multiplied by three because you did something right when you were in the air.
It became like an obsession to see how much we could master this simple mini game. I don't know how much Sega knew that they'd designed, I think they'd designed a mini game that actually ended up being more important than the main game itself. I don't know how much they appreciated that at the time.
I think the evidence of that is in the various sequels and remakes that have come along. They've always seemed to get Monkey Target a little bit wrong afterwards. They meddle with it and the purity is lost.
I would say that goes for maybe Monkey Ball as a whole. Everything they need to say with it is here in the first. The second one is still pretty good, but definitely when you get into what happens now in Monkey Ball, there's always so much shit.
I remember the one on the Wii. I mean, A, the Wii Remote wasn't really up to the task, I didn't think, but also, you know, like bosses and things like that with story modes.
Unnecessary.
You just don't get what made this special.
Yeah, so I experienced this by playing Super Monkey Ball Deluxe on Xbox, which combined the levels from both, add all the mini games from both as well, and I think even added a few more mini games. And yeah, I think that at that point in my head, Monkey Target had always been the thing I wanted to play more than the main game. So while I definitely dabbled with the main game, me and my little brother Doom Passerby on Monkey Target was almost exclusively how I...
I did try every single mini game as well. Some of them are definitely better than others. There's definitely a power rankings list to be done there of the different mini games.
But yeah, I think Monkey Target is just so perfect. And yeah, I sort of just like... It's so simple as well.
And the only other place I've seen really rip it off is GTA Online, weirdly, where they have a mode where you can drive... The problem is, because it's GTA Online, it takes ages to actually load into it. But you drive a car off of a ramp, and then you have a parachute pop off, and then you have to just land your car on the target.
And so it's the only time I've ever seen that pop up anywhere else.
Yeah, I've never played that, which won't surprise you at all. I think the crash mode in Burnout owes a little bit to Monkey Target as well. It's a different sort of thing, but the score attack element is there.
There was also in Game and Wario on Wii U, there was islands, which is slightly different in that you're sort of throwing handfuls of stuff onto a floating island, but had a little bit of that, I don't know, almost like ballsy kind of trickery of trying to land closer to something and fucking stuff up on subsequent turns.
There's something about taking it in turns on these games where half of the game is you watching how the other person does, taking delight in them screwing it up or being amazed when they pull off something incredible.
I just read about something called Benito Days on Switch, which came out a few years ago. It's basically a whole game built around Monkey Target. I don't know if I can be bothered with that, but certainly it's pretty amazing as a minigame.
It overwrote the narrative of the main game, but I don't think that's ever happened anywhere else. Okay, great. That's a worthy pick.
What's your number? Are we on five now, Ash, or four?
We are going into number four. This is an arcade game originally, but I would argue the Dreamcast version is far superior, and that is Crazy Taxi. This is where we're going to get into it.
But we like Crazy Taxi here. This has been established. I do have questions to you about the other two though, and how you feel about those.
The other two Crazy Taxis?
Yeah, we'll definitely get into that.
Give your top line then on this one.
Okay, Crazy Taxi. Does anyone need this game explaining to them? You run a taxi in a city, you pick up customers who will hop into your convertible taxi, and they'll say things like, take me to Pizza Hut or take me to Tower Records, and you have a big arrow that tells you where to drive at high speed.
The faster you get there, the more money you're going to make. You're also against the clock, so you can run out of time and it's game over. If you get there by playing in a crazy way, so you do lots of powerslides and jumps, you will earn more cash.
If you weave between the traffic, scraping really close to them without hitting them, then you'll rack up loads of extra dollars as well. Think the way Burnout 2 works to reference another game that's now ancient and probably a lot of people haven't played. A fantastic marriage, in my opinion, of over-the-top accessible thrills and skill-based depth.
Anyone can pick up and play Crazy Taxi and have a really good time in a couple of minutes. But the Sega heads, much like the Monkey Target stuff, will start to get obsessed with their strategies and their skills, obsessed with manipulating the handbrake and the accelerator to do a crazy dash which will give you a boost and net you more points, or a crazy back dash so you can reverse really quickly and turn around. Lots of hidden depth to this game that gives it a longevity.
Something we touched upon before about Sega games, a lot of Sega arcade games you might only play for 5 or 10 minutes, but I've been playing them for 5 or 10 minutes consistently for decades. If I crack out my Dreamcast, I'm not going to sit down and play Shenmue again, but I will play Crazy Taxi again. So you just keep coming back for more.
Same way you guys have been back to Ghost Squad again, because you know when you're playing retro systems, unless you're really dedicated, you're not going to put dozens of hours into an old game you've played before. But 10 minutes, of course you will do that. And I think Crazy Taxi is a great 10-minute game.
It's there in front of you. I don't think most people could resist. We've got to talk about the music.
So it had licensed music from The Offspring and Bad Religion, probably only about five or six tracks in total. So these same tracks kind of get stuck in your head. But it contributed to this kind of late 90s punk rock cool that suits Sega so well and is very much of its time.
It suits the Dreamcast so well. Later versions stripped out that music for licensing reasons and replaced it with generic rock. Later versions also took out the kind of real world locations, like the shops and restaurants that you needed to go to.
And it always feels a little bit lesser for those things not being included. But the heart of the game, the mechanics, the score attack, the speed, that's there in every version of the game. And I think it's a wonderful example of Sega taking their arcade racing expertise and plonking it into a different sort of game.
It doesn't surprise me that their big kind of comeback marketing this year is really centred around a new crazy taxi because there's still, in my opinion, lots of depth and lots of enjoyment to be had from that game.
What modern brands could they put in the new crazy taxi that would kind of be in keeping with the spirit of the original?
Poundland.
Greggs, obviously. Betfred. Things you see in destitute towns in the UK.
Yeah, it's...
It's the works. Yeah, it's... I love crazy taxi and, you know, just to kind of put it in context as well, when I was a kid, like, this was considered cool as well.
It was a game that the music obviously was a big part of that, but so was the aesthetic. I mean, the Californication music video by Red Hot Chili Peppers, surely that doesn't exist without crazy taxi. Like, the aesthetic of that is pure crazy taxi.
That sort of like vivid, sort of like, you know, sort of like outsider looking in, sort of America, you know, hyper real depiction of America is surely what they're riffing on in that video. But yeah, I think I agree as well, though, Ash. Like, it weirdly has frame rate problems in the arcade version.
Like, it doesn't quite run that well, but...
Yeah, so I should qualify that statement, right? So I've encountered the arcade version quite a few times. There's actually quite a few machines in the UK.
You can find it like Arcade Club and stuff like that. Because it's an arcade game, it uses a steering wheel and pedals as you'd expect. You know, it's an arcade racing game, of course.
But it works so much better on a controller because to play Crazy Taxi really well, you have to be really nimble with your play. And being nimble, like, you know, turning really quickly, reacting to what's going on, very quickly moving from, like, handbrake to accelerator. You can do that with digital buttons.
You just quickly kind of slide your thumb from one button to another. With a little analog stick on the Dreamcast, you can go from left to right in an instant. But turning a big wheel or moving your legs, it just slows everything down.
And all of the same mechanics are in there on the arcade version, but you will fail. You will perform worse in the arcade version of the game. And it maintains all of the kind of fun and cool, but it loses the depth of the score attack experience, even though it's the original version.
It's a really strange example. I don't think there's many examples of games where the arcade version feels flawed compared to the later home versions. So yeah, don't bother with the arcade version.
Don't go out there hunting for it.
It was a great thing to encounter in the early noughties, though. Oh yeah, it looks cool. It does look cool, and it really was everywhere in the UK.
It was maybe the last persistently available arcade machine you could find in not every town, but every city at least. So yeah, okay, well, I agree a good pick. So the sequels then, what is the deal with 2 and 3?
Because I never played those, but I know 3 has a really bad reputation too. I think it was kind of seen as more of the same, but I don't know much about it.
I don't care for them. Crazy Taxi 2, I don't know if it's an arcade version, it came out on the Dreamcast. It's set in New York, which means the level design is quite flat and grid based, which just doesn't suit this game at all.
The first one is in San Francisco basically, so you get the huge hill at the start with the trams on it. As you get to the bottom, you're going past the beach and then up into the shops, up another hill and there's a church. You're kind of naturally jumping by speeding over the environment and going off ramps.
And then you're in the sequel, you're just in this flat grid of a city. They added a jump button, which only feels necessary because the New York level design has these tiny little walls and tiny little fences that if you can't hop over them would completely slow your progress. And it just feels really flawed to me in that they picked the wrong environment for this kind of game.
They addressed that a little bit in Crazy Taxi 3. It's set in Las Vegas, but it's like a weird version of Las Vegas that doesn't exist with artificial hills and ramps. It's got more of that verticality to it.
But it's quite forgettable. It doesn't have the same sense of cool. It doesn't have the same great music.
It came out on the Xbox, Crazy Taxi 3.
Edge cover, if I remember right.
Did it have an edge cover? That's incredible. I think so, yeah.
Yeah, just so forgettable. I can't really go into detail about why it failed because I've forgotten it.
That's fair enough. I think, yeah, in some ways as well, I think it was a formula that had a sort of shelf life. You can only really do so many things with it.
So, yeah.
I should also state, I don't think Crazy Taxi is a bad game. Oh.
You do think it's a bad game or you don't?
No, I don't. No, I don't. All I was saying, you know, at the time, you would encounter this in an arcade and not to sound like a broken record, this was at a time when, you know, we'd only have a couple of games added to our collection every year.
And when you have experienced this and you have an idea of it from the arcade, the idea of, well, do we want that very small, bitty experience as, like, one of the only things we can do? You know, that, I just think that that way of thinking was more prevalent back then. You know, obviously now, when things are, you know, a bit cheaper or more readily available, I think we can all be a bit more open to these ideas and appreciate things on their own terms a lot better.
And I just think there's more of a sophisticated appreciation of the arcade sensibility, like, a little bit more in the mainstream now than there maybe was 20 years ago.
I will say, I think it's worth me going into a little bit of detail about why I think the arcade mechanics give this game longevity for the people who do dig into it and experience the depth that it has. So it's all about the timer. So there's a very strict clock in the game.
Once that clock runs down, it's game over. That can be quite frustrating because you want to see more of this city, you want to push further and see more of it. If you push far enough, you actually discover that this city is a loop.
So if you play really well, you can loop around and do circuits of it. But in order to do that, it's all about adding seconds onto the clock. So if you get a passenger to their destination in record time, like ahead of their expectation, as a bonus, they will add you either two or five, depending on how well you do, bonus seconds onto your clock.
So a really good player will keep topping up their time and you can play for longer. I think that gives Crazy Taxi a longevity that certainly kept me playing for years, because you're continuously honing your skills. The better you get at this game, the more of it you can enjoy and experience the next time you return to it.
But that only works if you're already bought into it. I think the people who were probably most bought into it are the people who either only had a Dreamcast or the Dreamcast was their primary system. They were quite comfortable buying these arcade games, knowing that they were going to put the hours into them.
The trouble is it existed at a time when people had Nintendo 64s and they were playing Majora's Mask and Grand Theft Auto 3 on the PS2. I think if you were more of a multi-format gamer, I can see how you would be like, well, yeah, I can buy one game this month. Am I going to buy the 100-hour game or the 10-minute game?
Okay, well, that makes sense, Ash. So, what's your number three?
Number three is a Yuji Naka game. It's on the Saturn. It is not Nights into Dreams.
It is Christmas Nights. Come on, guys.
Why is Nights good?
Let's start with you guys because obviously you've got feelings on Nights.
I have no real problem with Nights. This is more of a Matthew concern. I don't really...
I kind of get why the formula is good Sega design.
The sort of core loop of it is quite fun, but it doesn't have as much longevity to me as Sonic does as a formula, for example. What about you, Matthew?
I just don't click or particularly see the fun in the kind of looping mechanic. Maybe I don't quite understand elements of this game, but I remember having to get into Nights to cover the Wii version of it. And I was like, I do not get what the fuss is about this thing.
It didn't make any sense to me. Mechanics aside, I hate the world of it. I hate the really cloying kind of childlike dream element of it.
I find it incredibly naff and traditionally suspicious of people who are into it.
But go on, Ash.
I've never had someone properly explain the appeal to them, so please.
I will. It is a very divisive game. I think it's part of a narrative of Sega at the time of like, oh, this is what you've made instead of a new Sonic game?
Are you insane? I remember, you know, my same mate who keeps asking for a new Golden Axe. I remember him watching me play Knights and then saying to me, you are the only person in the world who both likes and understands this game.
So, you know, I know a lot of people who were like instantly turned off by this game. I was a big CVG reader at the time. Computer and Video Games magazine in the 90s were kind of huge tastemakers for me.
And I remember they used to bang on about Knights all the time. And I'd kind of I'd absorbed their opinions on Knights before I'd even played it. And I think that primed me for it.
So they had a real appreciation for the score attack element of the game. Very similar to Crazy Taxi, actually, in that a lot of the game is about making loops and combos around a circuit like platform game world. So it looks like a 3D platformer, but really you're going from left to right like you would in Sonic.
But instead of running along the ground, you are kind of gracefully flying through the air as this dreamlike manifestation called Knights. So it's within your power to basically steer this character as it flies to the right. You have a boost button so that you can go faster.
If you want to, you can play in a very simple way. You have to collect what are called idea balls, which is a strange name. You have to collect 30 of these balls as you make a circuit around the stage.
Once you do that, the circuit changes. So you're still on the same 3D world, but your flight path around it is a different kind of almost like racing game circuit. You do that, I think, three or four times and it's off to a boss battle.
You can play that very simply if you want. Collect the balls, do the circuits, get to the end of the game, and you may or may not have a pretty good time just doing that. But then it's got that Sega arcade score attack depth of like, there's a high score at the end of each stage.
And the way to get a high score is there are various kind of rings in the air that you can fly knights through. And if you do that, it will take her on a kind of more of a kind of roller coaster route. So you're having to like tilt up, tilt down, swirl around to kind of slalom your way through all of these rings.
And you get bonus points for each ring that you go through. And then that bonus point will appear on the screen. And it's kind of like ticking down.
You've only got a certain number of seconds before you have to combo into the next ring. If you don't get to the next ring in time, you lose that combo streak. So if you can make a perfect loop through the game, going through every single ring, which is very challenging to do, then that's where you're going to score really big.
And it does that Japanese game thing of, yes, you get a numerical score, but what does a number mean? Nobody knows. So it will also give you a grade, D, C, B, A, S.
I don't know why Japanese games give you an S, but S is like the best you can get. So it really clearly communicates to you objectively how well have you done, should you be going back and retrying and mastering this stage. And I think as is a theme for this episode of the podcast, that style of play is never going to be for everyone.
It takes a certain mindset. I grew up playing games in the arcade, the long stretches of my youth where I didn't really have a modern games console, but I was in the arcade. So I was kind of like bred for this kind of play.
And like I said, I was reading CBG magazine. I remember like Paul Davies and Ed Lomas and Tom Guise. All these personalities that I looked up to in the mags were like raving about knights and sharing their like strategies and hints and super guides on how to do well at this game.
So it was very much like time and place of being embedded in like a score attack culture that helps me enjoy this game.
Now I feel bad that the Games Magazine readers of 2008 had to deal with clowns like me going, what are we doing? Seems a bit shit.
That situation wasn't helped by the fact that Knight's Journey of Dreams on the Wii was an absolute trash fire. It doesn't capture any of the things that are great about it.
I'm glad I hadn't missed a secret Wii classic.
No, it's very bad. So, worth mentioning as well, it's a matter of taste of course, but I do really like that dreamlike world of knights. It's got this conceit of you're playing as one of two kids, Clarice or Elliot, literally like little kids.
You do start off the game in a 3D kind of Mario 64 like play, but you only do that very briefly, so you kind of like walk up the hill in 3D. You see knights who's this like dreamlike jester flying figure. You kind of bond with her and then you fly around.
If while you're flying around you get hit by too many enemies, that kind of bonding separates and Clarice or Elliot will separate from knights and like fall to the ground and you're back in the 3D world again. There's not much reward for doing that. There's no real reason to explore.
It's more run up the hill and get back to knights before you lose all your time and your combos. And I think that's on reflection, that's probably the element of the game where it was more open to criticism because this was a time when Mario 64 existed and was an awesome 3D platform game. And here's Sega with a 3D world where they're forcing you to play it on rails and play it in a 2D way, which just wasn't what people wanted at the time at large.
So just to explain why I've got Christmas Nights in here more than Nights into Dreams, Christmas Nights was a free version of Nights that was given away to Sega fans if you bought a console or you bought Sega Saturn magazine. It was essentially a demo for the main game, but they skinned it with a Christmas theme and played Jingle Bells over the top.
We always love that on The Back Page.
A pretty cool giveaway, but what made this game really cool was every time you completed the demo, you could open your presents. You played a game of pairs, and if you succeeded in the pairs, it opened a present. The present might be an image gallery to look at, or it might be something more interesting like a karaoke mode where you could sing along to one of the tunes in the game, or it might be a version of the demo where you could play as Sonic the Hedgehog.
So you could actually get to play Sonic the Hedgehog in 3D on your Saturn, which was a bit of a rare treat. Christmas Nights, I've played it every Christmas since it came out. It's a bit of a lifelong habit for me, so a really cherished and beloved strange version of a strange game.
Interesting pick, and probably more universally played than the main game, just from the way it was given away. I think so. I'm sure a lot of Sega fans out there have a similar experience.
What's your number two, Ash?
Number two is my favorite game of all time, Shining Force 3. This is a tactical RPG on the Sega Saturn. You can debate whether this is a Sega game or not, but it's a Sega IP published by Sega, developed by Camelot, who were formerly Sonic Software Planning.
It's a Sega game, it's on the list. What makes this game special? It's got everything that's great about the tactical RPG genre, the positioning, the tactics, the leveling up of the characters, adding loads and loads of characters.
Every time you get a new character, your force feels more eclectic and wonderful. But they just took it to an epic scale. To really appreciate this game, you have to play the Japanese version, you have to get the fan translations.
What they did was they released this game over three separate chapters that were released on individual discs about six months apart from each other. So you play through an entire 30 or 40 hour RPG on the first disc. It's a complete game, it has its own climax and ending, playing as this army in essentially a civil war.
And then in the second game, you play as the opposing side and you see the same story from the other side's perspective to the point where even some of the same dialogue is experienced, some of the same meetings, you will see them from the opposite side. It does that RPG thing that a lot of people hate where the main protagonist is silent and whenever they speak you get a dot dot dot. I know a lot of people hate that, but it works really well in this game because when you play the second chapter, it fills in the blanks and you get to see what the dot dot dots were actually saying and it gives you this new perspective on somebody who was previously your hero.
Of course, as you might expect from this kind of game, there's a reason to show things from both sides and you start to appreciate that both sides kind of have a point and war's bad. There's no real reason for these people to be fighting each other in the third chapter, both of these forces team up and they fight the real villains who are real evil baddies. I don't feel like there's been many attempts in the history of video games and RPGs to tell a story on that kind of scale and link sequels together.
Probably the closest thing ever since is Mass Effect, which was really ambitious with the way it kind of took your progress and carried it over into another game, but obviously it's in a more of a Western RPG style. So this is a very personal pick for me. I think it came along at the right time and just kind of blew me away with its depth and its possibilities.
I need to play this thing.
Yeah, it's hard to get into because it's never been re-released. You kind of need to emulate it. You need to get the fan translations.
But if you love tactical games, if you like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, you're going to have an amazing time with this game. And if you like Golden Sun, here's the Camelot game for you.
The one and two of Golden Sun have a similar narrative flip like that with the antagonist of the first game and the kind of leads in the second game, if I remember correctly.
It does. Yes. Yeah, very much a two-parter.
Damn. Yeah, I always wanted to play this because it's a really beautiful looking game as well. I can see why this has so much appeal.
What a shame they haven't salvaged it, but it does seem like there's quite an active fan base around this series. Actually, we're determined to get those extra scenarios that have been fan translated into people's hands.
Exactly. You've got to play the whole trilogy. Don't be afraid of emulating and playing fan translations.
You're not ripping off Sega by doing this. I don't think they care. Just play it the way it's meant to be played.
Don't worry about the lore. Listen to Ashley Day.
Listen to me and Eugene Acker. The lore doesn't matter.
Everything we know about the lore of this podcast was learned from the Ace Attorney series anyway, so that's fine. What's your number one then, Ash?
Number one, it's an arcade game. I think this is the definitive Sega game. You can learn everything you need to know about Sega for playing this game.
It's OutRun 2. I couldn't not have a racing game on this list. OutRun 2 is the one.
I think it's about 20 years old now. It has just lived and lived and lived. There are so many different variations of it that keep improving on the core gameplay.
I think you're going to any surviving arcade these days, you're probably going to see an OutRun 2 cab, and there's a reason for that. It's just an instant pleasure to play. It took what was great about OutRun 1, which was taking the racing game off the circuit and making it more of an A to B journey with multiple routes so that at the end of every leg of the race, you get to decide whether to go left or right, and that takes you to an entirely new environment.
Move through five of those in the time limit and you win the game. Brilliant. What made OutRun 2 so fantastic and took this to the next level was the philosophy of design behind it, which was Yu Suzuki saying, we're going to take this game that's about a journey and we're going to make it into a beautiful journey.
That was the slogan for the development of OutRun 2, a beautiful journey. They used the modern 3D hardware of the time to make every location that you drive through this picturesque place that is deserving of an open top convertible Ferrari. I know Yu Suzuki is a big car head and he spent loads of time driving around mountains and lakes in Europe to research this game and it really shows every element of it is just a pleasure to drive through.
And the way you drive through, something you couldn't do in OutRun 1, is these power slides that have become really popular in Japanese racing games at the time. Endlessly drifting around big corners, sliding your car on the road and weaving between traffic, it just makes you feel really cool when you play it in the right way. And it's not difficult to do.
I don't think OutRun 2 is a difficult game at all. And that's to its credit. It just means anyone can sit down at this game and they're taken away from reality for a few minutes.
And they can just experience pure pleasure. I don't feel the need to talk about any in-depth mechanics. There's a bit of a score attack element to OutRun, but not in the way we've talked about with these other games.
You don't have to dig into it and obsess over it. You just enjoy it. Enjoy the music, enjoy the graphics, enjoy sliding around.
What a wonderful game. You guys must know this game.
Yeah, I know it more as OutRun 2006, I suppose, is the way to put it. And I kind of understand that it is considered the sort of one of the true modern classics from Sega. So yeah, I played this, really enjoy it.
Just like beautiful, feels great in the hands. Played on PSP, actually. And is notoriously good PSP port, but I think a lot of people these days are big on the emulating the original Xbox one and kind of like blowing that up.
And it still just looks really crisp up close. And also the PC version of 2006 as well that you can no longer get hold of. People kind of covered that as well.
So yeah, beautiful. I can see why it summarizes, it brings into sharp relief all of the great elements of a Sega game. What about you, Matthew?
Yeah, little bits here and there. It's not a game I've ever owned. I know how important it is to people.
Kind of surprised this wasn't in the revamped collection that they're doing. I don't know how big it is as a going concern, but based on its reputation, you'd think this might have been one of the ones in the mix.
I do have thoughts on that. The licensing is tricky because Ferraris are such a major component of the game. You need to have that licensing in there.
If you don't, it's a little bit like taking the music out of Crazy Taxi.
My mates and I were talking about this the other day. What would you do with an Outrun 3? How do you build on top of Outrun 2?
How do you build upon perfection, quite frankly? I think that's such an intimidating design challenge. I bet they've thought about it and avoided it so many times.
You occasionally get little bursts of other open world racing games which seem to be channeling a bit of this. There's always a race in a Forza Horizon going down beachy highways that feels like it's trying to tap into a bit of that, never with the same purity or simplicity, I guess. But the fondness for it, you'd hope, would somehow manifest as another outing at some point.
Yes, Horizon Chase Turbo kind of riffing on this.
Horizon Chase is more riffing on the original OutRun, to be honest. It's more of that 2D sprite-based gameplay. It's a great game, but in my opinion doesn't hold a candle to OutRun 2.
I think it's really sad that there isn't an OutRun 2 you can play on modern hardware very easily. There's no official release on Switch or Xbox. But it is still out there in a lot of arcades.
I'll just quickly talk about the fact that there are loads of different versions of this game. OutRun 2 SP is the one everyone really loves. It's just a revamped version of OutRun 2 that doesn't punish you for crashing into other cars.
Nice. There's OutRun 2 SP DX, which you might have seen, where it's got two full-size cars you can sit in. And it has the gimmick of two of you can sit in one car, and you've both got a steering wheel, and it will dynamically swap control from one player to another.
So you can kind of co-op OutRun 2 while also racing against another pair of friends. That's kind of like the ultimate realization of what arcades should be doing. And then the home versions, OutRun 2 on Xbox added online play and had bonus tracks from Daytona and Skud Race, which never got a home version.
Really cool. And OutRun 2006 is the Sumo Digital developed, kind of let's take OutRun and make it more of a console experience by giving you loads of challenges and different routes through the game, kind of level up in a Gran Turismo way. I think that's the version to play if you want to spend a lot of time enjoying OutRun.
That's the 30 hour OutRun game if you want it. Really cool. I bought a PS2 version a few weeks ago, 5 quid.
It's not expensive.
Okay, well that's the thing actually as well, is that knowing there are these several different versions out there does make it slightly harder in your head to nail down. So it's nice to have a recommendation there. But yeah, very much enjoyed what I played of it.
I think this might be the first game I ever stole from the Imagine Officers was outright CS6 on PSP.
That's a good theft.
Beautiful memories there.
A noble theft, it's okay. You're not going to go to jail for that one.
Much like pirating Shining Force 3, Ash permits it, it's fine. Okay, well thanks so much Ash. That was a great list.
You really covered a lot of genres there. It was comprehensive. No Astro Boy or Mega Factor in there of course, which I'm obviously furious about, but so it goes.
Where can people find your blog again, Ash? Just to remind people.
If you search for games from the black hole, you're going to find it. I don't think there's anyone else using a name that strange out there. Next game I'll be covering on there, it's not a Sega game, but it is a tactical RPG.
It's Konami's Vandal Hearts. So please look out for that.
Nice, and where can people find you on social media?
I'm still on X for now. Jelly Scare on there. I'm not really anywhere else, to be honest.
Do you remember how disappointed you were that we... I emailed jellyscare at gmail.com, thinking that was your email address to get you on the Christmas special episode, and then it turned out that I had lazily assumed that was your email without actually checking, and then emailed someone we don't know, basically asking them if they want to be on the pod. So that's why Ash wasn't on the Christmas special last year.
The only thing I'm really disappointed about there is that nobody replied, and you didn't have a message from a stranger on your post.
In the episode we have Ding Dong, and it's like, hi, it's Geoff here.
Good time. So yes, that's why Ash wasn't on that episode. But yes, cool.
Matthew, where could people find you?
MrBazzlePesto, MrBazzle underscore pesto on Twitter, and MrBazzle underscore, oh, fuck it. MrBazzlePesto, no underscore on the blue sky.
That's it. The Back Page drinking game. Will Matthew bring up his blue sky account on every episode?
Drink, drink. I'm Samuel Roberts. The podcast is Back Page Pod, and there's patreon.com backpagepod if you'd like to support us.
Don't worry, we're going to chuck Ash 80 quid for his fine work on this episode. What a rich man he will be. Ash, it's always a pleasure, though.
Thank you so much for coming on. And it's been great. No doubt we'll have you on again soon.
So thank you.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks so much for listening. We'll be back next week. Goodbye.
