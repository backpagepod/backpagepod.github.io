Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a podcast about video games. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Wait, is that what it is? Do you see what I did there, Matthew?
Oh, I see. I see, that was a burn.
It was. It was a light burn for getting the name of the podcast slightly wrong in your episode with Stu Turton last week. So, yes.
That was, yeah, sorry, I hope you don't mind me taking a little jab there. Just thought it was quite funny that-
No, it's fine. I feel like I've taken quite a few strays over that episode, not due to the quality people seem to enjoy it, but from you for getting the name wrong, I've had quite a few people, they thought I was trying to do a bit of a Simon Parking impression.
All right, I mean, I just, you know, interviews did exist before My Perfect Console. I mean, like, as far as I'm aware, they've been around for quite a long time. So I don't know if that's necessarily a justified-
Yeah, I think what people are probably reacting to is the fact that I scripted the intro so I wouldn't, like, muddle it up and just have a nice, clean intro so I could get into the chat with Stu as fast as possible. Yeah. And when I read things out, I have a slightly different voice from what you're hearing now.
I think that's what really what it is.
Okay, well, that's fair enough. I mean, it was a nicely received episode. So people might not know this, but I had a little break, obviously, last week while Matthew interviewed Stu.
We thought that kind of made sense to have a bit more of a one-on-one chat and that went down well. Then when I saw Matthew yesterday, it was like, pressure's on for your episode with Darren Jones next month. So I've got Darren from Metro Gamer coming on to do the PSP draft.
Did that get under your skin? It wasn't meant to.
No, no, no, not at all. It's just a joke. I know you were being playful.
You weren't even being vaguely sort of passive aggressive with that, but it did make me think, I've got to fucking bring the A game now. I've got a fucking orbital strike, Matthew, with a podcast of searingly high quality. So we'll see how that goes.
I would say there's, I would think a traditionally, there is a bigger audience for a PSP draft than there is an interview with a crime author.
Well, I guess so, but people really seem to respond positively to the Stu episode. So I'm like, right, I've got to fucking raise a quality bar so high on this PSP draft. It's got to be out of this world, tight podcasting, so no pressure.
I was worried that things may also be frosty between us because the last interaction we had was a, well, I was going to say a malicious game of Choo-Choo Rocket. I don't know if any other kind exists.
Yeah, so for a nice little podcast Patreon plug there, Matthew, patreon.com/backpagepod if you like what we do and want to support us and also get two extra podcasts a month and in one of those, this month, the episode is coming out the Tuesday after this one goes live. We have played something like 10 or 11 Dreamcast games in a row, went around Matthew's house with my modded Dreamcast. We chose them from a big list of 132 games and played a few highlights and Chu Chu Rocket was one of those, a game that me and Matthew had never played before and it's basically a game of funneling mice into your little zone and collecting as many mice as possible.
But there are also cats around who fuck up your score and all you do in the game is control the four arrow keys and like control the direction of where the mice are moving on the board. But then every other player who's competing also controls the direction. So you got mice going in all these wacky sort of different directions.
Obviously people who had a dream cast will know what this game is, but we hadn't played it before. And Matthew just played it as a game of funneling cats into my base to fuck me up. And it was really funny, but it was like one of the most, like I was so sweaty afterwards because I was so fucking stressed out from playing it.
Like how would you describe that experience, Matthew?
Yeah, that sounds about right. I don't want to start on the toes of any of the Excel observations that we've yet to record and make. But yeah, it was an amazing potential for shithouse-ery in that game.
Really, I mean...
Out of this world.
Yeah, I'm kind of amazed that in all the years of reading about that game, no one had ever kind of conveyed that point to me. Like it wasn't at all what I was expecting.
No, I thought it was like a kind of like a weird-looking 2D puzzle game or something. I couldn't even really work out why it was the anchor of the Dreamcast Online thing. And you play it and you're like, oh, this is like the ultimate dickhead party game.
And it's quite wonderful at doing that. Yeah, I was kind of blown away by it. So yeah, look forward to talking about that more on that XL episode, Matthew, which you can get on the XL tier for Â£4.50 a month.
So yep, that will be available soon along with our observations on the cursed character models of horror cult classic D2. The less said about that, the better. So this episode, Matthew, what we've been playing, nice to do another one of these.
Good to sort of like get on the path towards the game of the year 2024 episode and play a bunch of different stuff and talk about how that's going. You have been amazingly prolific at clearing out games this year and have finished pretty much every big release so far. So very impressive.
I have completed none of those big releases but have instead focused my energy on sort of like mid-sized games and I finished a few of those and a bunch of multiplayer experiences as well. Got quite a lot of Helldivers 2 experience under my belt now. So that's good.
Been fun to sort of play that. It's kind of burning out a little bit with my group of players that one. It's sort of like nearing the end of its lifespan.
It attracted the attention, I think, of people outside the usual multiplayer sphere, but I think those people are now, their interest is subsiding and they're moving on to other things. I don't know if you've had that with the Helldivers, people in your lives.
They're leaving their review bomb and moving on.
Yeah, less said about that, the better. Also, okay, so this episode, we've got Stellar Blade to talk about, first of all, the PS5 exclusive game by this developer, Shift Up, who previously made a game called Blade and Soul I'm not really familiar with. We talked about this a bit previously, except for the demo in the last What We've Been Playing episode.
Matthew has finished this game. I am about six to seven hours through it. And we thought we'd talk about that as the main things.
This is probably the biggest recent release there is that's sort of on people's radars, I guess. So I wanna describe the plot of this game, but don't really know how to. Some robotic, attractive women drop down to Earth, which has been cleared of humanity mostly, and fight a bunch of weird looking monsters slash robots.
And then there's lots of like sad, wailing, sort of like women singing on the soundtrack. If you played near-automata, it's like that, but the plot doesn't really kind of like registering quite the same way. But what it amounts to is basically going around large-ish environments with this slightly soulsy, slightly bayonettary third-person combat system.
And later on, different kind of like elements weave into the game. Like it becomes a little bit more open-world with side quests and things like that. But the overall structure of it kind of remains soulsy.
You sort of like go between these different sort of like waypoints, basically different sort of like safe zones and unlocking those. And then going back and forth in order to collect things you might have missed, that sort of stuff. And yeah, so third-person combat, where there's a lot of like, I guess like Z-locking, dodging, parrying, that sort of thing.
A little bit of a hodgepodge of all the third-person hack and slash games that have really kind of like become prominent in the last 15 years or so going back to Bayonetta. So yeah, and I think the thing I find interesting about it, Matthew, is that it does lack a bit of personality of its own, I would say, in terms of how it looks and how it plays. And yet, stitched together, a lot of these good elements, I would say not great and not really average either.
They're good. Good combat, good exploration, good art direction, but not amazing art direction. It's all just quite good.
And then the music is excellent. But it amounts to something that's very pleasant to play. It's not nearly as challenging as a lot of these kinds of games are.
And I found it quite breezy and enjoyable. I think it looks pretty nice. It's got some, I guess, 360-era vibes to it.
And I don't mean that as a criticism, it just doesn't quite feel like the sort of game people make now. It is slightly imperfect, but in a way I find kind of endearing. It's the sort of thing, sort of feels like a big swing kind of game that Platinum should be making, but hasn't really been making recently.
And as a first attempt at making something blockbuster-y for, I guess, that PS5 exclusive audience who always want to buy something big and shiny, I think it's really a really respectable effort. And I'm enjoying it. But how do you feel about it, Matthew?
Yeah, that sums up a lot of it for me too. You know, I can't really point to anything here which is like all of the game zone.
Yeah.
Everything feels cribbed. I mean, at one point it feels like it might be doing something interesting with, so a bit later in the game, you get a gun. I don't know if you've got the gun yet, but.
I have got the gun, yes.
Yes, yeah. And which sort of switches you into a sort of third person over the shoulder kind of shooting mode. And that kind of hints at something interesting in terms of, you know, you have this quite acrobatic third person melee combat, you know, kind of parries and dodges and that kind of malarkey.
But then you also have the ability to kind of pull out a gun and target weak spots. And when you first get it, like the skill tree kind of hints that there might be interesting interplay there, you have a series of, I guess you'd call them context-sensitive parries, where there are certain moves where if enemies do them, you can perform a very powerful counter-attack as long as you input the right button press. So, you know, there are enemies who kind of flash blue and that lets you kind of dodge around behind them.
There are ones which I think is yellow and you'd have to do a regular dodge. But then there are also, I want to say, red attacks, which if you do the special counter-parry for those, it sort of knocks them back, exposes this weak spot, which the game then suggests you unload a load of bullets into. But outside of a handful of enemies which actually have those attacks, I never really felt that kind of interplay between guns and sword combat.
You know, it's almost like they kind of played Bayonetta or Devil May Cry and went, well, he has guns, and he has fists and swords and things, but because this game doesn't really have a combo chain system or a ranking system, there's no emphasis on momentum or keeping things together, which is what traditionally guns do in these combat systems, is kind of keep, stream together the moves as you're moving between things.
Yeah, they're like passive, they're meant to be like passive kind of fire basically, to like keep things moving, and this game is kind of like, it's a bit like, it's Gears of War for a second.
Yeah, but I think you can forget for long stretches you even have guns, like the ammo is so stingy, I don't really know why they're there. Apart from there are a, I don't think this classifies as spoilers, but just in case you're very precious about these things, there are a handful of levels where your sword is taken away from you and it's guns only, and they kind of play like weird kind of shit Resident Evil levels, because you're in these like dark environments and monsters are jumping out and you've got to shoot their weak spots, and I guess there's a bit of resource management in that you've got quite a low bullet count. So outside in the world where you're like, why do I never have any bullets?
That makes sense for these like three sort of survival horror set pieces that they do, but then, you know, when you're back outside again, you're like, well, I don't really know why I've got these things. And there's quite a few things like that where it feels like just not fully thought through. But in the moment, you're like, oh, well, this is kind of neat.
Like, I didn't hate the, you know, the survival horror things. I didn't write, you know, they're not amazing or anything, but they break up the pace of it and you're like, okay, this is a bit different. And it lets it do like a slightly different mode of storytelling because, you know, they tend to be in more kind of like futuristic science, sort of lab areas.
So there's a, you know, it feels kind of, you know, a bit like how in Resident Evil, you always break into the secret laboratory under the old ass house. It kind of has a bit of that going for it. So, you know, I was definitely never bored, but I was never like, holy shit, you know, I must recommend this to everyone because it stands on its own two feet.
I think, like you say, it's a bit of an arbitrary attempt to adding variety to it. And that the game, I think, is sometimes it almost was like a second guessing itself by doing that sort of thing. You know, the guns in general have a little bit of that.
It's like, well, we need something else at this point in the game. So guns, right? That seems like the kind of logical path.
But, yeah, I think the point you make about the different sort of like abilities that are almost kind of like cutie-ish, like the counterattacks to enemies. Like, first of all, it took me a little bit of time to get my head around them because you need to click in the left stick to activate both the one that's sort of like, the sort of shift dodge where you end up behind them so you can like do a bunch of damage, and the one that's like the jump backwards and like kick them to sort of like protect yourself from a deadly attack one. They're like, actually, like took a bit of work to kind of like add that to the rotation of my brain's sort of like understanding of the game because they are like, because clicking in the stick feels a little bit unusual in general.
Like, it's not something you really do in these kinds of games. It's something I basically associate with, like, I don't know, first person shooting and not much else.
So it's a little craters sticking his thumbs in eye sockets.
Yes, it's a bit odd in that respect. But yeah, in general, it's sort of like I weirdly just despite the fact that it doesn't really have its own identity. It's sort of like it's just kind of like oddly sort of pleasant to play.
Like there's a lot of combat encounters end up feeling a bit a bit sort of like slow paced and steady. It's a bit like, okay, now it's one to one with this guy. They're one to one with this guy.
And because you don't have the sort of like the default difficulty is not at that sort of like Souls level, it means that you're not thinking about each individual enemy encounter in the way you would with Dark Souls games where it's like, okay, if I fight this guy, how long until I make it to the next fucking? What is it like bonfire? Basically, how you don't have to do that level of planning because it's not that difficult.
Basically, so it's sort of like there's a tiny bit of like making your own fun with it, where if you spend too much time in one environment, kind of like interacting, like grinding through enemies, it's not really worth doing because it's not exactly that kind of game. I think it's just sort of like about you kind of need to trust yourself to find the momentum that works for you in order to enjoy it, because otherwise you just sort of slow down and think I'm in another kind of like gray scale environment and nothing much is really happening. And I've been here for like two hours or whatever, like you really just got to keep moving, keep doing stuff.
And it will be kind of enjoyable, gently enjoyable. But can I ask you a question? Do you know what's going on in the story of this game?
Vaguely, like some of it's meant to be a bit mysterious so they can do some very obvious reveals. The problem I have is when they like talk about humanity, then a lot of the humans you meet are kind of half robot. And I'm never entirely sure if the humans, quote unquote, I mean, are humans.
Or if they are like androids. And there are some reveal, you know, you've basically got like in the past, humans made androids and have warred with one another, which is why some people left to space and became like a civilization of babes.
I hate when that happens.
So you've got like babe civilization in space. They send babes down to try and like fix the earth. But who exactly is on earth and what their buy-in is and what, you know, what they're trying to sort of survive against and what their relationship is with the Nateebers, who are the enemies.
Like some of it is is given to you in very clear detail as like plot revelations and twists. Some of it is still now very confusing, but I don't know. I found it like, well, not like super engaging.
I didn't find it like it got in the way. Like I'd say like one area it maybe does trump platinum is at least it's cut scenes kind of come and go. And the story is pretty basic.
Like Bayonetta, there's a lot of confusing bullshit in there and like weird terminology. And I don't think they established the rules of that world like particularly well either. But this, I didn't really have that problem.
I just knew Babe Space, Aliens, Planet, Calm Down, Sort Them Out. The promise is that at the end you'll get to return to the civilization in space.
Yeah. I was kind of curious actually, like which is your favorite of those two games? Sid Meier's Babe Civilization or Alpha Centauri, Matthew?
Where do you stand on those two games?
It's tricky isn't it? Yeah.
And I sort of like, in terms of like the, because I don't really understand what's going on at all. Like I know people keep calling Eve the main character Angel. And they don't say it in a way like, alright Angel, kind of like.
No, I think they are angels.
Right.
Like that's their word for soldier. Like they have platoons of angels.
But she is called Eve, right? I've not missed that.
Oh yeah, you are struggling with this.
Well, I just don't really know. I just don't think it really gives you much context. So straight away you kind of like, you arrive from space onto Earth and start fighting these monsters and your sort of like mentor babe is basically like killed.
And that's kind of like the motivation for her as a character. She's saved by some guy called Adam. Got that right?
That's a character, isn't it? Yep. Is he a robot?
I don't really know. I think he maybe is, but he's sort of like, he's not a babe. He's like just some guy.
He lives on Earth. He's an Earth goodie.
He's got human energy to him, I would say that way. So you got, yeah, so I just, in the midst of that and all the cutscenes where people would talk about Earth and like some organization that humans don't like, and then you go to this sort of hub city area and there are loads of humans, there are loads of robots there, I think, but maybe some humans. It's really like, not that clear, but I do agree that it doesn't really get in the way.
I think it's sort of like, the most the story gets in the way is it doesn't seem to have skippable dialogue when you initiate side quests in the game, so there's a lot of like people waffling on and you having to listen to them, which is tough, but honestly, I don't really mind being tuned out of what's going on, because I kind of, having played Nier Automata as much as I have, I see so much the pastiche of what they're doing. I see through it just so clearly, like the whole thing with Nier Automata is you are basically meant to be clearing the planet for the return of humanity, but spoiler alert, that's not actually what's really happening, and you kind of peel back the layers of what's going on there. This game takes so many cues from Nier Automata and how it looks, sounds, and how the story plays, and they have been open about this as well, the developers shift up in talking about that.
I always feel like I don't have to engage because they haven't created something that's wholly original. Do you know what I mean? I feel like I've played this story because I've played Nier Automata, so in which case I'm just happy to focus on the game part of it.
Yeah, it's quite an unusual thing, really. Do you think it's fair to say it feels kind of double A in some ways?
There are moments where it feels as shiny as you like, really. Some of the boss takedown, the animations are really kind of ornate and detailed, and some people would say that's because it's all a bit salacious and that's what its priorities are. But actually, a lot of them, they're just very, very tricksy, cool, over-elaborate kind of cutscenes, which are so kind of artfully kind of composed and rendered that in those moments it does feel quite spectacular.
One thing I would say, having finished it, is that it loads the kind of the final third, I think has more interesting areas and like quite a lot more boss fights in quick succession. Like it ends on quite a high, which feels quite expensive compared to some of it. Like there's a lot of deserts in this game up front and sort of bombarded streets where everything's just kind of covered in moss.
And that's like an invitation for everything to be a bit beige and grey. But towards the end, you get to see, you know, some areas which are a bit more sort of futuristic or kind of untouched by the enemies. And as a result, it just sort of steps it up a notch and like the boss design, I think throughout is pretty fun, you know, there's got some really elaborate things.
I wouldn't say they're necessarily like great boss fights. It's pretty one quip. All I have with it is due to that slightly kind of quick time eventy nature that you pointed out, a lot of fights don't feel like hugely dynamic.
They feel like, you know, parry, parry, parry. It does a blue thing. You do the blue dodge.
It does a yellow thing. You do the yellow dodge, parry, parry, parry, attack, attack, attack. Like if anything, the fact that I move so little, like I basically just stand in front of the boss and press the buttons reacting to them.
Like there's very little need to actually like do evasive dodges, especially when you realize like a lot of your special moves can sort of stun enemies out of doing the moves that you would normally need to dodge for. So as long as you've got energy to do those, you literally never have to move out of the front. Right, you just stand in front of them hitting all the buttons and it feels more like punch out than it does like Bayonetta.
It doesn't feel like you're mastering this amazing combat system. It feels like a pure reaction test, which is like weird. I wouldn't say I hate it just because a lot of these bosses I could do first time and I felt good about that.
Like at least I could do it and it looks pretty spectacular. So I didn't really care. But I was also thinking, well, I don't think there's much more to this.
You know, like when I can kill like the second to last boss first attempt, just because I'm okay at this reaction test, there's maybe something screwy there.
Yeah, maybe it's that thing of like when I sort of get so cutie-ish as a design touch that I was there thinking this is like the unanswerable question about this game is like, is this is this a good design decision or is this a bad one? And I think like maybe if you get deeper into the game and you get so used to that system that you are tearing bosses apart pretty easily, then maybe that is the litmus test of this doesn't this doesn't quite work. Where I am, I kind of like I kind of like it as a bit of dynamism to sort of like, just to make the regular encounters pop a bit visually, it's a bit like, it's definitely just patiently sort of like dodge rolling around this guy, there's no need because he does this attack, I teleport behind him, batter him and he's done and that's, it's a nice, that's a nice thing to experience.
It looks cool, the camera does something cool and it feels pretty good. But yeah, in bosses, maybe that's where that sort of falls down a little bit, you just, you realise there's a bit of a, bit of a ceiling to how, how much joy that system can bring you.
Yeah. Another like little knock on from that is there comes a point where you almost can't be bothered to invest skill points because you're like, I've got the core moves. As long as you've got that blue dodge, yellow dodge, red dodge or whatever, that's it.
Like those are, those are the building blocks. Anything you put on top of that is just extra colour may speed up what is already quite a speedy process of taking down regular enemies and bosses. But I had, you know, in one of those games where you can go into the skill tree and you've got like 15 skill points or whatever and you're like, oh, I should probably spend some of these on some of this, some of this bullshit, which is a sign of failure always.
Where I am, those points do still matter. Like having sort of like, you know, critical, like having like increasing the chance of critical attacks, that sort of thing. Or, you know, just having a few more options to, to, you know, to fit into play between the, for combos between the square and the triangle buttons, basically.
And then just like clearing out regular enemies a bit faster. But I will, I will admit that none of the bosses have given me any trouble. They've all been, I've done them all in two attempts at most.
And like the first attempts would have been just me sort of like, actually to register a minor complaint. This game goes in the Helldivers 2 bracket of your consumables take about half a second too long to use, and like that animation's lasting too long there, my friend. That's like, I'm pressing the up button and it's not popping off.
Same thing with Helldivers. I'm like, I'm going stim, stim, and then like five seconds later I'm shouting at my TV, stim, stim, and it's not, and it's not stimming.
Your Helldiver is slowly unbottoning the little stim thing on his belt and going, which of these should I...
There's a little bit of that to it. It's just a bit, just like a touch too slow. But yeah, it's overall, yeah, it's sort of like, it's an odd little game.
It's an odd little game. And it's sort of like, yeah, none of the bosses are giving me any trouble. None of the regular enemies give me trouble, even though I think the enemy types are quite good.
They've got the ones that spit things at you, little ones. Big ones with blades that kind of pop out.
These are the correct archetypes. These are the terms they use in development. Give me one of them spit ones, a little one.
One's got a shield and likes to slap you about with a shield. They're sort of like, they kind of, there's a bunch more that unlock when you get to that desert place. There's like new types.
I assume there's new types up until the end. But yeah, a decent enough roster of enemies. But yeah, there maybe is a ceiling to how much joy this combat system could give you, Matthew.
That's probably like a fair criticism of you, you know?
Yeah. I have to ask, have you managed to unlock a more respectable costume or a costume where you feel like you wouldn't be mortified if anyone walked into the room?
See I paid Â£1.89 to unlock the Peacock's sensible lady's trouser suit. So like she's wearing that now, Matthew. And so I can't see the shiny buttocks anymore.
No, sorry about that. When you get to the city bit, you meet this lady, this information seller who can give you like new costumes are like one of the things that she'll sell you after you buy a certain amount of things from her. So I bought like the, I guess like the all-in-one black sort of like cat suit or whatever it is.
Like that's, that's more, she looks a bit more like a Metal Gear Solid. She looks like one of the Beauty and the Beast unit basically, an MGS4. There's just a tiny bit less egregious.
But the thing is, I've realized that no matter which costume you buy, she still has shiny buttocks and like there's no, there's no, the light source there. No matter where you are, those buttocks are always shiny. Is there a sensible sort of trouser suit or similar, Matthew?
Yeah, there's a, quite early on, or in the first there anyway, I unlocked a kind of a red blouse with black leather trousers. So yes, you know, shiny, shiny buttock maintained, but it's got big like Ada Wong energy, right? So you know, it's no, no less shady than that.
I spent a lot of the game with this, like, I know it only kind of came like halfway down the thighs, but it was like a knitted dress and it looked very cosy. It looked very sort of like big, thick winter clothing and you know, there's still like a lot of leg on display, but that was also, I wouldn't have been embarrassed if Katherine walked in. She definitely came in when I put on the swimming costume, which is one of the more kind of like, just outrageous in terms of like, the cut of it is just very, it doesn't hide much, leave much to imagination.
So yeah, that was fine. It wasn't as bad as like, it wasn't like, you know, the plumber walked in who previously came in during the God of War minigame, like, he'd come back for the yearly boiler check and this is now what I've kind of gotten on to, that would have been bad, but no, I'm kind of like, there's, I mean, I'd say those are like, two non-horny costumes in like a sea of quite horny costumes, but they do exist, should you, should you wish.
Yeah, I didn't find that first one. Otherwise, I probably would have swapped it in, because I bought another one that I thought was going to be quite different, and it turned out it's just the green one you start with, the orange, and I was like, oh, fuck.
Yeah. One of the weird things about this is that it has that, like, Metroid-y, you know, secrets hidden behind very sort of specific paths and solving environmental puzzles and weird little challenges.
In a very elementary way, I would say.
Yeah.
Very elementary.
Yeah, there are, once you get more into the two kind of more open world areas, I think there are some more in-depth secret things hidden there or little challenges that require a little bit more of you to kind of unlock. But it is interesting that outside of, like, a few things which give you, like, more health or more energy for your special attacks, all the pickups are costumes or crates with resources to make the costumes. And I always think it sucks a bit in a kind of a Metroid-esque game when the reward, when the scripted reward is, like, random crafting parts.
Like I want something more specific. I want, like, a missile upgrade or that health upgrade. I don't want, you know, you pull off, like, an amazing bit of platforming, find a chest in a cave, open the chest, and then it's kind of like three medium polymers, five rare polymers.
And you're like, oh, like, really, everything in this game is just channeling you into making suits. It assumes that is what you are here to do. And it's a little bit, I don't know, it's a little bit unsatisfying as a reward for, like, oh, what have I found?
Oh, I've just found some bits to make other bits, you know, to make skimpier clothes, which I'm not going to wear because I'll probably get told off.
I will ask, is it, like you trying the swimsuits on, sorry, not you specifically, I mean Eve the character, more or less embarrassing than Katherine walking in when you were cross checking the breasts in Immortality? Like where's the rank on the scale?
I mean, Immortality, because it's kind of odd, you can get away with it.
It's like serious adult nudity for serious adults, where this is like goofy teenage boy nudity for goofy teenage boys.
I wouldn't have been excited by this as a teenage boy. This wouldn't have, I don't think there's any point in my life where this would have been sexy to me, do you know what I mean?
Yeah, okay.
I mean, maybe you disagree, I know, but you know, like.
No, no, I mean, it's not like cup of tea, I don't really, you know, people are into all kinds of stuff, aren't they, I don't know, I don't really like to judge. Very diplomatic answer. I don't know, I try not to be too prudish about these things.
I lean prudish in everything I do, so I, you know, I just try not to air it too much. I mean, there's some stuff where I'm like, oh, that's a bit grim, you know, it's depressing to play this around women in my life, and it's definitely not ideal. But like I say, I think the game does give you an out.
I'm not trying to apologize for it.
Well, the funny thing is, it's like, you know, the suits the side, other than that first cutscene where she lands on the beach or whatever, and like you see her sort of like pop out of the, I don't know, like the sort of landing unit and her babe pod. Her babe pod, yeah, and there's just lots of egregious shots of like arse and, you know, breasts, etc. Like the game doesn't really do that again, at least where I am, like it's never really, it's actually quite like, if you change the character design, like to be just slightly more, I don't know, like slightly less provocative, I guess, I don't think people would even have talked about it.
Like it's, it's narrative is very PG, it's like, and it's presentation is generally very PG. It's almost like it's front loaded. So they were like, in the demo, we'll get the horn dogs on board.
And like the, and the people who were like staking their entire personalities on this on the internet on board. And then the rest of the game, we will just like give that backseat. It's kind of weird.
The fact that it pairs you up with this Adam character, and then you soon get this sort of mechanic sidekick called Lily, who's basically like a teenager, a young adult. And like the three of you kind of behave as quite a respectable family unit. Like this is not a horny game.
I think it was the Polygon review. It was like, it's so incredibly sexless in its storytelling, its characterization, even in its framing, like you say, outside of that. I mean, there's a couple of like executions and takedowns where if you're wearing a saucy costume, you know, you get a bit of an eye fall.
But it's like, I don't really think it really wears, you know, wears that stuff on its sleeve too much. Like, I mean, it's kind of what's hilarious about it, all these kind of, you know, grim characters online, kind of saying we're going to buy it and rub it in the face of all these sort of woke liberals or whatever. And you're like, I'm being our guest, but like, there's really not much in there that upsets most people.
So, you know, have at it, I say.
Yeah, I was kind of similar. I will admit to like, I briefly worried because I did the side quest, we fetch the, there's like a sort of like hairdresser, basically, you fetch this stuff, and then you can customise her hair. And I was a bit paranoid that when I changed her hair colour, that like the game would tarnish me with a trophy that said like, so you like redheads or something like that.
And I just, and that would follow me around forever. But it doesn't, it doesn't do that. Fortunately, it's good in a way because honestly, it feels like that discussion dissipated almost immediately when people realise that's not really what the game is.
And like, what's left is a pretty good third-person game that's got this got some this this pretty polished in some places and slightly less polished in some other places, but definitely like an interesting kind of experiment of lifting different bits and pieces and and seeing what you can build out of that. And like I say, for a first attempt to a big blockbuster game, pretty good. I definitely play whatever they make next, you know, that's for sure.
So, yeah, fair play to shift up, you know, sort of swimsuit outfit aside. And yes, one thing about it that I do think is outstanding is the music. It was I think it's the same outfit that did the Nier Automata music.
So again, lifting. But if you like sort of like sad ladies wailing in like this quite sort of like, I guess depressing kind of way, while like, oh, while like an attractive robot lady runs around the desert and you think I played Nier Automata and that to me is home, I'm all in dog, then this game is for you. Like it definitely sort of like cultivates those vibes in quite a convincing way.
Whether you consider it to be, you know, like copying someone else's homework is up to you. But games do that a lot. I wasn't massively offended by it doing that.
And the end result is still pretty, pretty good. So yeah, anything else to add Matthew as you move on?
No, that sounds about right for Stellar Blade.
Excellent. So why don't you tell me a bit about Animal Well, a game you've been playing?
So this is a Metroidvania, I guess, by a one-man development team called Shared Memory. I feel like it did the rounds maybe as like demos during Steam Fests and caught the eye of some journos. I know Edge went quite heavy on this.
Was picked up by Big Mode, which is the publishing label set up by video game Dunkey of YouTube fame. So it feels like, you know, it's going to be an interesting case study to see if you can kind of like anoint this game and make it a hit. You know, does his popularity as a YouTube creator translate into success as a game publisher?
It's also coming to PS Plus. I think by now it should already be on PS Plus on the game catalogs. If you've got the second tier of PS Plus, you can play this right away.
You play a small blob exploring a subterranean maze in the Metroidvania fashion. You pick up a map and it's all in 2D and it's opening up as you explore it. You are collecting not abilities from what I've played, but items and equipment which you then use to kind of push further into the maze.
If anything, I'd say it maybe has... It's that interesting place where like Metroids intersect with Zelda. You know, there is a lot of crossover there, but it's maybe a bit more 2D Zelda-y in the way that you collect items and that item then dominates a particular area of the map which you could describe as the dungeon for that item.
And then as you get more items, you begin to use them in tandem to push into other parts of the map. Several things I really really dig about this game, but the main one is so far the items have been really unusual. A lot of people tend to borrow the sort of functionality of Link's kind of core equipment, you know, bombs, arrows, hookshot, these things.
There are some sort of standards, you know, in here, just to name a few, because part of the fun is discovering them. The first item I got was a slinky, which when you set it going, it goes down steps and can activate switches. And somehow from that, he spins out this whole kind of area of the dungeon, which revolves around weird uses for this slinky and other mechanics, which work along with the slinky to achieve quite strange things.
There's a yo-yo witch, kind of travels along straight along the edges of surfaces, so you can get it in places you shouldn't be able to go. So you could, if you fling it over the side of a platform, it will cut the physics of it, it will loop back round and then run along the underside of the platform. So all of a sudden you're in like lots of switch puzzles where switches can be in all these kind of mad places.
And again, on top of all that, there's then a lot of strange mechanics and systems which I've not seen in other games like this. So the fact that it is the Animal Well, whatever that means, means that the world is full of these strange animals. Some of them hostile, some of them friends that you can kind of use.
They have behaviors that you can use. So there are these like little kind of Totoro kind of lads who you can kind of coax along and then jump on their heads and use them as impromptu platforms. But for them, it's all about getting them to follow you.
There are like penguins who've got this like belly flop, which can smash ice. So again, about like luring them to the right place where they can do their thing. But then there are like nightmare creatures, which kind of operate as enemies or bosses, which are very, very cursed.
This game does have quite a cursed energy. Like you may be picturing in your head, a cartoon world of animals all having delightful adventures. And it's not that at all.
The whole thing is played out to like these dark synths. It sounds very like the soundtrack to Twin Peaks.
Yeah, I was thinking it looks kind of a little bit linchy as well. Just sort of like, cause it's that strange thing where it's got this quite simple art style on the surface, but some of the effects it use, like lighting and smoke and things like that, are much more modern. And then you have these almost like bizarre projections of animals that are like chasing you, like bending sort of visage of like a cat or like, yeah, some flamingos.
It's a bit linchy in that respect as well.
Yeah. So there is sort of like dreamy or like nightmarish edge to it. And between kind of harnessing these weird animal behaviors and using this interesting equipment, you know, it's, I mean, it's a pretty exceptional kind of version of this kind of game.
I mean, every room has a pretty juicy puzzle in it. A lot of them I've just not seen before. So I'm constantly like, oh yeah, I'll use this.
Or I'll try that. It has a lot of like weird stuff around the edges. There are kind of hidden puzzle rooms which unlock these eggs and it feels like these eggs are leading up to something.
I have the feeling this might be a bit like Fez or The Witness and have something else going on, but I haven't like dug into that or I definitely haven't broken through to that. I'm still doing the core adventure. I'm trying to kind of, you know, you're trying to light up these four central shrines by pushing into the four corners of this maze.
But there are rooms where there are patterns or audio things happening where I'm just like, I know this is something. I know there's like code here or there's some kind of tunic thing going on. Whatever the mechanism is to interact with that level of the game, I have no idea.
When we got review code for this, they created a private discord for reviewers where they sort of suggested people could go there and discuss their progress and discuss secrets because they said, you know, we feel like this is gonna be a game the kind of community is gonna enjoy dissecting together. So we wanna give you that experience like within the review window. So it's kind of one of those games.
It's kind of one of those meta weird, like what you see isn't necessarily what you're getting, but what you do see, what is on the surface is so elegantly designed and playful with its item use. I'm having a whale of a time with it. Like if this was just it, I would recommend this game already for sure.
Like I'm having a great, great time, but the fact that there is gonna be something else and like how weird and fucked up is that thing gonna be? I don't know. I mean, it's like this one guy has been making this game for like six years or something.
So maybe he's just been going crazy and filling it full of like evil curse shit to discover. I've got a flute that might be something. Like that feels like it's quite a, you can kind of manipulate it as a tool and like make lots of different notes with it.
And I'm like, well, this must be a thing. I must be able to play this flute somewhere and something will happen. But yeah, I mean, what those things are, no idea.
But yeah, and you know, speaking to that, that sort of lynching thing you mentioned earlier, like a will flag, like can be quite scary at times. From a scary, from a stress perspective, there's a lot like the big animals are fucking evil as shit. And a lot of them have got like, they look evil.
And then they do something which is extra creepy on top. So I went into this room where there was this big ostrich and it was like slam its head down when it saw me, like to try and get me. And I'd be like, well, okay, well, there's these small holes in the ground, which I can hide in.
And if you go into those holes, there are then these snaking platforms under the ground. But the ostrich started putting its head down the holes and then its head and neck would snake through the gaps after me, like a big worm. And it would make this horrible sound, like as it was going through.
And it's, there's a lot of that stuff in the game. There's a lot of, oh God, why is that dog doing that? You know, there's this like ghost fox, which I think is like the main image they use to kind of promote this game, like this white fox dog wolf creature.
And there's quite an extended sequence of that thing chasing you around while you try and solve puzzles. That is, that was pretty hellish. I had to put that off into playing that in the morning when I just couldn't, I didn't want to replay it at night just because it was, yeah, very anxiety-inducing.
But yeah, I feel like that isn't a negative, that's still a plus to this game.
I mean, I am so fucking sold by your description of it. So this was first put on my radar, I think by Chris Schilling for Edge. I think I've come to depend on Edge for curating the indie games I check out in a given year.
Like I think, I see what a lot of people do as well because I think sites kind of struggle to see what the big things are coming. Whereas I feel like Edge don't necessarily identify, only identify the biggest things. They try and curate smaller things you might have missed.
Yeah, the first time I heard about this is about a month and a half ago because of Edge. And so I didn't really know that all of this is in it. In screenshot form, it's actually like, it makes no sense.
You have to see it moving, I would say, because I was just looking at the screens that are on Steam, as Matthew was describing this. I was like, I don't really see it. I just see a little blob thing and then like these quite low res environments.
And then you watch it in motion and you see the animations like the lighting and stuff and how fucking evil the creatures look, as Matthew says. And you get what it is they're going for. Do you think this will run well on Switch?
Because in some ways, I do want to play it on Switch, even though the little blob you play is very, very tiny. So I don't know if I'll be able to see it, maybe as much as I should.
But I don't know. I mean, you know, reviews will be out, I think, just before this this episode. So I'm sure if it is like a hardware disaster, Nintendo people will will quickly flag that.
I played it on PS5 and a bit on PC. And, you know, it runs on those, obviously, without trouble. So, yeah, really good too.
They did the review session like really well. They gave it to us like a month ago. Wow.
And, yeah, so a month. And they had that special Discord set up. I don't know, like to try and replicate, like, how this game is going to feel in the wild.
I thought that was that was pretty neat, pretty smart.
Yeah.
So well done. Too big mode.
Yes. So, yeah, like you say, it's a bit of the kind of like under-tail-y kind of like Hollow Knight, long-tail people talking about it thing.
There's no, there's very little combat in it, I would say. Like, what combat is more, you can pick up these like firecrackers, which sort of scare off little ghosts. You know, most of it is kind of how do you solve this, how do you solve this animal encounter rather than like you're going to fight this thing.
Like, it's quite difficult within that. Like some of the puzzles are quite hard and there's some quite fiddly platforming in it. Sometimes you have to do it, like I say, in quite stressful circumstances.
But it's, I wouldn't be like scared off by the sense of like, you know, it's not like a hollow night in terms of difficulty or anything like that.
Hmm, interesting. And it's just going to be on PS Plus, you say?
Yeah, yeah. In the game catalog for extra people, so.
Oh, extra people, okay. That's not, I'm not on that one, dog, so.
I'm so extra, so I have it.
I'll just go buy instead, that's fine. It's 20 quid. Okay, interesting.
This has been quite a big year for Metroidvanias already. I mean, we're four months in, basically, and there's been Prince of Persia, there's been Ultros, which people tell me is really good. I saw a bunch of people flagging that as one of the best of the year, so I've got to go check that out at some point.
Art by the Hotline Miami guy. There's that Tales of Kinsera game, which didn't seem to get loads and loads of critical adoration, even though people seemed to appreciate what it was going for thematically and in terms of its art and stuff like that. It's funny because I remember a few, I think maybe even two years ago on this podcast, I said, I don't know if a 2D side-scrolling game can really get my blood pumping creatively.
I think I was maybe making a point about how 2D platformers were maybe not that interesting to me anymore, but I feel like I had a turnaround with this playing Metroid Dread and ever since then I've been seeking these things out a little bit more. And it does seem like these are, Jay Bayless, a friend of the pod, made a point to me that maybe these are slightly easier types of games to make if you don't have loads and loads of resources. So that's one reason they're appealing to developers.
And also there's just a really high ceiling to how good they can be. And yeah, it just seems like there's more and more of these all the time and they all seem to be pretty good. So yeah, good suggestion, Matthew.
So, okay. My next game then is Pepper Grinder, which released about a month and a half ago. This is a platforming game published by Devolver Digital.
I didn't write down the name of the developer. Ah, Ek and MP2 Games. Those are the developers.
And it is, yeah, like a 2D platformer where you play a little pirate lady with a drill and you just go around with this drill, grinding through environments, as in like, sort of basically like you'll see a hard, you'll see like a sandy surface and you'll kind of cut through it. And then you'll basically snake through that environment nonstop, just holding down the analog stick to direct where she moves essentially. So you'll kind of like pop out of one surface, go straight into another, that sort of thing.
And I guess like the sort of momentum based play of it might remind you something like, something like Knights Into Dreams, I guess. It's a little bit of a spiritual successor to Drill Dozer, a Game Boy Advance game. It's not totally the same thing, but it's kind of like in that you play a little girl with like a big drill robot thing.
There's some similarities there. But yeah, you're basically snaking through these environments, collecting these coins, fighting these sort of like little goblin enemies. And sort of like, it has a certain, there's quite a lot of skill to it because you're asked to navigate through some quite precise tunnels with your drill.
So you'll just have to like basically just snake through past like obstacles and explosions and that sort of thing while collecting these coins. And if you miss a coin, you might have to go back in and you risk being damaged. It's like it's challenging, but not overly challenging, I would say.
And I think what's great about it is I think I thought there was not that much creative potential to this idea. Having played the first world, I was a bit like, well, this is cool. Like it feels good to drill through an environment and that sort of thing.
When you reach the surface of an area, you can like press the jump button and she'll do a little boost with her drill. And that will like give you a bit of momentum to maybe like power across the environment or jump through to like the next surface that you're drilling through, that sort of thing. So you're kind of like constantly moving.
But the level ideas get better and better as it goes. It has, someone also pointed out there's a little bit of like Echo the Dolphin inspiration to the movement. I can kind of see that.
And one of the bonus levels you can unlock is actually like a clear homage to Echo the Dolphin. So you'll just start in the water and there'll be that kind of like breezy calm before the storm music that kicks in. And then you'll be drilling past sharks and things like that and collecting your collectibles from little floating jellyfish and stuff.
Why didn't they think of a giant drill in Jaws? Think of all the trouble they could have solved if they just brought a bigger drill instead of a bigger boat.
Or indeed in Echo the Dolphin, if they just strapped a drill to his head, then he could have just fucked up those aliens.
Echo the Dolphin with his famous drilling hat.
Yeah, so there's other stuff that she can do. So while most of the time you will be just drilling through sandy or icy surfaces or things like that, you can also stick the drill into different items to give you temporary powers. So there's a drill-powered snowmobile that you get.
So you just hop on and then you can just ride that across one of the icy, an icy environment that's deeper into the game. There's a Gatling gun that the drill plugs into. There's this little key thing that you plug into in order to unlock a certain part of the environment, that sort of thing.
And in general, I think it just finds lots of inventive ways to kind of keep things going. Like the core sort of like drilling through a surface and then popping out the other side remains at its heart and never really gets like much more complex, even though some of the platforming puzzles do get tricky. But just, I think just to kind of like almost Nintendo like invention of like, right, okay, we're giving you this drill.
What are the cool different applications we can do with this? How can we surprise you with set pieces? There's one level where you're going up an avalanche and you're basically drilling through different bits of falling snow as they come down.
So it's like, yeah, like this kind of like reverse fall, basically, where you're just popping up between random bits of snow that are coming down. That's really, really cool. It's if you wanna make it a little bit easier on yourself, there's a little shop you can go to, you can get temporary bits of health if you spend a bit of currency, so you can bring the difficulty sitting down a little bit.
It's got really nice like 2D art in some ways, Matthew. Maybe think about how, remember how like the early days of Nintendo Switch, the Switch could be a real kingmaker with indie games, and then there's a time where that just stopped happening, I think. Like either it just became too saturated, or maybe the hardware couldn't keep up with modern games as much, but it feels like that was, there was definitely an era where that was happening, and maybe that's kind of subsided, but this feels like a throwback to that.
There's quite a lot of Wii Store shenanigans on Switch, I think.
Right.
Because if you can get it into certain, you know, like there's always kind of tricks, which is why people sell games for like 20p, and there's always, like, the algorithm of the Wii Store is a bit fucked, isn't it? Isn't that the sort of gist of it, I think? So maybe it's just a bit of a rough ground, where if you actually release something decent, it's kind of hard for it to sort of take seed at the moment, which is a shame.
Does this have a time trial element? Because it strikes me as the kind of game which looks like, you know, it's all about, like, it could be about hitting flow state and just acing it all in one.
That is, that's definitely part of it, but the first time you play through it, it doesn't have that to it. It lets you take your time, but if you replay a level, you're given the option to basically do the casual play or time trial version of that level. It also has a tiny bit of Mario in the sense that it has, like, hidden coins throughout the level, and collecting those is how you unlock the bonus levels I was describing, which, like I say, like house this one per world, and they house some of the best ideas of the game.
They're just really, really, really something. They're well worth searching out. But yeah, I make the switch point because I feel like this is the kind of game that if it released in 2017 would have been like, oh, you've got to play this on your Switch, just like how, I don't know, like, Golf Story came along, and people were like, you've got to play Golf Story, and like, there was a whole era like that with the Switch, and then it just, for whatever reason, just was no longer the case, and now I think that PC has become the kingmaker of Indies again, you know?
It kind of like passed the baton to Switch, then I think it's gone back to PC, when you look at how, you know, like, obviously, like, Power World would never run on a Switch, but things like Bellatro as well, Bellatro really took off on Steam, and, you know, Steam is just still really good for spreading the word on this stuff. This feels like it's gone a little bit unrecognized. It's got, like, sevens and eights from Outlet, so I think I would lean towards an eight.
I think it's really, really good, and I think I really went into it thinking, this is gonna be a seven, and how much can you really do with just drilling through an environment? And when it was compared to Nikes, I thought, well, Matthew will fucking hate that, so.
No, I can see where you're coming from, because it's, like, moving through dirt is, you know, a bit like swimming or flying. You know, it's three-dimensional movement in a substance of some kind, and I get that. I've played a couple of levels of this in a demo when Devolve will pop around with a demo a few months ago and definitely liked it, and it reminded me of, like, other games have done this drilling mechanic, not for a whole game.
The second Ori game, Will of the Wisps, had one of his upgrades was the drilling power, but it only got used in, like, one area where there was a lot of dirt to drill through, and, you know, while I hate to give this guy kudos, Sonic, in some of his 3D games, the, I think, Lost World had a drill power-up, and it had, like, two levels, which were basically this game, like, drilling through it, and, you know, you could have, like, full movement. Mario's done drill powers as well, but not in the same way, like, drill Mario in Galaxy just kind of went through things, you know? It wasn't about the joy of swimming in dirt.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I think the idea of building a whole game around this, but also not going too overboard, like I think this is, I think there are four worlds in this and I'm at the end of the third world, so I've nearly finished it, and it's taken me basically a morning of my bank holiday to get that far, but it seems perfectly formed around that idea to me. It's sort of like, it's the thing of like, they've demonstrated both ambition and restraint in the same package, which I don't mind.
It seems like it's destined to be a, you pick it up for around 10 quid in a sale kind of game, and then people discover it down the line and go, oh, did you ever play this? It's a pretty cool thing. So yeah, I like it.
It's again, like this side scrolling 2D games. It just seems to be a ridiculously creative space these days. It just seems to be, a lot of this stuff is happening for whatever reason.
So yeah, Pepper Grinder, I do recommend it, Matthew. So we come to your last game of the episode, Octopath Traveler 2. So how did you end up diving into this series?
Have you played the first one before this?
No, I played a little bit on Steam when it came out. Octopath Traveler gets quite a rough ride in this house. Catherine's really down on it.
And she's not down on a lot of things, but she really, I remember her playing the first one for what felt like weeks, months, and just having a really frustrating time with it. And then the same happened with the second one. So all this time I've been like, well, I trust Catherine, I've got other things to play.
I can't really say what changed. I had a code for it and thought, oh, I should give this a go. I've been playing it on PS5.
And yeah, I think I hadn't really given like a proper go to a lot of the newer RPGs. I'd just finished Stellar Blade and I wanted something to kind of pile a bit of time into. And I thought, well, let's, you know, shall I do like, you know, shall I play a live a live, live a live, or, you know, do you go as far back as like a Bravely Default, that kind of type of game.
And I thought, well, I've got this one here. Rob Pearson at work speaks very highly of it, says it's got an absolutely banging soundtrack. So I thought I'd give it a go.
How familiar are you with Octopath Traveler as a concept?
So I played the first one, I bought on Switch, and I did think it was very trad and couldn't quite get my head around it. I thought it looked amazing. And it's got eight different characters whose stories kind of play out simultaneously.
You can switch between them, is that right?
Yeah, so I don't know if that means that it frontloads itself with lots of excitement and surprises. And maybe I'm still in the honeymoon period with this because I've just unlocked the eight different characters. And so my experience so far has been every two hours, another character comes in and you go off and do their side stories, like eight origin stories.
And then they all have threads that you follow through the game, but they also kind of unite as a party and walk around solving other problems and dungeons and whatnot. But the kind of fundamental aim of the game is to grind up these eight individual characters so that you can see all of their individual stories, their conclusion, and then the ultimate conclusion to the story, which brings them all together. Like the big criticism of it from Catherine, at least, is that that involves like a lot of grinding, a lot of resetting, a lot of like, you prefer certain characters, you spend loads of time with them, and it basically locks off the end, but behind a massive grind, because you need everyone to be, to kind of have their shit together.
But at the other end of the game, at the outset, you're finding out who everyone is, what their weird little powers are, due to the fact that these stories take place across this kind of continent, it's pulling you to every corner of the map quite quickly. It really is like the best of this game all at once. It does maybe have that weirdness in that each one is sort of designed to teach you the game, because any of them could be the first campaign that you start playing.
So they all have quite a similar structure or kind of power curve to them. You know, like there's a few bosses, there's a few enemy encounters, and then like some talking and then a boss fight. And during that boss fight, you unlock your latent power, which is like an extra special kind of character specific skill you have.
But what I do like about it is, I think the combat system is like, it's quite pure, but it's like really punchy. You know, it isn't trying to do too much with the kind of old school JRPG turn-based battling, but it is made like very much in, you know, 2023 or whenever it was it came out. So it moves really fast.
The animations are really like snazzy. It has a kind of a weakness system where if you kind of break someone's weakness, you can stun them for a turn. So a lot of it is about like juggling different moves to basically prevent enemies from ever really having a go.
You can power up your characters to have an extra strong attack. And the longer they don't use that, the more of that power they generate over turns. So then they can channel it into like one massive attack.
And you begin to get powers which let you kind of pass that. I think they're, are they Bravely points? No, that's Bravely default.
It's something that whatever those points are, you can, you begin to get powers which let you kind of move them between allies and stuff so you can set stuff up. And that's, that's really punchy and fun. I can already see that there's going to be a lot of like fun, like multi-class stuff that you can do because all the characters have like specific skills which are kind of true to them.
But then the jobs they have kind of changed the moves as well. And I quite like, you know, I really got into that stuff mainly through Xenoblade 3 actually, with its, with its like micro job system. And I'm quite hungry for that.
It probably seems incredibly tired to anyone who's grown up playing loads of these games, which I didn't. But to me, the idea of like that kind of weird sort of micromanaging and trying to kind of turn everyone into an absolute kind of sort of synergy demon, like that still really speaks to me. Is that a thing you're into or are you just like, have you just seen it all before?
No, I do like that sort of thing. I think in some ways that most of the stimulation I get from a Japanese RPG comes in the combat experience itself and whether I feel like that's fresh. I mean, one of the reasons I don't get on massively with Dragon Quest is because everything about it is trad by design.
And so that, even with the best presentation in the world, which Dragon Quest does have, never really gets me excited. But I don't know, it's sort of like if you turn a few dials like that, I mean, I could see myself getting into it, but I will say that the first Octopath Traveler didn't make an amazing impression. But I did read a lot of people saying that this one was a better experience.
So I don't know, the fact that you're playing it standalone makes me wonder if maybe I should give it a try. I've got it on Switch, so I don't know.
The stories are fun. You know, I can say I don't really remember what the characters' deals were in the first one, but already I've got this Wild West guy, a kind of an ancient sort of samurai warrior, kind of a mad scientist who has this big kind of jailbreak story going on, a character who can kind of, she can kind of tame animals. So she has this whole kind of animal taming mechanic on top of her regular combat.
And interesting.
Yeah, like I feel like, you know, I can't speak to the first one, but they're definitely doing interesting things with the characters here. They, one thing I really love about it is they all have a bespoke NPC interaction, but they've got a different one in day and night. And I don't know if this was true of the first game, but like, there's a character who's like a merchant and he can barter with people in the day.
So any NPC, any named NPC can go up to them and buy stuff they have. So they may just have all this random shit in their pockets where like another person can thief off people so they can go up to that same person to steal stuff instead of buy it off them. But then some of the powers are quite strange.
So the merchant at night can enlist people. So they basically become his helper in combat. He can employ people to join the party.
So you just have these like random NPCs from whichever village you've been to are just following you around and are basically like elevated to regular party member. And it's just some bloke who you met in a bar and he's like, oh yeah, I'm like a level two, like minor. And you're like, sure, come along for the ride.
Here, have 200 gold. That's quite funny. And there's the prince.
Yeah, like samurai prince character. His NPC power is that he can challenge any NPC to a duel, which he means he then fights them one on one in the turn-based combat system. But that can be like any random shopkeeper or just anyone with a line of dialogue.
So you're like walking through a town, they're like, oh, you know, beautiful day, isn't it, mister? And you're like, you, duel, now. You just absolutely destroy them with your massive sword.
And then they're kind of lying dazed on the floor. Like, I'm sure there are some uses for that, but it's just really funny that this character is misusing his power in this way.
So you can just go to a village and basically clear them all out doing that. And they'd all be dazed. Is that the kind of, how much have you tried to bend that?
It makes a distinction between NPCs with dialogue and there are some who are just standing around, but they won't pass judgment or comment on it. It won't be like, what are you doing? You've knocked out everyone in the village.
I just like that based on the makeup of party, you have this sort of verb sheet that you can use on NPCs. Some of them are nice, some of them are horrible. And yeah, that's good.
That's just the dumb kind of shit I respond to.
That's clever, yeah. I'm kind of curious to hear about what the end game is like when it all converges. Because it seems like that is the big reward they're marching you towards, right?
So do you have any notion of where it's going?
No, only that there is a horrible grot. Everyone has to be up for the fight. So I think the game is, there's a big part of it is juggling your party to make sure everyone's like leveling up equally.
You know, the temptation is always to stick with your favorite characters. And I think this forces you to, I don't know if there's like some like XP share technique or something where everyone can level up in tandem, but I don't get the feeling there is from what I've read about it.
Is there a bad hang among them, Matthew? Is there anyone who you're like, I dread spending time with this person.
Oh, there's, I mean, so I'm only in the early stages of all their stories. There's like a nurse who's a bit of a bad hang. Her whole thing is, her like NPC interaction is like heal people, but when she heals them, they're kind of put to bed afterwards.
So that's her kind of equivalent of knocking them out is that they're kind of resting from her healing them, which is a bit suspicious. She's just a bit like noble, you know, just sort of neutral good kind of character. Like not very, there's nothing, there's no spice to her.
Like isn't naturally something I'd kind of go for in my party, like kind of mad animalistic. Like I quite like in RPGs in general, I'm often drawn to like, you know, crafty, intelligent or like erudite characters, you know, like I like, you know, foppish assassins and wizards and all this kind of stuff. So the idea of like, I'm a barbarian kind of beast girl is like very far from what I would normally go for.
But like, she's well written enough, you know. My party's like the merchant, the prison escape scientist, that kind of stuff. It's all very, it's like the grownups, you know?
I want the grownups in the room together.
Oh damn, it's amazing you've ever got through a father fantasy game if you enjoy grownups in your party.
Yeah, well if there's no grownups, then you're like, okay, I'll just accept what there is. But if there is an option, you know, I will go for it. I won't talk about it at any kind of length here.
I've started replaying Dragon Age Inquisition again, and like just remembering like all the party members in that as I encounter them. And actually there, I'm quite torn. Like I like a lot of them, and I kind of want to spend time with a lot of them.
So it's not as easy as it is in Octopath Traveler 2 to kind of cull the kind of the boring children.
That's a game that rewards you with NPC dialogue. Sorry, a companion dialogue interaction, isn't it? That is the reward for taking them with you.
It's not even necessarily the combat abilities. It's here and they talk to each other, which is quite an amazing thing to pull off. It's one of the real magic tricks of Inquisition that RPGs don't have really.
Interesting, yeah. I think you made quite a good choice here. I mean, I played Live Alive a little bit, and I thought it was a kind of cool curio to resurrect, but I didn't think the couple of stories I tried of it with that were particularly outstanding.
They were just nice settings, but not really much meat on the bone. So this is probably a bit more contemporized, bit more sort of relevant to today's players, I guess.
I don't know if it has a direct relation to it, because you can see the through line from Live Alive to this. It's definitely tapping into the same thing. And while Live Alive has quite bespoke things going on for different characters, this is, everyone is filtered through sort of fundamentally the same battle system.
But it's good. And in the back, the crucial thing is the battle theme absolutely bangs in this. So every time it happens, you're like, well, great, I'm into this.
And the boss, the music in general is exceptional. It's doing a lot of heavy lifting, I think.
Yeah, yeah, well, that's so often the case of this genre, isn't it? Interesting. Okay, cool.
Yeah, so I did pick this up when it was like 20 quid or something on Amazon. So I've got it sat there, but never quite figured out should I play the first one before I play this one. But would you like some interesting trivia, Matthew?
So when I worked on PC Gamer, one of the character designers on Octopath Traveler designed me as a little sprite man. And it was, you really couldn't tell it was me. It was clearly based on one photo I had on Instagram of me at a wedding, wearing a white shirt.
And I think like the Scranix PR at the time had told them, oh, he likes craft beer, so I'm holding a beer. And it doesn't really look like me otherwise, but I will, if people are curious, I'll post it in the chat thing, but yeah.
What would your NPC interaction be, both in night and day?
Hold Scrudge, just that would be fine. That was the weird thing about the Stu episode actually, was hearing you explain to a best-selling author about how your podcast co-host is always getting into grudges with people, that was quite a funny thing to sort of like, I was like, oh, it's weird that he knows that now.
I hope I didn't misrepresent you.
No, I think that's probably, it's pretty accurate, but I was like, it's just quite weird to hear you explain that to a best-selling author, I was like, who doesn't know who I am? So that was quite-
Well, that's how at ease I was. I just opened up. He could be a good interrogator if this author act doesn't work out.
So at ease, in fact, that you were caught by numerous listeners at Rust and Gorenny at the 53-minute mark.
I really cut out the worst of it as well.
I will also say, be doing this episode, you have completely Animal Well-pilled me, totally. I've got to play this fucking game now. You've really planted the seed there of like, I've got to see what the deal is with this thing.
Being well-pilled.
Indeed, indeed. Okay, so my last game of the episode, the depressingly predictable Star Wars Dark Forces Remaster. It was May the 4th this last weekend.
I don't really recognize Star Wars based holidays, but I did buy this because it was under 20 quid for the first time and I decided that was the right price for this, so it is a very nice night dive studios redo of the 1995 shooter. It was kind of doom like, but distinctive in a few different ways. You could look up and down.
Don't make fun, you were there. You know what it was like. Yeah, I liked it at the time, but I've talked about this.
I mean, Star Wars games have ambushed the lists with this like three times now, I think, or at least a couple of times, but I was big into these games where dad had Dark Forces on PC, we had this and X-Wing, they were our first two Windows games that we owned. And we played the first couple of levels, thought this is fun, shooting a bunch of storm troopers at these quite grainy visuals, but the atmosphere is just spot on, kind of playing this slightly Han Solo-ish character called Carl Catan, sort of like a smuggler, sort of mercenary guy, and then went into the sewer level in the third level of the game and never ever came out. We never progressed past that level.
We never saw what was beyond that level. To explain why this sewer level was kind of a nightmare, so basically you're placed in this sort of like series of white rooms. You go into one white room that has this like brown sludge kind of water surrounding you, and there's like a switch for four different gates that kind of like are basically like, there's like a gate in the water itself, four different gates surrounding you, and the switch will activate one of the gates at a time.
And what you have to basically do is go into each of these gates, find a switch in the kind of like series of tunnels that follow, hit the switch, and like raise the like brown water level in this one room. And then once you cycle back to the first, no, I think it's the second gate, you'll go into an area that when the water level is right, you can finally progress and finish the level. And it is so complicated, because you're basically in dark tunnels trying to figure this out.
And like I only was able to finish it this time because I knew what the actual like intent behind the level design was. But it's ridiculously complicated. No one without a walkthrough would have surely would have just like finished this within like without days of experimentation.
Certainly me and my dad didn't have enough fucking IQ to figure it out. So that was quite satisfying. So I've been playing the levels beyond that and they are pretty good.
It's sort of like, you kind of know what the ceiling is of what you can achieve with this kind of generation of first person shooter. It's only ever going to do so much in terms of set pieces, but it does have good sort of like Star Wars vibes. It's got like platforming bits where you're jumping between like bits of glacier and things like that.
I'm now on a level that I would describe as like piss filtered level, kind of like sort of slightly slightly like orangey sort of yellowy level. But yeah. I think it's just I spent by I just spent a comically large number of hours in that level.
And now know it like the back of my hands. Now I'm like, it's almost like home now. I'm like, oh yeah, it's the there's like five dienogas in this room.
And then these just like poo monsters to start attacking you and just like fucking, we'll just get through this and kind of like progress. But I will say the remaster is really, really nice. It's sort of like more work.
I think it's gone into the environments than the characters. Like it, instead of having that sort of like parallax-y 2D, 3D effects, they just feel like you're going through 3D corridors. And then they've kept like the enemies as sprites basically.
So they are sort of like 2D, but it's really nicely presented, really slick, really fast, really nicely calibrated for two sticks. I think they've done a great job with it. Someone on a Discord was saying that, oh, the community's already done X, Y and Z with it.
But like the community also hasn't put this on Switch and PS5 and you know what I mean? Like all that stuff that just makes it easier for modern audiences to access. This was kind of like a bit more of a, you go play out on GOG if you really want to check it out.
But now it's just so readily available. It's pretty cool.
They should have done an Easter egg in the sewer levels where you find a room and it's just full of skeletons of older carcatans.
Oh, it's just like a sprite of me and my dad just in there, just like unable to leave.
Your dad mournfully playing the oboe.
I will say, I sent him pictures of the level. I was just hoping to get a bit more of an emotional response out of him, but he was a bit like, oh, that's good, I'll check out when I'm home. And then he sent me a picture of some, I think he's in Croatia, of some rubber ducks dressed like Batman.
And I was just like, he was completely nonplussed. And he was just like, but look what I found. Here's some ducks that look like Batman.
So confusing, so a complex man.
I went to see Frank Skinner last night in Bath. It was excellent. It was really good.
And I thought, my dad is going to see him also on his tour. So I sent him a text message saying like how good it was, because you're going to see him later. That'll be exciting.
And I got back a very uninvested, very nice.
Just a bit of their generation. They just don't want to talk about their feelings, Matthew.
Their feelings about Frank Skinner or the Sewell level from Dark Forces. They don't want to talk about the things we want to talk about.
Yeah, they're like, it's almost like my dad's like, sorry that you're suffering from arrested development and cannot progress past this level that you played 25 years ago.
I just wish I could like, you know, if I could authentically like send a text message about cricket or something, I know that would just like, that would like make his day, make his year, but I just can't do it.
I've never really found that area with my dad because he's a very sort of like practically minded person. Like I think if I engaged him on Sharp or like the novels of Bernard Cornwell, he'd be like, fucking yeah, let's go. I've got loads to say, but or World War II, you know, if I asked him about, or what do you think they did right or wrong at the Battle of the Bulge or whatever?
What do you think they did right or wrong in World War II? What a broad, broad question.
We've just described the premise of Hearts of Iron IV. That's a very successful game. People are very interested in the what ifs of World War II anyway.
I think he'd be bang up for that, but yeah, I don't know. I think he's just moved on from Dark Forces. I was hoping to coax him into buying the Switch version so he could have a brief conversation about it at Christmas, but I don't know, man.
I don't think it's gonna happen.
You should get him onto Shard Lake on Disney Plus.
Oh, because it's got Sean Bean in it.
Yeah, well, that's the Medi... That's classic, like, dad stuff. It's very pentament.
It's monk murders in a monastery and a medieval lawyer investigating. That's classic. Classic dad fare.
That sounds pretty good, to be honest. Maybe we'll check that out. He did watch all of Shogun, actually.
So, yeah, I can engage him. Maybe I'll send him the XXL pod we did and see what he thinks of the seppuku section at the end, Matthew. That was very deranged podcasting.
I've been sitting on a, sorry to keep dragging this out, I've been sitting on a tweet about, you know all this diss track stuff that's been going on?
I've been sitting on a tweet. It's such a great setup for a...
I don't know if it's right on. I don't know, not offensive or anything, but if it actually makes sense. I was trying to, I got sick of all this diss track stuff this weekend.
I can't think of anything more boring than these two grown men writing nasty songs about each other.
That's the lamest thing I've ever heard. I was like, who cares?
But I wanted to sort of undermine it by with some kind of comment about, do you think in Shogun, Mariko's Hayakus, like if any of them could be interpreted as like they're good like burns on people, like if they could be described as this Hayakus, this is the tweet I've been sitting on.
I can see you've got about 60% there. And then you've decided to workshop the rest of it on the pod.
And I respect that. I just don't think it's quite right though. I don't think she does a Hayaku and everyone's like, oh shit.
Like Mariko's absolutely destroyed that person.
Wouldn't want to be Buntaro right now. You know what I mean? It's not like that kind of thing.
It's more subtle than that. Like she definitely undermines people with her poetry, but it's never like, oh my God, that person was destroyed. So that's why I haven't gone live with that tweet.
It's been sitting in my drafts. I keep coming back to it thinking, I love the phrase, Dishaiku, and Mariko's Dishaiku, but I don't know if it actually captures the character of what she does in that show.
Yeah, I think the moment's passed on Shogun as well. Like it's, you know, it's sort of like, people are still sharing Shogun memes, and I'm a bit like, I don't know, dog.
I think we kind of, I think the, you know, I'd say this is less a Shogun meme and more of a diss track meme.
Yeah, but that sort of feels like that will be over in like a week, and something else will happen. Yeah, I hope so. I was a bit, yeah, like you, I was a bit like, I don't really get this.
I mean, to the point where I even Googled, like, does, to see if anyone else had had this observation. I was like, Ruriko sick burn haiku, and Ruriko dis haiku, and I got absolutely fuck all back from that.
I mean, amazing. I mean, I love that you've been trying to make this happen. I mean, we're already at Bank Holiday Monday.
I think the moment's passed on the tweet, but it will be forever immortalized as a great pod bit. You know, you're discussing this.
I just wanted to know, like, that's something I was up to this weekend. I just wanted to give you an insight into what my life is like. A hand wringing about whether my tweet was accurate to the psychology of Ruriko.
Nice. And sort of like, and Frank Skinner, what would you give them out of five, Matthew?
Four out of five.
Pretty solid. So is that higher or lower than the big Sainsbury's in town? I can't remember.
Oh, well, I wouldn't want to review a person like I'd review a shot. I don't think Frank Skinner appears on Google Maps because I think it sets the false idea that he's always going to be there and he isn't. He was there one night.
Yeah, that's true.
I don't think you can find Frank Skinner down an alley doing four out of five comedy.
Yeah, fair enough. Lots to think about there then. Okay, well, so this was, but this is quite a fun What We've Been Playing episode, Matthew, I enjoy talking about these things with you.
I think we kind of like, I like that we sort of landed, sort of not lukewarm on Stellar Blade, but sort of like, good, like one thumb up for Stellar Blade. And I think that's good. You completely Animal Well-pilled me and I need to play that game.
So I'm gonna go pre-order that after this episode. And you had to endure me talking about Star Wars game, yet again. I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed it, I liked it. We got to talk about dads, you know.
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, we've got a pretty exciting month coming up on the pod. I guess when you're listening to this, we're almost halfway through.
We're doing a game soundtracks draft this month. So look forward to that. We are interviewing someone who used to work in the US.
Video Games Magazine scene as well. That's coming at the end of the month. That should be good.
And for people who back us on patreon.com/backpagepod, we've got the Dreamcast Roulette episode, like I say, coming up on Tuesday. And then we have at the end of the month, Mad Max movies ranked, including Furiosa, which is out this month. So quite a lot going on, but should be a good one.
And then some more exciting stuff planned further afield as well. I will tease that we're doing a first-person shooter draft in June. So you can look forward to that.
Two drafts in one month. Some might say it's overkill, but I don't know. Been a little while since we've done a draft now.
I think we can get away with that. But Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I am mrbazzle underscore pesto on Twitter and mrbazzle pesto no underscore on blue sky.
And yep, to our blue sky, sort of like readers, I guess, or followers on blue sky, whatever, slash back page pod. I will apologize for maybe missing a couple of weeks worth of episodes on there. That's my bad.
I'll try my best to keep on top of it. And we're back page pod on Twitter as well, if you want to follow us on there. And I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on both platforms. But thank you so much for listening. I'll be back next week.
