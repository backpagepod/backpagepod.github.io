Hello and welcome to the back page of video games podcast. Wait, the XXL version of the backpage of Video Games Podcast. That's right. It is. Behind the paywall. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by the mighty Matthew Castle.

Matthew
00:32
Hello.

Samuel
00:33
Hello, Matthew. So the draft episode, I won by a tiny bit, and I wanted to posit to you that the readers took piti the listeners took pity on me, and that's why I won.

Matthew
00:44
Oh well I I wouldn't undermine your own victory like that. Just J just tell yourself you won for the the normal reasons people win. They pick the better selection of games.

Samuel
00:54
Yeah, I I felt like there was a a certain amount of uh th your guy needed a win, um, about the whole thing. Um, you know, I won't I will take the victory for sure. I was happy to take it. I sort of um 'cause I d at first you were quite far ahead and then I sort of pulled it back and then it stayed level for ages and then I just sort of dribbled over the finish line.

Matthew
01:14
So um yeah, it was uh I would be and I'm not I'm not accusing you of anything here, but I would be interested to see what happened in that poll. If we both agreed that neither of us were going to pass any comment on the current state of the poll, which I think I'm quite good at. Like I think if you go back, you'll see that I really didn't weigh in at all on this one 'cause I just wanted to see how it how it went. Uh where I I think you are, you know, and this isn't against the rules, but you are m you are more uh scampoolish.

Samuel
01:47
I'm out there campaigning, you know. I'm sort of knocking on doors, knocking on doors, kissing babies. Uh well I just sort of s sit back and and see what happens. I've got my big scissors as I open the town hall. That's me basically um in there. Yeah, it's true, but I think that backfires more often than not, because I just seem like the petulant little baby that I am. Um so that that doesn't always work in my favour, at least. Not this time. It didn't buy fire. No, I did think you might win just ca I thought Prey and Dead Space were very good picks. I think Prey was the ultimate pick in that draft in some ways, so You know, but Deus X MGS5, I did hope people would see that. No one seems to care about Rogue Leader, which is a bit of a bummer.

Matthew
02:22
Yeah, I think that's that's one for us. Um there was an interesting thing. Um you've definitely seen this, but someone collated games which have been picked multiple times and how many times they were in the winning draft and it was interesting to see that there were a couple of games which we both went to bat for several times but seems to have no impact on the outcome.

Samuel
02:44
Yes, interesting. I think the most egregious one was probably the Simpsons hit and run, wasn't it? Um that's didn't that lo didn't that lose three times on the trot? I think it that's a huge bust. Yeah, I don't think I don't think I even like that game. I think I I've never finished it and I found it very aggravating. So maybe I'm just that maybe that is an example of pandering that just simply doesn't work, you know? Or w it's just

Matthew
03:06
A couple of ye the the audience for it is just a couple of years younger than our audience.

Samuel
03:11
Yeah, that's possible, actually. Yeah, you're right, because our audience I think our audience are all about our age or maybe five to ten years older. So I think that's sort of the um sort of what we're going for there. And yes, it didn't work, but you know, pandering with Time Splitters 2 worked again. I vow that I vow that that's gonna be the last draft that I picked time split as two in, Matthew, because I think it we we should have like an un undraftables list of like games that have been picked too many times and we're all fucking sick of hearing about them. And like they're not like the peak games, but they're the sort of They're the sort of cynical games. I would definitely put to I'd say both times Splitters and the Simpsons are in that in that bracket, but uh I'm sure there are more. Um I saw a uh it was uh I was I was reading an angry op-ed this week and I I read a rare good point. This is in relation to Roguelita, by the way. I I read a rare sort of like good point within this angry op-ed that pointed out it's basically talking about how Ubisoft's uh sort of like where they find themselves in terms of not being at their you know commercial peak is their own fault. And they made the point that they said that I think they said something about how the license for Star Wars had entered Choppy Waters when Star Wars Outlaws came out. And then they made the very good point then, why why are people playing Star Wars Battlefront 2 on mass then? On uh on Steam? And that was such a good point. That that sort of um underlined to me that yeah, it's really the So really the type of game was probably wrong for the moment as opposed to the actual game itself.

Matthew
04:39
Also st the the new Star Wars Battlefront 2 was always good, so don't get me started on that bullshit.

Samuel
04:47
Um, okay, so this episode then, uh very much inspired by a recent poll about a month ago at the time we're recording this, so probably no longer as timely as when I came up with the idea, but you know, create a lot of discussion. There was a New York Times list of the hundred best movies of the 21st century. It was selected by m you know sort of film critics, but also people who work in the the film industry. Uh I don't subscribe to New York Times. That's because all I ever see on Blue Sky is some of the worst op-ed headlines of all time. Um I wish them well. I won't be paying for that. But um I did read that I did do some kind of ridiculous sort of like Google maneuvering to actually get to read the list first hand. But it it was good. It was a very nicely put together thing. The sort of thing you can only do when you've got that.

Matthew
05:31
you know, big editorial budget um sort of behind you and yeah.

Samuel
05:34
Shiny, wasn't it?

Matthew
05:36
I think the the celebrity contributions made it because there was a little bit of gawking energy at Ooh, what top ten has John Totoro picked? Because it when they wrote it up at the bottom of some entries, if a famous person had gone to bat for it and had been willing to speak about it. it would say, you know, you'd have the entry on the film and then it would be like, yes, John I say John Tutoro because he appeared on multiple entries. Yeah. So he must have just been really keen to talk through his picks.

Samuel
06:05
It's like when we get the uh freelancers to do the piece of game of top one hundred and if there's one guy who'd like write twelve entries and another guy who'd write three, you're like, well I'm gonna reward the guy who did twelve for like really contributing. So he gets more he gets more cover m more space in the top 100 because he gave a shit. Maybe that's it. John Taturo sent in the longest um sort of like a mount of um feedback, you know, on the film.

Matthew
06:29
There was a good entry for the Cohen brothers film, A Serious Man, where Pat and Oswald was saying, you know, this is one of my favourite films. Incidentally I auditioned for this for the Richard Kind role and I'm so glad Richard Kine got it 'cause he's much better. Like I even told the Cohen brothers in my audition I think Richard Kine should play this role. 'cause he'd be perfect for it. Um so I I like that. That's that's a good little contribution to that list. Yeah.

Samuel
06:55
You didn't get to Richard Kind in old in old Burzafray, did you Matthew? They didn't get that far into it. Uh n oh I didn't even know he was in it, no. Nay, isn't it? He's ve it's just he's in one scene, that's it. But The memorable I would say. Um I Bo's afraid it's got too much coverage on this podcast as it is though. Let's move on.

Matthew
07:11
Well I hope it's not in your top ten of the twenty first century.

Samuel
07:14
No it most certainly isn't. It's just an interesting film. Um so yeah this is was inspired by that and then A subsequent I say deranged reader poll, I thought the reader poll was pretty good actually. They had uh interesting mix of stuff. Like not not perfect by any means, but plenty of good films in there. And so I think when we were looking at when I was looking at those lists I found plenty of sensible suggestions to add to my to my own list in there. Um, you know, a few of mine uh I would say the order of mine's very different, but And s and a few things that were just, you know, seen by many, many people end up higher in the list by default, I think. But I thought they were I thought they were pretty good overall. What did you make of that sort of overall project editorially?

Matthew
07:52
Yeah, it was good. I thought the thing that jumped out to me was how much it coalesced around certain directors. Like certain people were really overrepresented. 'Cause they didn't have any kind of if you're in once, you can't be in a second time and Maybe they are just the directors who have dominated, you know, the conversation for the last twenty-five years, you know, and and maybe it's a good indicator of people who are slightly out of favour. Like I don't think there's a Spielberg film in there. Oof, really? I guess. I don't think so. Maybe. Or did Lincoln or Munich make it in?

Samuel
08:28
Well those are good suggestions.

Matthew
08:29
Um Yeah, I can't no, but I I Th there was a definite lack of him where, like, you know, if Paul Thomas Anderson fucking did a scribble on a napkin, that made it into the list. So uh it and it was a It it was quite film browy, I I would say, a lot of the picks. Uh but, you know, have a conversation about films on the internet and you know, of course they're gonna turn up. You know.

Samuel
08:57
Yeah, it's true. I there's just a lot of Nolan dominance in there, as you'd expect. Like loads and loads of Nolan actually. Um to the point where yeah, it makes you realise that even in that film bree culture there is a mono culture within that you know and so yeah yeah so I think in making my own list I still wanted to put a couple of things in there that I just think are fun that I just enjoy um to you know to just give it a bit more bit more character you know um I wouldn't say I've got like vastly you know sort of revolutionary picks or anything you won't be hugely surprised I imagine but I'm pretty happy with it. As what was the process of coming up with a top ten for you, Matthew?

Matthew
09:32
I went in and thought, oh yeah, my top ten probably live within I you know, this a hundred or this a hundred plus the reader a hundred, you know, I imagine it'll it'll be a bit of um just maneuvering around. But actually when I started thinking about like what are just my favourite films of all time and then, you know, putting in the ones which were from the last twenty-five years. Uh the list actually became quite full with things which aren't in that list. Uh I'd say my list is quite unusual. I really hope it doesn't come across as contrarian. I had that in my mind the whole time. Like are people just gonna be like, oh here's just a wanker who's trying to deliberately pick things that aren't in this top 100. And that it that isn't true. Uh they're they're all things I really like. Some some of them are in that list. Um I do think there were a couple of like massive, massive oversights in that list, which we can get to in when we do the top tens, um, some of which address that. Um Yeah, I yeah, I I think it I think it's okay. I I I had loads of fear. I had about 30 in a short list. Yeah. Which I then tried to whittle down to ten. Yeah. We'll see.

Samuel
10:43
Yeah, I I so I had a go at making a top ten when they did the poll originally. Yeah. So I did that and that was quite useful because I spent about an hour on it. And then it meant I had a first draft for um doing it this evening. Oh, nice. Um which is you know, I did my list about 25 minutes before we um recorded this, Matthew. Um but it was based on that previous brainstorming that I'd done um to uh to figure that out. I don't know, it's not a word you can use these days, is it? I don't know, came up with those thought about the process of thinking about things, fuck's sake. Um that's not me saying PC gone mad by the way. That's just a good one. No, no, I again. It's Wednesday evening, it's quite warm. Um so yeah, I but You know, I s I I don't think I had I've I've got like one really key film that was not in the either top one hundred. And I think that's there's a really simple reason for that that we'll we'll we'll go into when we get to it. But Yeah, otherwise I think I'm I'm a bit more monocultural. I expect your list to have a bit more in the way of like um Korean cinema in there, for example. Um But yeah, it's uh it yeah, it it was I've got a top twenty here. Um so I I uh when we do the ten to one, I'll also do my twenty to eleven afterwards, just to sort of um Talk about that very briefly.

Matthew
12:00
I think part of it as well is that the last twenty five years obviously covers like many different appetites in my life film-wise. And it c it covers, you know, the early part of the twenty-first century. It sounds so m grand when you say it like that. Um, but the early part of the 21st century I was really into film and I was going to the cinema all the time and I was seeing, you know stuff off the beaten t beaten track. I'm not saying like, oh, I saw all this stuff so that the other people won't understand or whatever, but I no, I f uh I feel like I have drawn from that period where I was just more on top of film and in the last ten years like I definitely haven't been that. have become quite a casual cinema goer really. Um so that the list also reflects that.

Samuel
12:44
Yeah, I think there's a a bit of recency bias in there as well. Like there aren't that many films from the early 21st century in there. It is more stuff from the last 15 years, I would say. And so, you know, it I'd say like a yeah, a bit a bit of a lack of films from 2000, 2001 kind of time. And some stuff that is probably a bit higher than it should be. So their list had um Dune part two at number twenty-seven. I I really like the Dune films. I think it's a bit too soon to canonise them in that way, personally. I think we need to see how they sell. Um and maybe see that third one. Like it's not done yet. That's the thing. The story's not over yet. So that's a another factor to it. But um yeah, it's uh Interesting process. I definitely went more with personal than trying to do something that was a ticking a load of boxes. I also tried to make sure the results tallied somewhat with the list episodes we've already done on Scorsese, Fincher, Nolan. So they're not totally out of whack with those. There was a bit of I had that a little bit as a a ceiling to it, I suppose. But um yeah. So I think then Matthew, we might as well just get straight into it. So what's your number 10? Are yours your tenth? Are they in an order?

Matthew
13:52
Yeah, they are. Okay, I've I tried doing that. I sort of struggled a bit. I uh my mine are maybe more of just ten my ten favourite films of the last twenty-five years.

Samuel
14:01
Well i I would say it's a bit arbitrary, the order. So I agree with I agree with that. I just went with a pool of ten and there's There's a thought process in what are the ten, more than like what the order is. So I mean how would you prefer to do it? How about we just do your one has no order but my one has an order and I'll just read it out. Yeah, that's fine.

Matthew
14:17
I did try and put them in an order, but I I don't want to be like held to it. Yeah, fair enough, Matthew. So what's your number ten? My number ten, uh, I wanted to kick off with uh Guillermo del Toro, but not Pan's Labyrinth. has appeared in the top 100. Hellboy 2? No, I've picked his 2001 film, Devil's Backbone. I wouldn't say this was a before he was famous, but it's I'd say it's it's kind of like a dry run for Pan's Labyrinth in that it's a a film about uh an orphanage during the Spanish Civil War and a little boy who gets dropped off there. and starts seeing a ghost or believes he sees a ghost walking the halls of the orphanage. Um it you know Or see what happens, but you know, it it very much ties into the kind of political situation and there's all kind of you know metaphor going on which you know you can probably expect from Pan's Labyrinth. I absolutely love Gail Mel del Toro. I think he's a a brilliant, brilliant director. I think sometimes he's a little bit he's become maybe a little bit style over substance, uh, in his more recent things, or like i it's more about pushing the Del Toro's style and I I think this sort of very, very simple sort of fairy tale horror film um is is for me like the best balance of what he's trying to do. I think I may have talked about it in the horror film XL we did.

Samuel
15:42
Rings a bell, yeah. Uh do you know what I got this film for free on Sci Fi Now on Blue Ray, they never watched it. How rude is that? Brutal R It's no comment on the film. I was just reading a lot of Batman comics at the time and had a very superficial you know sort of perspective on pop culture.

Matthew
16:01
And I still do, Matthew, except now I've seen a few more films. But you know. I just I yeah, I yeah, I I really like it. It's not as out there as Pan's Labyrinth, which I actually uh thought was a little bit overrated oof uh w when it came out.

Samuel
16:15
Um what is it you don't like about it?

Matthew
16:17
I guess it's quite like maximalist in the fantasy sections. Like they're so out there Devil's Batbone, you know, 'cause I'd already seen it and was, you know, really, really into it at the time that Pan's Labyrinth came out. And it's just one ghostly child who you maybe see like f Five minutes for the entire film? Yeah. And in Pan's Labyrinth, it's, you know, old fucking Doug Jones covered in prosthetics, climbing all over a dining room table, and you're like Yeah, I I it's it's a it's a little bit m more like not fairy tale, but like fairy world and kind of like Sort slightly zanier fantasy which isn't quite my cup of tea.

Samuel
16:55
I know what you mean, though, is there's almost as much it feels like there's almost as much fantasy as there is real world. So there's the the balance of it was a little bit of a lot of things.

Matthew
17:12
works very nicely against the kind of the m the you know the magic fantasy stuff that's going on. I just I don't know, like it's uh It's like the same mix of ingredients, just different different values of them, and the the recipes are a little bit off for me in Pan's Labyrinth.

Samuel
17:30
So I I I I should get to this at some point. He's become one of those directors, like you say, because this stuff has gotten a bit more a bit more superficial, a bit more, you know, one dimensional. Well made pretty things now um that don't really like live in the memory. I feel like Maybe it's he's not the the hottest director at the in the world at the moment, you know what I mean?

Matthew
17:53
Yeah, I know everyone's like pumped for his Frankenstein 'cause he's super into Frankenstein But that that kind of s sets me on edge a little bit.

Samuel
18:02
I've got three stars all over it that badly.

Matthew
18:04
Yeah, yeah. I don't think I've really loved one of his films since Hellboy 2.

Samuel
18:09
Yeah That's uh uh yeah, it's tough. I mean I yeah, I I sort of feel uh similarly I've still not seen the two Hellboy films actually, but I didn't Oh Hellboy twos

Matthew
18:19
Absolutely cracking. Is it really? Oh, it's so good. It's got like all his stuff, you know, like weird puppets, good characters, quite a lot of humor. It's it moves quite fast. And it's got good set pieces. Yeah, Hellboy 2's like a secret banger, I think.

Samuel
18:34
And they've made like two dog shit Hellboy films since then for some reason. Instead of just giving him the license to make a third one. I mean that seemed to backfire, didn't it? Um yeah, okay. Well that's a good suggestion, Matthew. I'll go watch this at some point and um and report back for sure. And yes, I will I will sh I will shrug it. the what is presumably a Netflix Frankenstein film whenever that rolls out. Um I'm more curious about the uh is there another Frankenstein film coming out? This is nothing that was.

Matthew
19:04
Christian Bale and um uh You know, the Irish actress, red hair, very like feisty.

Samuel
19:17
You know, she's oh she's so good, Jesse Buckley. Oh of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm curious about I mean That that film, so the Del Toro one's gonna be three-star. That film will either be one star or four stars. It can't be anything in between. Do you not think so? It's gotta be one of the two. I heard there's like musical bits in it. I mean that could be yeah. High Shimbale going like full method as a Frankenstein. Even in that Thor film he was giving it about three times more effort than anyone else was. That is a guy who has definitely inserted bolts into himself to get into character. Absolutely. Okay, well, devil's backbone, Matthew. Not your number ten, but you know, in the list of the top ten. So that's good. All right. So my number 10 is Money Ball. Um so Q here um the mighty Rio Grande Z will destroy wait the other way around. This will destroy you the mighty Rio Grande, that nice bit of music that plays the background of Moneyball. This is my. I think of this as like an elevated feel-good film, because I think it kind of is. It is a sports drama about basically an underdog story about a. uh like a manager using maths in order to optimize his team and no one thinking it's gonna work this guy Billy Bean and it actually working space on something that happened in real life but

Matthew
20:37
um Billy Bean played by um Brad Pitt in this film who uh How many times he's gonna say Billy Bean.

Samuel
20:42
That's it now, no more. I might just say Bean after this or Billy, but not Billy Bean. Oh I just said it then but you know you get the point. Um yeah, I think this this something about th the so that it's got like an Aaron Sorkin script, but the direction is very understated, so it doesn't feel like Sorkin takes over the movie, which I think he can with his script sometimes. I mean his own films. He watched something like The Trial of the Chicago Seven. The sulkiness of it really overpowers everything. And I don't think it does when his his scripts get in the hand of the right directors and Bennett Miller here. I think is the the right kind of director. You've got like peak fat Jonah Hill in this film as well, just sort of like as his as a sort of like pal. Rest in peace, fat Jonah Hill. Yeah, uh we hardly knew ye. Um, you know, d a Zenpik, what have you taken from us? You know. You got you got like a little bit of fat Chris Pratt as well in this film. Oh yeah. Um I so I went through a phase of watching this. I think I watched this about five times in 2015. And then it might it might sadly have been like one of the films I watched during a breakup at the time. Um but I would say every two to three years, dial it up because I think it y is it passes the test of even if you don't know what the fuck is going on. um on the a in terms of the actual sort of like sport side of it. It it does kind of um it does pass the the test of being entertaining. and uh and heartwarming. Uh what do you make of this?

Matthew
22:09
Yeah, I've only seen this film once and but my like appreciation of it has grown purely sort of vicariously through the enthusiasm of other film podcasts that I listen to. Oh yeah.

Samuel
22:21
I got to this before big picture, by the way.

Matthew
22:24
How this yeah Yeah, no, I'm not saying hey listen, I'm not accusing you of anything. But Every time they talk about it, I think, oh yeah, I should probably rewatch that because I liked it, but I I didn't it didn't like register as like, oh, this is a potential castle fave. Um but Like the the enthusiasm for it has grown. It feels like it is a film which maybe you get a a better uh understanding or enjoyment of on repeat viewings. Um so a bit of an unsatisfying answer on that one I'm afraid. Um I really remember was that he was called Billy Bean and that was baseball in it. There's baseball in it, right?

Samuel
23:02
It's got one of the those sort of things that I think you always like in a film though, which is Philip Seymour Hoffman in a supporting role where he absolutely kills it and takes over the film in different bits. I think that's Yeah, I do like that. Yeah, that that works really, really well. It's yeah, I It really is like quite a quite just a very well made version of something quite simple. And so, yeah, feel good in quite a specific way, but it's one of the all-time just dial it up on Netflix and uh have it on the background, watch an hour, come back later, watch another hour. It's got it w I feel like this is on Netflix UK for about About five years, I feel like I saw it on there. Um yeah. Is this the twenty-first century's answer to Jerry Maguire? It's just so different. It's not It's it doesn't have that nineties Hollywood thing of of the really high so the really sort of schmaltzy side of it. It's not Really that it's a little bit more gently uplifting, I would say. It doesn't bat you over the head with it, you know. Is it good vibe social network Uh no not really because there's not really the thing is there's nothing Billy Bean is just I said it again, sorry, I said I wouldn't. Um he's just an underdog. He's not really got anything like hugely wrong with him. He's just a guy trying to get it together and who's trying to do something bold and has to convince all the people around him. Um, you know, where the stakes are quite high that this is gonna work and Yeah, so it's you never really have the a man's about to unleash hell on earth, which is basically what a social network and by the way, he's a dickhead. That's all that film is basically, isn't it? And what face it, let's face it, real life has turned out to prove with uh with Mark Zuckerberg. So Is it spreadsheets field of dreams? Yeah, you know what? I think that's a bit closer. Yeah, it's uh have you got any more there? It's something something with Microsoft Excel? No, that's it. Now now that we've Agreed that it's something I won't keep guessing. No, I enjoyed that. I mean, yeah, I'd say watch it again. It's funny because the director has sort of disappeared as well. He made that wrestling film, right, with Channing Tatum that I think people were a bit mixed on.

Matthew
25:12
Um it's that one Steve Carrell's weird name like Tiger Eater or something.

Samuel
25:16
Steve Carrell's got that a load of m

Matthew
25:28
Uh d really? Uh every single time? Not even um Pretty much every single time. Like I need I need that guy to be like just doing the office until he dies. I don't need him to be pretending that his son's a drug addict.

Samuel
25:42
What about the Adam McKay film where he's the banker guy? He's pretty good.

Matthew
25:46
No, you don't like that film?

Samuel
25:48
I don't like that film. People don't like Adam McKay.

Matthew
25:50
I will be saying up front Adam McKay does not appear on my list.

Samuel
25:54
Yeah, it's um yeah it's Foxcatcher was the name of that wrestling film.

Matthew
25:58
Foxcatcher lion eater.

Samuel
25:59
Who's not made a film in eleven years? What's all that about? I mean there are all kinds of people making shite out there, do you know what I mean? Making these tech why don't the Russip brothers get this guy to make a film? They got all that all that money from making terrible Netflix films. Anyway, enough on that, Matthew. What's your Next film.

Matthew
26:16
This next film, this is this is the most obscure one on my list and the biggest eye roller, but also the one which is like most it's the biggest heartpick on here. Fast five, let's go. No no no this is you won't have heard of this. Um This is the 2000 film Dinner Rush. Oh no, I've not heard of that. Which is a very small independent film. I would say it's a proto-the bear, almost 25 years before the bear came out. Um I think the guy who directed it also owned the restaurant in which he filmed it in. His name's Bob Giraldi. I don't think he's directed another film. Uh super obscure cast of of sort of indie actors. Danny Aiello, who you probably recognize from sort of some gangster-y things. is the head of this restaurant and the film is set across one evening in this restaurant following the customers, the chefs, the owner of the restaurants, basically anyone who walks in the door can be part of the story. Quite Robert Altman-esque in the way that it jumps between the different characters. Um but I fucking love this film. This film's great because the restaurant looks amazing, the food looks amazing. The little character arcs, they're all really beautifully done, everyone's played by an interesting indie actor. And the It all kind of wraps up perfectly the way all these little storylines kind of come together. It's a little bit sentimental. Um, there's definitely like a through line Like it it's a very different film to Days and Confuse, but like a film with quite a lot of good hangs having a c uh an interesting evening. Um, like that's very much on my wavelength. And there's a little bit of diner in that there's lots of people eating food together in quite a cool looking place. This film is so hard to find. It's not on any fucking services. I think you might be able to buy it on Amazon Prime. Um I've I've always I've always loved it. I've never met anyone else who's who's seen it. I showed it at my college film society trying to sort of indoctrinate people into loving it. I suspect it's really, really good. And so you have to permit where you've one very obscure pick. for this list.

Samuel
28:31
My guy Kirk Acevedo's in this.

Matthew
28:33
Oh K yeah, Kirk A well the two the two chefs are Kirk Acevedo and and uh guy called Eduardo Ballerini. Who you probably recognise from things, he's got quite a distinct face. And oh everyone is good. I think it's got w I think it's got One of the phoenixes, the s the the the the the girl phoenix. It's got Summer Summer Phoenix, sorry.

Samuel
28:58
I'm making them sound like they're fucking Pokemon. That's my problem, which is not good.

Matthew
29:03
But there is one called there was one called Leaf.

Samuel
29:05
Oh really? Okay, well there you go. That's fine then.

Matthew
29:07
It's one like it is legitimately one of my top ten films of all time. Um just because it's like the ultimate comfort watch for me Uh so I'm putting it on this list. Maybe one listener will find it and enjoy it. If you find it and hate it, I don't want to hear about it. Just don't tell me on the Discord. I d I really this is this is of a tier of film where I just don't w I d I don't want to hear that opinion.

Samuel
29:30
So I think this'll be one of those films where everyone in the Patreon chat channel goes, Oh that film Matthew talked about the The film with the the restaurant. I think that's what they'll be they'll all be adding it to the letterbox list. But um that's a good note, Matthew. I also want to note this film um features Mark Margolis. um who uh you will know as Hector Salamanca, that guy um with the with the bell in um Breaking Bad.

Matthew
29:53
His his storyline involves Summer Phoenix because he's a snooty art critic from a newspaper. And she's his waitress and he gives her loads and loads of shit, like making fun of her the whole evening. So it's a good little good little story that.

Samuel
30:07
Ratatouille plot came from Matthew. It's just fucking Brad Byrd watching this in in in a a sort of a very small LA cinema in 2000 probably. Um yeah, that's a good suggestion. I like that. Genuinely interesting. And I would like to see it. It's probably on Internet Archive or something. I've watched a few films on it. Yeah, or someone's uploaded it to YouTube. Yeah, exactly because no one Bob Giraldi's not sued them and got it taken down or whatever.

Matthew
30:31
The opening five minutes are terrible. It's like a man being gunned down in the street, which is a key plot point to the rest of the film, but it is not indicative of where the film goes.

Samuel
30:40
Okay, I wanna do what you did with Moneyball and ask, is this um John Favreau's dinner for five but not on the telly, Matthew? Uh

Matthew
30:53
No, it's not quite that. I'd say I'd say it's it's Richard Linklatters the bear.

Samuel
30:59
Oh well that's good. I like that. Okay. Um my number nine, um because mine has an order, remember, um, is Damien Chazelle's whiplash, which is de definitely his best film. And by far. Yeah, and is basically it's not quite his debut. I think he had a film before this, but Is out of the gates this, you know, very confidently made but also perfect examination of, you know, your a person's relationship with their art, how far they'll go for it, and then the kind of like corrosive uh relationship a person can have with their mentor when they're trying to, you know, a reach a level of greatness that you know that It's sort of like just out of reach, I guess. Um and so obviously you have JK Simmons here who I think an actor everyone always really liked. um, you know, was always a I think he was a supporting uh character in that TV show with Kyra Sedgwick that used to be on more for Matthew. Like I always thought it was weird that he would do these TV roles and then he sort of after Spider-Man ended up having 'cause I think he was I think Oz is like one of the shows that he comes is like a big breakfoot for him. But I would say that he was always sort of in those fourth, fifth lead sort of positions in films. Like in um uh s uh Juno, for example. You know, he's just sort of there in the background. And obviously he turns up in Spider-Man. He's like amazing comic relief. But then I think that maybe Maybe it's because older millennial filmmakers just w were really familiar with this work. He started getting better opportunities the older he got. And then this is I th I Oscar Oscar nominated for this, and rightfully so. Just the most toxic Toxic but very complicated bully character. A guy who has his own rules that he sort of insists that everyone else lives by. And exists in his own sort of like moral sphere as well and d does not care about how people talk about s you know mental health on social media or anything like that. He's just a guy who will call a kid fat as he punishes him for being out of sync with you know everyone else in the in the band basically and so amazing to watch just the relationship But sort of grow, then unravel, and then right at the last instance, sort of like grow again it in the most like horrendous circumstances possible. It is absolutely riveting and One of those films that I think I after I first watched it, I thought, oh yeah, it kind of slows down in its last act. Then rewatched it and was like, no, no, no, no, it doesn't. You you forget just how Awful the last stretch of this film is. Um, when you realize what when like J. K. Simmons is well, I don't spoil too much of the film for people in case they haven't seen it. They probably have, but When he is removed from his position and he identifies who removed him from his position and then the sort of like turn that occurs and then the turn that occurs after that. It's such a twisty thrilling film like it are amazing. So I think this yeah, it's what it's also I wouldn't call like a personal favourite or anything, but I just think it taps into something so specific and captures it perfectly. Something that feels quite real. I think if you're a writer and you've always wanted to become great but feel like greatness is a tiny bit out of your grasp, you know what I mean?

Matthew
34:19
Yeah.

Samuel
34:20
I don't know what that feels like.

Matthew
34:24
Someone who, you know, attained it a long time ago. You're the one who you But that's cute, I get it.

Samuel
34:29
I Yeah, but you posting that Donkey Kong Bonanza review on The Guardian was like Brad Pitt at the end of Inglorious Masters game just might be my masterpiece. That was you looking at that review, wasn't it, Matthew?

Matthew
34:43
700 words on them on the monkey terrain destruction game. The highlight of a man's life's work. I mean, it's not too far from the truth. I yeah, I really like this film. Uh incredible crowd pleaser, so entertaining that you can make a thriller out of this setting as well. Where the the threat is not really like viol I know there's a bit of violence, but it's not like life and death, but like reputation and your own sense of self-worth. Uh brilliantly done. Uh I'd go as far as saying I've I've really not really gelled with what he's done since then. I I think he's I don't think he's all that for me, um, the director Yeah, I think it's uh I'd I'd love him to do more like this than whatever he was doing in Babylon. He needs like money taken off of him again, basically.

Samuel
35:37
You know what I mean? They need to go Your budget is. Well that's it. It's here's ten million, not one hundred million, basically.

Matthew
35:44
The thing is, as I as I learnt with that Donkey Kong review, you need to spend a few years in the wilderness to really reconnect with your own genius.

Samuel
35:52
Oh, that was so good. Um I don't think he's even got another film coming up, so I think he's one of those guys who just had too too many blank check films and that people didn't really like.

Matthew
36:02
So um imagine having a blank check and making a film buttney boring astronaut who does that.

Samuel
36:09
Yeah, I mean this territory was already covered so well by um you know. Oh don't you say it don't you say it. No no no it's alright, I'm only joking Matthew. What's your num what's your next uh next film? Uh my next pick

Matthew
36:20
is The Master by Paul Thomas Anderson. Oh right. You know what? None of his films made my top ten. It it was a toss-up between this and Phantom Thread, which both films that I I really like. Just i like P probably my f favourite acting showcases come in his films. I think he's made more entertaining things. I mean Licorice Pizza simply for the Bradley Cooper bit is is you know a bet a much better hang than the Master, which is a if you haven't seen it, a tr a heavily traumatized Navy veteran played by Racking Phoenix. going like full whacking Phoenix, uh has an encounter with a man named Lancaster Dodd who is uh very clearly modelled on uh Ron L. Hubbard, the creator of Scientology. Um I wouldn't settle at the time everyone was like, oh it's the Scientology film, but it's kinda n it sort of is and it isn't. Um the the Philip Seymour Hoffman character sort of runs this cult that has processes which are quite like the processes that people you know, allegedly do in Scientology. I don't know why I said allegedly, it's out I'm not like defending them or anything. Um This is where Matthew reveals he's been part of the church for uh fifteen years now. That's where your patron that's where your Patreon money goes. That's fine. But uh but it's more about this these two very different personalities. who uh you know he he takes a real interest in the Wacking Phoenix character. Two very different personalities, two very different actors, very different acting styles. You know, Hacking Phoenix is I don't want to say he's going like method, but he's like so pained and like vanishes into this role, which he is brilliant at, but I I thought this was the sort of best version of that and Philip Seymour Hoffman is just such a sort of controlled like well master of his craft, you know, and seeing you know, what is it in this slightly damaged man that that he becomes so kind of obsessed with? Um also great support from Ailey Adams as his wife and I don't know, I just I just think it's like seeing two of the best actors of the last twenty five years doing probably their best acting ever. Uh and you know, the the last scene of this, their last kind of encounter is just such a weird, intense, like emotional moment. Something very strange happens. Um yeah, I d I yeah, I just thought I thought this was Just it's just really sort of stuck with me, basically. It's not it's not like a oh it's Saturday night, let's pop on the master. Um but in terms of like appreciating the craft, I think it's it's really up there.

Samuel
39:01
Yeah, I um I I really like this film as well, and I think I I agree that it's a great acting showcase. It's one of the the few genuinely great Amy Adams films as well because I feel like she's just made so much shit in the last ten years or so. That's not I don't think that's harsh.

Matthew
39:18
You know I mean a rival's obviously. I mean the thing is though, she she she like always gets a pass for a rival, so Yeah, that's you're not a not an arrival guy, Matthew? No, she no, she always gets she's like she's granted a forever pass for a rival. Oh right, yeah, yeah, exactly. No, no, I th she's a I think that's an incredible film.

Samuel
39:36
That almost made my top ten. Yeah, I d I didn't actually I don't think I picked uh no I've not picked a Vilner film either for my top ten. Um that was tough. Though those are all like would be eleven to twenty films, I think. But yeah, I this film I I wish someone hadn't shared with me the theory online that Joaquin Phoenix is playing a dog in this film. Because I I when I watched it, I saw the entire film through that lens. And I was like, well it makes no sense that a dog would be like a navy veteran. So that immediately kills the theory dead.

Matthew
40:06
But his performance is moonshine. That's too complicated for a dog. It is I don't care how smart your collie is, it's not doing that Show me a dog that can make mean shine and I'll show you truly man's best friend.

Samuel
40:19
But no, I but I think it's because his performance is so animalistic, he is so physical in it. Yeah, and then you just have this button down until he explodes Philip Steamur Hoffman performance. It's a amazingly entertaining. Yeah Yeah, it is it is really good. I think um in some ways it was it was a a lith for me, it was a little bit of a victim of its own hype because the Scientology thing was so the narrative that surrounded the film. And then when you watch it, it's It's not really that, you know what I mean? It's no it's just not. It's yeah, it's something else. But yeah, like you say, power how just amazing performances across the board And yeah, it's uh yeah, I can see I can see why you picked it. It's just not it's not a personal favorite, but I definitely admire the craft of it. And I say the same for Phantom Thread as well, you know? Just brilliantly made, but not something I not like not really close to being a heart pick. Whereas licorice pizza would be a would be a heart pick.

Matthew
41:16
Yeah, that's yeah, that's yeah, that's true. Phantom Thread is like a rare film that can change how you not how you see relationships forever, but you will I think after seeing Phantom Thread there will always be a little voice at the back of your head telling you Is is th is there more truth in this than I than I think, you know? Is is the nature of like codependency actually Is he is he like bang on the money here? Uh and it's just doesn't really matter either way if he's wrong or he's right, but it's always there kind of like, hmm Maybe. Am I like this? I don't know. It's a great film to watch with a pilot and then make dark jokes about your own relationship, I find. That's the better solution to it. Rather than just quietly stewing on it.

Samuel
42:02
Yeah, what's the your version of the the poisoned eggs, Matthew? What's uh do you have one of those?

Matthew
42:07
The you know, like uh quality street tips? I would s I am a quite a pitiful ill person when I am ill and Catherine is a like particularly kind and generous nurse if she has to go into that mode. And she's she's way better at taking care of me when I'm ill than I am taking care of her when she's ill. Um which will probably come as no surprise to anyone.

Samuel
42:32
Well that's why she's the goat, you know.

Matthew
42:34
Uh yeah, exactly.

Samuel
42:35
Okay, well okay, that's um good stuff, Matthew. I do you know what I weirdly was um uh did fucking what's it called the other the 2000 Tom Cruise. You tame the C-word. Did that one what film what film was that called again? Magnolia. Magnolia. I've cleaned up enough sleep because I'm forgetting the names of things in this episode. Um was that would that have qualified for this episode? I think it would have done. Is that right? No, it's a n that's a ninety-nine film. It's a ninety nine film. Right. It's out then, it's fine. Um we should maybe we should do an episode on the ninety-nine films at some point. That might be a fun thing to do. Uh just something themed around that because everyone talks about that being a great film year, don't they? Um something to think about. Okay, my next pick, Matthew. is a Richard Linklater film before sunset, which I'll be honest with you was not on my list when I made it originally And then I just read the New York Times list and it kind of just jolted in my memory, oh my god, remember what it was like watching this film. And and how it how how it felt to watch that during COVID when you couldn't fucking go anywhere, but you could watch Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy walk around Paris. Um So this is the second film in that trilogy of um the before films. Before um sunrise is the first one set in the 90s. about a couple who meet by chance on a train in Europe, spend a day together, fall in love, and then go their separate ways. This film is set ten years later and they meet again um in Paris, um where I think Ethan Hawke's character is doing a book signing. And yeah, they basically it's a a second chance them to meet and fall in love. All they really do in this film is walk from walk between locations in Paris. Um and it but it looks absolutely amazing. And there's something very particular about the chemistry between these actors. There's a a baked in bit of realism to the whole thing, um, in that Ethan Hawke's character is um is either divorcing or on the edge of divorce, um, and I think in real life he was uh divorcing Uma Thurman Um so that was a i a factor it that kind of g went into the production of this film. So I think they the actors put a lot of themselves into the characters. Um This is the shortest of the three. It is the most satisfying of the three because, you know, it is it is tragic to see them sort of like go their separate ways in that first film and to see them reunite like this is incredibly cathartic. Um you know the fact there is a third film I think does spoil how this film ends to some extent. And the third film is by design a much tougher hang. What happened then?

Matthew
45:03
What's the third one about?

Samuel
45:04
I don't know if I've seen the third one. They're basically bickering on holidays. Right. That's all that really happens in it. And it's it's just quite it's just quite sad um in places. Or like c it's more challenging a watch than I think it needed to be. It couldn't be this again. But this this I think reflects something about being about a slightly more mature love when you're in your thirties, something that feels a bit less Maybe fireworksy in that very particular way it can feel in your twenties, but it feels like I don't know, there's just something so authentic about it. And yeah, the fact that they're in Paris, a a massive bonus. And yes, I will admit that watching this during COVID uh massively enhanced it for me. So I was like, I went there, I went there last year and it was amazing. And I can't go back. And so Um in that moment. Except it was you and me in Paris and me eating an onion pie. Yeah, I mean, you know, I reflect on that as a very treasured memory. Yeah, it's a very, very different film. It's like, yeah, I wish I was um I wish I was in a Before embargo.

Matthew
46:11
That's what our one's called.

Samuel
46:14
That's really good. Before embargo. Um I think it's a beautiful film, um, with two great actors and Julie Delpia. Just a incredibly beautiful woman. I'm gonna be honest with you, Matthew. It's gonna come clean there. And um that'll be the first and last bit of horn dogging that happens on this podcast. What are your thoughts on This film.

Matthew
46:31
Yeah, I mean I I I haven't seen the the third one, but um yeah, just incredible vibes with uh yeah amazing people you really root for. Um Yeah, it's w it's weird. I kinda came to s like I almost wish I had sort of discovered these, you know, a bit earlier or or when maybe they they kind of echo your life a bit more or you can maybe like resonate a bit more with I mean nothing in my life is like their life really. um so, you know, that's that's kind of preposterous um bar like we've both been to Paris. Uh yeah, that's good. I d I w I wasn't ex I wasn't expecting you to pick this, but uh a nice swooningly uh romantic pick. Well yeah.

Samuel
47:14
Yeah, I think s it's still got a bit of swing to it. Oh massively. I think it's just um yeah, it's watching this thing reignite and them realizing they still have the the chemistry they once had Really powerful stuff. And I think I think you're right, they are good hangs. I think maybe you could argue they're almost like r unrealistically good hangs. Now I think that's why the third one is quite valuable because it does it does interrogate their problems as a as a couple have been together for much longer. But um Yeah, this is certainly the most satisfying watching. Yeah, there is something about how Linklater does people hanging out. Why is he so good at that? It just maybe it's the way he just makes people improvise or you know, he seems like a very, very laid back guy as well when you hear him in interviews. Maybe he's just good at creating that sort of space for people to feel a bit easy around one another. So yes. Okay Matthew, what's your next pick? From the sublime to the ridiculous, it's Spider-Man 2. Oh, do you know what that is in my um 11 to 20, so

Matthew
48:12
Yeah. Yeah, I I I thought I had to represent I'm not including this 'cause I have to represent, but as an intro, I thought I had to represent the dominance of superhero films these last twenty-five years. Um so I thought I'd go back to one of the ones that I truly truly loved, Spider-Man 2, Sam Raimi just showing everyone how it's meant to be done. I think if you go back to this film now, as I did this week Um it's it's just such a pleasure seeing how sort of proper everything was done back in the day, or just 20 years ago, like all the sets all the practical effects, all the interesting shot choices, like a script that feels like it's actually been thought about and written, so that the lines actually land and hasn't been cobbled together on a day. I haven't just picked this as a stick to whack. um the absolute shhat uh tidal wave that followed uh in in the the later Marvel era. But Uh it is a little bit that. You watch this and you're like, that's that's proper filmmaking. It's really, really pure, brilliantly observed. Like the characters are like cartoonish and comic booky, but there's like an emotional realness to them. like the actual actors every everyone is so perfectly cast in this film like even the the smallest bit part just looks like part of this world alfred melina Brilliant villain. Um stuff which should be a bit kind of hacky and hokey, like the monologue where he talks to his tentacles and becomes a supervillain in basically the course of the film. Uh quite a reminiscent of of Willem Dafoe talking in the mirror in the first film. But I like these scenes. I like a villain origin story. Um I kinda miss when superhero films did do all these old fashioned beats. You know, it's been interesting in Superman, a lot of the conversation's been we don't need to see him become Spider-Man again, and we don't need to see this again and that again and and maybe that's true, but The Marvel films are so anti this kind of like self-contained storytelling where we set everything up you need to understand in the film. I I just really, really appreciate it all the more. Um great, great fun this film.

Samuel
50:26
Yeah, I I love this film. I mean the Alpha Million stuff is great. It's the fact that yeah, you see that origin in full. It's nice it's really well plotted because it also pulls Harry into the story. Like Harry's got like money invested in it and his friendship with Peter is under strain and y a lot kinda goes wrong. It that's just really nicely plotted in general. And then yeah, like there's the Classic Sam Raimi, quick cut, camera zooming in, sort of like monster montage of you know the birth of Doc Ock in that surgery. Just fucking brilliant stuff. Um Yeah, it makes you realise why this genre got big in the first place. It's so good that it makes you think it's actually unfair that so many shit films got to piggyback off off of these films. Like it that seems like they should owe they owe a tax, really. And I gotta say Seeing the there's a Kevin Feige interview doing the rounds this week from a press conference. That sounds like a guy managing a bunch of SEO pages, not a guy making film Do you know what I mean? Like he doesn't sound like a storyteller. He sounds like yeah, we've got to reboot this at this point, gotta reboot that gotta uh relaunch the redirect this and send it to a different URL and try and rank better on Google. That is how he sounds when he talks about his films, which is just uh just so bleak. Um yeah, I love this. I saw this in the cinema again last year. At this gonna sound so pathetic, but I welled up a little bit at the scene. When Ursula, the uh landlord's daughter, gives him the slice of chocolate cake. Uh. And he's just in this moment where he really needs like one person on his side. And it's and it's so sweet and just I I always loved that scene. But I think I just forgot it was in the film because I always think of the big emotional scene in this being the the train scene where he stops the train and he's unmasked because it is the scene, right? Um but there's just so many details like that we like this fucking nothing like this in Shang-Chi. Do you know what I mean?

Matthew
52:23
Oh no but this y you know th if you take for example there's the bit where Mary Jane invites him to see her play and he doesn't get there in time. But in the course of that scene, like You see her backstage at the play, you see her on stage on a set doing the play, you see the inside of the theatre. This this it it shows you everything. And you're like, that just doesn't happen anymore. There's just no thought to it. Like every film now is 12 scenes long. And they're just 12 long, boring ass CG pieces of shit backgrounds. Uh and this is just like everything you see, like they've been to that place and they've actually done it and they've thought about the set decoration and the costumes. Oh my god, it just it just hits so differently now. Like the physicality of films. I know it's really dumb to get like sort of dewy eyed for that, but it it really does work. You're like, this I mean this just looks brilliant. Some of the Spider-Man CGs look a little soft now. But the actual like I'd say ninety-five percent of this film still looks great. Great music as well. Danny Elfman absolutely good. Danny Elfman doing his thing. Yeah. Um I mean Jay Jonah Jameson absolutely like brilliant. are a billion times better than the Daily Planet stuff in Superman. Like that's how you do it. All these people coming through his doors, you never leave his office. It's just people coming in his doors and him barking one-liners at them. It's cold.

Samuel
53:51
Yeah, is it uh the shots of like his deputy editor with the glasses and it's like the same shot several times and uh he's just saying random bullshit each time and yeah, just a back and forth. The only man I trust is my barber and all this stuff, and it's just Yeah, it's so good, man. Um yeah, I yeah, it's it it's just does the right thing of the film is about 75% Peter Parker to 25% Spider-Man and That's where so and but also the supporting characters like the scene where in the diner, you know, which ends with that amazing shot of um of Docok chucking the the car through the window, right? Um just really uh is he chuck a car? Is that right? Have I got that right actually? Yeah. That's right, 'cause you see in the reflection of the don't you see ri in the r in the reflection of his glasses or something?

Matthew
54:38
Yeah, well he chucks the oh there's a bit where he chucks bits of a taxi at him when he's coming out of a bank.

Samuel
54:43
Oh yeah, that I mean that that scene's amazing. Um because it also has Joel McHale pre sort of like hair transplant and it's just really obvious.

Matthew
54:56
bags of just giant gold coins. And this cold coin rolls along and Joel McHale picks it up and Art May smacks it out of his hand. A great bit. But you are meant to be distracted from the fact like why's this bank got so much gold coin?

Samuel
55:10
Like Yeah, a very like nineteen nineteen forties comic book. Maybe that is but it's yeah, it's so preposterous really. Um yeah, very enjoyable scene. Uh we could have done a whole episode on this film, couldn't we? We would have um had a great time. Um yeah, it's but it's just that that that dinosine The conversation, the writing between Peter and MJ is really realistic and really well done and so beautifully performed. And you're like, wow, they used to do These used to be kind of slightly prestigious films when they were done well. And so yeah, um that's gone. Um the genre is ruined, but they can still occasionally be um pretty fun, as sp as Superman um showed us, Matthew. Okay, great pick. Uh love that film. Maybe that should have been in my top ten actually. My expick is American Psycho Matthew. Oh. This is what I mean about how the list the New York Times list just had a bit of recency bias. Think people forget that this is actually a 2000 film and not a 99 film. Right, yeah, that's what I I I made that mistake It might just be because it has that very it has a very particular nineties energy to it, I think. It's sort of like but well maybe s it may be even slightly more eighties vibe because of the whole New York yuppie um sort of element of it. But I read this book because people I used to have a couple of male friends who banged on about this book. And it was alright. And then I watched this film, and this film is like three times better than the book. It's just so fun. Because it is all played for laughs. But I don't even I don't think at the time people fully comprehended just how played for laughs it was. People treated it like the release of this film like it was a very transgressive thing. And it is shocking in places, but it's so funny. And like Bayliss so funny in it. It's so like preposterous and the monologue is so good and just but I had a slightly better haircut and all this stuff and it's just I uh really just an incredibly rewatchable fun film, I think, which I know is Given the violent some of the violent subject matter in it, the gaudy sex scenes and the the outlook of it and all that stuff. It's uh but it's just Oh my god, it's so funny. It's one of the funny I think it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. And the more I rewatch it, the more I just r I just lean into the funny stuff and enjoy the funny stuff and think What an absolutely ridiculous character this guy is. And um and find that deeply enjoyable. So yeah, I I think the performance is just it's so It's absolutely there's so many so many layers of irony to it. I think it stands the test of time incredibly well. If you made it now, I don't know how it'd be vastly different to this, really. What do you think?

Matthew
57:47
Yeah, that that that's what I was gonna say. Like it it just feels it's like If you released it now alongside like succession or whatever, it's that kind of c caustic understanding of of like high business society. Uh you know, it just it's you know There's such an appetite for that right now. Um, it is kinda hard yeah, hard to remember a time where this seem did seem like more outrageous. It just s it just seemed so not sensible, but just so uh I don't want to say obvious, but uh you know, it inevitable, maybe.

Samuel
58:21
Yeah. It's also just his His relationship with shit pop culture as well, like talking about Huey Lewis and stuff like that. Film poster that film poster of him in the mask was in the window of my local um video rental shop when I was a kid. And so I always stayed away from the film because I thought, oh, that looks really dark and messed up. Because that is how they sold it, isn't it? That is how they got people to to be interested in it, the shock factor. But yeah, you watch the film and I think because the violence in films is, you know, just so so pervasive, you're completely desensitized to that now. And I think you can simply enjoy this as a dark comedy that it actually is. Very perceptive adaptation. Looking at a book and being like, I think the guy who wrote this is a bit preposterous. I think I can do something really fun with with this material. Um and also Matthew, the only female director who's in my list, I will cop to that. So um I don't think I have one sadly. Uh yeah, it's uh yeah, Mary Harron. Um but uh I mean yeah amazing job. Um I want to watch this again. I don't think it's on a streamer at the moment, but I'm sure everyone listening has seen this at some point. What's your next film, Matthew?

Matthew
59:27
Uh release the Weeb Shit. It's time for Summer Wars, the 2009 anime film by Mamaru Hosada. Have you seen Summer Wars?

Samuel
59:36
I haven't, but I've definitely know this to be one of the big But you know, sort of like uh uh I guess awards y anime films in the last few years. Alright, you know, well well received critically.

Matthew
59:47
I absolutely love this film. I was actually quite surprised, side note, that Spirited Away placed so high that it did. in the New York Times top one hundred. It's quite an odd film to be like anointed as one of the ten best films of all time, but I I don't think it would make Mike Ghibli top five it might be the top five I don't think so either but anyway this isn't a Ghibli film what I love about Summer Wars is that uh for my money it's It feels like the best Spielberg film of the last 25 years, old school Spielberg film. It's about a boy who is invited by his classmate. uh who he has a crush on, um, to go and visit her family. Like, uh she's got this big family out in the countryside and she needs to bring a date so that I think she's lied about having a boyfriend so that they don't all think she's, you know, a loser or whatever. So she drags along this this awkward boy, um, and You think it's gonna be about the boy trying to kind of like awkwardly maneuver his way around this quite big, quite strange family. There's lots of uncles and aunts and cousins and they've all got quite sort of distinctive characteristics. It's quite a hectic house to be in. Um but there is a there is a sort of crisis in the family that unfolds that weekend with the return of the kind of black sheep uh an older family member who comes back and causes trouble, uh which is also tied into I'd say like a slightly bigger sci-fi issue that y you have to kind of watch the film to understand. But there's there's sort of a the kind of climax takes place in like an online game, and this online game becomes quite integral to to the sort of fate of the world. But it never ever loses grasp of like the that exciting thriller element in one hand. and this brilliantly observed like family comedy and that for me is like the Spielbergy thing. It feels really, really well observed. Um the family's very very believable. The boy's kind of awkward reaction to the family is very very believable. And him having to deal with like the double whammy of like a threat that's gonna end the world. But also how do I not fuck up in front of this girl I like? Uh I think that's a great dynamic. It's so charming, it's so well done. This family's like 20 characters big and in like an hour and a half you feel like you know them all really well. Yeah, I th I think this is great. Again, this is like a personal top ten film of all time for me. I think it's it's so like funny and exciting and and and well observed. you know, it isn't a wild fantasy journey like a lot of um the Miyazaki films. It's it's it's quite kind of grounded in a sort of everyday life, everyday Japan that you'd recognise, which I like as well. So yeah, I will always recommend this film to people.

Samuel
01:02:41
Mm, yeah, I think it's come up once in the podcast before, but I can't remember when, and it's definitely been a while. Um Yeah, I don't know if this is streaming anywhere, but um I know it's been re-released in recent years. So I remember seeing it. at like maybe in the listings to the Odeon or something. Right. So it must have like a bit of a ta long tail to it, Matthew. It's just more people found this over the years.

Matthew
01:03:03
I think every time a Hosta f new Hosta film comes out, there's like uh you you you get a lot of like mini seasons of his work. Yeah. Um 'cause he also did You did wolf children after this, which is which is quite good. Um didn't Mirai? The boy and the beast. Mirai, yeah, the boy and the boy and the yeah, that's it. Um I think he's got a new one out soon actually.

Samuel
01:03:25
Yeah, like it was I think it was literally uh it might actually be coming out in the UK in 4K in the next few weeks, I believe. Right. Just looking at the um Yeah, I just had a quick Google in the background. There's a trailer for it from a few weeks ago, Matthew. So might be able to catch this in UK cinemas very soon.

Matthew
01:03:41
Well hope hopefully. I I think he actually came up through like Digimon anime, weirdly. Yeah. Well, you know, this uh that makes sense given the subject matter, right? Honestly, like I think they sold this as like i i it's gonna be a bit more anime than you think, and what took me by surprise was Actually, it was really really relatable as as like a fan family drama. Um uh yeah, I still this film is really really good. I swear by it

Samuel
01:04:08
Yeah, that's um that's that's really interesting. Yeah, I just gonna I'm gonna make a note of your ones afterwards and add them to my letterbox to watch list, Matthew, because that's how I engage with that platform. Um okay cool. Uh so uh damn. Yeah, I should really I should really say the Spielberg thing really unlocks that I think for me, what the appeal of it is. And also Digimon did have good animation, you know, however else you might level at it. It did it did. It did. Better animation than Pokemon.

Matthew
01:04:33
That fucking rotten T-Rex thing.

Samuel
01:04:35
Yeah. A little dinosaur guy. All you're doing is explaining you're dissing the Digimon character designs, the actual animation, very sharp. The The weeb psychos in the Discord will back me up on this. I can't I can't see past the monster designs. Fair enough. Um okay. Probably my m l I probably most controversial or like the most contentious film I'm putting in here. Is it Human Caterpillar? No, but this was like quite a late edition. Oh no, Centipede. Are you thinking of the hungry cat? But did you get just did you just conflate the hungry caterpillar and the human centipede? Is that what you just did? Very different vibes. That was the last page of the Hungry Caterpillar. Imagine reading like a children's storybook in of like the human centipede, but in the visual style. of the hungry caterpillar. Can you think of a I mean that would absolutely pop off on it. It eats through a succession of fruit and then a human asshole. Um and on that note, my number six is uh AI Artificial Intelligence, directed by Steven Spielberg. Oh wow, okay. This film seems to have A lot of detractors, um, who I think maybe didn't feel like the Spielberg part of it and the Stanley Kubrick who was supposed to direct it before he died. um instead leaving his last film the um sad horny nightmare eyes wide shut um instead of this. Um but maybe those two things didn't quite join up. I actually really disagree and think that they They are sort of it's a very unique film because of those combination of sensibilities, I would say. There is a sort of an obvious Spielberg family element to this, including the I mean it's another film that the Fable Mans unlocks, I would say. Um it's There's a lot of Spielberg film I would say almost all of the Spielberg's films you look at in a slightly different way after you see the Fablements, because you fully understand what his point of view is on on family. Um And so yeah, this is uh basically about a uh an artificial boy who is adopted by Parents who um who cannot conceive. I believe that's the the reason they adopt him. And so and attempts to assimilate um within their lives, but cannot um because he is an artificial boy and he is not treated the same as other children. And What that c then that kind of turns into a a story where he is separated from his mother this little boy played by Hale Haley Joel Osman and all he wants to do is reunite with his mother. And basically It sort of goes on this I s I suppose you might call it a kind of a a bit of an adventure film in its second half of like exploring how artificial people are just treated as this commodity or like the or basically slaves or they are you know second second class citizens versus other human beings. And um yeah, and so uh encounters these other these other artificial humans who are living as like, you know, sex workers, for example. And Yeah, really interesting sci-fi film. But I think that what makes this for me is that the the very last section of the film is the is the clear Kubrick bit. It's the big swing. There's like a time jump. There's a a things beyond our understanding sci-fi element to it. And then it ties back to the Spielberg mother and son thing in a way that I think is like so beautiful. So so wonderfully done. And I thought I mean I watched this on an airplane and it absolutely destroyed me. Absolutely Annihilated me. Haley Joe Lossman is so good in this film. Jude Law also really good in this film as well. I think There's a there's you know there's a there's like a a a a line like one of the like the last line that Jude Lord delivers in this film that really stays with you and encompasses the themes. of the film so so well. Is that when he says it's sad being a robot? Well I mean it is sort of along those lines if you must be so reductive. Um anyway, I think this film is I think this film is great. What's your where do you stand on AI?

Matthew
01:08:56
I haven't seen this film in uh about twenty years, so I I you know I'm a different person now. I think at the time I was, you know the biggest Spielberg f fanboy going and I thought it w I don't know, I thought it was qu I I remember it being quite schmalzy if I'm if I'm to be honest with you, and not not really getting what the what the big deal is, but Uh you know, there was lots of things which I wasn't into twenty years ago, which when I go back to them now I'm like, oh actually this is like a secret masterpiece that my child brain didn't understand. So I um I definitely need to do that. My lasting memory of AI is going to the cinema and 'cause it came out quite soon after September eleventh. And uh there was it was the first time I saw there were lots of signs all over the cinema saying, you know, basically the first trigger warning I think I ever saw, which is like Uh by this film contains images of the Twin Towers or the Twin Towers in a state of ruin, and so just heads up, that's gonna you're gonna see that in AI. Um Right. And there was a lot of discourse about that at the time, that this was like a post-911 film and da da da da. But uh I you know. Uh a bit of distance I think will probably give give me a better run at this one.

Samuel
01:10:15
Yeah, I think that the um because there is a humanity goes extinct element to this film. I think that mean I think post-COVID that feels a bit different as well. Post-climate change that feels a bit different. That reads a bit differently. So And the other strange thing is I think that at the time, my memory is that they try to market this as being like the next Jurassic Park or something. Because they were AI there were AI toys. In Woolworths? Like they were like the sh the shippy flies around and you could buy a toy of that. What kid is buying a toy of that?

Matthew
01:10:47
But isn't that just that's just where Spielberg is, right, coming out of the nineties? He is you know, the premium purveyor of Blockbuster Thrills. Like the thing that really bugs me is at the time there was this there was a lot of conversation about like what of this comes from Spielberg and what of this comes from Kubrick and there was a load of snobby discourse about all the frivolous shit you don't like is Spielberg. Anything good or smart is Kubrick. And actually I think, you know, if i the understanding we have of those artists, you know, even twenty-five years later, uh i it's much murkier about like who did what and made what and You know, I think Spielberg is a way more interesting filmmaker than people give him, you know, credit for.

Samuel
01:11:29
Yeah, it's I think that's the part of why it's misunderstood though, is that it was trying to it was trying to be the the Kubrick and Spielberg film. Like you say, there's an argument over that, but it was also trying to be a ps you know, like a summer season blockbuster or like just after summer, and it's really not quite that. It's much more It's bit it's slight it's slightly more Oscar film than it is blockbuster. It's sort of awkwardly in between those two things, you know. And most of Spielberg's films, you know, neatly fit into one or the other, I would say, you know, blockbuster or or kind of like more awardsy um fair. Like I feel like that's a bit more bisected in, you know, h in his other work, but Here it's basically both at the same time. And yeah, I think it's really still the test of time. Well, I'd be curious to hear what the listeners think of this. But yeah, I think I personally think this is I I I think it's perfect to watch in 2025. You have a slightly different perspective on it. And like I say, Fableman's j does change your point of view on it as well. But Halo Joel Osman, you know, i I know he was he only really had a five to ten year stretch there of making well five years really, of making really having amazing performances, but yeah, I thought he was amazing.

Matthew
01:12:42
Served his purpose and the world moved on.

Samuel
01:12:44
Indeed. But like I say, the toy thing was weird. It'd be like if they did like the fucking monolith from 2001 of Space Odyssey as a toy you could buy in you know I mean like Yeah, it's a big thing. He does, who's who speaks in like a grumpy old man voice, which is a a great character, but uh yeah, I love this film.

Matthew
01:13:04
Like a proto-Ted Yeah. It's like nice Ted. It's like s it's like a really sincere Ted.

Samuel
01:13:10
Yeah, it is. He's got yeah Ted yeah, he's good Teddy. Okay, what's your uh next pick, Matthew? My next pick is Django Unchained. Ah yeah, not on my list.

Matthew
01:13:19
Yeah, I mean Tarantino could have picked a few for this. It is a cliche for a a man of my age to like Tarantino films, but he makes some of them most surprising, exciting things you see at the cinema, you never really know what you're gonna get. Of his films, you know, the last 25 years. I thought Django Unchained was the one which I wouldn't say like sort of shocked shocked me as such, but I thought there was something kind of outrageously ballsy about doing this tale of a slave seeking revenge on on these plantation owners and how kind of blase and frivolous it was. You know, i whenever anyone dealt with this subject matter, it's always so sort of um you know, rightfully delicate and subtle and uh this was just so sort of obnoxious, there's almost like a pantomime element to the villains in it. Like I I st I still kinda think given like where his career is at, it's kinda crazy to me they managed to get Leonardo DiCaprio to play this absolute shit lord racist in this film. Incredible performance, bit of casting. Samuel Jackson in this film is just immense as this sort of bitter kind of collaborator almost with the Leonardo DiCaprio character and I was just like, man, I've never seen anything like this before. And then the cartoonishness of it, like that crazy costume, the the blue outfit that he wears. One of the best t you know cinema tickets I ever bought in terms of just sitting in the seat and being blown away by how how just unexpected it all was, which is kind of what I want from Tarantino. You know, I've loved a lot of these other films. Kill Bill I think is maybe just a little bit bit too sort of shallow and frivolous to make the list, though it is really striking. I also really like the Hateful Eight, which I know a lot of people are cooler on. because it's so fucking long and basically just a weird weird ass cowboy murder mystery. But yeah this one was this one's brilliant. Jamie Foxx absolutely brilliant in it. I I love Django Unchained.

Samuel
01:15:18
Yeah, it's because I feel like the reason DiCaprio's in this is because that Christoph Waltz's character in Inglorious Bastards takes over that film in such a pronounced way that I imagine Tarantino could have angled it to DiCaprio as the same as like this is the f this is the performance that will take over the film. And I don't think it quite does in the same way. It's an amazing performance, but I think that it's it's much more even-handed between Jamie Foxx and and Christoph Waltz in this film than yeah ha Hans Lander really does just take over in Glorious Bastards in that very particular way. Um yeah I love this film too. Um It's like pulpy and fun, but does have that real world texture, like you say, that real historical context and the tone is just right. Um Yeah, it's and it's got all of the kind of like Tarantino flourishes, like the the bits of idiot bad guys having a discussion about nothing, um kind of like element to it and Yeah.

Matthew
01:16:22
A terrible Tarantino cameo.

Samuel
01:16:25
Yeah, with f Australian is he doing in this? Yeah. I think he is. Awful stuff. And he's like I would say slightly out of shape as well. So it's a bit Oh yeah.

Matthew
01:16:33
The worst thing that happened with relation to this film is I I went to see this with my dad Right. Uh in Leicester Square when it came out and that was a really nice experience. And then we were getting the tube and then my dad pointed out that I looked a bit like Tarantino. But I mean like i like Django era Taratino, which is like massively overweight. It was like awesome. That's what everyone wants to hear.

Samuel
01:16:55
You know I look like you, so joke's on you, you know? Okay, well I'm sorry that that happened to you, I will say. Um but but you know, uh yeah, uh while also being amused by it, I suppose. I mean, you know. Um yeah, I mean it completely threw me off. Yeah, I I thought about um I the problem with Kill Bill is I couldn't pick one or two because I think that They sort of need to travel as a pair because they complement each other so well totally. Obviously they were meant to be one film originally. And so I thought about two a lot when Michael Madsen died recently because his his sort of like sad life in that film is so that character is so understated but real there's something very real about that guy you know I think in some ways that's how I sort of see my life going, you know? Um even less cool than that because I won't be anywhere near like a strip club. But you've not wronged anyone who's gonna come and kill you though No, that's true. I mean, yeah, not not to that extent, I would say. No, it's it's not quite gotten that far. Um yeah, so uh a good a good pick, Matthew. And um yeah, that's it I I think the Samuel L. Jackson thing is interesting because around the time this came out, I don't know if you felt this, but I thought, well that's a guy who I feel like has taken a few too many easy paycheck roles. And does just rock up and do his thing and then sort of like leave again. I mean, maybe it's because he made things like snakes on a plane, but I didn't feel like feel like he was consistently challenging himself. So When he is in this and he's so so good, it's nice to be reminded of how you know what a talent he is, you know.

Matthew
01:18:32
Yeah, just needs to do infinite Oh well there won't be infinite Tarantino films 'cause he's not gonna do anymore, but uh that is just that is such a potent combo combination.

Samuel
01:18:42
Okay, um very different energy for my next one, Matthew. Um my m my most recent film on my list by far is Tar. 2022 Kate Blanchett film. I I would say the up there with a zone of interest for me is like I I thought we were about to say zone of interest. I say post-COVID films that are like masterpieces. And I don't think there are no. any more beside those. I think Oppenheimer's called a little bit in the memory for me and I think that I think Zone of Interest probably should have won best picture that year. I Um that's that's sort of that that's my with a bit of time to think about it, take on on that whole thing. Um but yeah so I guess fake fake biographical film about a like a composer who's not real and sort of her her downfall amid some shaky moral decisions that she's made. um as a teacher and in in the workplace. Um I mean absolutely like electrifying strange Film with an amazing Kate Blanchett performance at the centre of it. Um just has this very I don't it's it's basically a cancel culture film that's not about that in the way where it's like beating you over the head. It's like Yeah, it's it's a very contemporary film in in that respect, but the way it handles that, the way you see her abuse her position as this, you know, one of the most well-regarded composers of her conductors, sorry, of her generation. Um really it's it it's just so it's so good, man. I struggle more than the other films to explain why this is good, but It's really about that performance and the way that the the character treats other people because of the the privilege she's been afforded by her success. That feels as very real as a as a dissection of how great people can behave, you know, when they take advantage of that position. Um plus it has monster hunter in it. So you know, I mean as a punchline. That is indeed uh which yeah, uh again like a really um sort of like great touch. But Yeah, I just found this I didn't I didn't expect this to be as good as it was when I watched it, and I came out for thinking, wow, that's a five-star film right there.

Matthew
01:21:01
It feels like it feels like there's a lot of discussion at the moment around like genius or like the mythology around genius and I'd say this is maybe like more part of that rather than cancel culture specifically. You know, it's like the idea that at w at what level of achievement or skill, if any, you know, are certain things permitted or not? And yeah, it doesn't have any like obvious answers. It's a real like everyone leaves the cinema thinking something completely differently and maybe having some like slightly caustic exchanges with their friends on the way home. Um like it's a good like no, I wouldn't say it like pokes the horn its nest, but it definitely it gets you like th you know, thinking about people or characters you've come across who are a bit like this or have i you know w what you all stomach in the pursuit of quote unquote greatness, perhaps.

Samuel
01:21:58
Yeah. And s it's such a great it's such a uh sort of f fun to watch the downfall as well because like you say I think there is a litmus test element to how you perceive her actions in this film. Um which does make it genuinely interesting on that level. It does not tell you what to think, which is probably key to its success. But sh it is quite fun to watch her lose her mind as she does experience that. So yeah, it's it's funny 'cause this this guy, Todd Field, has he made like three films or something? Just the tiniest handful of films. Yeah and I think this is his first in over ten years. And so You know, it it means something that someone like that would would cut it I guess Jonathan Glazer's probably quite comparable in in that respect, you know, just not the opposite of prolific basically. But when they make something it just it it's kind of earth shattering, you know? So yeah, love this film Matthew. And um that's that's all I've got to say on the matter apparently. What's your next pick? My next pick is Park Chan Wook's The Handmaiden.

Matthew
01:23:04
Ah, of course. I thought this would come up. I've always liked Park Chan Wook, seeing b old boy at the cinema, uh you know, at university was was the such an eye opener of like Well this is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's a adaptation uh the handmaiden that is, is an adaptation of a British novel actually, uh Fingersmith by Sarah Walters. I think she's a Welsh writer, um, which my uh I'm pretty sure my mum has read. I remember when he said he was making an adaptation of this. I was like, what? Like the books my mum reads? The guy who makes Old Boy is making things and in my head it was just gonna be some naff period drama, but uh what he really takes is like the bones of a thriller plot where um a figure a con man called the count enlists this young woman to help sort of aid his scamming of this Japanese heiress where he he gets this young woman to kind of infiltrate um the household and convince her to marry this shady count so that he can take all her money. There's an awful lot of like double crossing and flip-flops and twists in this film. um before it gets to the end. Uh stylistically it's got all the the great stuff that you like from Parchanwork. It's like really in your face. It's really explicit. It's quite creepy. There's this uncle figure in the heiress's life, who's this sort of sadomasochistic, sort of um sort of hentai loving I o or like anti you know, whatever the hentai of the era is. Um but like pr like extreme kind of erotic fiction. Uh a really unpleasant character. Um but there's all that, but I think what I th makes it maybe when a part channel looks like more Like maybe like grown up or like easier to appreciate f to films is that Uh there is this sort of romance at the heart of it. This this this maid begins to fall in love with with the woman she's working for. They have a lot of very explicit lesbian love scenes. watching this at the Bath Film Festival in a crowd of old fogies as some frankly obscene well, I mean it's all obscene, but some stuff involving giant bull bearings which I didn't really understand and I haven't bugged. That's come up before in the podcast. It has, but it I never really know how to talk about it. Anyway, there's stuff in this we're like Like what the fuck is going on with that?

Samuel
01:25:33
I always wait for you to say ball bearing before I laugh.

Matthew
01:25:35
That doesn't look like a thing that should go in someone. Anyway, it's very explicit, but also there is there is a like a romance at the heart of it and there is like a uh a kind of sincerity to that and I just feel that m makes it a bit not grounded but all relatable 'cause the relationship's quite extreme in many ways. but it is definitely it's got more recognizable human behaviour in it than Old Boy, which is this amazing stylistic experiment, but you know, m maybe n you know the the the guy's quite unpleasant in it and you're along for the ride. I wouldn't say you're like, yeah, this is my life. And I, you know, I'm completely on this guy's wavelength, but I think handmaidens like a best of both worlds. Bit more grown up, bit more mature, but also like absolutely filthy and weird.

Samuel
01:26:27
Yeah, I mean, still not seeing it. I know it's come up a few times and um I think it's quite often uh actually cited in these kind of kinds of lists as well. Was it in the New York Times list, Matthew?

Matthew
01:26:39
Yeah, it it was yeah, but look, I think Old Boy was up quite high and this was down lower, I think.

Samuel
01:26:44
Yeah, well Old Boy I guess is like probably the be best known of this director's film by Miles. So that's probably part of it. It looks like it's made a it made a good show. Mmm, I think it was 60 something. Yeah, 67. Um 69 would have been awkward, wouldn't it? Um but uh 60 67's just fine. Uh I I've I will watch this, Matthew. It's still on my watch list from the last time you recommended it to me. Um it is a a staple of UK streamers. I feel like I'm always seeing it pop up. So um Yeah, okay. Good choice. Um here comes the most obvious pick on my list. Actually, there's two really obvious ones in a row here. Um so Zodiac is next, Matthew, number four. Did this make your list? Uh it didn't. No. Yeah, so wanted to pick a Fincher film. It's between this and Social Network. I do think that the particular true crime nature of this and how true crime blurs into h blends into horror is what is is majestic about this film. The idea of a mystery that also has these uh terrifying murder scenes in it and a sense of real danger for the protagonist and a sense of real danger for a for a whole city, you know, for San Francisco. Um uh you know from this uh from this uh serial killer and yeah just I think this has been one of the this is definitely like the ultimate kind of film bro film. It was moderately successful at the time. It was very well reviewed. I think over time its reputation of snowballed, very influential film on, you know, the sort of rise of true crime, I think, as well. Um, just in terms of how it how it examines and dramatizes. elements of elements of that. Um Jake Gyllenhaal doing a really an amazing performance as this reporter who is basically a conspiracy theorist at the same time, just someone who is driven spare by this mystery as many of his colleagues are. I'm probably saying all the same things that we said in our Fincher episode, Matthew. Um but anyway, a cheeky bit of Brian Cox as a newscaster. Oh you know. uh again like goes a uh really adds something um to the mix. Really interesting ensemble to this film generally, really. Like a you know, uh one of the last downy rolls before he gets completely subsumed by That Tony Stark persona. Um so that that definitely has some magic. Mark Ruffalo, who is always kind of like always looks like he should be investigating a crime, either as a cop or a sort of like you're like a down on his luck cop or a sort of like really weathered looking reporter. He's perfect for this as well.

Matthew
01:29:14
I think it might just be the hair that sort of goes everywhere.

Samuel
01:29:16
Um, those are my takes, Matthew, on Zodiac thoughts. Great takes.

Matthew
01:29:20
Thank you. Great film. You know, I was thinking about the sort of David Fincher of it and th there's a few quite big name directors from this period who who didn't make my list and it's like there may be people I like admire more than uh like my personal heart picks. So like a heartwarming drama about found family in a New York restaurant speaks to me a bit more than like a a brilliantly made crime procedural about the Zodiac killer. That's just my my taste, no shade on this pick. Absolutely fair. And it is a super obvious pick, but And it probably is the one of of David Finch's from the last twenty-five years.

Samuel
01:29:59
Yeah, it's it's definitely on the long side. Um, but yeah, there's nothing else that quite quite gives you this this atmosphere, um, amid a a genuinely compelling mystery. So yeah, and we talked about the idea of the the compelling mystery film where the mystery is not solved, like with Memories of Murder, for example, and it can it definitely really ha it's a really potent uh sort of idea to build build a film around. So yeah, what's your next pick, Matthew? It's my basic bitch pick. It's Inception.

Matthew
01:30:28
Oh, I did not expect you to have a Nolan film in here. I think I had to. He's just he's just brought me too much joy in the cinema. I I've maybe been like a little cool cooler on him in like recent years, but there was a time where I just thought everything he was doing was the best. This is the one where I I really um denard over Inception, Dark Knight and Prestige, Dunkirk, four films I really, really loved in the last twenty-five years. Prestige is maybe like the ultimate heart pick, but I just think Inception is is this crazy next level. It was just a film, I remember seeing it, you know At the IMAX with Mick Jagger, as we all know. Taking his sweets. Taking his sweets. It's that old classic. Anecdote number seventeen, load it up. Um Retrieve the tape from the BBC archives. This was definitely the film where I felt like I can't believe someone has been allowed to spend like this much money on something so outlandish. and also that he's been able to like land it and guide us through like quite a complex idea and quite a confusing territory. But y you know, he manages to do it. I mean, I'm not gonna relay the plot of Inception, I feel like everyone's seen it, but th the the the logic and rules of the things are are are are pretty complicated. At a time where blockbusters are getting like dumber and dumber and dumber, I feel like Christopher Nolan's one of the only blockbuster directors who's asking you to like lean in a bit and I think that's that still really, really speaks to me.

Samuel
01:32:04
Yeah, I mean You know, next year we've got the powerful combination of Christopher Nolan and John Bernthal in a film. You know, that's have you have you seen the teaser for that one? I have like three times now. They show it basically every time you go to the cinema.

Matthew
01:32:18
Yeah, I'm not feeling it.

Samuel
01:32:19
That teaser. I'm sort of a bit up and down on his teasers over the years in that fashion though. Like I'm I'm a bit like I don't really care until the proper trailers here, you know?

Matthew
01:32:28
I'm sure it I'm sure it will be good. I went to a I went to a party, he says, making it sound like he has any kind of social life, um, a couple of months ago. where someone told me something about this film. Um that they'd s that they'd seen something uh specific, a specific effect being worked on in real time and said it was really, really cool. So Oh yeah. You you told me that and I was like, Oh yeah, that sounds awesome. And that that that alone w has made me more interested, this fact that I'm not gonna share on this podcast annoyingly, uh but I thought that was better than John Bernthal kind of saying some gruff things to Spider-Man.

Samuel
01:33:07
Yeah, fair enough. Um I'm definitely reserving judgment for the um for the film. Like if you ever watch the original Dark Knight Rises teaser. Where you get a a bit of Bane and a bit of, I think, um Gary Oldman in a bed. It's like a really it's really underpowered compared to the actual Gary Oldman in a bed. Well there's some amaz the the actual trailers they did for the Dark Night Risers were really good, but that first teaser where they clearly just didn't have enough footage to make anything good. Incoherent Gary Oldman in a bed because he got What happened to him? Oh he got shot and then fell into a sewer. It's a very strange film that. Um yeah, just doesn't really uh he's like, oh this power rises. So it's just really vague. You get one shot of Tom Hardy, it's just rubbish. Um so I don't, you know, I'm not too much like, what person can hold a man like that, or whatever he's saying in that trailer. Um yeah, and Spider-Man looking a bit sad. Um yeah, I I I take your point. Um you know, it's just a bit of a just like a wooden horse on a beach in it really. And then John Bernfeld doing that. Do you know I'm gonna make a late change, Matthew, and my number three is not gonna be the Dark Knight because no one needs to hear about that again. I th you know I d I've deliberated this whole time. about putting Dunkirk here for the simple reason that is there a better war film in the last like since saving Private Ryan than that one? Um like the 21st century, this is like the war film, right?

Matthew
01:34:33
In terms of the sound of uh of one Cosmo Jarvis found crying out Warfare, warfare.

Samuel
01:34:41
Um Uh so yeah, but I and I think that every time I watch Dunkirk I'm just blown away by it again in terms of the the fact that it manages to turn this very specific historical moment into a into a thriller, um a very like finely crafted thriller, um where you get these different sort of like layers of the you know, of the battle playing out um, you know, uh uh you know, sort of sea, land and air. Um and so yeah, I think each time I go back, it I it's the film where I'm a bit like Let's slight slight it's a slightly less heartpicky but I admire the execution of, you know. Um whereas I think someone like Interstellar is very easy to be like the heartpick because it's got you know, some c some key emotional scenes in it that that really land. This is a bit more, yeah, it's a bit more of an ensemble piece. This is a bit more of a guy's getting stuff done film. So I think Dunkirk It's a more interesting pick for my number three than the Dark Knight Matthew. Everyone knows that film's good. We already talked about Spider-Man 2, and I thought about putting Spider-Man 2 in here. Instead of The Dark Knight. It might be a film I slightly prefer. If I'm in the mood to watch something, what will I watch? It will be Spider-Man 2. So Yeah, Dunkirk, Matthew. That can go. That can go here instead. Thoughts?

Matthew
01:35:54
I'm not dunking on Dunkirk. I love that film. One of the best one-word line readings of all time from Kenneth Brenner. Home. Yeah. Home.

Samuel
01:36:05
Banging stuff. Uh never you know, it's the only time I've ever been excited by the cliffs of Dover. You know, that's never been an exciting sight for me on a PNO ferry. But in this film, banggin. You know, absolutely off the chain. Real good. Okay, what's your what's your um second to last My second to last one, this is writing or wrong in the New York Times list. You

Matthew
01:36:26
Um they had not one film by the Japanese director, uh Hirokazu Koreida, who is, I would say probably one of the one of the like the most highly lauded and rewarded international film directors of the last twenty-five years. I thought it was crazy. that they didn't put shoplifters, like Father Like Son, I Wish, any any one of his films, just one, just put one in. The idea that oh all Japan has to say is fucking spirited away, that's bonkers to me. Absolutely bonkers. Um so I'm putting in His 2008 film, Coriaders 2008 film, Still Walking. I've undernaught over this one also because I think he's probably made four or five of the best films of the last 25 years, but I've picked this one. He is one of the best directors of drama living today. an observer of naturalistic Japanese family dramas. Like I say, most people probably know him from shoplifters, which I think is actually one of his more outlandish plots. This earlier work is about a family coming together to m to mourn the death of a of their son who died many years ago saving a boy in an accident. And it's basically about all the baggage they've carried through the parents' baggage towards their their remaining son, the son's baggage with his parents. He's also married a woman who's already got a son and that's causing issues with the family and just over the course of the weekend all this stuff comes out. I don't want to say it's like Mike Lee or Ken like it isn't social realism. I mean it is realistic, but I wouldn't say it's about like anything particularly political, it's purely about relationships in his films, uh, you know, between family members, probably with some some cultural specific Japanese quirks to them, obviously. But I th I don't know, I just think he's one of the one of the the the best to ever do it. You know, his films are really, really subtle. More recently he's made some uh shows for Netflix. He did the uh Oh, I can't remember it was about geishas in in Kyoto. That was really cool. The Makanai, I think it was. And he did Asura, which was like a a family drama about all these Warring Sisters, um, which came out earlier in the year which I absolutely loved. But uh his film work is just something else he casts. Brilliant actors, brilliant child actors as well. Like considering the families often have young people in them, that's very, very hard to get right, but He probably i is the best director of child actors. Like it's the films where they are more prominent, you'll be amazed by some of the s some of the stuff he gets out of them. It's a bit of a academic one that, but I do really, really love Kori Ada. It was dis I just couldn't believe it. Like, he's a darling of cats like he I would say, you know, he is Japan's most prominent director currently. And you know, if there's gonna be like multiple Park Chan Wuck films or multiple Bong Jun Ho films in this list, I'm like, I I just I don't know. I would have thought the same people would've would've would have liked these films. I don't know. Maybe not.

Samuel
01:39:40
Yeah. I don't know. It's w it's it's weird. I feel like there's maybe a I don't know, a contemporary fascination with Korean cinema that doesn't extend to other Asian cinema scenes. You know? I don't know.

Matthew
01:39:55
It's more like genre cinema as well, I guess. Like that that they're a bit more accessible and enjoy you know there's something more purely enjoyable about um memories of murder or parasite or old boy or whatever Where like, you know, even as I was saying it, I was like, this doesn't sound very convincing as my number two pick, a load of people being sad about their dead son. Like this doesn't feel like Sam's gonna be rushing to watch this one but I think you'd like it.

Samuel
01:40:23
Did the um did that drive my car not get into the list? Did that not make the list? Japanese director, right?

Matthew
01:40:30
I don't know. I actually f I actually found that one a little too uh highfalutin and highbrow for me.

Samuel
01:40:35
I've not watched it for the simple reason it's a hundred and seventy-nine minutes long. Um and that will rule out so many films for me.

Matthew
01:40:42
Uh I think it requires quite uh exact knowledge of The plot of Uncle Vanya for all of it to make sense as well.

Samuel
01:40:49
Well I'm br I'm broading that one out completely from for myself then. That's not gonna happen. Um I I but I've still never seen a Koreator film, so that's on that's on me.

Matthew
01:40:57
Oh yeah, cor yeah, like It was a toss-up really between Stillwalking, this film, and a film called I Wish, which is maybe a a bit more e easier to enjoy about these two little boys going on a road trip to do they want to go to the location where two bullet trains pass each other 'cause they hear that there's a release of energy at that point, which will let one of them make a wish. So it's a little bit it's not magic realism, but it's it's a a little bit more out there.

Samuel
01:41:24
Alright, well uh again, that's gonna go on the list too, Matthew. Um that's that's my um Still walking, that's my vow to you. Um I've got far more boring two and one here on that. I'm afraid I've got no discovery for you whatsoever. But number two was not on the New York Times list and I get why because I think it's as a British film it's maybe not on their radar, but sexy beast is Oh my I w I saw this at the cinema last year and I'd seen it once before. Cause it is my it's like one of the few films my mum's like, this film is amazing. This film's incredible. Like we there was some reason that she I think she had to teach media studies in college and early in her career a teaching career and this is one of the films that they would they would teach there. So and she said she just became fascinated with it from from teaching it and from learning more about it as she was teaching it and she has like no other passion for cinema like doesn't even really care and I watched it and I think I thought Oh well it's just a sort of another of these fucking Guy Ritchie sort of gangstery films, isn't it? And then re-watched it last year. You know, kind of having seen every Glazer film apart from birth since then. So I've seen under the skin and the zone of interest basically. It's not prolific as mentioned. But you know, and then thinking right, okay, I've seen the zone of interest, I should go back and watch this and see if how see how differently I feel about it. And you do get this feeling in ev almost every scene that it does something you've not seen before. Or it just constantly surprises you and subverts you. It like technically fits that. sort of like British crime thing that was happening in the in the Nort in the nineties. But it's like the best Weirdest, most exciting, most inventive version of it. Um, with obviously this amazing, um, amazing banking sleep performance. That has only been partially ruined by Adam Buxton's podcast. Where he cuts the clips of going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like those bits I think he's um partially ruined, um, but even though it is funny, um, which is okay. Um, but just such a Uh I I I love every performance in this film. I love Ray Winston sort of like trying to keep his cool in the company of this psychopath. I love his like pathetic little mate who's there with his wife, um, who's like obviously absolutely shit scared of Ben Kingsley. That actor's that actor's face is brilliant. There's sort of like pathetic cockney beater energy to him that's just really sort of spot on. And yes, s sort of like Sunburnt Ray Winston, Ian McShane who going to all these weird orgies, fucking Big Rock being knocked down the you know, like the cliff into their sort of villa. This film was fucking amazing. It's like f I wouldn't uh change a single thing about it. I think it's like a total five-star masterpiece. And Re-watching it, I was like, I f I think I just forgot how delightfully entertaining it was. Because I think you in my head I think of the Ben Kingsley character as like uh Well, it it the it's all about the f the first act is all about waiting for him to turn up, right? And when he turns up he takes over the film. But it's yeah, it's just got uh it's it's it's just much more entertaining. That I remembered it being. And I think maybe it's because Glazers' films are have been so much more challenging since then. But this film is terrific, man. It's absolutely by far the best of Any film resembling this from this time period. What do you think?

Matthew
01:44:58
I remember loving it back in the day. I think this is one my my um dad showed me. He didn't compare me to anyone in this film, which is most of him. Um That's you but sunburnt sun. You didn't say that. Right. Uh yeah, I yeah, I I I do really need to go go back and see this. I think and this is gonna sound really dumb. I've I've conflated parts of this film with Inbruges. They are very different. But the the Ray Fine's character turning up quite late and being quite caustic and straight talking in Inbruges. He's got a little bit of the bankings of energy in this. And I yeah, I definitely need a refresher. I didn't know they re-released at the cinema. I should have caught it.

Samuel
01:45:38
It might have just been one of those l um picture house like one-off screenings. Right. Um But it's it's funny 'cause I went there and I was sat next to uh like a a young lad who was watching it with or a teenager lad who was watching it with his mum and I thought, Oh, that's kind of like what it was what it was like with me watching this with my mum. It's odd Odd but quite nice to see that um happen in um in real time. Um so yeah it's uh it's so good. Um it's yeah uh I when I was just like blown away by it. I was like, what Would you change about this? Every time there's something he something he can do that's unlike you know uh un unlike anything you've seen in this genre, he does it. And so you just see that raw talent on the screen. Um it's brilliant. So Yeah, what's your final film, Matthew?

Matthew
01:46:23
My final film, a big dollop of recency bias, and some semi-recent chat on the podcast, uh, Parasite. Oh right, of course. What I liked about this film, and we talked a lot about this when we did the Bon Jun Ho episode, is that it's quite a sort of subtle, unusual take. on the kind of rich poor divide. It's not a crude Eat the Rich film, you know, of which there is a lot doing the rounds at the moment and it's almost become a bit a bit kind of meaningless. This story of like a a kind of a str a striving but unfortunate family of quite skilled grifters who've just been sort of dealt a bit of a bad hand. uh infiltrate uh the life of a very rich family by um sort of setting themselves up as as various sort of servants in their household. and it sort of escalates from there, but I think they're a an interesting depiction of a family. I don't think the rich family are just like out and out bastards. And that gives it just a lot more to kind of chew on. Uh it also just functions as an absolutely brilliant thriller. I mean ev everyone always talks about this one in terms of you know how meaningful it is or its political messages or its socioeconomic kind of criticisms, but actually I I think you can just enjoy it on the level of what mad shit is gonna happen to this family next and where the hell is this film gonna go and It's kind of pristine in the way it's made. It's just so sharp and clinical and yeah, I was I was really taken with it that that rewatching it for that that podcast and I was like this is This is like one one of the best guys to do it at at his very best for my money.

Samuel
01:48:20
has that social relevance no matter where you live. Um and it's I think it's sadly only getting more relevant um to people's lives as we willingly accept the decline of um Western civilization And that's that's our like our whole deal now in the UK and the US that's what that's really what we're doing, that's what we're about. Um Not ideal really. Yeah, great, great film. We did both agree it was number one, right? I think so, yeah Yeah, I think so that makes sense.

Matthew
01:48:53
I don't think you were coming in with like a weird Mickey seventeen vote.

Samuel
01:48:56
No, it was I think it was more it was just this versus memories of murder, wasn't it? I think the tech I think it's just the the evolution in filmmaking is pro is what I think maybe put it puts this ahead, you know?

Matthew
01:49:09
Yeah, I just I just think this has more to say about like the modern moment and Yeah, it just r it just resonates way more th with me than Memories of Murder, which is like expertly made. I mean you cannot fool memories of murder, but I c I can't say it hugely resonates with me.

Samuel
01:49:26
Yeah, yeah. So that's yeah, so we We both actually you did no I did put Memories of Murder ahead of um okay that's all right but we both um agreed that Parasite was number one that's that's all that matters is the collective um the collective pick Matthew And of course, um Barking Dogs Never Bite was at the bottom and all those real dogs were barking in the background of that episode recording while we were talking. But that was so weird, wasn't it? Um that was one of those moments where I was like, oh, maybe my life is a TV show. Maybe I am dreaming parts of this from a coma that I experienced ten years ago or something. Um anyway. Do you ever wonder if you're just a hallucinating AI? Okay, my number one is ri I mean, I don't think you would see this coming really, but I picked the Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring, Matthew. That was that was my eleventh. Oh, well there you go. Um, I mean I I thought what does sum up the twenty-first century of watching cinema to me? And I think it's this film. It's this film that has that Sort of like what Star Wars had to the previous generation of being yeah, like the memes, the way it's embedded in culture, the way that The other day my girlfriend turned to me and went, mushrooms, in that very specific way, because I mentioned mushrooms. um being a plot in the film Friendship, that um the the Tim Robinson film. Um and so just the way it it sort of like sunk into everything because it was just such a huge moment. And the way it's become this, I think, like comfort film for millennials to always do the trilogy rewatch around Christmas. I personally don't have that relationship with it. I think it's a watch every five to ten year kind of thing for me because I watched it so much at the time when it came out in the original theatrical version and of course extended editions, Matthew, those um those bo those like green, red and blue boxes are like uh proper millennial ephemera, you know? With like way too many DVD extras. No one's got time for that shit. Except my dad doing a stack of ironing in the year two thousand and two. He was having a great time.

Matthew
01:51:33
Like oh I do want to know how they made the chain mail.

Samuel
01:51:37
That was it. I would watch I would walk in on him watching the most boring stuff while I and in my little brother's like school T uh you know sch uh school uniform or whatever. Um this first film, obviously the best. I can't remember when we've talked about this before. It probably came up in that Lord of the Rings episode we did like, you know what, four years ago now? That episode? Long time. Um but you know this this first film has that sense of a journey to it. You have the fellowship together, you have a big battle in it, but it's the battles don't take over the film in the way that I think they do in Um Two Towers and Um Return of the King. You know, the battles are very much like you have quite a lot of them to get through. They are the centerpiece of the whole thing. The scale of this one is just right for me. Um you have like the uh amazing array of settings of like Rivendale and Moria and you know just uh yeah, it's that that that feeling of an an adventure. And then the vibe changes when you have to accommodate Gollum in the second and third ones, which is a bit of a creative choice. I'm I get it's it's part of the film it's part of the story, but uh there's a bit too much of it for me or it takes over the film a slightly too much This though is like a five star masterpiece to be Matthew thoughts.

Matthew
01:52:43
Yeah, I I completely agree with everything you say. I'm particularly the our our generation Star Wars, like that's that's very much what I was thinking of when I I r you know put it down on my list. Uh Just a yeah, a hugely important film. Uh yeah, the the memes of it all the little quotes. Even just like a certain generation of actors. that that mean a lot to everyone who is there and they're quite unusual actors really in hindsight. Like the idea that there's just loads of people who are like really into Vigo Mortison because of this film. That must be quite puzzling to people who are like maybe ten years younger but there you go. Just a huge cinematic event. And uh like not for nothing, you know? It was seeing at the time, you were like, well I've never seen anything on that scale before. and the craft of it and how realistic it all looked and the special effects and the locations and oh my god just uh you know. the kind of high point of that that era of blockbuster filmmaking, you know, never never quite the same.

Samuel
01:53:47
It was the sheer punt of it of we'll make all three at the same time. And it'll all be by the same guy, the same production team. It will all be consistent. We'll take that bigger bet. I mean, I've never they've never done anything like that since then.

Matthew
01:54:01
The mad thing is as well is like when you actually go back and look at like the budgets on it, by today's standards they're not really anything that spectacular. You know? And you're like, it costs that much to get like the rock Ryan Reynolds and Galga Dot in that fucking Red notice or whatever. That's thermally shit film. That's that's what that money buys you now, you know, twenty-five years later. Yikes

Samuel
01:54:30
Yeah, that's it. And it was nothing about it really like there's no stars in it. There's no Peter Jackson was a respected director, but not a hugely commercial one. Like All of it was a bit more of a punt than it may be you realize in retrospection.

Matthew
01:54:46
It made stars th it made stars though. Like Oh yeah.

Samuel
01:54:59
I just watched the Michael Mann film The Keep a few months ago. And let me tell you, he stank out the joint so bad so badly. And I noticed that you you've reviewed something on Lairboxed. where you I think you alluded to him being honking in something like this year. It's that happened. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Like you I think you called him a bit ripe. And but maybe directors were too polite to tell him to dial it down.

Matthew
01:55:25
Is that correct? Uh yeah, Ice. I i I think he is he's having a bit of a rough patch recently. Hmm. Well he's very old, isn't it? You know, he can't just keep, you know

Samuel
01:55:34
Yeah.

Matthew
01:55:35
Yeah.

Samuel
01:55:36
He needs to get get that fucking magneto hat back on him. Is he in that is he in that? I don't think he is actually. I don't think he's in the cast for the the new one. Um I think Patch peased you is. He can't ever escape it, but I think Ian McKellen might not be.

Matthew
01:55:49
He gets to sit in a chair.

Samuel
01:55:50
It's a bit easier for you.

Matthew
01:55:51
Old Pat old um 'Cause Ian McKelleny he had that fall, didn't he, when he was on stage in London. So you know, maybe he's a bit sort of dodgery on his feet now. Yeah. Oh well. Well they aren't flying him up to the top of a fucking mountain in a helicopter uh for Lord of the Rings for any time soon. C

Samuel
01:56:09
No. Um it's weird thinking that Vigo Mortenson has reached the age that um Ian McKellen was In the when he went this film. Yeah, subsetting, isn't it? No one wants to hear that.

Matthew
01:56:21
It's you know, is that one of those like Cliff from Cheers was twenty-five kind of situations. Twenty-five? You know in the cannon of the rings, yeah. He's twenty-eight. That's what twenty-eight year olds look like in two thousand.

Samuel
01:56:37
What the fuck? Twenty-five Cliff from Jesus Oh dear. I always wonder how those actors feel. If you're real Pearlman and you see everyone putting that image around saying, can you believe she was only like 29 in this photo and like uh everyone on the internet is going, uh how about Alec must make it.

Matthew
01:56:59
I think well the thing is real poem doesn't look like I wouldn't say she looks super old now.

Samuel
01:57:04
Well no, I think it's one of these th I don't even think John Ratzenberger looks much older than he did in Cheers. He just I think back then you just ate you reached middle age at the a uh twenty-eight and then just sort of c and hovered around there for the next fifty years of your life. I th I th I don't know if that's like a post-Vietnam thing or I don't really know, but it's lots to think about there. Um So yeah, Lord of the Rings, um what a banger. Um I hope they re- re-release these in the cinema at some point. I assume they will for the Twenty fifth anniversary. That's this year, isn't it? No, it's next year, sorry. Next year.

Matthew
01:57:44
come and watch all three of them in a day and I've just not got the guts to do it.

Samuel
01:57:48
I think that's why I've not been, because they never space them out.

Matthew
01:57:51
They're like, yeah it has to be an endurance test.

Samuel
01:57:53
That's not how I enjoy cinema So yeah, they need to be on like three successive weekends. That's what they did with Spider-Man. They did one, two and three. And the same amount of people went to one and two. My partner said like three people went to see Spider-Man 3, which is tough. Um, you know. Okay Matthew, that was very fun. Um so, yeah, really enjoyed talking about those with you. I think that was a good little episode. What um anything else you want to talk about from your films that didn't make the cut?

Matthew
01:58:18
I couldn't quite find a place for Mission Impossible.

Samuel
01:58:22
Oh yeah. What would be the the highest out of it?

Matthew
01:58:24
I mean we we will never see eye to eye on this. I I think purely for my nostalgia of the moment in the cinema, I would still pick Ghost Protocol with the the um Birch Khalifa uh we do agree on that.

Samuel
01:58:39
We do agree on that. We agreed on that last time. We both agreed Ghost Protocol's number one. Yeah.

Matthew
01:58:43
Right, okay, then go I ca yeah, I I just remember there was a lot of back and forth, so Mission of Possible Ghost Protocols in the Mix, uh The Incredibles, also directed by Brad Byrd. Wow! That's your Pixar from pick from the Uh well it's it's but it's that all ratatouille.

Samuel
01:59:00
Oh interesting.

Matthew
01:59:01
I'm a Brad Bird guy, what can I say?

Samuel
01:59:03
Oh fair enough. Um, you know, uh it's uh yeah those I mean those are obviously he's an amazing visual storyteller. I love Bratatouille as well Um one of my most cursed memories is um I fell asleep after eating Christmas dinner um with a massive paunch from how much dinner I'd ate. with like a Christmas cracker hat on me that tilted slightly forward while I was drooling on the spot and my brother took a photo of me. It's the worst photo of me ever taken. And I wasn't even at my fattest then, but somehow it's like the most cursed. How's that like Ratatouille? Oh no, is it we were watching Ratatouille at the time? Oh right. Sorry. I forgot to point that bit out. It's it's it's game late. Um Great anecdote. Speaking of Ratatouille Sorry, I missed a really key detail that made that a story. I was just like, is there a scene in Ratatouille where that happens? Anyway, that's um that's embarrassing. Wells Matthew.

Matthew
01:59:55
Royal Tenenbalms? Oh yeah. Yeah. I just I I used to like the Wes Anderson stuff a lot more, I think, when I was when I was younger. Uh you know, I do d the f I think the first time you see him do his shtick is like pretty mind blowing 'cause you're like, well, I've never seen anything like that and you know the bird flying at the start set to hate you is uh Like a r uh a key cinematic memory for me. It's it's way too dumb to include it here, but I I did write down L Bridesmaids as a comedy. Oh yeah, that's not a dumb film.

Samuel
02:00:25
That's got a melancholy edge to it, that film.

Matthew
02:00:28
Bride Bridemaids, the bit where Christenwig is takes the drugs on the plane and is out of our mind. That is I think one of the funniest things in a film I've ever seen. I will I've we watched that clip so many times on YouTube where she's being rude to Rose Byrne and she's all like, Oh you do, oh you do it's great.

Samuel
02:00:50
It's um do you know what one of my go-to comedies is, is Spy. I've got Oh yeah, that's good. It is good. I got my family to watch that. I got my partner to watch that. I got friends to watch that. Spy is like if it's on a streamer, that's a what a really fun film. It's it's slightly better than a guilty pleasure, you know.

Matthew
02:01:08
Yeah. I th I think uh uh like my my little triple whammy of that is Bridesmaid's spy and the heat. Oh, I've not seen the heat. You forget how funny Sandra Bullet can be, and she's a great foil to Mr. McCarthy in it. And like the Boston of it all is they have a lot of fun with it. I'm gonna watch that. Like I'm gonna watch that this weekend. Oh, that's that's really good. She's got these terrible brothers in it. I think one of them film burr And they just like fucking ride her ass the whole time. It's it's really good. I'm absolutely I'm gonna watch that, like that's number one next to the first one.

Samuel
02:01:45
You're like, uh the family drama about the dead son. I don't know. The heat Well, it some good comedies are so thin on the ground, that's the thing. So I d I did like Paul Fagan she shouldn't have made all those shit films with her husband and just made films with Paul Fage, 'cause she has an amazing talent, but

Matthew
02:02:01
Yeah. What a stinkarooney of a run she's had. Yeah, it's tough. Any others, Matthew? I really liked Hero back in the day. But I haven't watched it for a long time, so I thought it felt a bit like a twenty-one-year-old Matthew would have put that in, but I don't know about now. And uh a film I picked out when we did our thriller episode, the Argentinian Short Story Collection Wild Tales, I will always recommend that to people. Really caustic little f Thrillers, but s many of them kind of compiled into one film.

Samuel
02:02:34
That I really like. Oh, good stuff. Those are all um yeah, all interesting suggestions. Wild Tales, again, I should make sure I add that in my uh My letterbox list. Um but obviously I've betrayed all that by saying I'm gonna watch the Heat next. That's tough.

Matthew
02:02:46
Yeah, that's fine. I as long as you watch something, that's good. Um what about you? What will we say the first?

Samuel
02:02:52
Okay, so the twenty to eleven. Yeah, okay. Um and I'm not saying this is like the Uh definitive forever. This is a you know, this could all change if you ask me in two weeks, but I want to. This is gonna change after you watch the heat. Exactly. Um so number 20, I put get out A bit of one of those sort of like I've I've seen it twice and I think it is lessened when you know what is actually going on and what's gonna happen, but it's just one of those big cultural moment films that where it lived up to the hype, you know? Yeah. Um I but really like Nope as well by Jordan Peel. Um you know but I can't wait to see his next film. uh Daniel Caluya, don't know what happened to him um after we made that Xbox advert, not seen him too much. Um since that that and Nope were like the last times I think anyone really saw that guy. Um I Wally was my um Pixar of Choice Matthew. That's my number nineteen. I know um some people are mixed on the second half of that. film but um I just see too much of myself in the space tourists do your dad turn to you and go that's you Matthew fuck off dad That's not me saying that about you, by the way. Um, I would never I would never never say such a thing. Okay, Spider-Man 2 is my number 18, so it was in here too. Um zone of interest I had at 17.

Matthew
02:04:05
That's a that's a hard swerve from Spider-Man too.

Samuel
02:04:08
Yeah, in some ways the zone of interest was too hard to talk about in a frivolous podcast, you know. But it but it is incredible. Um The Departed was number 16. Um so the only Scorsese having there. Uh I think um I think that is the best modern Scorsese film though. Um you know for certainly the The most walks that line between entertaining and good. You know, I'm not putting silence in this list. You know what I'm saying? Um Michael Clayton, number 15, Matthew. Um only saw that for the first time recently though, so I didn't want to put it too high. Um but it is very, very, very good. Um Clooney obviously excellent in that film. Parasite I had at 14, Social Network at 13, um Memento I had at twelve and Mad Max Fury Road I had at eleven. So Those are the films. I think that was a rich discussion. Yeah, and a lot of stuff I don't think we talked about in detail before, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Enjoyable Oh well that's it. The podcast is very much over. Um Matthew, people know where they can find us on social media because everyone who listens to this are among our most um you know most loyal listeners of course on the Patreon. We're very grateful for your support as ever. Next month we're actually bringing back the film club and we're gonna talk about two films. We haven't decided what those are yet, Matthew, have we? So um we'll we'll hash that out. It's not gonna be as heavy as threads and speak no evil. It will be more fun than that. That's our promise to you. And uh yes, we have other other f other fun surprises coming up. Anything. It's true, it leaves it very wide open. But uh yeah, thank you so much for listening and we'll be back soon. Goodbye. Goodbye
