Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, after your borderline delusions mid-episode last week, where it was clear... What? Well, you were incredibly ill, and you told stories about fishermen that didn't go anywhere.
Are you feeling... Not minding it, I think the listeners quite enjoyed them, but are you feeling better after that ordeal?
Yeah, yeah, hopefully. Hopefully I'm fighting fit for this DS draft, but that may still be Tales of the Sea. Who knows?
Anymore like anecdotes about comedy mackerel signs, et cetera, anything more? Something like that to throw into the pot or do you think we're all good now?
No, I've got it out of my system.
Yeah, we covered a lot of like fish town based content in that episode. So yes, that was the what we've been playing for people who are curious from last week. This week Matthew is fighting fit and it's good that he is because we have to do the DS draft this week.
I say we have to do, I've actually been looking forward to this for quite a long time. So people who listen to the podcast a long time will know that we do console drafts as kind of, I guess they've become our signature episodes a little bit Matthew, and maybe more so than the best of the different year episodes because the drafts let people vote on the winners. We stole the idea from the Big Picture podcast, but it's gone pretty well.
I think it has quite a different flavor to those podcasts because that's obviously a film podcast. So yeah, I think it's created some of our most dramatic and interesting moments Matthew.
Yeah, I think they're the favorite episodes of our classiest listeners and then the sickos like Game School, that's the divide.
Yeah, I think so, yeah, yeah. Because I think you get on this, you basically get like a first half that's fairly nutritious content about the console itself and the history of the console and its place in the pantheon of other sort of games hardware. And then in the second half, it just becomes a bit sort of bananas and me and Matthew just chucking shit at each other, trying to undermine the other one psychologically, et cetera.
So it's gonna be fun. We're gonna pick 15 DS games each to represent the best of the catalog.
Holy moly, that's a lot of DS games.
It is, and Matthew did already message me beforehand saying, can we not let this one run three hours because I have to edit this one. And I was like, look, Matthew, I'll try my best. But also if you end up monologuing about, I don't know, radiant Historia for like 30 minutes, who am I to stand in your way?
Don't try and sound me out about things I may or may not include. I know your tactics. All this weekend, we've been posting little tweets and things about our research, but I know that the other person has been looking at those tweets, analyzing them for potential avenues.
Yeah, the thing is that this is an interesting draft because we're back in Matthew's home turf. Obviously Matthew has a long history covering Nintendo consoles and was there on NGamer during the DS days. So obviously has as deeper connection with the DS as I did with the PS3 when we did that episode.
So this is your home territory, Matthew. Are you feeling nervous about doing the episode? Really?
Isn't that that bad?
It is my home territory, but also my brain is now soup 15 years after I covered these games. Researching this, there are games where I've like, wow, that's crazy. I've never even heard of that game.
And then you follow the rabbit hole of Metacritic and realize that I reviewed it for NGamer. And you're like, oh shit, that's bad.
Oh, incredible. That's like memento sort of like games reviewer version. It's like, it turned out it was you all along who gave, I don't know, contact six out of 10 or whatever.
Guy Pierce looking in the mirror going, why does my chest say Jump Ultimate Stars 82?
82, that seems high. Yeah, so that's fun. So Matthew's got a lot of DS insights.
And in the first half here, we're gonna dig into the history of the hardware. Then second half, we'll do those 15 categories and we'll draft and you'll be able to vote on the winner at Back Page Pod in the pinned tweet. No, I don't have a better solution for polls yet as the Twitter platform goes to shit week by week, but we'll see how it goes.
Usually it's okay. I mean, last time the poll stopped working after four days. That was good, but fingers crossed it goes okay.
So the Nintendo DS, Matthew, the Game Boy Advance was only three and a half years old when the DS was released. When it was revealed in January 2004, Nintendo described it as a third pillar next to the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. They even said they had a true successor to the GBA in the works in February 2004, implied to be alongside the DS.
And so the DS was meant to be its own little thing. Was this them hedging their bets, Matthew? How much do you think Nintendo really had riding on the DS?
And do you think they would have cut their losses pretty quickly and rushed out a GBA successor if they really had to?
Hard to say, but I do believe the line that this was something else, you know, that this was a third way they were proposing. It's a third way Iwata and Miyamoto as the two kind of main spokespeople of Nintendo at the time, clearly wanted to become the main way, the only way, and indeed it did. You know, like actually that their idea of kind of zigging where everyone else sags, not doubling down on power but looking more towards, you know, unique hardware, interesting interfaces, interesting inputs, as a way of kind of getting out of the graphics arms race, which is basically what they wanted to get out of and they fundamentally did with both the DS and Wii.
But the talk in the run-up to it isn't the talk of like we're betting everything on this, it's very much the talk of we're gonna try this, we think this about where consoles are going, we want to try this instead, but we still have the GBA and it's kind of an interesting period to think about in terms of how much information we have about it. Because obviously there are interviews with with Iwata and Miyamoto from the time, but this predates things like Iwata Asks where they're a lot more open about their sort of thought process and you know a lot more kind of explicit about what they were doing. You can glean things from that period of openness that follows.
Like one of the interesting things actually in the Iwata Asks about the 3DS is they talk to the main hardware engineer on the 3DS, the guy who designs the console on a chip, the heart of any machine and he says, we obviously started working on 3DS before DS was out. Like that's the kind of timeline we're on with these things. And he says back then, this was a, you know, we were, our remit was trying to get home console graphics in a handheld.
That's what we thought the thing after the DS would be, which may be, if you want to force the narrative onto this, which I do, you could say, maybe that's the more conservative kind of GBA family line. You can almost see them pitching a version of that, if that makes sense.
Yeah, I can sort of see that. I think that one thing that makes me cast doubt a little bit on their narrative is that after 2004, the GBA games do dry up quite quickly.
Yeah, there is that.
So you have like Minish Cap the next year and you have things like Final Fantasy Advance games coming out and Gunstar Super Heroes. So you have a bunch of GBA games, but it does feel like all of the major stuff is being thrown at the DS after that. So yeah, but no, I think that's an interesting way of looking at it, certainly.
One of the funny things Oata says in one of the interviews, basically when they announced the DS already, people are going, well, this is going to be a DS PSP fight, right? And he's like, well, no, the PSPs rivals the GBA. That's what the PSPs against.
The DS is something else entirely. It's not really, so they work, whether or not they plan to stick to this line, I quite liked their dedication to the GBA is still in play, as a pitch.
Yeah, that's one of the interviews I read with IGN US about this. I think it was like one of the Nintendo US sales representative people who said that, oh, we're still selling GBA SPs in droves and very much hammering home the idea that this is something else and not just a GBA successor. But it's interesting because I think we can come back to this a little bit, but there was very early on before these consoles released, there was very much a PSP versus DS narrative that emerged.
And I think that at the time, I remember people seeing it as, oh, coming off the success of the PS2, Sony's about to monster the hardware, the handheld space as well, in a way that has done with the home market where the PS2 completely dwarfed the GameCube. And I think those people wrote off the DS because it was such a high concept pitch for a handheld, the idea of a handheld that has two screens. And so a key part of the ethos behind the DS creation, Matthew, was gaming population expansion, which was Satoru Iwata's brainchild.
At TGS 2003 Keynote, he reportedly expressed concern that games were becoming too complicated. The touch screen allowed more intuitive play was the thinking. And that's something where he was clearly ahead of the curve when we look at where mobile gaming comes from.
Nintendo were there first. Matthew, fundamentally, why did the DS succeed as much as it did? Was it to do with this philosophy of anyone can play?
Yeah, I think so. It definitely ties to specific bits of software which bust them out of their traditional audience. You don't want to just say all the DS is successful because of Nintendogs and brain training, but Nintendogs and brain trainings do a lot of heavy lifting and you just have a look at the sales numbers for those games and how many units they shifted just to play those single games.
And that definitely speaks to this growing audience. I think it's a bit better balanced than that. It's interesting listening to Awata's speech from, I think, the 2005 GDC, where he was sort of pitching, talking about the revolution to come, but was being a bit more explicit about the DS.
And maybe it was just because he was talking to a room of game developers there and traditional gamers, but he really doubled down on the, this hardware is still for kind of our core audience too. And this kind of awakens interesting thinking for us. And this allows us to do interesting things with our kind of traditional territory, you know, he famously opens that speech with like, you know, I have the heart of a gamer and we all have the heart of gamers and all this kind of stuff.
It's very easy, I think, just to go, oh, it's this one, you know, it's this one thing, but I think they saw it as a slightly broader church than that. I think they also, they're quite open about being surprised at how successful it was. You know, while this was Oata's big philosophy, rather than competing for the same 100 million people, why don't we try and find new people outside of this?
He often says throughout multiple Oata asked interviews, like how lucky they were that Nintendogs did what it did, and how lucky they were that Brain Training did what it did, and Wii Sports did what it did on the Wii. And they always say they hoped it would be right, and they thought it would be the right direction, but they weren't sure of anything basically.
Yeah, I think even when the DS was a success, Oata was quite cagey about the Wii being an automatic success off the back of it. Like there wasn't necessarily any sort of presumption that they were gonna dominate at all. They were like, yeah, I think taking it back is probably a fair way of putting it.
So the DS does immediately become a commercial success. It launches in November 2004 in the US, March 2005 in Europe, and Christmas 2004, it was apparently like the hot thing to the hot toy to get hold of. And I was curious, Matthew, how much of what made the DS great do you think was there at the very start in the hardware and the software?
It's immediately a big success on the market, but when does it actually get good, the DS?
I think it's like late 2005, early 2006. I think the DS light is super important, because while the DS is a success, it is kind of rank. I'm kind of amazed that the DS did well out the gates as well as it did, when you see what it became and just how much more appealing the light was.
You know, 2006 is also the year it gets New Super Mario Bros. Pokémon Diamond Pearl, Brain Training. You know, these are like three big, big hitters for it.
But like, you know, I also throw a bone to late 2005, because that's where I feel like you begin to get the first generation of really good core games, because that's where you get like Ace Attorney, you get Trauma Center, Castlevania, Dawn of Sorrow. Those are really strong things. They all come out here like March, April in Europe, I think.
So even the following year. So around that period, I mean, I'll be honest, I wasn't following it too closely. You know, I was at university up until April, May 2006, going into my final year at university and having to focus on like exams and not like crashing out with like no degree, which could have been a thing that would have happened and would have been terrible.
And so the idea of spending too much time thinking about the DS, like I didn't own an original Fat DS. I obviously didn't have any money, I was a student. So it's a sort of period that sort of passes me by and I definitely join NGamer just as it's riding the wave of DS mania, like DS lights, there's New Super Mario Brothers was reviewed in the first issue of NGamer.
Like it's forever tied with the DNA of those early days of the mag, that particular period of time.
Yeah, I get you. I mean, for me, I actually had a PSP shortly before I had a DS. So like you, I was very unconvinced by the original hardware.
It just looked quite like the form factor was a bit wrong. It kind of looked like two consoles stuck together, you know, in the first situation.
It's so angular. Catherine's got one and it's got these like, awful, apologies Catherine, listen to this. It's got these awful decals that she stuck on it from a Fisher Nintendo magazine.
That's not what Nintendo did to it. She was younger at the time, that's fine. But actually, when you look at the decals, you're like, these could have been part of this.
Like these gaudy stickers are almost of the same aesthetic as this slightly horrible console. That this looks of a piece is quite damning, that a video game magazine could give away stickers that look like they belong there.
Yeah, it's got sort of like maybe same energy as the Mike Tyson tattoo, GBA, whatever that is.
Right.
Yeah, whatever that is, that kind of like design. Where it's a bit like, I guess it's a bit Nintendo cool, which is to say not cool of the time. So yeah, a bit all over the place.
I just remember finding it very unappealing because the PSP, I think by comparison, the PSP despite the fact it had UMDs, which were slightly cursed sort of like physical media format. That was actually quite a nice design out of the gate. It felt good in the hand.
It looked nice. It looked like a Sony product. It was kind of all there.
But the thing that I noticed happened at the time when I got my PSP is that it had very, very few games that were worth talking about. Like once you got, maybe you got Lumines, maybe you got, in my case, GTA Liberty City Stories, and it was amazing to see GTA on that screen. But what I noticed happening was loads and loads of conversation around DS software specifically, around like Animal Crossing, around Mario Kart, Phoenix Wright, brain training.
There was such a culture of big stuff that was popping off on DS. Then all that momentum seemed to lead to the launch of the DS Lite in early 2006. That's when I was like, I have to jump on board.
So the day it launched, I went down to Dixons in the UK and got one with two games, and it immediately just pushed the PSP to one side for me. I like the PSP and I came back to it. Ironically, I think the PSP has a better second half of its life in terms of software than the first half, and the DS is the other way around.
But at that time, all the exciting stuff was happening on DS. It just became such a huge deal. I remember just being really impressed because we had Wes on a few weeks ago talking about how Nintendo were just not seen as cool during the early noughties frosted tips, some 41 era of popular culture.
I can't stop thinking about how perfectly that nails everything that was going on with them.
Yeah, and then right afterwards, seeing that photo of Des Linham dying his moustache purple to promote the GameCube and being like, they were completely out of time. But then...
Jason Alexander looking really unimpressed at like a Mario Tennis launch event, wasn't he?
Walking out sheepishly with, you know, Metro Prime.
Mega cursed Getty images energy.
Yeah, but then it just suddenly started to change. Nintendo managed to reinvent itself, and that was partly a marketing thing, but it was partly the way the hardware was made as well. The clamshell design of the DS Lite was a beautiful, modern looking thing.
It was perfect for the moment. It was Nintendo bang on with what people wanted. And so, yeah, I feel like that moment is where it had this sort of like apotheosis thing where I just had to have one.
I feel like everyone got one from that point. I don't really know many people who actually have the original DS, Matthew. Most people I know had the DS Lite, whether they ditched the original in shame or not.
But yeah, so I suppose Matthew, from there, like what is your, you've alluded to it a bit there, but what's your journey with the DS by comparison?
I bought one when I got my job offer on NGamer. That's what triggered me to do it. I thought, I'm just gonna go and reward myself.
You know, I got the call that morning and yeah, went to Winchester, bought it from Argos in the Brooks shopping center, bought Ace Attorney and Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow. And in that moment was born such a huge part of what would go on to be my sort of personal brand, he said, yuck. Just the chance of the first thing buying in playing Ace Attorney being like something which has just been such a through line of the career.
I don't know if it's, and it is because I love it, but I don't know if there's a tiny bit of that. It's just because it was tied to one of the happiest memories of my life, which was being offered a job on something I just couldn't believe I was getting a chance to do it. And being able to buy a console for the first time in your life and say to your parents, like, it's for work, like it's literally for work.
I've managed to like evolve beyond kind of what you think games are. And I'm going to make money in brackets, no money from it. So yeah, like just, what a great time.
Yeah, so it was also just like quite cheap as well. I think it was, was it something like a hundred quid, maybe a tiny bit more?
Yeah, that feels about right.
Yeah, and I think that just meant that it got in everyone's hands off the back of that. Like I think the original DS didn't launch for like loads more than that. But yeah, it was just so cheap that everyone I knew suddenly had one.
My dad had one, my brother had one, my friend Andrew had one, and everyone had a copy of Mario Kart. And some people had a copy of Animal Crossing. And then it just meant that by the time I joined Imagine, obviously I was working on a PlayStation magazine, not on a Nintendo magazine, but everyone had a DS in the office.
Like, you just saw one on like every desk. I think even if you weren't really the big Nintendo head, they were so cheap that it seemed completely reasonable to just get one. I mean, that's the thing.
The price of entry was so low.
It's annoying we didn't really have that culture of future, I don't think. Not in the same way that like 360 was the console that everyone had, you know, whatever their mag. I don't remember there being a big DS scene.
That was much more like a 3DS thing with like StreetPass. Maybe everyone secretly had DSs in their bags. I just didn't know.
And maybe we were just quite insular and NGamer, but I didn't, I don't remember playing like a lot of multiplayer DS with people in the office. Your office sends a lot more.
Well, no, I mean, I don't want to over-egg it here. Probably under half people did. But like, you know, I think Darren Retro Gamer had one.
Ashley Day had one. I remember playing Worms with Ashley Day when the imagine internet went down. So we just sat and played Worms for a while at a little meeting area.
That was quite fun. And like Simon Miller had one. And I think a lot of the games team had one.
So yeah, I mean, I don't want to over-egg it here. Like 360 was dominant in a way the DS was not, but that was the thing. It's just that, yeah, I think the reason just it got into so many homes is because it was so cheap.
You didn't have to really ask questions about whether it was worth it or not. I mean, the analog pocket, I think is $250 to buy. Like it's a really nice bit of hardware.
And obviously it's boutique-y and they're not mass producing it in the way the Nintendo is. But I don't know, just the idea of any hardware now launching for this price or the equivalent price just seems out of the question, really. I mean, I guess like the Switch Lite is kind of the modern version of that.
But even that's around twice the price. So yeah, I don't know. I think that was a big part of it.
But it didn't have the amazing movie playing capabilities of the PSP though, unless you had... We had, there was a thing you could stick in the GBA. There was like a movie player.
Oh, right, yeah.
I don't know if it was an official thing. I think it was. Then you'd stick SD card inside this cartridge or you'd download stuff on it directly.
But it was like a GBA thing and you could maybe play stuff or put music on there. But it had the, visually, it definitely had the whiff of something kind of naughty.
It was like maybe the kind of like cursed sort of Frankenstein energy of that, the 3DS add-on that added the extra stick, Matthew. That cursed thing.
It was just the competition in the race to watch TV and films on the screen or device least equipped for it. It was like a very defining feature of this time. Like PSP was probably a better fit than most, but I know I've definitely talked about it before, but like watching films on my creative Zen media player, where the screen on it was maybe like an inch wide.
Like if you ever want to watch Sons of Anarchy on a postage stamp, like truly bizarre experience.
If you could choose Matthew between the current Netflix lineup, UK lineup, it's Frozen, and you have that on a desert island, or you have every film released on UMD, and like every TV show released on UMD, from Dodgeball to Little Britain Series One, 24 Series One to the Stewie Griffin movie and Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children. Which of those two things do you pick? Which do you think gets you more stuff?
Oh, I think it's still Netflix. No shade on UMD, but there's only so much, you know, so many UMDs with four episodes of Family Guy that I can watch, whatever the fucking numbers were, because it wasn't like a whole season on the UMD, right?
No, they did do 24 Season One on UMD, but not the rest. So they did-
All on one UMD, or spread across multiple UMDs?
Multiple UMDs, but it was like a box set that had them all. I think they might have done one or two seasons of Family Guy on UMD, like the entire seasons, but yeah, again, like very cursed artifacts of the mid-noughties, those things. So yeah, okay, fair enough.
So you'll be watching, I don't know, Love is Blind, rather than, I don't know, Reign of Fire with Christian Bale, fair enough.
Reign of Fire, or you, season three.
So Matthew, the DS hardware iterations are like a key part of this evolution. I think in some ways, it maybe has the most meaningful upgrades of any hardware we've seen. Now I think it's very much an arbitrary power upgrade.
And I think with the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X, like they were kind of, they very much felt like mid-generation refreshes in a way that a new generation does not feel that way. But the DS history is interesting because we start with this slightly cursed original model. We get this like a miraculous hardware revision for the DS Lite, I think.
And then there's the DSi as well. So what do you think is sort of behind that evolution? What's Nintendo's thinking there about how it kind of keeps the DS fresh in people's minds and upgrades the feature set?
It's kind of interesting because obviously they're working on the DSi probably simultaneously with the Wii. And Oata has said in interviews, they looked at the fun people were having with Wii, particularly like the channels and the interface and the kind of goofiness of it. And they thought there should be a bit more of that in the DS.
One of the big things the DSi brings is like extra downloadable bits of software, things that live on the machine digitally, an SD card that can hold music. So it's got like a music player, you know, the camera so it can take pictures. They want more stuff that kind of organically lives on there.
To me, it always felt like them seeing what was happening in smartphones and going, we need a little bit more of this. You know, it's kind of almost a little bit more like a sort of iPhone without a phone component to it, you know, it's sort of edging that way. And, you know, they're quite open about really admiring Apple and saying, does this hardware enable new fun software?
And that's our driving philosophy here. It's quite an odd thing, particularly the cameras, you know, the idea of 0.3 megapixel cameras being like a big selling feature. And does anyone look back on photos they took on the DSi and go like, brilliant, I'm glad I've got this incredibly low res record.
I mean, their argument for the power of the thing was, you know, it's fundamentally still DS hardware and we don't want to kind of split that audience. So that's fine. And also, like, with the screens we have, you don't need a higher resolution image than that, you know, like that level of camera is perfect for the screen.
But the whole thing seems seems quite daft and redundant. Not that we thought that at the time, like we obviously fucked around with all the weird kind of camera features and messed around with it and enjoyed all the silly little bits of DSi wear. If they'd been able to have made the leap where you could have downloaded whole DS games maybe, or had like a digital DS marketplace as opposed to just DSi wear, like they were several years away from that being the kind of the level they'd operate at, that probably would have felt like more of a revolutionary leap rather than this slightly weird kind of halfway house where, you know, DSi wear, some of it's fine.
You know, there's a couple of like absolute standout pieces, but Nintendo took many many years to get anywhere close to feeling like they'd really like nailed their digital offering, and this was quite a sort of tentative step towards that.
Yeah, I actually just completely passed it by at the time when I bought a new DS. I just bought a DS Lite again. I didn't really, wasn't super convinced by the idea of smaller digital download games, and some of the stuff they were making seemed very slight.
So I just, I just skipped it. And then it was something I could basically pick up and enjoy the highlights on 3DS. You know, it was kind of like a first step in that direction, I suppose.
So, yeah, I don't know, it was, it was just interesting that they kept, they kept pushing that hardware forward. They didn't just leave it as it was and add a new light. They changed the form factor each time and then, yeah, and then added features.
So, yeah, interesting stuff.
I don't know, if you've just come out of a period of what happened with the GameCube and the shellac you've taken to finally have the thing everyone wants, it's got to be very hard to resist the temptation to make as much of that thing as you can. It's not like they haven't done this before. They've got a long tradition in the handheld space of trying to update these things and shrinking them.
I don't think there are technically any more DSs than there are Game Boys or GBAs, I don't think.
I think there are more DSs than maybe like, I think the DS might be the best selling Nintendo hardware, but then I don't think that's true if you add GBA with Game Boy. I think that's where it exceeds it. I'm just plucking numbers out of thin air here.
I'm not sure if that's true, but I think that's right.
Sounds good.
I think the Game Boy did over 100 million, and I think the GBA did something like 50 million. I'm just guessing.
No, it was more specifically like the number of hardware updates they did isn't actually that different from like a Game Boy, Game Boy Color, you know, Game Boy Pocket, you know, a GBA, GBSP, GBMicro. You know, like they have previous form, like DS maybe gets another one when they do like the big ones, the sort of old people version.
I don't remember that one. There was an old people DS?
Yeah.
What do you mean the 3DS, when they did the 2DS version of that? That was like the Fisher Price version for like...
No, they do like the DSi XL, which is the big chunker.
Oh, yeah, I think my dad had that one, actually.
Yeah, it's got like a big screen, but like it just it just halts everything. It doesn't like it's not more powerful. It just just makes everything look look slightly bigger and slightly worse, in my opinion.
Yeah, so that yeah, so I think you're right. There's a comparable number there. But, yeah, I suppose like the feature set is maybe getting more advanced.
Adding cameras is maybe more drastic than things they typically do. Like this generation, obviously, they've added the OLED screen, which actually is more of a game changer than I would argue than cameras are, because you notice in your hands with the switch, the OLED switch just how much nicer the games look, even if it's not any more powerful in terms of processing power. So, yeah.
So Matthew, I suppose a really key part of the DS of success was the mainstream ad campaigns at the time involving celebrities and lots of lifestyle imagery that very successfully got the DS and we into tens of millions of homes. And it was just before smartphones broke, and I think that was a key thing. They were ahead of that, then smartphones would kind of replace them.
But what did you make of the mainstream ad campaigns at the time as someone who was covering Nintendo actively and the overall reception towards the DS from people who weren't necessarily interested in games?
Again, kind of hard to untangle from my time on magazines where NGamer's whole deal was like, we're not that, we're not the new Nintendo, we're like the traditional Nintendo people and O&M kind of made itself look a lot more how Nintendo presented itself to the world. O&M was a lot more touch generations than NGamer was. So I remember thinking this was one of the first times in my life where I realised how advanced marketing had become, particularly in regards to how well targeted it was in that I know it was a massive campaign, I know it did really well and it pushed out to all these new places, but actually I personally encountered very little of it out in the wild.
It was put in places where the right people would see it and what was quite brilliant about the whole operation was that people saw the bit of the machine that they were meant to see. I think the closest thing we ever came to running, a Touch Generations advert, which for people who don't remember, that was the collective branding for a certain kind of DS game, which were often very much stylus-led and aimed at the quote-unquote casual gamer. You had people like Nicole Kidman sitting there doing brain training and quite big celebrities to push these things.
I think the closest we came to running something like that is there was a range of spoof adverts done for some snooker game. There was one with Steve Davies mimicking. It looked exactly like Nicole Kidman.
It was like him sitting, looking rather dreamily at his DS on a couch. And instead of a stylus, it was like a mini snooker queue that he was holding. So we had like the parodies of the marketing in NGamer.
That was more our speed. But yeah, I mean, certainly this is where it ramps up. And a lot of its successes are marketing successes.
The success of Nintendogs isn't just his delightful Nintendogs, which is a really interesting piece of software in its own right. It's how cleverly they tapped into the dog-loving bit of the brain, the idea of kind of putting out a range of these games with different dogs on the cover. Kids would see them.
It was like going to a sort of virtual pet shop and picking out a breed from the shop. I think how they presented the games on stands was very like, pick a dog that you like and then you'll have it. And that's probably more important than what the game is.
Yeah, it's funny because I was exposed to this advertising and it was mostly when I... It was before I moved out of my parents' house in 2007, so I was watching... I know the thing that my parents would always watch is Coronation Street and you would definitely see those ads during that.
Right.
That's when my mum might comment on it and be like, oh yeah, look, it's those games you like, but on during Coronation Street or whatever. She would have said that, but that was the thing. It was like our world's colliding for pretty much the first time.
I mean, obviously, there had been the PS2 had sold, I think, more than we did. So that was already a mainstream success. But the very aggressively mainstream way in which this was being sold, it was innovation, wasn't it?
It did work. It did get people interested in the products, even if the products were maybe slightly different from what the marketing suggests, as you say. But yeah, I sort of admired it.
But also, I think that we know that we've discussed this before, but it was kind of a dead end for Nintendo, ultimately. It's sort of like, well, actually, we've debated this before, because we've discussed, does this actually grow Nintendo's core user base in some way? Does this bring in Nintendo players, or does this create just a wave of players who see the Nintendo products as disposable and then just completely move on when the iPhone comes out?
And I think that the answer is it probably did both.
Yeah, it's like the Wii Sports thing. It's people who buy a Wii for Wii Sports and maybe Wii Fit and then never buy another game for it. It's actually, the fact is, if you look down the best selling games on DS, while there are some staggering figures in there, games selling 30 million copies, they are all Nintendo first party games.
They are the games which sold hardware, this game and this piece of hardware you maybe bought once. They sold to an audience who maybe didn't appreciate the concept of a console is that once you've bought it, you buy other things for it. You know, they just bought it for their one thing and that was fine.
There's a huge drop off after that, definitely exacerbated by just the how incredibly easy it was to pirate stuff. And you get to a point where there's like no point making a core game for the DS because its sales figures don't mean anything. That's like 80 million mums who aren't going to buy GTA China Town Wars.
And like 20 million people. How many of them have an R4 card and are just going to like download it on day one? Many, I would imagine.
Like it seemed, you know, I know this working on a magazine which was targeted at, we were trying to sell to a bit of an audience that probably just looked at our magazine and you know, just downloaded everything we recommended. Probably played more DS games than we did because they were just zonking them down the pipe. So it was so easy, you know, to do.
Truly wild times. You know, the numbers speak to that. Like the actual people who managed to sell games are actually quite few and far between.
It's basically Nintendo and Square Enix.
Yeah, it's a weird one. The same thing happened on PSP as well where I think like, you know, you mentioned Chinatown Wars. I think that was kind of the poster child for, look how much R4 has fucked things up for the DS.
And I think I remember like one of the Dissidia games, Final Fantasy games came out. And I think it was a number that had been downloaded five times more than it had sold or something like that. The thing is, I didn't gauge with the games that way.
Obviously, I was lucky enough to get, you know, PSP games for free, but I didn't get DS games for free. I think one thing that I always thought was very appealing about the DS is the games felt very collectible. And because they were on these like flash carts, they didn't have the same problem with the batteries dying that you get in Game Boy and GBA games, where you now have to like basically replace the batteries if you want the safe functions to work.
The DS doesn't have that problem.
I think they do rot with time though, because like my copy of Picross DS will not work in anything for love of money.
Oh, interesting.
And that might be my fault for like keeping them all in an old biscuit tin.
Who can say Matthew? Who can say? That was really funny, that biscuit tin.
Yeah, I don't know. Mine all seem okay, but I've got them all like in these enclosed, hoary plastic cases. I don't know, but I was just playing a copy of a Wenden, like an early DS game, and that is working completely fine.
So, I don't know, but you know, it makes me nervous, the thought of it.
Everything I tried works, apart from Picross DS, which, you know, is very precious to me.
Fair enough. That is sad. Just treat yourself to a new one on the patrons, Matthew.
That's what the money is for. Don Draper voice, that's what the money is for. Okay, so, Matthew, I want to talk a bit more about the DS and Wii and comparing those.
So, if I can float a thesis by you about why I think the DS has a much stronger reputation in retrospect than the Wii, I think it's fair to say that that is the case, is that it emerged very quickly that the touch screen could support very complex types of games, as well as types of games we hadn't really seen before. Whereas the Wii just didn't have the same depth of control in those motion controls, at least until Wii Motion Plus when it became very precise. And as a novel control scheme at the time, it just wasn't used by developers with the same breadth or innovation as the touch screen was.
It wasn't as versatile an input, and it just meant the DS could both be this console for people with good taste in games, like us, that sounds ridiculously insane.
Us and all of our patrons.
And all of our listeners. And also something that your nan might be interested in playing. That's something that could sell a copy of Brain Training.
The Wii has languished as a shovelware machine with only a few obvious outliers, but the DS, because it just had, you could be so precise with those touch controls and so many genres flooded onto the thing, it just means it's got like a massive reputation the way that the Wii does it, even though the means with which they were sold and how much they sold at the time were the same, yet they feel like a world apart to me in terms of reputation. What do you think about that?
I definitely see the input thing, the difference between, you know, motion controls aside, the Wii instantly becomes quite a trad console with lots of buttons and it's all a little bit strange. I mean, my favorite thing about the Wii is the fact that you can play like hands apart and that won't speak to, you know, anyone unless they've spent years and years hunched over a controller. That's quite a weird, a weird innovation.
Yeah, and the fact that the big successes on DS are the stylus driven games, that all makes sense. I think the DS still has its fair share of what happened on Wii. People don't know it as well, but like it still had loads of licensed crap that was as bad as the licensed crap was on Game Boy and Game Boy Advance.
There's still an absolute rank tier of 30% rated movie tie-ins and EA annual iterations and things like that. You don't come into any contact with that, which probably helps, where Wii just seems more obvious. And it probably just comes down to difference in budget, right?
Between a portable and a home console game. There's just a greater volume of games being made for DS, you know, particularly in Japan, which probably gives it this slightly better reputation as well. But yeah, I generally agree.
Yeah, I think it's just a few other things as well. I think they're like Western publishers took the DS more seriously than they took the Wii seriously, you know? Yeah, they weren't rewarded, though.
Right, you don't think that's the thing.
If you look in the top 100 best selling DS games of all time, the only big Western seller in there, weirdly, is Lego Star Wars.
Oh, that makes sense, I guess.
Yeah, at a time, did about 4 million on DS. And then it's like a lot of Nintendo games, a couple of Dragon Quest games, and then right down, I think when you hit about a million copies sold again, you finally get to Guitar Hero on tour.
Right, yeah.
Like that is the second best selling Western made game on there. And then after that, I think it's a Hannah Montana game. It's pretty dire what does well in the West.
And I think people did try. I think EA, they obviously, they did the whole My Sims thing that they tried doing on Wii, they did on DS as well, where they actually put, I think, quite a lot of budget, quite a lot of thought and time and effort to try and make a proper version of The Sims, a bespoke version of The Sims, rather than the weird simplified console version of the PC game that they made before. But I don't feel like they were ever properly rewarded for that, or there wasn't a great response to it.
And then you just get a lot of people just doing bad clones of what Nintendo did. That's the other thing, is a lot of people just saw, well, they've got all this money to be made from brain training, so which British celebrity have we got? Oh, it's Carol Vorderman's number crunching, whatever.
Golden Balls, of course.
All the terrible TV tie-ins, which are maybe the shows which run between all this DS advertising, maybe that makes sense. You've got that... What's that astrology thing that always does the rounds on Twitter?
Is it Russell something's astrology? Russell Grant? Yeah, that's right.
Just this big jolly face surrounded by astral figures. It always makes me laugh. Maybe people had it coming that they thought, we can just do our version of that and it will work.
Nintendo were just so masterful at making the polished version and then selling it.
That's interesting actually. I hadn't really thought about that actually, about how well a lot of those games do. I really do think that Western Publishers gave it much more of a run than they gave the Wii.
It felt like there was some better stuff, like a better undercurrent of things coming out on their core games. But yeah, like you say, they just weren't rewarded for that and that's kind of a shame. It is interesting actually because I think that I look at my own highly curated collection of DS games and I get very excited by them and I'm like, well, this is like a pretty amazing array of stuff and then I look on Facebook Marketplace in Bath for DS games and see like basically the abyss, just like just roiling rivers of shite, you know what I mean?
Just like the worst things you've ever seen, like licensed games and the same old crap being kind of like offloaded, like just really bad stuff. So yeah, it's true that it's just odd that the console contains those two identities. It really is like a core gaming machine and then it is very much not that at the same time.
I suppose that is true for any console that becomes successful enough. But I don't know here, it just seems more pronounced because the gulf between the good stuff and the bad stuff is so vast. So yeah, it's interesting.
The exception is like some of the core stuff that does so well in Japan, but nowhere else, but means it's worth pumping a lot of money in, you know, like DS is not even low key. It's a great JLPG machine for that reason, because Dragon Quest IX was so big in Japan that everyone starts chasing it in the same way that like, you know, Monster Hunter has that effect with the PSP and then everyone chases that and, you know, it's worth a gamble of something decent. It's worth like a bigger budgeted handheld game, you know, when you have that active fan base that could be yours.
And so as a result, we are quite well fit in games that almost don't have to do well in the West because they kind of did their numbers over in Japan.
Yeah, that makes sense. So Matthew, do you think the success of the DS led to the current success of the Switch and the surprising success of some relatively hardcore returning Nintendo series? Do you think the DS created enduring new generations of Nintendo fans and trying to basically work out where the audience for Metroid Dread or Kirby and the Forgotten Land really came from in these games becoming modern blockbusters in the way these series really just weren't back in the DS and Wii days?
Do you think that the DS is a key part of creating that new generation of Nintendo players?
Switch seems like it's its own sustaining success machine. Everyone's just in on Switch now, so whatever Nintendo do, people do it. You know, like, trying to work out where the success of Metroid Dread lies, when I think it probably just lies in the Switch itself.
I mean, anecdotally, like, obviously I know writers who are maybe five to ten years younger than me who the DS was like a formative machine, and I can see the through line from the games they would have played on the DS and what they rate now. Animal Crossing being very, very big with games journalists in 2020, absolutely tracks with Animal Crossing being very, very big on DS, because you play it as a 12 year old, 12 to 15 year old, and then you're the age where you're then the tastemaker in 2020, and it really lands, or even earlier than that, like the 3DS version. But I can see individual case studies where I'm like, that person was a DS person, you know?
And I kind of know what that means, steep down, even if it's hard to articulate.
Well, no, I think, I just also think that, you know, the success of Phoenix Wright, you know, obviously it wasn't like a monster seller, but it was big enough to become this enduring cult sensation, right? And, you know, and for, to me, it at least feels like the audience for that series is our age, and then maybe five years younger. And so that again, that again, feels like it tracks back to DS to me a little bit.
That console gets these games in people's hands in a way that previous Nintendo hardware maybe didn't, you know?
Yeah, I think I can like pinpoint, like someone who's formative console was a DS more easily than someone who's formative console was like a GBA.
Right.
Like that has less of an identity, you know, you are more open to like weirder shit. You probably like quite sort of bespoke interesting hardware. You're more open to the fucking crank-o-matic wherever it is.
What's that thing called?
Playdate crank-o-matic? That's a British version.
Like that thing was basically pre-ordered by people who love the DS and the DS was their first console.
Yeah.
While all the analog pocket people are all like people who like Castlevania on GBA.
These are preposterous generalisations, but I enjoy them nonetheless.
Like I said, I can't say anything for sure. I'm just feeling my way through this. And that feels right to me.
Constructing synthetic narratives. That's what we do on this podcast. Yeah.
Yeah, you were right about the DS having much more of an identity than the GBA. Like the GBA, so much of it was like SNES ports, right? When we've talked about doing that draft, it's like the array of original software that's worth picking.
There are more than 20 games for sure. But from Nintendo itself, it's like an avalanche of cool SNES stuff. And then a bunch of new games that riff on SNES stuff.
That seemed to be the profile of a lot of GBA games, right? Whereas DS is like a lot of series get completely reinvented.
GBA is like, we just spent all these years learning how to make NES and SNES games. And then you're like, oh, shit, now we got to make 3D games. And it's like, no, you don't.
All these teams, you can make GBA games instead and just carry on doing what you're doing. And they're like, fucking rad, we're going to make some great games.
Absolutely. That's based on nothing.
That's my narrative and I'm sticking to it.
Fair enough. So Matthew, which classic Nintendo series thrive on DS and which get left by the wayside? Does every series benefit from the success of the DS in the way that a lot of series have benefited from the success of the Switch or just some?
Just some. If anything, I'd say, again, that slightly vague sense of GBA 2D sprite heroes maybe don't do as well. Definitely the weaker Nintendo first party games are where they have like trad 2D platforming heroes and they don't really know what to do with them.
That's interesting on the dual screen. It's why you get average Wario games. Not a very good Yoshi game.
No 2D Metroid. Like there's actually that wing of Nintendo suffers a little bit. And those things do come back.
You know, they're not they're not dead for good. But I don't want to say like, you know, this was like a casual machine. So something kind of weird like Wario doesn't work and Wario still has like Wario, you know, you know, his his Wario ways and all that.
But like GB was pretty good for like the Wario land.
Well, I think it's interesting that, you know, if we're talking about specific series, then yes, Wario is actually kind of intact on DS. OK, because there are like there's also is there a Wario platformer as well on this?
Yeah, it's not very good. That's the problem.
Right, right, right.
But like the thing like that, Nintendo do make some six out of tens and like the Yoshi's Island DS is one of them Wario's like, yeah, Princess Peach wasn't crazy into that. I guess I'm pleased that they did the experimental Tingle game. Is it actually good?
Well, I think another series that loses out is you've got quite a lot of F-Zero on GBA and you don't get any of it on DS, I believe, Matthew.
Or anywhere else ever again.
Yeah, that's kind of it. And then obviously as well, you have Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero Mission on GBA. Again, another remake in there, but also a very high-end original game.
And there is Metroid on DS, but it's in the form of Metroid Prime Hunters, which is a weaker 3D Metroid game. And then also you have a series that bypassed the GBA entirely and then end up on DS. So you have a Starvox game on DS, which is not really all that.
It's quite unexciting.
It's part of the ongoing identity crisis of Starvox, right?
I'd say it's one of the more exciting or more interesting ones.
I mean, yeah, but the competition there is not enormous. But basically they are all some version of Lylat Wars, right? Some version of the original Starvox.
They kind of get that formula down and then it's about what can we kind of layer on top of this. But yeah, I suppose if you think about what was going on in Gamecube, then I suppose the DS one is actually like, it's a safe pair of hands, the DS one really by comparison. Yeah, some serious...
Interestingly though, what happens to like Nintendo's sort of strategy wing, Fire Emblem doesn't have a great tie. There's a notable exception to that, but coming from GBA where Fire Emblem kind of like properly arrived in the West, to a point where when they're making the 3DS one, they're like, this is the last roll of the dice for Fire Emblem. You know, DS sits in the middle and is responsible for getting the series to that dire place.
You know, Advance Wars quite strong coming in after Days of Ruin. No one seems that bothered or interested with it after that. It's the latter day DS stuff.
Something definitely changes.
Yeah, for sure. It's just interesting because some, also some series seem to be allowed to stay in 2D, then some just are sort of like forced into 3D and it maybe works or it doesn't work quite as well. So yeah, it's interesting seeing them figure that out.
So outside of Nintendo, Matthew, who do you think were the winners on DS? Who actually managed to sell some games and build their profile and make a real go of it?
Like I said, Square Enix, Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest IX is just a phenomenon in Japan. It's so big that it encourages Nintendo to really get behind it in the West. They're like, we must be able to have a fraction of this success.
And on the back of Dragon Quest IX, like actually Dragon Quest, you know, across the board, the series of ports that they do, quite snazzy remakes actually, of like 4, 5 and 6, all do very, very well on DS. The other big winners and like the emerging talent of this period, you can't talk about DS without talking about Level 5, you know, a sort of studio that sort of comes from nowhere, ends up being probably one of the biggest sort of IP factories outside of Nintendo, you know, they really looked like they were going to be another kind of game freak in a way, with Professor Layton, Inazuma Eleven. Is Yokai Watch the tail end of that DS?
No, I think that's, it starts with 3DS, that one.
Does that start with 3DS? There was another one that they did, another collectible thing anyway, but we were always so excited to cover their games, they were so polished, they were so confident from like Iteration 1, they came out with really exciting plans of how to make them all novel, like they weren't, you know, if you compared them to like what they were making to say the Pokemon series, their like technical ambitions and the presentation and the level of polish, it was like unreal, like they really kind of like doubled down on that thing and put their best foot forward, it was, they were like such a treat to cover, and I think they hit a bit of a, I think the absence of a Nintendo handheld in the market has definitely hurt them, like it's basically what they knew how to do and then they'd occasionally make these less successful, like PS3 and PS4 games. It feels like they may be getting a second win now, but during this period they were the ones to beat.
We used to load up their website on NGamer and they bought a new office, they opened this new office, you know, about midway through their DS run and their website had all these pictures and it just looked so nice that we used to load up images of it and just sort of fantasize what it would be like to work in such a nice building. So, good old Level 5.
You were sort of like, your stock in Level 5 at this time was just out of control. It's well documented that you thought that Hino was going to take over Nintendo.
I thought if anyone was someone who was very close to Nintendo, had those close ties, really could make a success of things in the way Nintendo had, was making the kind of stuff that Nintendo liked so much that they were publishing it in the West. I don't know, Hino had all the hallmarks of where Oata came from. He's a game maker himself, but also clearly a good manager of a company, also a big marketing brain.
I really thought he was the chosen one.
Yeah, I echo your enthusiasm that maybe in the next few years you might see a bit more DS level 5 in terms of what they make as opposed to franchise chasing, which I think is less interesting. Just make a really good later and then make a really good new thing. That would be my ideal path for them.
I'd like to see them get on top. Don't they sponsor a football stadium in Japan? Did I imagine that?
It sounds about right.
I think that's a good assessment of the winners there. So much like Capcom on DS as well, Matthew. Is that really a going concern?
I guess if you throw in Phoenix Wright and Ghost Trick, you do have a few important things going on there. But maybe not the most important. Maybe not the biggest series.
I feel like they've always had this base loyalty to Nintendo and a closeness. And Capcom never phoned it in. Just everything they make is pretty good.
Apart from the Mega Man games. That was just for the one listener who asked about that.
Who asked very politely. And does support the podcast on Patreon.
Well, shout out to you.
Matthew wishes you well.
I wish you well. They just make good stuff and hope for the best is my take on Capcom. And sometimes it works out really well for them, sometimes not.
During this time, they're making an incredible bank on PSP with Monster Hunter. That is their version of Square Enix and Level 5's success on DS. They did not have to make a Kami Den for DS, but they did and we thank them for it.
It's just weird because when you get to the 3DS era, Capcom are probably the number two after Nintendo, right? The most important publisher. Whereas Square Enix kind of disappears from the 3DS.
They're not really a going concern in the same way. They don't have the same volume of stuff. Maybe they just got their fingers burnt too badly by piracy on the PSP and DS to invest in that versus PS3 or 360 or whatever.
Very interesting, Matthew, to hear your perspective on the winners and losers there. I think we're almost done with the preamble, Matthew. Do you think, and this is the really key thing I think, is that we are in a more conservative era of game input when it comes to hardware and types of hardware.
In some ways, we're not because there are so many boutiquey hand-helds around and amazing emulation solutions in the home and things like that. But in terms of the big console manufacturers, doing a connect arrives on day one with the console punt from Xbox. In the case of DS, giving people two screens that we've never seen before or the Wii with the motion control, we haven't seen that for a little while, like a radical input in the vein of the DS.
Do you think we're ever going to see something like that again from Nintendo?
Sounds like someone's forgotten HD Rumble on the Switch.
That's true. Or Labo. I forgot about Labo.
Yeah. I think they would say the fact that they compacted their home console wall and portable console timelines into one was pretty radical for Switch. It may seem a bit conservative, a thing you can play on the TV or play in your lap, but that is a huge shift for them.
It's also the reason why I struggle to see what a more radical or out there hardware could look like if they continue to pursue this we're only making one machine that is both now, which feels like they're going to, because it's just done so well for them. People like it. You can see trends elsewhere what other people are experimenting with, with the second screen of the PlayStation Portal or the Steam Deck.
Nintendo ahead of the curve, people are still kind of feeding into that. They're obviously going to stick with that. And it's very hard to imagine what the hardware would be, how it could be experimental and still satisfies both a home console and a portable console.
If it was only one of those two things, there's more space for it to kind of be a bit weirder and a bit more bespoke. But isn't the current rumour the next Switch is just a Switch with a camera on it?
Yeah, that is basically it. So the DSR version of the Switch.
Yeah, or maybe edging that towards Wii U with some video call functionality, maybe. I don't know.
Yeah, I get it. Because you can't afford to make missteps when you have just one machine that you're selling. It has to be the everything machine, right?
Yeah, that's the succinct, better version of what I just said.
Hey, it's a very warm day, Matthew. Summer fucking came back in the beginning of September, which is very irritating. So I enjoyed our overcast summer.
I thought that was pretty good.
Well, I hated it. It was overcast, but I was also poorly for a lot of it. So like you didn't get the energy boost that you would have got.
And now I'm not poorly, but it's muggy. So I'm kind of like slightly muted again. Like, when will I ever be 100%?
Fair enough. I mean, I pray for your ongoing good health. Okay, there was one last thing I wanted to ask actually, which was I did discuss this earlier, but I think the PSP did get better in its second half of its life, when you had like, you know, God of War, Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta and some really cool stuff from Square Enix, like their sort of Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy games were really strong and really pushed that hardware.
Whereas the DS, it feels like by the time you get to around, I don't know, 2008, it feels like the DS's best games, best days are sort of behind it. And you have, you know, like a three-year stretch there until the 3DS launches. Do you have a fair assessment, Matthew, or do we think we just tend to talk about the games that came along a bit earlier?
That's probably a fair assessment. I mean, it's quite similar to what happened with The Wii. You know, it's just on this, like, roll for so long, and they keep just dropping, like, megaton things that kind of renew it and refresh it and get everyone excited again.
And eventually those things just sort of stop happening. And, you know, arguably, like, DSI forwards, they never really, like, find the big smash breakout hit again. And they so soon shift into, like, well, now we're talking about 3DS instead.
It's definitely tough from covering it on a magazine, you know, like, it kind of happened at the same time with Wii and DS. Just as the kind of big hitters seem to slow down on DS, you begin to get Nintendo trying to refresh the Wii with, like, Wii Motion Plus and both become a bit of a bad hang, albeit with, like, the occasional Xenoblade Chronicles or Ghost Trick to kind of come along and make you feel, like, really renewed. You know, there's always biggies there to kind of give them a shot in the arm.
There's always, like, a Pokemon or whatever, but those are kind of, like, old favorites and old Reliables rather than what is the next big thing. They definitely happen in the first three, four years of it.
That's true, and then, yeah, I think, like you said, there's a few bits and pieces that come along after O8, you know, for sure, and Pokemon really does keep selling. That's one exception to the piracy thing, right?
Dragon Quest, the fact that the Dragon Quest narrative out of Japan was this big and like, you know, dominated the headlines, definitely in specialist circles, the way it did was because that was like the only game in town. In 2009, it was the game of Japan, and then they tried to make it a big thing in 2010 over here, less successful. That it did make that noise, I think, is an indicator of where things were generally at with DS.
Yeah, you actually are so right about the best sellers as well. I just looked at the list. You are right.
There's the top 10 pretty amazing sellers, and then after that, it drops off very quickly. And then you are your old favorite, Spectrobe, still managed to sell a million copies, Matthew. Disney Pokemon game.
So, yes, that's funny. But yeah, otherwise, there's around like 60 or so games that have sold at more than a million copies, and yeah, the vast majority of them are from Japan, like you say. So, okay, Matthew, is there anything else we should cover there?
Do you think we've done our due diligence on the DS?
I feel like we've talked a lot about DS, and I would like to talk about some DS games.
That's fair, yeah. So I guess I'll just reiterate that I really do just love this as a piece of hardware, and revisiting a lot of the games for this draft was just an absolute pleasure. I think there's definitely like a step back in presentation your brain needs to calibrate to.
But actually, some of the ways in which that second screen was used, it really was such a specific way of playing games that was magic in its own right and not gimmicky. Sometimes it was used in a gimmicky way, that touch screen. But the vast majority of games just found ways to really make it work.
I think that's actually really surprising that the likes of Advance Wars and Fire Emblem didn't massively explode on this thing, because they seemed like the perfect games for DS. So kind of bizarre really that Advance Wars goes away, and then Fire Emblem is on its last legs until you get to 3DS. So yeah, hell of a piece of hardware.
Very, very charming. Sort of Iwata asks, it's not actually Iwata, but Iwata in the narrative of the interview sends Sakurai to interview the Fire Emblem guy about Shadow Dragon on DS. His argument being, Sakurai is a huge fan of the series, obviously Fire Emblem is very important to Smash Brothers, it's very well represented on the roster.
So he sends Sakurai as a roving reporter to do the interview and he fanboys out, which I quite like, and asks all these stupid questions. He clearly is super into it, very endearing and worth tracking down.
Mate, I've played the Switch Smash Bros, I know he's super into it, OK? There's like 40 lads with swords in that game.
It's actually like become a fire emblem and beat him up with some Nintendo characters.
Very much so. OK, Matthew, let's take a break and come back with the DS Draft itself.
Welcome back to the podcast. So we come to the actual draft part of this episode. 15 categories.
It's our largest draft in a while. Why 15? So I felt like we, with the 360 and the PS2, we just only got a little surface layer look at what the console is.
Now we talked about loads of games on that episode anyway, so it's not like we didn't encapsulate the whole of the history, but I did just have a little yearning in my heart to have a few more categories in there for each one. PS3 was fine with 10, by the way. That was okay.
Could have gone with five, if you ask me.
Yeah, there won't be a redraft of the PS3, I can confirm. But Matthew, I felt like the DS deserved 15, but how did you feel about expanding that for this?
Like you say, the library's huge. It actually goes into loads of different genres. There's some genres which are so rich, you want an opportunity to draft them elsewhere as well.
So it would be doing it a disservice to cut these out. I mean, I think when NGamer finished and we had our final directory of like the top 50 games or whatever, that was a killer top 50. There would be no complaints with any of those things appearing on this.
And I think that's the kind of strength of the library that we're looking at.
Yeah, for sure. So yeah, we wanted to encapsulate that. We did also want to give ourselves a bit of flexibility with how we select things because there are some genres that are just very successful on DS and some that are less successful.
So I think the categories will reflect that. Matthew, is there anything you want to say about how you selected games for this draft? Because I feel like you and I have put a lot of effort into getting this right, into making sure we're as, you know, we're swatting up on this as much as possible.
You know tons more about the DS than me, but- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go ahead.
You know, I'm not joking. Like my memory is not quite what it used to be. So there's lots of things where I'm like, oh yeah, I did love that.
This could go many different ways. I don't think I can fuck it up, but I also know there's quite a lot of stuff I'll be sad if I don't get. There's an extremely populist version of this console, which I think would do very well in the draft.
But I also think the heart picks for this particular console, my heart picks are definitely like well established through the course of this whole podcast. So I feel like they would also resonate. I don't know if I've got many surprises up my sleeve.
Like I feel like I've talked about most of the things I want to bring up.
Yeah.
But then we have done a hundred and whatever, however many of this podcast we've done.
Yeah, we have. And during the Best Games of the Different Year episodes, so many of these got discussed in depth.
Right.
Yeah, so in some ways, I guess, it's not a retread as such, but your canon, your sort of growing canon is very much emerged. It's very much emerged over that time period. So yeah, it's tricky.
For me, it's maybe a bit weirder. Like I did play a ton of the DS, but for like 15 games I know incredibly well, those weren't necessarily the best 15, the ones I know really well.
Right.
So I did go and do a bunch more research and uncover some things and investigate some things that you like, investigate some things that Metacritic likes, that people have brought up over the years anecdotally, that sort of thing. So I do think there is a push and pull here between how much you represent the console as a history exercise versus how much you lace this with heart picks. And I don't know, I think maybe my ideal console will land somewhere in the middle, you know?
But maybe you don't agree with that. Maybe heart picks are the way to go. Like, yeah, I'm curious to see where you land with that.
So.
Yeah, I don't want to commit either way because I just, whatever I make, I'm going to basically tell people that that's exactly what I wanted to make. Because I really, really want to win this one. If I fuck this one, I mean, it's really like game over for me in terms of drops.
Well, I don't want you to stop wanting to do these either because I have so much fun doing them. So, yeah.
Yeah, I just, I can't take the often brutal commentary from certain corners of the internet.
Yeah, this is like, yeah, like we say, home territory for you. Whereas I feel like PS3, people expected me to win that fine. Even though I think you actually, we actually did have pretty much, if you'd have had one Naughty Dog game in your list, you'd have probably won that, I think.
But it is, it is. 360, I think me getting fabled to is why I won the 361. And so that was like, just a heart pick too far, like for your list to be able to compete, which was tough.
So that's, that's, there's just a few decisions that hinge on it. I think you're a very good draft competitor, but you get caught, you get more caught up in the psychology of it than I do, I think. And I just don't, it doesn't phase me as much, at least not since the 90s, PC gaming one.
I think at that point, my brain broke and I just thought I have to be slightly less invested in this and instead rely on like, psychologically tormenting you as my tactic. So yeah.
It works.
Yeah, I guess it does, yeah. I'm excited to hear what you pick, Matthew. So shall we go over the categories?
Yes.
Okay, so at Back Page Pod and the pinned tweet that will go up after this episode goes live on the Friday, you can vote for the winner. 15 categories here. I will read them once more before we get into it.
At the end of the episode, we will recap them and then I will post the list on social media, on Twitter and our Blue Sky account at Back Page Pod on the Monday after the episode goes live. So category one, platformer. Category two, adventure.
Category three, RPG. Category four, puzzle. Five, visual novel.
Six, shooter or side scrolling game. Seven, Pokemon game. Eight, rhythm action.
Nine, tactics or strategy. 10, gimmicky touch screen controls. 11, port.
12, touch generations game. That means a game from a very specific list of titles that came under the touch generations marketing banner. 13, free pick one.
14, free pick two. 15, wild card. So I'll repeat those shortly Matthew before we get started.
Any thoughts on those categories? Which ones are daft? Which ones are annoying?
There are a couple of danger ones. I almost don't want to flag them because I don't want to draw your attention to them. But I think there's a couple where there's, there's only a couple where I'd say there's like quite a clear winner.
Yeah.
Still a little unsure on shooter or side scrolling game. More like I can't quite figure out what would be the winner there. Yeah, yeah.
That's my fear that I've missed something super, super obvious.
Okay, yeah, fair enough. So that's interesting. All right, so me and Matthew will do a coin toss to see who goes first.
Matthew, do you want to do the coin toss now?
Yeah, so let's do the bring up coin toss.
So a bit more about the rules here. So basically, whoever goes first gets to decide, whoever wins the coin toss decides who goes first and who goes second. The person who goes second gets two picks, whereas obviously if you go first, you have the advantage of picking first.
So that's how we do it. There'll be one pick, two picks, and it'll just be one pick apiece until the draft is over. So got the coin toss up?
Yes, what do you fancy?
Heads.
Heads it is.
Okay, I'm going to go second. I'm going to just read out the categories one more time, Matthew.
Does that mean you get two picks and then we're back to one pick each?
That's correct.
Yes.
Okay. So, category one, Platformer. Two, Adventure.
Three, RPG. Four, Puzzle. Five, Visual Novel.
Six, Shooter or Side Scrolling Game. Seven, Pokemon Game. Eight, Rhythm Action.
Nine, Tactics or Strategy. Ten, Gimmicky Touchscreen Controls. Eleven, Port.
Twelve, Touch Generations Game. Thirteen, Free Pick One. Fourteen, Free Pick Two.
Fifteen, Wild Card. Matthew Castle, what are you going to pick first?
I thought a lot about what I'd do if I went second and I had two picks.
Yeah.
So, I've played out the first three picks of this quite a lot.
Yeah.
I have quite a good idea of two of them. For my first pick, I'm going to go with what I think is a difficult category.
Right.
And get something off the board. I'm going to pick Port and I'm going to take Chrono Trigger.
Interesting.
Are you all right with that?
Yeah. You now have to tell me why Chrono Trigger is so good, Matthew. As a well-documented Chrono Trigger fan, why don't you take it away?
Well, it's classic, isn't it? It's a time-travelling JRPG classic.
People love it.
People do love it.
Why is this good? I mean, it's mainly good because it's not the other ports on DS. That is the reality of this.
It depends on how much we're allowed to bend the definition of port, I would say.
Oh, interesting.
Yeah.
Well, I was being quite strict with myself.
Okay, interesting. Well, we'll see what you say to my suggestion for this, I guess. But yeah.
Yeah. What can you say about Chrono Trigger that hasn't been said a million times before? One of the most beloved JLPG stories ever.
As you travel through time with a wonderful bunch of characters, with delightful music.
In a long tradition of these JLPGs, not always being treated particularly lovingly in their ports, this is just a very good fit for the hardware. Basically unchanged, but it's very well suited to it. Doesn't have the most heinous fonts of all time, which is often a criticism leveled at these.
Adds a few extra little bits, but they're not really important. What fundamentally matters is it's a really rock solid version of a greater JRPG that is very, very hard to find and play in as satisfying a way. So I feel like as an old classic and also as one of hopefully many JRPGs I hope to get on my DS, I think it's a solid pick.
It is the best version of this. SNES Classic, very late in the generation SNES game, about basically a time traveling RPG. You go to different time periods and you are trying to stop essentially a time traveling villain from destroying your world in the future.
And so you go to, I think, five or six different time frames from basically prehistoric times right through to a doomed far future and even the very end of time itself where there's a mysterious old man there and just this platform floating in the middle of nowhere. It's quite spooky. And yeah, you accumulate this vast party of characters designed by Toriyama, the Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Quest guy.
Obviously like an incredibly talented artist, an important artist in the history of video games and Japanese popular culture. So yeah, really, really important in that respect. Also like quite a straightforward, easy to understand combat system that depends on the amount of time that you have different characters in your party.
They'll learn organically more abilities that they can use as a trio. So if you have like the same trio of characters going around, then they will learn these super powerful combos where they basically like they perform animations that look like they're individual animations, but they become more and more elaborate as they do these vast group attacks. So really a great, great bunch of party members.
And the story actually is really interesting, the way that different, the world changes over time and how divides sort of rise and fall, how you get some of the comedy you get into, where you're put on trial and things like that, when you go back in time. And just, it's really, it's really, I think like it's the best representation of the SNES era of RPGs in the sense that you will play this and you will think that all RPGs from the time were this good, and they weren't really. It was like this and FF6, and then the rest are like more complicated or a little bit less easy to get into or a little bit different stylistically.
Like there's an amazing array of RPGs on SNES, but this is like the top level, the top tier highlight, and in an amazing form on DS. So yeah, a good pick, Matthew.
Thanks.
No worries, pal. Okay, so I've got two picks. Interesting.
First of all, this is why I struggle with this draft. I don't think there are that many categories where you are locked into just one thing. There's like six or seven priority categories to me, and so it's hard to know which ones to lock down, which ones to try and shit you up with, etc.
I was only getting port out of the way because my other port picks were less convincing.
Yeah, I mean, couldn't you argue that Phoenix Wright is a port, Matthew, because it comes from GBA?
Yeah, so there is that. Okay, I'm going to take a game that I think is only really makes sense on DS, and this has been proven when the game has been taken to other hardware and it's not been quite as successful. So for RPG, category 3, I'm going to take The World Ends With You.
Basically, an RPG set in Shibuya about trendy kids who are essentially doomed. Is it counting down seven days, Matthew? Is that right?
And then something bad is going to happen. What it basically amounts to is a combat system where you control your main character with the touch screen, and then you control your party member using the D-pad on the DS, so really making the most of the functionality. And you're customizing your characters using these pin badges, essentially.
And you have this game wrapped up in this beautiful Tetsuya Nomura visual style, which feels very much like him off the leash, I would say. It's not like he's trying to build a fantasy universe. This is like him creating trendy Japan, essentially, and giving you these really distinctive character designs that are extremely him.
With this dark, anime-ish story wrapping things up, and the idea that you're in this shadow version of Shibuya, and you're at the crossing, it just very vividly and amazingly captures the setting. With this combat system that is, as I mentioned before, it feels like a relative of Kingdom Hearts' Chain of Memories, the game where you use cards to issue commands. Really liked it at the time, has been excavated for Switch, has an extra scenario on Switch, but I think most people would agree, I think everyone would pretty much agree, this game is a DS RPG through and through.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, it's absolutely brilliant. Memory came out of nowhere, and just felt like the most exciting thing ever. The idea of this contemporary RPG set in modern Tokyo, you know, for the Japanophiles, is just an absolute treat.
Huge experimental combat system, I loved the variety of badges, I loved how cool the badges looked, combined with all their mad little powers, really tapped into that excitement of feverishly collecting things, and wanting to see what each power did. Great music, really weird, sort of twisty, twisty-turny story, like if you've not played this, but maybe liked Alice in Borderlands, that kind of weird, sinister scenario that's playing out around a kind of contemporary Tokyo. This has got a lot of that energy, obviously, way before that was a thing.
Yeah, it's absolutely great, this, and you're right, kind of terrible in every other format form.
Yeah, like I appreciate them making it possible to play on phone and Switch, but...
Yeah, it's just not what the game is, though. You just have to take out so much stuff, it becomes just not as good.
Yeah, it's like, it's maybe the DS cart that I cover the most having, you know, having seen it like shoot up in price over the years, so, yeah, OK. Second of all, for category 10 gimmicky touchscreen controls, I'm going to take GTA Chinatown Wars. I thought, I thought for my first picks, I thought I got to pick games where there's nothing else like them.
There's no other comparison point, and it definitely isn't with Chinatown Wars, which is ostensibly like a return to top-down GTA in a sort of like, in a very superficial way, but also combined with using the functionality of the DS in a load of interesting ways. So I use gimmicky touchscreen controls affectionately here, like it's, you know, where you steal car radios, you like twist a little thing around, and you know, you basically like, you perform little QTE actions to do a bunch of, to like hot-wiring and a bunch of stuff in this game. Like it's very nicely integrated touchscreen controls, I would say, but nonetheless, I think that stands out as like a way in which it's very different to other GTA games that Rockstar has made.
And yeah, I think just really showed a commitment from them to value the handheld. Has a very addictive drug economy mini-game in it, has a visual style that really suited the DS, that is very simple, cell-shaded DS style. It still looked nice when they put it on PSP, but I would say they PS2'd it up for the PSP, like it's a very much more realistic style.
And you know, this was a DS game, this was made for the DS, like a Rockstar game made for the DS. And I think it should be given, you know, treated as the special thing that it is. So hence me picking it here, Matthew.
Thoughts?
Again, blew us away, like the amount of love that went into this, particularly because it came in that slightly later years of DS, where third party interest, you know, was definitely on the wane. And to see Rockstar, who obviously seemed so sort of exotic and exciting and naughty on a Nintendo platform, making something that was so cool, and the drug economy of the game, whatever you think of the rest of the game, that in itself is just brilliant, like so compelling, kind of controlling the stock market with sort of supply and demand. Yeah, it's a great pick.
Cheers, pal. So that's my two picks. Not sure if I did that right, to be honest, but there's a long way to go.
So what do you pick next?
For gimmicky touch screen controls. That's basically any game with touch screen controls.
I would say that any game has got notable touch screen controls. You know, like I would say that like, I don't know, there are some games where I don't necessarily think touch screen is relevant to the DS, to the way it's placed on the DS, you know, but yeah, go on.
For Pokemon game, now how are we doing Pokemon? Are we taking whole, are we taking pairs or just one of the pair?
Just one of the pair.
Oh, I mean that makes it seeming slightly redundant.
That's not true because there's one DS game that doesn't have a pair on it. Like, you can't take Diamond and Pearl. Well, you can't take Platinum and then wipe Diamond and Pearl off the list, I don't think.
I don't think that's fair.
Right. I wouldn't do that anyway.
Yeah, but like, you know, there's a lot of Pokemon on DS. Like, I don't necessarily think... So, you're thinking that you'd pick HeartGold and therefore I couldn't pick SoulSilver.
Was that your sort of strategy? Yeah, I guess we should have clarified that beforehand.
Okay, that's alright. That's fine. Well, that just means I don't have to worry about it for the time being.
Fair enough, yeah. That's not a high...
Obviously, you'll be picking Pokemon Conquest anyway, Matthew, the Disney Warriors type, yeah. There's three things I think you've got floating through your brain right now and I wonder which one you'll do. I know how he thinks, listeners.
No, I think. You see, there's quite a lot of things where there are like sequels which mean you kind of have a backup.
Yeah, that is true. It's going to take a bit while till the tension goes out of this one, to be honest.
I've got to take a Castle classic off the board. Touch Generations, I'm going to take Hotel Dusk, which a lot of people might know is one of the Touch Generation games, which you may associate with more like Nintendogs or Pitcross or, you know, that brain training. But I have to have Hotel Dusk on there.
The Tale of Carl Hyde investigating a sort of twins, a Twin Peaks-y strange motel where all the guests seem to be harbouring secrets and mosey around absorbing the immaculate vibes, trying not to get kicked out of the hotel by asking too many prying questions. Made by Sing, who were a company that made a lot of games for DS that leant very hard into the sort of specificity of the DS hardware with gimmicky puzzles and whatnot. But most notably, this game is played holding the DS on its side, like you're reading a book with kind of touch screen controls to sort of navigate this 3D version of the world and this beautiful illustrative style, which kind of looks a little bit like the take on me music video.
One of my favourite, favourite games for sure. I'm very pleased it's counted amongst touch generations, so I can have it here.
Yeah, it's I played this the first time today, Matthew.
This is where you're like it sucks.
It's quite boring and slow, I think, but that's code word for immaculate vibes.
That's what we mean when we say immaculate vibes. It means boring as shit, but I like it.
So it's like really languid and it controls quite strangely because don't do this to me. So you have to navigate through a 3D environment, but it has this lovely, let's say take on me style 2D art style on top of it. It's much more lavish than other visual novels are on DS, I would say.
It feels like a much bigger operation. And then you'll go to a space and then you'll do basically point and click stuff looking at a certain area of a certain room. The biggest crime this commits is it doesn't give you a skip text function until you finish the game.
So you're very slowly watching slightly bad hangs just talk to you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
They are a little bit. Certainly everyone I've met in Chapter 1 I consider a bad hang.
Everyone is very tired looking. It's got big editors leaving future building in an evening energy.
So I'm glad to see that your personal recollections have not been conflated with the game itself in any way Matthew.
Also responsible for one of the worst reviews I ever wrote.
Oh yeah, we read that out didn't we on the... I thought that was pretty good in the end actually. I thought you were much better at the high concept, the thing than me with my Niko Bellic GTA 4 diary.
So yeah, it's like, it is interesting. You have this room that can grant wishes in this hotel. You have this dude who's like, looking into the mystery of what happened to some guy he's on the trail of.
His former partner, is that right Matthew, when he used to be a cop? So yeah, and then you have lots of like, languid discussions of characters.
Stop saying languid!
Yeah, it's true though! And then you have some quite good puzzles that use the touch screen in some cool ways. And then, I think it punctuates each chapter with you basically like, interrogating a character.
Is that right Matthew? And that's how it kind of is structured.
Yeah, and it asks you kind of what, how, it does like a little quiz.
Yeah.
About like, what you saw and did.
I can see why you've covered this as a Castle classic. As soon as you boot the game, you're like, and you hear the music and you see the presentation and obviously you have to hold the DS sideways. You're like, yeah, this is peak Matt Castle.
I don't want to say bullshit because I think it is like, no, no, no.
This is tough. I just, I think this image of you gleefully waiting for me to walk into the hotel dust trap so that you could announce it that you thought it was languid.
Well, I don't think it's bad. I just think, I think like, sin games are just a little bit like you either completely jammed with the vibe or maybe you just like, maybe they just, they don't move you. And I definitely think this is better than another code, which I've also played on DS.
I thought another code was, that was actually like quite boring. I thought this is, this is better. And this is tough.
But I'm not saying it's bad. I'm not saying it's bad. But I think that it's like, if you play, let's say, another big visual novel series on DS, then, and you go into this thinking it might be the same pace to it, it's not.
It's like, it takes its time.
It's very much, it's very much its own thing. This is, this is not how I expected this conversation to go.
Are we still pals?
Is that OK? I mean, it's quite a key text for me.
I'll keep playing it. I did like it more than more.
It's like you just said you don't like 10% of me.
It's like I've just said I don't like Catherine, basically. Yeah, basically.
Catherine and Hotel Dusk are both equal parts of my life.
Oh, I look forward to hearing this and what she makes of that. And you dissing her DS decals.
Whoever wins this draft, I definitely lose.
Yeah, tough, tough, episode for Catherine. Okay, so yeah, I think it's a good pick. Everyone expects you to pick this, so it makes sense.
Fair enough, Matthew. Anything else to add on that one? Before we move on?
No, just that it's, you know, you know that it's good, everyone. Covet it. Vote for it.
People love it, brackets in our discord.
I love it. Matthew loves it.
Okay, fair enough. Okay then, so my next pick then. For my visual novel, we're going to take Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.
So, again, I think we discussed this with the Capcom Draft. Like, you can pick another entry in the series, but it doesn't really make sense to take one without another, I would say. And this is, in a lot of ways, other than Apollo Justice, which was built specifically for DS, this is the high point of, like, porting the GBA games to DS, but also adding some kind of, like, DS functionality.
So, obviously, you have inventory management. You can shout into the microphone when you're in the middle of the court cases. And then, obviously, they added the fifth case as well, which required you to use the full suite of DS functionality for fingerprints and other bits and pieces.
So they did, like, make a solid effort to put it on DS, and you wouldn't necessarily think it's a GBA game from playing it. But it was a massive moment for me to pick this game up. Like, I just was, you know, probably...
I was into my peak Capcom bullshit phase. You know, I was the most excited man in the world about Aakami and Godhand, and then I got wind of the DS series that was about where you got to play as a lawyer. And I would even go as far to say my intrigue about this game from reading about it was the reason I bought a DS Lite.
I just had to see what the deal was. So, really excited to pick this up. Picked it up on day one when I got my DS Lite with another game that may or may not come up.
Definitely talked about that before in the podcast, but maybe Matthew's forgotten. So, yeah. So, Felix Wright is turning.
I think this is the only one it makes sense to pick in this draft. To pick another one by itself would be a bit odd.
You're salt in the earth, so nothing else can grow in its wake.
Yeah, maybe a little bit. I'm surprised you picked Hotel Dust before you picked this, actually.
Because I didn't know you hated Hotel Dust. I thought you were going to try and get it to win me. Yeah, a classic Castle mistake.
I played another game you recommended on DS and fucking adored. So that's the one I'm going to try and take. I wonder if you know which one I'm thinking of.
But I couldn't believe how good it was, the one I'm going to be alluding to.
No.
I wonder what if you know which one I mean.
No, I don't.
It's happening again.
You're not behind though. We're still so early on in this draft. We have a long way to go.
But Phoenix Wright's attorney just so memorably sets up this amazing universe of bizarro characters with really memorable cases. As ever, I stand by my stance that they killed off Mia Fey too early. She fucking ruled.
They should have kept her around. But hey, hey ho. Mia Fey perfectly fine too.
And yeah, just all of the cases here really kind of like stuck in the memory. I think they just did a great job of giving it that kind of like anime-like comedic touch combined with genuine darkness under the surface when you actually like, you know, there is someone who's been killed here and the stakes are real. So always love that mix of Phoenix Wright.
And I think this is, like I say, the one to pick. So, yep. Any thoughts there, Matthew?
I mean, I obviously love Phoenix Wright. I've talked about it endless here on episodes. I also sort of agree that it would be weird to pick part three because you need part one and part two and...
Yeah.
Fair. I thought it's funny, as I was putting together this list, I had this memory of something going wrong with Phoenix Wright before. And I thought, well, that's not right because we've never done a draft.
And then I forgot that we did the Capcom one.
Yeah, we did this exact thing like two months ago.
It's all just a little bit of history repeating.
Okay. It's your pick again, Matthew. I wonder if you'll pick, I know exactly what I need next, but will you take it first?
Let's find out.
I have no idea. I have no idea. I feel like I'm banishing to try and just take something.
Take something precious. Take something precious.
It's so stressful.
Oh, I've done it. I've broken him. I've got a good podcast content.
We're only on pick four. Come on.
Pick three for you. For free pick, I'm taking Ghost Trick.
Oh, okay. Interesting.
Fuck it, isn't it?
That wasn't it. I've not played that and I didn't want to play that one for 10 minutes and then try and bluff my way through it. So that's all yours, pal.
I wanted it on there anyway. I did want it. It's obviously what Shootagumi did after Ace Attorney, which is probably exactly what I said when I picked it in the Capcom draft.
A major deja vu from this whole series of events. Obviously it has just been remade and re-released in HD on other platforms. I still think its natural home is the DS.
I think the technical feat of its very distinctive animation style had way more of a wow factor on DS and really didn't need to be any better than it was on DS. You know, you can do an HD version of it, but actually it's not as impressive as other games on those platforms. A perfect DS game.
One of the greatest bits of narrative design of all time as you play a ghost trying to investigate his own death over the course of a night on a journey which takes him through the lives of many other people, often themselves in a moment of death, which he then has to write by possessing and affecting physical objects in the environment. It's the reverse final destination. Can you use the choice of a room to save someone's life instead of kill them?
That's a great hook. I actually think the way it builds and the momentum and the story it weaves over the course of this one night, how it brings it all together, I think, is just an absolute triumph. One of the best written games of all time.
Maybe lacking the obvious character and warmth of Ace Attorney. I think Shuu Takumi has made two masterpieces and this is the other one.
Yeah, so fair play, Matthew. This is something again that it feels like when they ported it, I was very grateful that they ported it, but like you, I was sort of like, well, these games just, Shuu Takumi and the DS, they were just born for each other, really. So yeah, that makes sense.
Interesting you used it on free pick and not in like a puzzle or something. I mean, you know, I guess it was...
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it technically classifies as a puzzle personally.
Okay.
All right.
Fair enough. Well, look, it's a good pick nonetheless. So yeah, it's not what I was thinking of, but still a good pick.
No, obviously not. What is this? Please don't be something big.
Well, okay, so for category two, Adventure, I'm going to take the Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks. Because I think that there just seem to be too many caveats for Phantom Hourglass to pick that, right? And I played a bunch of Spirit Tracks this weekend and found it delightful.
I think it's just a very nice, it's a very gentle Zelda, but it's a very good version of a gentle Zelda, I think. So essentially you are basically doing a Zelda-style Dungeons and using a rad little train to get around. And all the mechanics of Zelda have been translated very nicely onto the touch screen.
And they've kept the Wind Waker art style, so the 3D looks super good. I think basically the plot of this is that Zelda is a ghost, Matthew. Yeah, that's right.
And then there's basically a war with spirits going on, and then you're pootling around with Ghost Zelda. But really I think it's just a game about wouldn't it be rad to put Link in a nice little train and then it goes along going toot toot while you're doing a lot of trad Zelda Dungeons. They aren't too challenging, but from the two or three hours I played Matthew, it seemed like perfectly solid Zelda-ing to me.
Thoughts on this pick?
Yeah, I love it. I also love Phantom Hourglass. It probably will appear in my list, I'd imagine.
And I don't feel bad about that. Do I love spirit tracks more? Even if I did, I wouldn't admit to it.
The drafting. This is a competitive business. You've got to pick a side, boats or trains?
Everyone knows boats are cooler, right? Even if the game is a bit worse. The consensus seems to be that this corrected a lot of the flaws that Phantom Hourglass had, but some people did seem to prefer Phantom Hourglass more, Matthew.
They preferred having the overworld.
There are a load of babies. I hope they're not amongst our voters who don't like the central dungeon. But if you don't like the central dungeon, I don't want you voting for my draft anyway.
This is going great, this episode. Okay, what's your next pick, Matthew?
My next pick? Depends how loose we are with the category of adventure as a term.
Well, how far are you going to stretch it?
Like an action adventure?
Well, like Castlevania?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. But maybe I'll need to stretch another genre later on.
Oh, so this is the thing. Do I not take your graciousness now so I don't have to be gracious to you later?
Well, Castlevania fits into, I would argue, platformer, adventure and side-scrolling game. So you've got three different areas you can slot that in, as well as the free picks, you know?
Oh, so you... Okay, you know what? I'm going to take it in side-scrolling then, because my pick for that is going to rank.
I'm going to take Castlevania, Dawn of Sorrow as a side-scroller. Bit of a tricky one, because lots of people really like the last one too. Order of Ecclesias?
Ecclesia?
Yeah.
I think Dawn of Sorrow is the only Castlevania game in town, for my money, on DS. For the very basic bit, it has a massive castle where you explore, which is like the core ingredient of these things. Beautifully animated, tons of atmosphere, set slightly in the future, but that doesn't really matter, because you eventually shift into this castle, killing all these monsters, collecting all these powers from the monsters, so you've got a very versatile action system at the heart of it.
I think of probably all the games since Symphony of the Night, I think this is the one which sold me on the location and the changing location and the sense of pace and an adventure through that castle and the danger of moving into new locales and seeing what was around the next corner. At the heart of Castlevania is that fantasy of going to kill an evil thing that lives at the top of a castle. It really, really satisfies that for me.
I think the other Castlevania's on DS are all a little bit flawed. Portrait of Ruin uses this portrait system to basically whisk you to smaller, self-contained areas which don't really satisfy that kind of exploration angle. And Order of Ecclesias has got a lot of long flats that you grind through.
Not a lot of platforming. The actual exploring is much worse than this one. This is the stuff.
It's got some slightly crappy DS touchscreen stuff added to it, which I don't think is that important. What I like most about booting this up over the weekend, actually, is one of the things it does do is when you create a file on it, you write your signature rather than type it in. So it's still got my scroll from like whatever 16, 17 years ago and my brother's scroll as well.
And it was like a nice little time capsule.
Yeah, because I bought a second hand copy of this, a legitimate one for those collectors out there who might be curious. It just said like Richard in like a really nice like bit of writing.
It didn't say Richter, someone really leaning into it.
And then my four year old sort of like Samuel just like just like splayed on there and like basically felt it pen by comparison. So yeah, this is good. And I it's interesting because it seemed to be like a split, Matthew, in the player base between people liking this one and people liking Order of Ecclesia more.
So yeah, and like I think more people have a relationship with this one and that's why it came out in the top in the voting. But maybe some of the real Castlevania heads prefer Order of Ecclesia. That seemed to be the vibe I got from that.
I think Ecclesia is like harder and got maybe like deeper combat shenanigans, the way you can kind of reshape that character. But I honestly think that you need a big castle to explore. That's a key part of it.
And without that, something is lost.
Fair enough. Okay. Well, look, it's a good pick because I was going to pick it for Platformer, so that makes sense.
Platformer is a fucking wrong category, actually.
From the fucking inventors of the genre.
Yeah, it's a weird one.
Well, the masters of it anyway.
Yeah, bit of a strange one. Next up then. For category 9, tactics or strategy, I'm going to take the incredible Might and Magic Clash of Heroes.
Aww, god damn it.
Now, there are other games you can pick for that category, including my beloved Civilization Revolution. However, this game is fucking incredible. Like, I've been playing it this weekend, and I was aware it had this reputation, but I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Like, match 3, kind of like turn-based game. I just couldn't quite... It sounded like DS Core as hell in my head, and just maybe a bit too casual.
And then I played it, and I was like, this is so fucking gold, this is so good. This is the inverse of my Hotel Dusk experience, Matthew.
I thought you had played it. I was like, oh, there's no way he'll take that. He's never played it before.
I've told him about it, and he's never been interested in it.
Yeah, and I just wasn't bothered, but I bought it after, I don't know, 2008 Draft or whatever it was that we talked about it, but not Draft, sorry, the best games of that year. And yeah, I just booted up, thought, oh, so give it a go. And then it has a really good story mode where it essentially teaches you the mechanics.
Basically, you have a bunch of rows of units, and then you have to match three with the different types of units to build these squads, which will then essentially then slot them into the attack order. So they're like in one turn, they'll attack the other side. And basically, you have a health bar, like an overall health bar, they have an overall health bar.
Your goal is to knock the bunch of dudes out of the way, and cause direct damage to the health bar. So it's a mixture of strategy and puzzle. And it's got so much depth to it, because there are basically all of these different factions who have different abilities.
You might be able to stick a wall directly in front of your health bar to protect you from direct damage. You might be able to perform a comet attack that blasts a load of fire onto the screen and takes out a bunch of units that are in the way. And then you have these more elaborate hero style units, where you essentially have to burn your basic dudes in order to power them up.
Then when they get to the front of the queue, they'll just completely mash through the forces and do a load of damage. And the campaign's really good, right? But I ended up skipping to the quick battles against the AI, because that's where the real shit is.
That's where it gets like, the screen is full of units, and you're like, I'll remove this character from the screen to create three here, then I'll remove this character to create three here. I'll match these two sets of three up behind. So you've got six in a row of the same color and same unit, and then they'll form a more powerful version of that unit.
Just loads of versatility in how you can build an attack plan, and then you slowly watch it all just pop off and that health come off, and it is so fucking good. It's like RPG chess or something. It's fucking, it's magic, I promise you.
It's so good. I think I would almost go as far as to say this is the best game I've drafted so far. Like this is so good and I can see why it's got the reputation it has.
So while it might not be the most obvious DS pick, I promise you the listener, this is really fucking good. Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, I obviously agree with all that. It's one of the best DS games. It's one of my favorite games ever.
Like just a genius fusion of the strategic elements and the match three elements. There's nothing else like it. You know, it's genuinely a true original and it just jumps off the screen the second you start playing it.
You know, for all the HD versions they've made, just the art style, everything fits the DS perfectly. This is what it was made for. This is where it truly belongs.
I'm not going to smear it in the name of draft play, obviously. I can't do that. I'm on record as picking this as one of my games of the year.
It's actually one of the most beautiful third party games as well. It's a Ubisoft game and it's like a gorgeous pixel art. It's really, really nice looking, so I agree.
It makes sense of DS more than anywhere else. There you go, Matthew. You weren't expecting that one.
That was the one where I was like, oh my god, I can't believe how good this is. And it has multiplayer. I really want us to play multiplayer of this.
I think we could have a great time.
We're never playing multiplayer again after this draft.
Not anymore. I'm not playing with you anymore. It's your pick again.
For puzzle, I'm going to take Professor Layton and the Lost Future. Now I realise Professor Layton is probably still open for the other iterations. It's not quite like Ace Attorney, where if you take the first one, the story doesn't make any sense.
I'd say that Professor Layton is being as they're self-contained, that doesn't really hold up. But Lost Future is definitely the best one in terms of story. It actually hits hard.
Professor Layton and Luke go into a time machine and travel to the future and discover a different London in there and have to work out the mystery of this alternate city. Absolutely preposterous twist, but there's also a through line about a piece of Professor Layton's past, which I think is genuinely affecting. I'm not going to say it's hugely emotionally charged, but it's quite a touching story.
Of all the stories they do in these games, this is the one that lands the best. Obviously, that aside, this is the classic Layton formula of you're going through quite a basic point-and-click adventure, taking on lots of logic puzzles. Each one is beautifully presented as its own mini-game, often with bespoke interface, mechanics, input.
Level 5 just did a really nice job of it. Considering this was aimed at the more casual gamer, I think it still satisfies the core in terms of its mystery credentials, production values, its almost steampunky aesthetic. I think there's a lot to speak to everyone here.
This one had some good mini-game extras. The whole package, the series, was definitely downhill after this one. Spectre's call forwards, they never quite found their groove again.
I think you've got to have a professor later on here.
From what I can tell, this seemed to be the one with the consensus, Matthew, that it's the best one. It would appear to be a good pick based on that. Obviously, hugely important series to the DS.
Again, something my dad got into, which was very rare for any games to permeate his bubble, and obviously very different to The Saboteur, so, you know, significant in that sense.
It's just a treat, like having one of these every year. You can kind of sit on it to keep it as a little Christmas game. Just a real reliable treat.
You knew it was going to have those Level 5 production values and just be very well put together. A very, very happy time covering these on NGamer.
Yeah, well, only a yearly treat, because it took so bloody long to localise them over here. This is one of the games I bought in North America in I think like six months before it came out here. I was on a press trip and I just picked it up for like 20 quid or something like that and was like, oh yeah, this is going to be huge.
And actually, I will say of all the games of this profile on DS in terms of crossover into the casual audience, it's actually good on top of that. It's not just... I wouldn't say brain training is a good game.
It was a nicely made version of something quite gimmicky. But these were actually actual good games.
Brain training was just so clean and boring.
It was, yeah. It was just, yeah, no appeal to me. Okay, good pick, Matthew.
Right then. Is it time? No, it's not.
It's not time for that yet.
It's... It's so sinister.
Okay, let's take category eight, rhythm action. I'm going to take Osu! Totake!
Oendan! Oh, Oendan. I will be referring to it from now on.
So, okay. I have a huge relationship with Elite Bee Agents, which was the western version of this game. It's the same basic setup.
Basically, it's like some sort of music cops who turn up to some situations to try and resolve them with music by helping someone out and defeating some kind of evil force, whether it's cynicism or a bad boss or any number of things. It's basically like a drum tapping game. You tap the bottom screen of the DS in time to the music.
For Elite Bee Agents, they did lots of cover versions of very obvious western songs that were not very appealing, I would say. But nonetheless, I played the absolute ton of it. I mastered it.
I did all three of the difficulty settings. I got incredibly good at it. Never played the original, which was like...
It launched in 2005. It was an early DS game. But this was like the banner import game for DS, wasn't it, Matthew?
This was the game that everyone was like... You know, they heard about it and they had to check it out and they had to get it from PlayAsia or wherever else you imported games at the time. Lick Sang, was that one of them?
I can't remember.
We were PlayAsia always on NGamer. Had so many bits of tats that came free with those games.
Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, like the DS import scene was like a real and exciting thing. And it was for PSP as well.
It was like a big part of the DNA of these consoles because the DS was region free, you know, much like the Game Boy was. But it was just a great choice because it meant you could go and hoover up this interesting stuff. And the difference between this game and Elite Bee Agents is this game just uses, you know, like Japanese pop music essentially.
And that music is fucking incredible. I played it this weekend for the first time and I couldn't believe the difference it made to like hear music, like what feels to you as a player, like original music, because you're not familiar with this music. With this game, that's actually a perfect fit.
It's much better than fucking Highway Star and loads of dad music that no one likes in Elite Bee Agents. Like, it's like, it's the perfect mix of game type. Great music, great theme, fantastic like presentation.
Just, this is like, Innis or I-N-S, I don't know how you pronounce that, Matthew, but hugely important on DS. And I'm going to bet that even though there are games like this, you can play on, there are other games as a sequel, there is Elite Beat Agents. This is the one I'm going to bank on people having the most relationship with, Matthew.
Thoughts? Yeah, I mean, it's a great pick. I may yet pick its sequel, simply on the same grounds as everything you've just laid out.
I don't think it is just the sort of Japanophile in me that thinks the soundtrack to this is just so much better than Elite Beat Agents' kind of covers. Maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the music in Elite Beat Agents that you can see the kind of covers aren't quite as good. Just the attitude and style of this, the design of their little cheer squad, you can tell this is the authentic vision of the game and that Elite Beat Agents has been slightly tinkered with in a not-so-good way.
Yeah, and it's absolutely classic. I have got other rhythm games that I might yet pick.
Yeah, and there's a few others that I've had, like I've been scouting out as well. Yeah, okay, what's your next pick, Matthew?
My next pick for RPG, I'm going to take Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story.
Interesting.
Yes, it does count.
Yeah, it does.
Technically, it's definitely at the fluffier end of the RPG scale, there's definitely some more hardcore things you could pick for this genre. I think this is an absolutely amazing game. I really, really went to bat for it on NGamer.
It is the continuation of the Mario and Luigi series, which is kind of like a sibling to Paper Mario in that it takes some of the combat mechanics, like extra button cues to give attacks a bit more oomph, but obviously has the Mario and Luigi gimmick in that there's the pair of them. It's kind of almost more of a puzzle RPG in that a lot of the enemy types, it's about matching the right attack to them, so using a hammer on a spiky enemy rather than jumping on them, say, and little gimmicks like that. The big change in this one is that half the game is played as Mario and Luigi, the other half is playing as Bowser.
He inhales Mario and Luigi in the opening stretch, and they then explore his insides. It's kind of like a rudimentary 2D platform, it's still an RPG in there, while Bowser stomps around the overworld and goes on mad adventures. The two of them are working in tandem in order to help Bowser survive.
They're powering up his body inside, so they go and do mad stuff in his knees if they need him to jump further or whatever. It's that kind of cartoon logic. Leading up to these set pieces where Bowser basically turns into a Godzilla-style monster and fights these giant castles where you shift the DS onto its side and do this side scroll where Bowser's on one screen, the castle's on the other, because they're too high for the typical rotation of the DS.
The two of them have these huge slugging matches, and they're basically quit time events, but they're properly spectacular. Really gorgeous 2D animation. Absolute lashings of humour.
I know I always joke about the psychology of the Goomba with these games, but this one is the game which is like, what is Bowser about, and what's it like to be Bowser, and let's have a think about Bowser, not in a very complicated way, but, you know, he's a good hang. And Mario and Luigi, after two games, I think we were pretty familiar with their style of RPG, so actually having them doing a little less inside Bowser, I think is a very sort of smart solution to that. It's just brilliant, absolutely brilliant game.
Yeah, it's, you know, like, I remember this being better received than Partners in Time, which was the game before this, right?
Yeah, that was just a bit very fiddly puzzles where you were controlling four characters at once, and just a little bit of a bad hang.
Is it fair to say though, Matthew, despite the very novel premise that Superstar Saga is still very much held up as the best one of these games?
I've got a little bit of a Paper Mario thousand year door thing going on with Superstar Saga. I think what people really like about that game is obviously it hit at a particular time, it was the first time anyone had seen this particular formula, and it had 4-4 with all these hilarious syntax mangling internet meme humour. I actually find that very, very tiring.
Now, this game is much better than Superstar Saga, and it actually holds up as well. I know there will be some people who are like, ugh, and roll their eyes at it, but I've gone back to Superstar Saga, and it doesn't hold up as well. This is a more imaginative, bigger set piece, it's much more exciting.
It's a better game.
Okay, fair enough. Well, look, I'm not going to fight you on that, because I've done enough torching of the Castle Roberts partnership with the Hotel Tusken Trix.
That's alright. The thing is, most people will listen to that, and just believe me, I know it will really upset one person on our Discord, and he's just going to have to deal with it.
Okay, good stuff. Alright, Matthew, so my next pick. Actually, shall we recap where we are so far?
Oh, God, let's not. No, we can, yes.
Okay, do you want to read yours first?
For RPG, I've got Marion Luigi's Bowser's Insight Story. For puzzle, I've got Professor Later Than the Lost Future. For shooter or side-scrolling game, I've got Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.
For port, I've got Chrono Trigger. For touch generations, I've got the much-maligned Hotel Dusk. And for free big one, I've got Ghost Trick.
Nice, that's pretty good. Pretty good selection.
I would normally be over the moon by that. The Hotel Dusk is like really taking the wind up for sails.
Sorry about that, pal.
You've done a number on me. I thought it was impossible. I thought there's no, nothing can get in my way.
Okay, for adventure, I've got the Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks. For RPG, I've got The World Ends With You. For visual novel, I've got Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.
For rhythm action, I've got a Wendon. I'm not going to repeat the full name again, but you know what I'm talking about. For tactics and strategy, I've got Might and Magic, Clash of Heroes.
And for gimmicky touchscreen controls, I've got GTA Chinatown Wars. So yeah, it's all popping off, lads. Okay, my next pick then.
Category 12, Touch Generation's Game, and I'm going to take Rhythm Heaven. That maybe limits your options slightly more for rhythm action. But I was looking at this list of games, and it's quite a grab bag of stuff.
There's a lot of like, I don't know, art academy, those kind of like level of like, you know, six out of ten basically fond of.
Hey, listen, do you want to vote for a guy that fucking hates art? Philistine.
I don't know if that DS Cartless just like, yeah, that DS Cartless is just a hundred books is also in this collection.
I've got a copy of that.
Amazing. So yeah, again, I've got a war on literature and art from Samuel Roberts here. Rhythm Heaven played this a bunch this weekend for the first time.
Actually quite hard for a game that was advertised to a wide audience. Essentially just like basically tap the screen, flick the screen in time with some novel thing that's happening on screen whether you're part of a choir or you're in a factory or those kind of like that sort of thing. If you've played these games before, you're basically confronted with surrealist imagery.
And explaining this game.
Well, it's actually quite hard to explain, but it's basically like a bunch of surreal imagery and then you just have to learn what the thing, your timing, your flicks to is and then just play from there.
Yeah, that is true.
It's simple to play, but incredibly high skill ceiling and quite tricky from the start, but once you get into it, you really get into it. It does have an infusion of Nintendo weirdness that makes it very distinctive.
This game was a little bit of an import hit before it came out here. You feel like it maybe popped off elsewhere before it came here, but either way, just like a really pivotal rhythm action game on the DS. I feel pretty good.
That and a Wendon, I've got those genres ticked off really nicely here. Thoughts Matthew?
It's actually the iteration of the series I don't like. I'm not just saying that to be petty because this is in touch generations, home to the languid Hotel Dusk. The stylish controls remove the precision of the buttons of the GBA version and the Wii version, which is where I think this game really comes alive.
I think the difficulty comes from a slightly imprecise input. That is my take.
I don't actually think that's unfair criticism.
Yes! Yes!
One in every 30 flicks you maybe think that should have gone through but didn't.
That's too much. That's too many.
There's a tiny bit of that. But you do get used to how sensitive the screen is, I would say. You are able to navigate as a player.
But yeah, I still think like, I don't know, between those two I feel like I've got rhythm action sewn up. What's your next pick, Matthew?
We shall see. Seems that someone's forgotten about electro plankton.
And guitar hero on tour.
Platformer. You know what? Let's go.
Let's go basic bitch.
Oh dear.
New Super Mario Bros.
Fair enough. It's what I had for this category too.
It's the beginning of a series which I think people quickly ran out of love for. When 3D Mario is doing just the crazy, imaginative explosion of brilliance that it's doing constantly, the idea that 2D Mario, which used to be the definitive 2D platforming series, played it so safe. This is quite a conservative Mario game.
It plays a lot like my first Mario. It takes a lot of the iconography of the games, but doesn't have the same spirit of mischief or difficulty. I don't want to say it's easy so it's not as good, but there is a little bit of that with this one.
It feels like Mario made for the touch generations. But within that, it is elegantly, mate. It does feel nice to play.
It's not a bad or broken game in any way. I also think it's quite a fun package because on top of the platforming game campaign itself, you have some quite fun multiplayer modes. I actually think the mini games in this, which were repeated from the Super Mario 64 port, but with more multiplayer functionality in this, are legitimately good.
Some of them are like good Mario party games and I've had a lot of wireless fun playing these games with pals at the time. I'm not head over heels in love with this particular series or this particular strand of Mario. I hope that they get me more invested with Super Mario Wonder, which everyone's saying has kind of got a bit of that spark again.
But of all of them, it's a beautifully made, if unimaginative Mario and I'm okay with that in platformer. There are more esoteric things I could have put in here that I also do like, maybe like a little bit more. But also, I don't want a scenario where brand Mario is up against fucking DK Jungle Climber or something.
You know? It just, the real heads might know, but how many real heads are actually voting? Come on.
Well, yeah, that's the thing. It's like, this is DS as fuck, really, at this game. So even though I think most people would agree, it's kind of like, it's a mediocre strand of Mario games that starts here.
It was nonetheless a success for a reason. It was also very beautiful looking. One of those games that has, like, 3D visuals for the DS, but it actually makes sense.
You know, it's not, it doesn't feel compromised in the way it's presented. It's actually a perfect fit for it. So, yeah, I think that makes sense, Matthew, even though it's hard to drum up enthusiasm for it.
I appreciate your effort nonetheless.
I genuinely, the mini game where you have to quickly sort Pink Bob-ombs from Black Bob-ombs is like a legit thriller.
Okay.
Remember that when you cast your vote.
I appreciate you going, trying your best, scraping the barrel hard for this one.
Scraping the barrel? That's at the top of the barrel.
I'm only joking. Okay, fair enough. My next pick then, let's get another super obvious one off the board, shall we?
Category 13, free pick one. I'm going to take Mario Kart DS. One of the best games on the system.
Absolutely phenomenal. An incredible party game. I play this more than any other game.
Everything about it is great, apart from Baby Park. Which is as egregious as ever. But it's the first time they did that 3D visual style for the DS.
They tried the SNES aesthetic on GBA, and I think we can all agree that it didn't work quite as nicely. We'd all been treated by Mario Kart 64 and Double Dash. We wanted to see something approximating that style on DS.
And we got it. It's a really nice looking game. It has a bunch of new tracks combined with a bunch of old tracks.
It feels like a lot of what is great about modern Mario Kart starts here. The modern, widespread, mainstream obsession with Mario Kart feels like it kicks into another gear with this one, Matthew. It's just such a monster seller on DS.
And it's actually good, unlike the Wii one, which I think we've agreed before was not a very good game. Casual audiences liked this, but it was also a good Mario Kart game at the same time and a phenomenal multiplayer experience to boot. Thoughts, Matthew?
I'm not going to slag off Mario Kart. Obviously, that would be a mad thing to do, not Mario Kart DS. I think you're right.
Establishes the template for what Mario Kart is after this point, with the collection of the new tracks, the retro tracks. The multiplayer was really impressive, just to see this eight-player game running at 60 frames on the DS. Super, super slick, even though playing online was fucking hell, because everyone was just sort of snaking around all over the place.
If you ever came to this, it was just a bleak experience playing with randoms. That's about as best an attack I can make on Mario Kart DS. Obviously a good game.
Is it as good as the port of Diddy Kong Racing?
You decide. You, the listeners, will decide.
I mean, the only thing... Yeah. Nah, it's fine.
You weren't going to go for the angle of, but why would you play this one when you could play a more modern one?
I mean, that is a common refrain.
Doesn't that apply to the game you just picked also? Why would you play New Super Mario Bros on DS now? You know what I mean?
Like, it's...
I just think if we did a blind taste test and we got a load of kids in a room, and we were like, you want to play Mario Kart Deluxe on Switch? Do you want to play Mario Kart DS?
Okay, so let's do the same thing with Mario Wonder and New Super Mario Bros on DS, Matthew. Let's do the same thing.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, that only is preposterous, but listen, I just want to put the thought out there.
Fine, bit of spice there.
Just like, I've got to do something after you attach the Holy Grail of drafting, which is Hotel Dusk.
Okay, that's really unseated, this draft episode.
That has absolutely, like...
Psychic damage to the max, that one. Okay, all right then, what's your next pick, Matthew?
I have no idea. Listen, you're not going to take it, but I'm going to get it off the board, just in case something like Mad happens. For adventure, I'm going to take The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
Didn't you already pick Castlevania for this one?
No, that was a side-scroller. Because you kindly reminded me it was a side-scroller.
Oh yeah, sorry. You were right to pick this, I was going to pick it next. Good job.
Yes! I will not be uncharted 2, 3'd again. Never again.
Take nothing for granted in the drafts. He's learning. He's learning, listener.
Phantom Hourglass. This had the hard job of translating Zelda into the touchscreen format for the first time. Did an amazing job.
They basically don't change the controls for spirit tracks afterwards. Controlling Link with the stylus. Little gestures to do attacks and rolls and other moves.
The way that they translated Link's equipment into stylus-based control. And some of the new powers that brought to it using the hookshot for little tightropes and things. I thought this was really imaginative.
If you've played every Zelda game, I think this did stuff with all of the old favourites that you've never seen before. And I was just impressed that this control scheme had genuinely awoken some fresh thinking in them. It doesn't hurt that it's a return to the universe of Wind Waker.
Looks absolutely delightful, lovely music. Has a lot of fun with the drawing a little line to sail around the ocean, go on little adventures. Spirit Tracks, I think, is definitely the quirkier of the two games.
It's got a little bit more weirdness to it, which will probably resonate more with listeners of this podcast. But I think Phantom Hourglass itself, you know, it's not diminished. It's still an absolutely outstanding adventure game.
Some people have an issue with this central dungeon that you return to after each of the other temples. The idea being that the new item you bring reinvents the dungeon. It's not quite as interesting as that all told.
You know, you're shaving off a little bit of time in this dungeon with shortcuts that open up. But they did enough innovating with the controls that they don't need to take this big kind of structural twist at the centre of the game too. You may be more of a Spirit Tracks head, and that's fine, I accept that.
But I don't think anyone would say this is anything less than an excellent game.
I personally... Spirit Tracks is much more appealing to me. But, you know, that's, again, not a bad pick by any means, Matthew.
So, yeah, I don't want to sound negative about all of your picks. I think you've justified this one quite nicely before when we talked about it, because it did come up in the legendary Best Zelda Games episode, which was a Matthew Castle classic. Okay, good pick.
My next pick, then. Category 14, free pick 2. We're going to take Dragon Quest IX.
So, got a good combo of RPGs there, I think. We've got the much more experimental and wild The World Ends With You, and the very trad but presented in a really nice modern form RPG of Dragon Quest IX, which in some ways, I think, is like a culmination of many great DS things. So you have obviously Square Enix, you have Level 5, and you also have some like basically like Wi-Fi functionality, like multiplayer functionality on a level they've never done before Dragon Quest, where you can have people join your adventure, that sort of thing, and then travel around together.
Sharing some kind of treasure maps element, Matthew, I'm not sort of familiar with that side of it.
Yeah, it's like an early version of Street Pass, but just for this game. So if you have the game, you can set your DS in like Wi-Fi mode, and it would swap maps. So it caused a kind of phenomenon of like huge meetups in Japan around shopping centers where everyone would go there to kind of harvest these randomized treasure maps from other people's DSs.
Yeah, absolutely. And so I think that as what the other thing that's key, I think with the Dragon Quest games on DS is I think that Toriyama's art style actually translates better to DS than maybe the Final Fantasy games do. Like they just sort of like they look the part like the Dragon Quest sort of like Joker games they do like look incredible as well.
They actually like make the most of the 3D style and you know, very stylized depictions of characters. But kind of like kind of miraculous I think is like a DS undertaking like a huge game, like a massive deal that this moved from home consoles to handheld and the DS was obviously the right choice at the time. It sold more than five million copies.
So yeah, while I'm like not it's not a huge heart series for me. Dragon Quest, even at the time I was like, well, this feels pretty fucking deluxe for a DS, a new DS entry in a series. Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, like at the time and probably still now, like one of the crown jewels in sort of Square Enix's collection of games. So wherever the main line entry went, they pumped so much into it.
They obviously made it with level five, so it had all their technical know-how as well. Looked absolutely brilliant. You know, I love the music.
It's super trad, but like an absolute world-class example of a simple turn-based battling with a job system. If you're into the kind of basics of the form, it's one of the best of its kind. I had a very, very nice press trip for this where they took me to a Dragon Quest cafe where it played the Tavern theme tune constantly on a loop for two hours.
And I think a part of my brain is still broken after that.
Good stuff. Well, that's a nice little bit of colour to go alongside this. The famous press trip you stole from under someone else on another magazine.
OK, what's the next pick, Matthew?
Gimmicky touchscreen controls. I'm going to take Trauma Center.
Oh, yeah.
One of the classic games that was advertised alongside the DS of like only on DS. Have you heard of the weird surgery game? Most people were more excited about.
Have you heard of the weird lawyer game? It came out quite close to Ace Attorney. This is a kind of an arcade surgery game where you are performing under the pressure of time and declining health.
It's an incredibly difficult game, but one I think most people will enjoy experiencing once at least before they get really frustrated with the later levels. The stylus has any number of surgical tools. It's all played on the touch screen.
You kind of tap them down the side. You get little knives to kind of cut open wounds to get inside the kind of cavity and then you've got like a little tube. You can suck out kind of blood to better see the wounds you've got to like stitch up or bandage.
It's kind of a memory game in that you're trying to remember the process for each individual kind of wound. And it's a very abstract version of surgery. You know, it's kind of like big strange neon organs.
I wouldn't say it's trying to go for like gruesome realism or anything. You know, a lot of it is, well, I know this wound is very easy to fix, so I'll prioritize that first and it's a game of sort of prioritizing kind of desperate sort of triage. A distinctly DS experience.
They brought this to Wii, obviously, probably a better fit for stylus, like the precision of that rather than the kind of jittery nerves of the pointer controls that they had on the remote. Also, as like the size of the adventure, maybe a better fit for a handheld game. Short snappy bursts of sort of arcade fun with ace attorney visual novel sections in between, as you kind of unpick this strange disease, which is terrorizing the hospital.
Yeah, the only reason I didn't pick it is it is so fucking hard and annoying in places like it's very nicely presented. And I think it, like you say, at the time, it was, you know, another example of like a type of game you'd never seen before and they could only really do on DS. And it existed because of the DS and therefore is very exciting.
But I do think it's just like just so tricky and just like, and it happens like it happens faster than I remember, Matthew, the like getting to the difficult bits and this. Like it's you get this like buzz of like, oh, this is so specific to game type and then it's just so hard. Yeah, it gets so hard.
So that's the only reason I didn't pick it. But I do agree that like, as much as like a Wendon or Phoenix Wright, this is like, you know, DS as fuck for sure. Like it's hardcore, important DS games.
So yeah, would you did you consider the sequel, which I think was better received but like played by fewer people?
I think like what you need to see from this game, you'll see in the first one, you know, it makes perfect sense rather than having like a, you know, a weird thing with established characters and everything. I'm confident you're not going to pick the sequel.
Okay, fair enough. He said. For category 11 ports, Matthew, will you let me have Tetris DS?
Yeah, I think so. I'm not that worried about Tetris DS.
Okay, fair enough. Okay, I've just got the best version of Tetris ever. It's fucking incredible.
What, you think it's better than Tetris Effect?
I think, actually, I don't know, what kind of modes do they have in Tetris Effect? Do they have like the competition modes, you fire blocks at each other and stuff like that? Does it do that stuff?
Because that's what's great about it.
I just like all the weird sort of psychedelic windmills.
I do love that. I mean, it's like, you know, it's my number one VR game for sure, Tetris Effect. But this is like...
I'm not going to knock it. Tetris DS is fucking great. It's as exciting for Tetris for like Nintendo heads as Tetris Effect is for...
Mizuguchi heads, yeah. Yeah, like Q Games, yeah. So, yeah, this game is classic Tetris.
It has that experience in it. Though it does let you save blocks, which is arguably makes it a bit too easy, but it lets you do that, save one block and then drop it whenever you wish. So you can play the classic DS...
Sorry, classic Game Boy style Tetris, which is why I got away with this one as port. Then layers on loads of other different versions of Tetris too. So of the ones I remember, there's basically a competitive Metroid Tetris where you're firing blocks at each other and trying to like basically get lines as quickly as possible and then like apply pressure to the other player, which is a really cool, fun experience to sort of take Tetris that way.
But my personal highlight was basically like the touch screen puzzle Tetris they did where you could slide, you had to slide blocks to solve the puzzle. So you just like pull a square block along and drop it in in order to like solve this puzzle. And that was a really great use of the DS.
It wasn't just like farted out DS port of Tetris. It was Nintendo saying, what are all the cool permutations we can we can explore a Tetris on our rad handheld. And it was a massive seller and it looked fantastic as well.
Looked and sounded incredible. And yeah, themed around Nintendo. I think this is a real treat.
So I'm pleased to get this on my on my my list, Matthew. Yeah. Okay.
So what's your next pick?
For the visual novel, I'll take nine hours, nine person, nine doors.
Nice. Thought that would come up.
This is obviously Uchikoshi's first Zero Escape game. Some would say like most powerful in terms of if you know, if you've played it without having played Zero Time Dilemma or Virtue's Last Rewards. You know, this is the first time you're encountering his unique box of narrative tricks.
It's about a group of strangers locked in a strange survival game. There are a lot of puzzle rooms that you solve in kind of break away, point and click adventure sections, which I actually think kind of help liven up the game. Like, you know, you get a chunk of visual novel where everyone argues about the situation they're stuck in.
Then you get to go away and actually do more of a kind of tangible puzzle that you're interacting with. And I think that kind of breaks up the end of the storytelling. It makes it super engaging to play.
A huge number of mad twists and turns. A lot of the game is about exploring multiple branches of this branching story. At first, this just seems to be quite a gamey kind of made up concept.
But as it goes on, you realize there is the game is a kind of commentary on its own structure. And that structure is woven into its story in a really interesting way. He kind of uses that trick across all three games.
So whichever one you see in first will probably impress you the most. This is the part one of a trilogy. Great place to start.
No prior knowledge needed. So I've no worries about recommending it and having it on my mini DS or whatever this device is that we're making.
Yep, that makes sense. I didn't even want to try and pick this one without the context, because it's so fucking complicated a premise that it needs an expert to explain it really. So left that one for you, buddy.
Glad you picked it.
Thank you.
Never released in Europe either. So, you know, nice to have a fairly elusive cart these days to get hold of that one.
Yeah, I mean, it's you can play it on like PC and other formats. But again, the style of the storytelling in the scope of it, it was made for DS and that's where it remains most effective.
OK, fair play. Right then. So for my platformer, I'm going to take Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
Not played it. People love it. So not Matthew.
It's like visually like so Dawn of Sorrow very as I think quite very appealing anime style. This goes a bit more closer to the I would say like gritty Symphony of the Night style, Matthew. It's a bit a bit more in that direction.
I know almost nothing else about it though. So but on the list it goes. I need a platformer.
I do want to pick Kirby Superstar Deluxe because I don't know. Again, I think like there's I think actually News of Maribor may be the pick for this category. But I think having Castlevania, which was an important part of the DS journey, is a good choice.
And people did like this one apart from you. You didn't review this one for Edge, did you? You're not the responsible for the Edge 6 for this game.
Well, I think I did. I mean, like I say, bad memory.
Everyone else gave this an 8. So I don't feel like this is a bad pick at all. And like I said, apart from the competitions needs to be between this and Dawn of Sari for the best DS one.
So, yeah, don't feel bad having it there. Wish I had things of more substance to say. But what can I say?
It's the draft. It's competitive, damn it.
That's how it goes. You just say whatever you have to say. Don't have a great line on Chrono Trigger.
You say Chrono Trigger nonetheless.
That was bold to start first with a game you couldn't say things about. I will say that. But that was it was very amusing at the same time.
What's your next pick, Matthew?
For Wildcard, I'll take Infinite Space.
Yep, classic.
This is Platinum Games and Nude Maker do a intergalactic RPG spaceship simulation battling game. Incredibly ambitious for DS, but the beauty of it is where they decide to simplify and how they squeeze that into an epic battling system. It's all about building ships, but the ships are then in quite a basic Rock Paper Scissors combat system, but the ship you build drastically changes how it performs within that Rock Paper Sister system.
Huge amount of customisation and a lot of thought goes into it, but when it fundamentally comes to battling, it doesn't overwhelm the system, which obviously isn't capable as doing a full space sim like you can on PC. That's married to just really funny writing, charismatic characters as you go on this weird adventure encountering quite bizarre platinum style boss characters dotted around the galaxy before it all goes a little bit Arthur C. Clarke in the second half and gets a bit kind of heavier with it.
Lots of people struggle with this because it's very, very difficult and has quite an uncompromising save system, but if you do click with it, I think there's nothing else quite like it and I think it's always good for these mini consoles to have a couple of weirdo picks that are going to really resonate with some and other people will just feel smug that they own something cool.
Fair enough, Matthew. That's a classic wildcard pick. I found this slightly too impenetrable this weekend to just play in 40 minutes.
It wouldn't be like, oh, can I get the run of it in half an hour? Probably not.
No, exactly. That's fair enough. Okay, good stuff.
Right then. Okay, category four, puzzle. I'm going to take Professor Layton and the Curious Village.
This is the Professor Layton game I've played. And I'm going to gamble on this one being the one that most people have played. And you go into this slightly odd village and you're trying to find out what happened to...
I don't remember. There's a bunch of posh people and there's something odd about the village. And then there's a preposterous twist about what happened.
What's going on with the people in the village? That actually did surprise me when I found out what it was. But what a great little formula with this, you know, like sort of French style, you know, Band-Aid, Destiny, kind of like inspired art style, these very obscure looking potato men who you encounter exploring this place, finding secret puzzles, solving, just like little brain teasers, a really nice hint system if you get stuck, just like, you know, like really good puzzle design.
I'm willing to believe that the puzzle design gets better, Matthew, but as a self-contained great first run at an idea for a fantastic series, this is the one that captured people's imaginations. I can see why. Yep, so I finished this during the pandemic.
It was a game that I hadn't touched for like 13 years, came back to it and finished it, which was really satisfying. And the puzzles in it are super good. And yeah, it's just also just has like full motion video, sort of like animations, just like real nice sort of visual touch in bringing these games to life and giving them so much personality.
So yeah, curious village, Matthew. Do you like this one?
Yeah, I mean, it establishes everything that's great about the series. Basically, the first trilogy, all great. I think they get a little better with each one, you know, culminating with Lost Future.
But everything that's good about Professor Layton is in this first one. I'm not going to slag it off. It's a great pick.
What's the next pick, Matthew?
For tactics or strategy, I'm going to take Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon. Very, very hard to get hold of. Not that that massively seems to impact people's voting because this thing isn't actually going to exist.
But this is a remake of the original Fire Emblem, where the team just basically went back to that first story and bought a lot of quality of life improvements. It's kind of interesting where it lands on the timeline of Fire Emblem, because I think they had a decent amount of success introducing the series to the West on GBA with the two Fire Emblems there. So it's not like it's a series that was desperately struggling or needing reinvention.
But I like that this was a very focused effort to actually clarify some of the ideas, teach people the basics. It really hammered home the Rock Paper Scissors relationship at the heart of Fire Emblem. A little overlooked at the time.
I think Fire Emblem now being a little bit more beloved. People go back and want to rediscover these games and find this one quite hard to get hold of. That's certainly my relationship with it.
I only played a little bit of this at the time and kind of dismissed it as feeling a little old fashioned or not really appreciating its role as a piece of like heritage that they've very kind of carefully updated. Which is something like I value a bit more now being older and you know a little less sort of snooty and obsessed with the new. So a game I feel deserves re-evaluation or at least better appreciation from fools like me.
I think that makes it a good pick nonetheless. It gets tricky around here, doesn't it? In terms of like ranking sort of like importance of things.
I mean Fire Emblem is a weird one in the sense that I don't massively cover this game. Like I think that the visual style of the 3DS ones is maybe part of why it came to life that people sort of just really like that art style. But yeah, the fact that this is kind of like a lost game in some ways, so I can see why it's...
Yeah, and it's something about the original team behind it coming back and updating their work. You know, just showing what they valued in it. You know, and then I think, you know, Awakenings obviously comes along, takes the series in a slightly different direction.
It's a slightly new generation of people. But I've still got affection for these earlier games.
Fair play, Matthew. Okay, good choice.
It's not like Magic Clash of Heroes, but...
Well, to be honest, on paper, people might just vote for Fire Emblem on principle because they might not know how good that game is. So, you know, and hey, you know, it's also a good pick. It's so right, obviously.
Okay, my wild card. I'm going to take the puzzle game Meteos. So, it's a Gucci puzzle game where you're basically matching up tiles and trying to get lots of tiles to take off off the screen with little rocket boosters before the screen gets full.
A very frantic game. A very panicky, energetic puzzle game that seems to have a massive co-audience. People seem to really love this at the time.
And I got up and down with Mizuguchi's games. Some click with me, some don't. I like Luminaise, but I don't love it necessarily.
I think this is really accomplished and fun and I can see why it's got the reputation it does. It uses the touchscreen really nicely. They put it on 360, but I don't think it quite got the same reception.
It just really made sense for the DS's touch screen and really satisfying to see all the blocks pop off and just disappear off your screen. A cool fit for the DS and amazing really that you can make something puzzly and distinctive and have it get this much acclaim, despite there obviously being so many offerings in that space on DS. Meteos is, Matthew.
Do you have much relationship with this one?
Designed by Sakurai. No less, yeah.
Okay, I didn't know that.
This is like a freelance gig, I think, post Smash Brothers when he kind of goes out into the world and explains some of it, slightly sort of everything, but the kitchen sink, demented energy. Mitsukichi meets Sakurai, which is an interesting combo.
Yeah, for sure. Like it's, yeah, I actually had no idea Sakurai was involved. I should have had more research.
It's a strange period of his career. He sort of goes out and floats around.
Yeah, so, yeah, like, yeah, so, you know, yeah, like there's nothing else quite like it really as a pick.
Very, very, so if you find block puzzlers stressful at the best of times, adding rocket boosters that send everything flying all over the shop, it's great, it's full on.
Yeah, it is frantic for sure. So that is the word I would use. But yeah, I think of the puzzle games of this generation still has a reputation all these years later, Matthew.
And yeah, not that hard to get hold of either for those collecting. What's your next pick, Matthew?
Pokemon game.
Yep.
Pokemon Heart Gold. I appreciate you can take Soul Silver and it made this cancel out. This is the Pokemon game I've played the most of.
I was our Pokemon guy on the magazine hilariously for a long time. I wrote the World of Pokemon section. Around the time this game was quite big, I did a Pokemon diary of playing Pokemon Heart Gold.
I know that it's based on Gold Silver, the beloved Game Boy games. The updating was very sophisticated. It let you have a little Pokemon that follows behind you, like in Pokemon Yellow, except it's any of the Pokemon.
It came with a pedometer, which you could put your Pokemon in and then go for a real life walk and it would gain XP and energy from you doing that, which was very cute. Got me off my fat arse. Everyone knows where I am with Pokemon.
I find the tone of them quite childish and that really, really puts me off. But I know there's huge nostalgia for this game. It's a lot of people's favorite iteration of the game.
And so a very polished remake of that iteration cynically should do quite well in this draft.
Yeah, so I'll jump in and say I'm going to take Soul Silver at the same time. So that makes sense really, because this is the one I have the most connection to because I did play Pokemon Gold and Silver. And this was like a real, like full blown, detail packed, rich, you know, like version of that remake of that game.
The magic of Pokemon Gold and Silver was that they managed to cram the new play, the new area of the new world to explore Johto. And then also they managed to cram in Kanto as well, the original setting from Red and Blue. So you basically had like two games in one.
You could go and beat all the gym leaders from Red and Blue after you had done the ones in Johto, which was just such a cool idea. And so to get what was already a packed sequel on Game Boy and enhanced even more for DS, and obviously you can trade the Pokemon into the other DS games and build out your full collection from there. It just has so many little touches that enhance it for Pokemon players, like little twists and additions and things to go and dig out.
It's just the best. I think it's like the pinnacle of what I like about Pokemon in terms of the visual style as well. It's a really nice mix of the 3D art and buildings and stuff like that, but also 2D sprites that bring it to life.
It's a great fit for what the DS's functionality was. I prefer that to the later attempts at 3D they would try with black and white, Matthew. That's much more my sort of thing.
Good, we've both got our Pokemon games sorted then. What's your next pick?
Rhythm Action. I'm going to go with Jam of the Band, the classic multiplayer Nintendo first party game where a line moves along a bar and you hit direction, D-pad directions or face buttons to play notes and that way you play classical pieces of music or pop music or whatever. It doesn't quite have the simplicity or the elegance of a guitar hero where you have those bands running down.
To look at this, it looks like you're playing a bit of music software. Pretty like no frills to look at, but the actual satisfaction of hitting buttons in time with the music in order to play the music is very satisfying. The gimmick of this is it has a multiplayer element where it breaks the tracks down into like their eight respective instruments.
You play wirelessly, everyone by playing one specific instrument between you, you play the complete piece of music. So you're like a little virtual orchestra, which is incredibly cool. The fact that it has like the free wireless play meant that you only needed one copy and then everyone could kind of jam with you.
One of the harder Nintendo games to like love, I don't think they ever really nailed the look or vibe of the thing. Like this had the infamous mascot Barbara Bat, who's like a very sexualized Bat Lady. Quite a weird Nintendo character.
Some strange conversations about her in respect to the What Are Asks interviews. But if you ignore the very sexy Bat Lady, I think you can just enjoy the silliness of playing this music together. I used to do a podcast called The Rotating Platform.
It's the only other podcast that exists outside of this one. And we had a regular segment where we would play a tune. Collectively, the three of us would attempt to play a tune on this as a little musical interlude.
And it always just dissolved into just raucous laughter at how fucking monstrous it sounded. That's the appeal of this game. Oh and Dan, definitely the better single player hang.
But I've long been a cheerleader of Jam with a Band, so happy to have it on there.
Yeah, I know nothing about this game. Like, it's a late DS game, isn't it? So it's, yeah, passed me by.
But yeah, it sounds like a good pick, Matthew. Sounds like a real head snow kind of pick.
Yeah, but like, oh and Dan is... It's powerful. That's quite a tough one.
It's powerful, yeah, it's tough. So yeah, I get that. But yeah, nonetheless, I would have been curious to check this out and sound I missed out on it.
It's a good, I'm sure it was a fun NGamer thing to experience at the time. Okay, my last pick then. Category six, shooter or side-scrolling game?
God, finally there. I'm going to take Aliens Infestation. There are loads of like way forward side-scrolling games on DS.
I played the Thor one today, the one, the time for the Chris Hemsworth film. It's not bad. This one, I think, has like the standout pixel art and sound.
It's just really frantic, fun, sort of like schlocky take on Aliens. It's published by Sega. And it just like, actually just like seeing the Geiger designs like rendered on DS pixel art is actually really cool.
And so, yeah, just really fun, has the motion tracker, which is obviously like always a great sort of video game conceit for like creating a bit of arbitrary tension. Yeah, just not loads to it, but like a real fun, just sort of fun, like Curio that is a little bit lost to time again, because like there's nowhere else you can play it and it's quite expensive to get hold of. Thoughts, Matthew?
Of the way forward games on DS, this is definitely one of the strong ones, like how they kind of nailed that license and bored it down. I'm not a big way forward guy. There was always quite a big divide between US and European journalists on this.
I think they had a few champions on IGN and GameSpot who basically give all their games an A. I always thought the sprite art looked quite nice, but I never thought they really had the gameplay chops. I definitely remember playing this and being surprised that quite a complete aliens experience was there to be had on DS.
Oh yeah, good. I'm glad to hear you're not completely down on this one. I did think about Metro Prime Hunters for this, but it's such a vanilla version of that kind of game.
Not very interesting.
I thought about Bangai-O Spirits because I'm a big Dreamcast head and so seeing that kind of live on DS it combines my two favourite things, DS and Dreamcast. That Thor game, that's a way forward one as well, I think. Probably got an 8 on IGN, but it's probably a bit of a 6.
It's just okay, it feels quite rushed. There's a really good version of that type of game for superheroes to be made, I think. That I would say only gets about half of the way there, whereas this is a better depiction of aliens than that is a depiction of the MCU, I would say.
It's cool. Go look at some of the sprites for this, they really did a good job. I found out, actually, I was watching a playthrough of it earlier and I saw there's a dude in the comments saying I'm a tattoo artist and I made the pixel art for this freelance.
I'm glad people are enjoying it all these years later and I thought good for him. So yeah, that's my story, Matthew. Okay, your last pick.
My last pick? It's a free pick. So it could literally be anything.
Animal Crossing Wild World?
That has been replaced by other Animal Crossings.
Yeah, that was the tricky thing. Mario Kart I thought I could get away with, but not quite.
Yeah, Mario Kart, yes, but Animal Crossing, you just can't, you can't go back.
Such a pivotal DS game though. Massive, massive deal.
I love WarioWare DIY, but it's quite a niche pick. I think I was like the only person who played it and liked it.
The games that you made that you shared in the Discord were so funny, Matthew. That Santa Claus one is Santa Claus, the Miracle of 34. It was so good.
That was so good.
One of my happiest, happiest, I spent so long, I put so much of my own evening and weekend time into making those mini games for one spread.
What's the one where a homeless guy gets run over? What's that one?
A homeless guy gets run over?
It's like, I saw it twice in that reel of like, of games.
Oh yeah.
A dude sleeping in the gutter gets run over twice by a car and his arm comes off. It's quite brutal.
Yeah, that's the more general films one. I'd have to have a look at it and see if I remind myself. Yeah.
Oh, this is tough. Listen, I'm gonna go with I mentioned it earlier, like it's broken now for me, but I desperately want to play it again. major nod to the more casual audience on this, but where I had a lot of fun, I'm gonna take PitCross DS.
There are loads of these games, kind of take a thing that you like in real life, crosswords or card games or whatever, and put them on DS with nice stylus controls. PitCross as a game, like I don't know if you can play PitCross in a newspaper. I don't know if it's a thing, like it's kind of a in that family of your Sudokus or whatever, it's a grid based number based puzzle where the numbers tell you how many squares on a line have to be kind of coloured in and how many are left empty.
I guess there's a little bit of Minesweeper in its DNA as well and the idea is that as you fill this grid following all these kind of number clues, the squares you fill in eventually reveal a picture. I mean, that's quite generous. The game has to colour it in and animate it for you to go, oh right, it's a kettle I guess, if you kind of look at it from this angle.
But that's part of PitCross DS's charm. Very like, mindless fill in the grids. This game just had hundreds and hundreds of the things.
PitCross lives on in Switch. There are lots of versions of this. I think they release lots of packs.
I think it's Jupiter who make it and they're still making it. Maybe that's maybe about the wrong friend of Nintendo Studio, but I think it's something like that. Dead Simple.
My brother once cosplayed as PitCross because he loved PitCross so much. He went to a fancy dress party dressed as a PitCross grid.
Classic Castle family, I don't doubt that.
I think that happened. We'll have to get him on the podcast.
No, I've seen a photo of that. That is real.
Yeah, okay. That's real. PitCross DS against the mighty Dragon Quest Nine.
Well, look.
You'll love to see it.
Fair enough. Okay. Alright.
So Matthew, is there anything you wish you'd picked that you didn't grab?
Outside of ones you already picked, I was quite tempted by Radiant Historia, which is an amazing JRPG, but I just don't think enough people know it. And if I've learnt anything from drafts, you know, there's a lot of light pearls before swine with this stuff. So it's just not even worth wasting it on these animals.
Well, that's what he thinks of you the voters, which is good.
Yes.
Matthew's honestly. Yeah, I do get what you mean. I looked into it as well, and I've got the 3DS version, which is a nice version of it as well.
And yeah, who knows? Maybe I'll come up on a future 3DS draft or something. I'm not sure.
But like it's kind of a Chrono Trigger adjacent RPG.
Yeah, which I obviously love.
I thought you might have picked one of the other Dragon Quest games, actually. There's some nice ports on that DS, on the DS versions.
I really liked, I think it was four was the one I really liked. When you play as the four different heroes, they're almost like mini adventures and then they come together.
Along similar lines, I thought about the Final Fantasy which is like a tactics game on DS, A2. There's also Four Heroes of Light which is kind of like a throwback to older games. It's a bunch of kids going on an adventure.
Kind of preempts Bravely Default as well as what the team did before that.
Yeah, very much so is their whole deal. You also have from the same team, it's Matrix Software, isn't it? They did the FF3 and FF4 versions, but they're okay, but I don't know.
I think it's, I don't know, they wouldn't be my, 3 would be my pick for playing that game now, but I would just play the Pixel Remaster of 4, or the PSP version of 4, they're better versions of that to me. So, yep, to each their own though. Yeah, and a few other, sort of, Bangai Spirits thought about the Ninja Gaiden game on DS, the one with super nice graphics, that's pretty cool, I thought about that one, played that a couple of years ago, and then there was also Peggle Dual Strike, which I did think about too for Wildcard, but got my puzzle games sorted out with Tetris DS there, and Professor Layton.

Excellent. I think we've picked some pretty fucking good games there, Matthew. It was a nice draft.
Sorry it was so long. I don't have to edit this one, but...
No, that's okay. That's okay. I'm just going to edit out some of my Hotel Dusk despair, so I don't want people to lose faith in my picks, as I lose faith in my picks.
Well, that's good. That should take a good 20 minutes out of the final running time, so that's good. Matthew, it's always a pleasure doing these.
I think we did the DS Justice in this one. Like I say, I wish I'd kind of got Animal Crossing in there, but it wasn't quite the strongest pick, but Animal Crossing and Phoenix Wright, they brought me to the dance of the DS, and I fucking loved that.
Who needs Animal Crossing when you've got aliens infestation?
That does seem weird on paper, doesn't it? But hey ho, these are the sums we make with the draft. Okay, Back Page Pod on Twitter, if you'd like to follow us.
