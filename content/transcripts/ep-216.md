Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello there, Matthew. Our guest this week is Dave Jewitt, who with his former GameSpot colleagues, Adam Mason and Chris Morris, has just launched the YouTube channel XP, or EXP. Fuck, I've already screwed that up from the start, but Dave will clarify shortly, and it's accompanying Patreon.
Even though I just watched the video yesterday, somehow I've got that wrong. You'll likely know Dave from his highly successful Expert React series on YouTube for GameSpot, including his videos on video game guns with Jonathan Ferguson of the Royal Armouries Museum. He also rather likes Warhammer, so we're going to chuck the things together for this episode.
Dave, it's a pleasure to have you. Hey, Dun.
I'm great, mate. I appreciate you having me on so I can promote EXP.
Good. Nice to have that clarified from the off. Yeah, it's great to have you on, Dave.
I've known you for a fair few years now, most ever since I worked in PRs that are bothering you about various Warhammer games, which is the duty of anyone who asks to PR a Warhammer game is get in contact with Dave and see if Dave's interested. That's basically what you do. But I know you've been in games media for a long time, so you've got a lot to dig into in this episode and yeah, excited to hear about your new project.
So I did, to kick us off, want to ask about your background with video games. What shaped your taste growing up?
I feel like I was affected by never having a Nintendo. Right. I feel like everyone who grew up with a SNES or an N64 or something, they have a more rounded taste in video games.
I feel like that console exposed more people to all the selection of Marios, like the Wii Sports, they're more, I think broadly palatable. Whereas I grew up playing on the PC and the few PlayStation games I had were Tekken and the Die Hard trilogy. So from a fairly early age my games were off of an ilk.
When it finally came to playing a nice soft platformer, I was like, oh, games can be this varied. I was playing Counter-Strike at about eight years old. Wow.
Amazing.
Far too young. I was playing the original Delta Force games. So I was playing games of that kind fairly early.
And I think that shaped my taste of games to come. I think I was like put off by platformers when I was young because I played Crash Bandicoot and wasn't very good at it. And one of the first games I ever got for the PlayStation was Bubsy 3D, which sucks, like so hard.
So I think I was like, oh, platformers are like this. They're either hard or they blow chunks. So I'm just going to go play light gun games and the Die Hard trilogy and stuff like that.
Nice. Yeah. I mean, I like the idea that your version of Sonic the Hedgehog was Kingpin or Soldier of Fortune.
Well, they are niche, intense games. I love it.
Yeah. These are firmly my PC Gamer reading years. Those games are from like 98 to 03.
You just unlocked a memory of Kingpin, actually. I used to play it in secret. So I remember it being on the shelf in my house, and my stepdad had it, and he was like, you can't play this one.
This one is a bit too much for you, actually. And I was like, I know. I snuck on the family computer, played a bit of Kingpin.
I was like, no, you know, that is actually, that might actually be a bit too much for me.
Yeah, you were five years old at the time.
Is that when you were like bludgeoning kind of potato face gangsters with like lead pipes?
It is along those kind of vibes, yeah. Like it, first person. And there's, potato face would describe the NPCs in that game, Matthew.
They were quite caricatured, right?
They, yeah, yes. To be honest, the only reason that came to mind is because of the sad passing of Victor Antonov, and that was one of the games that he worked on. Oh, right.
But like, so that just came to mind. But it was also a few weeks ago, Matthew, when we were talking about Republic for some reason on the podcast. And then I think this is a tier of like early noughties PC or late 90s PC games that have just are permanently floating around my brain.
And this is one of them.
So was your stepdad a big gamer then, Dave?
Um, no, uh...
Oh, sorry, it sounded like he had the game.
He did, he did. I think he was like getting into it. I remember just like treating MS Paint as a game.
It was around the time of the era of like Half-Life and Day of Defeat. I think that's what he started to get into. And then by osmosis, I started to play some of those games.
I think the first game I can remember playing was like Earthworm Gym. And I remember just being super stressed by that game. Is it like the second level that's set in hell, where it has like really hellish music?
Oh, Earthworm Gym is quite a full on audiovisual experience. Even now when I look at it, I find it quite hard to read, like the screen, like which bit is the level, and which is the obstacle, and what you can interact with. It's quite a challenge.
It makes it sound like you do like a yearly replay of Earthworm Gym. Just to see if you can get back into it. You get as far as like the submarine level.
No, no, that's it for another year.
Oh, that is so not your vibe, Matthew. That's fine. The idea of you doing that is funny though.
I don't do that for the record.
The listeners know, Matthew, you didn't even have to say it at this point. Dave, I was curious if you having that PC gaming background meant that when you came to work in games media, it maybe gave you a slight advantage, because I feel like PC gaming started blowing up just as you got into games media, and so maybe that deep knowledge ended up being like good counter programming to the more generalist tastes of other games journalists.
Well, one of the things that was an advantage is PC gaming giving you access to more tools. So like when I joined GameSpot, part of like in the interview, I was talking about like how I would mod games and how, like even on games like Fallout New Vegas, being able to take pictures by unlocking the camera and manipulating the environment so you can get like good footage. That's that stuff I was doing back when I was doing my own YouTube channel.
Starting out or having like a big background in PC gaming gives you, it does give you a leg up in sort of how you interface with a game, I think, because even back in the day, like when you'd have to run installers or some people, definitely not me, would have to do things like key gens and things like that. I think it makes you like a little more technically minded, I guess. I studied computer science as well and programming, and half of that was honestly just like, oh, what can I do with this game?
How can I edit this file? Like I remember the original Rome Total War, and to unlock factions, you could just edit a file to make them playable. So I was always curious about that stuff, and I think that that helped when we would do PC game coverage, because I was like, oh, okay, I can elevate it by doing things like going into third-person or free-caming, or even just expediting the process by spawning in items.
I think it just, to me at least, it made me feel more confident with the tools in a game, and I've always just been, I've always found keyboard and mouse easier as well. Like I played a lot of 360, like that was my console for a long time, but I always gravitated back to PC gaming, like from strategy games to first person games. And Total War is a funny one actually, because I remember when I went into my interview for GameSpot, there was a copy of PC Gamer in the reception that I was thumbing through that had a full cover of the Total War Warhammer.
I definitely edited that issue, whatever that issue is, it was me.
Amazing. It had like the Carl Franz cover. It was off the back of the first battle they showed off with the Empire and the Greenskins.
Oh yeah, the big eagle, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It had like a big piece in the middle. So I remember in my interview talking about having a long standing relationship with PC games, strategy games, mentioning the magazine that I'd just been looking at in reception.
And it's come to think of it, there wasn't really anyone else on the GameSpot team at that time that was really into PC gaming. And now I've never actually put these parts together, but it was when Cam and Seb left and they were doing the Top 5 Skyrim Mods show that was really popular at the time. And to mod Skyrim there needed to be a bit more PC gaming know-how to, you know, get all the mods to work and all the PC-specific capture stuff.
So I do wonder if part of it was like, oh, we've lost that expertise and now we can refill it. So you've given me some sort of epiphany. I didn't realize my ability to mod a game might have been more helpful than that.
I'm sure they hide you on your own merits and not just to fill someone's shoes.
Yeah, I did want to ask next about GameSpot, Dave, because that is the, it's not your first job in Games Media. I believe you're at a slightly smaller site before that, but I was curious about what it was like coming into that team, because I do think that it does help to have specialisms as part of like a wider sort of multi-format site like that, like things you can be the go-to guy for. What was it like in your first few years at GameSpot?
I mean, I felt so out of my depth, like my route into Games Media was not the norm. Like I was always told and, you know, by my colleagues that had, you know, stepping stones to GamesSpot. Like many of them were at multiple sites or outlets before that.
And people in the industries would say, oh, you know, you sort of want to end up at a bigger site and you do some times with, you know, enthusiast sites or off your own back. I basically I did a YouTube channel for a bit and I wrote a little bit for GGS Gamer, which was at the time, yeah, like an enthusiast volunteer site. And then sort of lucked into GameSpot.
So I always had imposter syndrome for years, for so long, even to the point of like I probably still had it by the time I was made redundant, honestly. But the team was like so much bigger when I started. I think there were like seven or eight people.
And we had much more sort of involvement in the non-American space, I guess. There were more people with specialisations, there were more people in the way of like the editorial team. Like when I joined, you know, I was joining the likes of Lucy James and Tamar Hussein, like people that I was already looking up to.
And I was like, wow, I now work alongside them. While we were at the similar age, they both had so much experience. So I always, you know, looked at them as inspiration and guidance.
And, you know, I was lucky enough to work with them for... In degrees of, you know, closeness, they obviously went to the US., but yeah, I was lucky enough to work with those folks for a long, long time.
But yeah, going into the UK office that first time was quite daunting, especially for like a country bumpkin from mid Wales who previously was working on his own YouTube channel to the tune of 5,000 subscribers. And now it's like, oh, you're on one of the biggest games, media outlets in the world. And the main thing people are looking at you towards is Fallout and Warhammer knowledge.
Like, I think that was the big project, the first big project I was put on, because it was around the release of Fallout 4, and they wanted like a weekly Fallout show. And at the time, I knew Fallout inside and out, so that was my first little baby that I was given, I guess.
No, nice. I think that having some imposter syndrome happens to everyone who works in games media at some point, whether you go work for a huge brand as your first proper job. When I moved to PC Gamer, I had a little bit of imposter syndrome because I did not own a PC for a good five to 10 years because I was very poor as a games journalist.
Matthew, you've had to work on non-Nintendo things, not necessarily your sort of thing before. I think everyone encounters that at some point. I'm talking for you a bit there, Matthew, but I feel like that's probably true.
Thank you. It would seem obnoxious if I was the only one who didn't have imposter syndrome.
You're just there like, no, I'm great and I've always been great.
There's a bit of that.
You're right, though, that GameSpot UK team used to be huge. I mean, it was a huge bummer last year when that team just disappeared entirely. I just remember GameSpot feeling like the UK team were as big, or if not bigger, than IGN at a certain point, and we'll come to that a bit later, I guess.
But you always had this satellite team in the UK with this larger team being in the US. Did that give you a bit of scope to make the content you wanted to make, Dave? I mean, obviously, Fallout, that you say, was your first project, but I remember you doing your...
I think you did a CA slash Games Workshop piece, that I thought was so you, and was so well made.
Was this the one that I was put in the mocap suit that was definitely a bit too small for me?
Yeah, I believe so, yeah. It's going back a few years now. But I feel like you got to work on your own stuff as part of that mix too.
Is that the case?
Yeah, it did feel like there was more room to explore passion projects in the UK. And I mean, depending on the individual from Gamespot, they might agree or disagree. I felt like the US team were doing the more day-to-day stuff.
Meat and potatoes.
Yeah, the more production line.
Yeah, like reviews, guides, shorter opinion pieces, maybe some previews. But it did feel like the UK was given a little more leeway to explore things that were potentially a little bit more out of scope and experiment with stuff from time to time. Like there were many shows that I worked on or types of content that I worked on that we did for a while, decided they didn't work, and moved on to the next thing.
Eventually, after a while, we had what was called an Original Programming Team, and a lot of that was based in the UK, and the remit was to make a series of shows. Then that expanded more and more into the US, and there were multiple teams working on that sort of thing. But yeah, that satellite element was always a thing that we felt, especially when it came to communicating with the US team, trying to collaborate.
And it makes me feel ancient, because collaboration with the US got easier and easier, just because internet speeds got faster. So it's very odd to think back like, oh, it was only eight or nine years ago, but sometimes that would be something you would have to consider. Like we can't get files to the US quick enough to have a turnaround.
So yeah, we were, I don't want to say cut off, but there wasn't as much connective tissue as there might have been if we were one cohesive team in the same office. And that came with its own pros and cons, but a lot of what came out of that was, I think, a bit more flexibility and a little bit more experimentation in the UK team, at least on the video side.
Did they ever bring you all together? Because I know that we've talked to some people from IGN, they'd get everyone over to LA for E3 or likewise Gamescom, they'd get all the American guys over along with the UK guys. Did you have anything like that?
Every year we would do a summit, I guess. So we'd go to San Francisco a week before E3, it'd give us a chance to work on other projects, team builds, just reconnect. That was fun.
And also meant we weren't going straight into E3 horribly jet-lagged.
Yeah.
So that was a big help. But yeah, one time it was once a year, we would get to spend like two weeks together, one week in San Francisco, one week in E3, really, really grafting. That was always a blast.
And one thing that always struck me about the US team is how much more outwardly they were able to share their love and excitement and enjoyment of games. Because we in the UK team, we were much smaller, we shared an office with other brands from at the time were CBS Interactive. So we would play Smash Brothers at lunchtime and get a little too loud and get told off.
But because in the US, the whole office was basically GameSpot, they were able to have more fun with it, like just jump on games together to spitball ideas or to let off some steam or to spend lunchtime or after hours. Whereas it did feel like in the UK, this might just be like a British versus American thing. Whereas like, you know, I feel really self conscious making too much noise in the office.
Like I got sent a really nice mechanical keyboard and I felt too self conscious to even use it in the office because it was just clack clack clack clack clack clack. Whereas in the American office, they're screaming at each other over a game of Rocket League. And it was weird because I was still pretty inexperienced, but I liked it.
These were people that were able to share their energy and passion openly like that. And I think it did make like a nice vibe. I'm sure sometimes you're just like, okay, shut up now.
We do have to knock a review out quick. But no, it was always great catching up with that team. And especially because at the time there would be people come, people go.
Opportunities to do so were so rare. But no, that was always great. And that was one of the things personally that I was most glad about E3 going away.
Because it meant that that was one less time for me to see my American colleagues and friends. And when CBS sold GameSpot to Red Ventures first, that yearly get-together, of course, we had the pandemic, which was a massive effect on that. But that yearly get-together never came back.
And it was something the UK team asked for constantly. We never got to do it again, unfortunately.
Hedge funds, eh? How did you end up making videos about guns for GameSpot, Dave? What led to Loadout or the Expert Reacts series generally, I suppose?
Because those are kind of like the two sides of how this kind of content manifested on GameSpot.
I've always really loved history. I've always found weapons, firearms, like, battles really intriguing. World War II history, especially.
And there would be times where I would look for opportunities to weave that in to content. So like, when Battlefield V came out, I did a feature that was basically... And this video did not do very well.
And in hindsight, you know, if I were to do that again, maybe I would think twice. But basically Battlefield V would shine a light on specific battles or events in World War II. And I did a video that was basically a pitch for an interesting battle or event in World War II.
It was called the Battle of Castle Itter, I think it was, if memory serves. It's basically something that happened at the very end of World War II. And it was the only time in the Second World War where Germany and America fought on the same side.
They had to basically get a bunch of German POWs or German prisoners, free them from captivity in this castle. That was previously held by them because the SS were coming. And these Germans were like, well, they're not going to be thrilled with us either.
So they banded together and I was like, that could be a really interesting story to explore in a video game because it was just after the Battlefield V Last Tiger DLC. And that sparked a lot of discussion about like, oh, playing as the Germans, the Axis powers in a story mission. I would try to weave features in like that, just combining my enjoyment of history and reality with video games.
And I used to watch channels like Ahoy that would do breakdowns of pop culture weapons and talk about their history versus their reality versus how they're implemented in pop culture. And part of it was that I was a bit of a weird kid as well. Right.
That was definitely an element. Told this story a bunch of times, but there was a time in high school where I went to high school in the middle of the countryside and I'm not a farmer. And that was like 90% of the people that I went to school with.
Right. So I didn't fit in super well. So I would spend a lot of my times in the library at lunchtime because I'm a big old nerd.
And I would read Wikipedia pages about World War II, about certain battles, about specific weapons. And I remember the librarian coming up to me and checking on me because I was reading the Wikipedia page for the MP5. And there was a whole thing about like, oh, do we need to talk to his parents about this?
Oh shit.
A bit of a red flag. But I was just interested in it because I was, you know, I'd watched Die Hard. I wanted to read about the gun from that movie.
And it was genuinely just a sort of-
I have a completely innocent educational interest in firearms in school.
Yeah. I was a weird kid in that regard. But yeah, I just tried to weave that enthusiasm or that interest into my content where I could.
And yeah, it was something that I just always found really interesting. And the thing that really propelled it at GameSpot was when Loadout started. And that was when we were doing more of these, as I mentioned earlier, in the OP team, we had to create shows that would go on for, you know, eight to ten episodes and that we would have like seasons, like traditional TV.
And I pitched one about firearms and first person shooters, really. That was the main sort of connection, I guess. I was doing a lot of first person shooter content by that point.
And that is always been a genre of game that I've really gravitated towards and not to toot my own horn or anything. But it was helpful that I was really good at them way back when I'm not so good anymore. Because I'm sure you guys know what it's like.
There's the perception out there to a lot of people who consume our media, that games media people aren't very good at games. Or if you were to be seen as less than optimal at a game, you would get memed on and clowned on for years. Yeah.
So because I was good at first person shooters, they were like, if we need first person shooter gameplay, let's get Dave to do it. Because at least then we know that the comments aren't going to be filled with, oh, GameSpot can't play games. How embarrassing.
So I ended up just doing a load of that coverage. So I became like the first person shooter guy.
Today, just to interject, I have definitely been at Battlefield review or preview events with you thinking, thank fuck Dave is on the team and knows what he's doing, where you've got all the kills because I am the opposite of you.
Oh yeah, wasn't it you, me, Andy Kelly in Sweden?
Yeah, yes, yeah, in a big old warehouse playing Battlefield 5.
Yeah, we didn't see sunlight for about three days.
Yeah, and I was just like...
Because we were stuck in this warehouse.
I was like, if I follow Dave, my game capture is going to look all right. I'll just show everyone what he's doing and it will be fine.
I forgot about that. That was a good little event. That was a good time.
Sorry, but as you were.
But yeah, because I was doing so much first-person shooter stuff, I tried to basically turn that passion of playing first-person shooters and enjoying history into mini documentaries. So I think the first one that I pitched was, and I think I had watched John Wick 2 as well, near this, was why suppressors, why silencers have a weird sound in video games, and in movies, they sound like that pew pew sound.
Yeah, I think I watched that back in the day.
And that was, you know, I find this really interesting. Like, what else can we do around this, do with this idea? So, you know, the Desert Eagle, huge encounter strike, a very video game gun, not really used by anyone in reality.
That's an interesting thing. Let's discuss that. And I think it was basically me expanding on me being one of those guys that if I was in this time, like TeamSpeak or Discord with my friends, I'd go, actually, did you know that the Desert Eagle isn't used by anyone in, you know, something like that?
I would be that guy. I'm like, OK, well, now maybe I can tone that down and turn it into an actual well-produced video. And I can turn these fun facts or interesting discussions into something a bit more developed and interesting.
And we can do it properly. And that's what started our interaction with the Royal Armouries and Jonathan Ferguson, because we want it to be authentic. I can talk about the game side, and I know a little bit of the history, but we want to make sure we do it properly.
So who better to get involved than historians, than museum curators to really show that we know our own YouTube?
Yeah, they're just brilliantly done videos. It's that thing of deep expertise, like entertainingly presented. Jonathan's brilliant as well.
So that relationship then, how did that come about? It was just you folks looking to deepen the authenticity of it. And I was curious from their perspective, how has the relationship benefited them?
Has it brought more visibility to them? That sort of thing. How did that relationship come about?
Yeah, so when we were doing loadout in these documentaries, that was that was our first interaction with the Royal Armouries. I knew of them as a museum and knew a bit about their collection. And I was just researching like firearms experts, like weapon experts in the UK, because I think at one point we were like, oh, maybe we can go to America and do it.
We costed that up and just like, no, no, we're not going to do that. And the Royal Armouries came up, they had media inquiry forms. I'd seen Jonathan in a couple of things before.
I was like, oh, he could be really good. So it was through the first season of Loadout, where we started to work together, where we got to know each other, where that relationship with the Royal Armouries started. And I think we did one or two seasons of Loadout.
And Jonathan and I got on like super well, because we are both very nerdy and very passionate about the same things. But I describe it as Jonathan is super knowledgeable and super nerdy about firearms and pretty nerdy about pop culture. And mine is sort of inverted, super nerdy about pop culture in video games, pretty nerdy about firearms.
So we got on super well there. And I think as someone that enjoys the pop culture side, he was really keen on what we were trying to do, what we were trying to accomplish in the stories we were trying to tell. Like, even when it came to doing the episode on the Bolt Gun, he was like, yeah, I'd love to be involved about that.
I can't really talk about a space marine, but we can give it a go and we can find real world parallels so we can develop this. Jumping towards Expert Reacts, that sort of came by necessity because after I'd done so much first person shooter content, after I'd yapped about so much Warhammer in history, after we'd done, yeah, I think at this point, it was two seasons of Loadout, we knew that we had an audience for this stuff. But then the pandemic started and we were pretty into the pandemic, we were into the depths of lockdown when we wanted to do a third season.
I actually remember we did an episode of Loadout about Doom and how the original BFG was based on an old 1960s, 70s toy that was photographed and inverted. We did a whole thing of hunting down that toy and I still have it. I think I still have it unless it might have been left back at GameSpot.
It's called the Raw Gun. The day we got the email saying, you all need to go home at like two o'clock. We were just finishing up production on that final Doom episode in the Loadout season.
We hadn't shot anything to camera yet, so we rushed into our studio to shoot those lines. So all the shots of me with the Raw Gun talking about a toy and how it influenced one of the biggest first-person shooters of all time and being very silly with it. That was literally shot like the morning of the first lockdown happening when we were all sent home.
But then months later and we wanted to do another season, we started putting our ideas together and we did do a few episodes from home. But because I was at home and our experts were at home, it was just missing something for me. It wasn't as good as we wanted it to be.
You know, we did an episode about the katana and we didn't get to show a real sword. Things like that, that really helped tie together the story and the visuals, were really important to me because, you know, when you're talking about a very visual medium like video games, and you know so many people have locked in to a certain game or a certain weapon or object or firearm or whatever because they like the look of it. Not even being able to show the real deal.
I just knew it wasn't, each of these episodes weren't as good as they could be. So we decided, okay, we can't go to Leeds to shoot at the Royal Armouries, let's put a pause on that, but we still have this audience, how do we keep serving them? At the time, a lot of people had done the reacts format, and at the time, that was really popular, and I think it's easy to see why, especially during a pandemic, because it is something that you can do remotely, much more easily than a lot of other things.
So we thought, hey, maybe that's worth a try, maybe we should give it a shot. So we approached the Royal Armouries and said, hey, would you be interested in joining us for a few video calls and doing that? And funny enough, despite, you know, I feel super humbled that it became so popular and so many people enjoyed it.
But the first like three episodes did not perform very well at all. To the point where we were like, is this something we can continue? And then it was only, I think episode, I can't remember, maybe four, maybe episode four or five where it got enough views that we were like, oh, this is worth, this is worth sticking with.
But it was, it's been such like an honor and a privilege to work with the Royal Armouries. And hearing them talk about how important it was, that show was as a donation driver, and to bring eyes to their platform was so humbling. Like, when they, when they, we went after COVID and they were telling us about like, you know, the EXP React series did so much in getting us donations, in getting eyes on our own YouTube channel, and getting eyes on our pages, on our collections.
I genuinely got quite emotional. Hit them telling us how important it was to them. Like, it's always been a museum that I've admired.
And knowing that now we've, I've got to be a very small part of their history, like, genuinely humbles me. Like, it gives me goosebumps to think about. Like, and that, and I know that sounds cheesy, but working with them for so long and feeling like that content that I just enjoyed making that was part of my job helped them, even if it was a little bit, is, yeah, it's crazy for me to think about it.
It sort of like makes my head spin to, to consider that like butterfly effect, I guess.
It sounds like they owe you a cool gun. That's what I was hearing. If you could take a gun from there, what would you have?
Oh my God. Well, I think I can say this because, yeah, Jonathan said it before. They've got more guns because of our content.
Oh really?
So I feel like I maybe I'm owed one of those.
Amazing.
Like their place on the internet grew enough that when they were like, hey, we've got gaps in our collection, people were like, we can help fill them. And then they went through all the proper channels and that.
Well, yeah, not just through the letterbox.
Yeah, Royal Mail gets a little iffy if you put a Chris Vector through the post.
I really hope that Sega tried to donate the Dawn of War 3 Power Fist they used in their PR campaign. That would be like just an amazing thing.
I used that one, so I feel like I'm owed it.
Yeah, amazing.
I got to punch a toilet with that, so if anyone's going to lay claim to it, it's me.
I thought it was a great idea for it. That genuinely warped my idea of PR pictures for ages. I was like, how do we top the big fist that destroyed a computer or whatever?
That's how my brain works.
It felt very cool to use and then you look at the slow-mo footage of me using it and I'm like, delete that. That can never see the light of day. That looks horrendous.
It's like someone's thrown a bag of mince together into white goods. It's so awkward and awful. You have to wear this big chest rig and my hoodie's spilling out the side of it.
I think I'm looking cool in a fighting stance. Then it's just a big dumb guy with a big dumb fist. It's very, very obvious that the momentum and weight of the fist is carrying me forward.
It's so embarrassing. It's the most whiplash between feeling cool and then looking at something and being like, oh no, people are going to laugh at this.
Amazing. I was curious to ask which kind of games you find made for the best videos for Expert Reacts or do make for the best videos because I find that a lot of the joy with Jonathan is he genuinely respects the work that's been done by developers when it feels like the guns feel authentic in the game but also he is very amusing to watch when it's something completely preposterous and I feel like you worked that out as someone who was making these videos but like what have you found that works the best for that series?
It really depends. Like, variety was the main thing that I strove for because we found that if we did like too many milsims in a row people would get tired of that sort of thing and you're right Jonathan's Jonathan's great and so respectful of breaking stuff down and giving critique and also being open when something is is bad or just a mistake like he's he's advised on games and stuff before so he knows what goes into taking a firearm from you know a real object and turning it into a model in a in a video game. In terms of what made the best episodes like I think people would say the cursed ones because people just enjoy watching Jonathan suffer but it I think it's when...
Can you describe the cursed ones for people who haven't seen that?
So it would be I mean a cursed gun could be anything from you know a Borderlands gun. There are there are guns in Borderlands that are very obviously real world weapons that have been smushed together so you can see the the the barrel of an AK attached to the grip of a Luger for example or it could be like a Call of Duty cosmetic so the one recently is like it's a weapon kit that turns your gun into a bong or a unicorn or a burger something like really like it's not even a weapon anymore it's just a completely different object that shoots something and seeing him try to piece together in his mind like that's still got this piece from the original weapon and that piece and that's a lot of fun but yeah it can really depend on the type of like vibe because if you do like a milsim they will pay attention you know armor or hell let loose or squad for example they pay a lot more attention to the details of the weapons Escape from Tarkov is a great example because they're so so authentic and so detailed there's then so much more to talk about and I think the generally the best episodes for me are when there is that balance between being able to give critique on something but you can see how interested and intrigued Jonathan is and that is it is like a good polished product and you know like Hunt Showdown is a good example because that is you know a game that is historical fiction it's zombies set at the dawn of you know I think it's set in like 1890 or 1905 you know something like that the the end of the the Wild West era but it's got zombies in it so those games that have a world of their own but they're so well realized always made for really great episodes it's like what it's like when when a franchise fully commits to their world building to their own right unique flair and you can see pieces of their inspiration but also how they've used historical inspiration to make their own thing so for example of Hunt it's you know Wild West Revolvers but there's a giant club on the grip because of course it's now a zombie fighting Wild West Revolvers or it's like a bolt-action rifle it's got an axe head on the bottom because you now have to use it to fight zombies so they always made really really interesting episodes for me but it could really honestly really depend like there was there were so many times where we did like a Sniper Elite episode and I love the Sniper Elite games but Sniper Elite 5 featured a very specific firearm and only one of them exists in the world and it's the one in the Royal Armouries. So whenever there's a one-to-one relationship between, oh wow this weird thing that I didn't know was a real thing and oh here it is, that was always an amazing feeling that we got to showcase that.
I don't even know if I answered your question honestly, I think I went on a ramble. It was just so varied in the type of episode, the type of games that we could do. But I think that's honestly the credit of Jonathan Ferguson, the Keeper of Firearms and Attila at the Royal Armouries Museum in the UK, which houses a collection of thousands of our current weapons throughout history.
It's hard to get in. He meets games halfway, he appreciates what a game is trying to do and he's got a lot of time for weird fiction and world building. The first time I had to explain to him what a bolt gun was or what a melter gun was from Warhammer, he was like, okay, that's very odd, but I sort of see it and it's cool and I like it.
Okay. Then you flash forward to when we did a Space Marine 2 episode, he's like, oh, that's a bolt rifle. Yes, mate.
That's great. Do you want to talk about EXP and how it came to be and why on earth would Gamespot not want your videos on their channel when people actually want them and like them? You don't have to answer that bit, but you want to make sure it hits.
That's my perspective on the situation.
You'd have to ask them, mate. Because I've not been able to figure it out. I think they, I mean, who knows, honestly, the easiest thing for me to mentally do is to just do the same thing that anyone has ever gone through a layoff has to think is that this decision was made by potentially people that don't watch the content, by people removed from the intricacies of what you were doing.
It's an old adage of people saying, when it comes to layoffs, you were just a name on a spreadsheet. There was potentially not a lot of thought that went into it. So yeah, who knows?
I have guesses, but I wouldn't like to say. You're right, people really enjoyed that content. What was odd for me is because, like it came to a real surprise that it happened almost naively because the content was doing so well.
I thought, oh, maybe I'm sort of immune to this. So when the meeting invite got dropped in to our calendars for like half an hour in the future, and then we joined that meeting and they said, you're being laid off. I was like, oh, that's something.
That's a surprise because we'd been through a number of rounds already over the past few years. But yeah, a lot of people really enjoyed that content. I loved making it.
Expert Reacts and Loadout are two things that if I had to point to, I might be most proud of in my professional career. So we took some time to absorb what was happening, and over the course of Christmas and into the New Year, we were thinking, I want this to end. Is there a way that we can continue this without stepping on anyone's toes?
Maybe doing it in our own way, developing it a little bit. So we thought, hey, let's give it a shot. The only reason we could do weekly episodes of Firearms Expert Reacts, plus a lot of the expanded expert stuff with people like Toby Capwell.
We talked about Armourwith, David Rawlings, who was the man who swung a giant seven-foot sword against my face. That was very scary, but he had to do it to demonstrate lightsaber work. It all makes sense if you watch the video.
We wanted to keep doing that stuff and people really enjoyed it. But the only reason we could do a weekly episode of Firearms, expand into other experts, do things like Loadout, is because there was a team behind that. It was me, Chris Morris, and Adam Mason.
Without the three of us, there would not have been a weekly episode. There would not be as much variety in experts. Loadout might have not existed because they were also such a huge part of those projects.
Loadout especially, I'm really proud of how polished that is. But I had no hand in editing it. So, if I edited it, it would not be quite as shiny, let me tell you that.
It was those guys working on the editor, Motion Graphics, and being behind the camera, getting really nice B-roll and shooting everything so beautifully. So, the three of us, we were like, hey, is there a way to continue this together? And that's where EXP came from.
We thought, let's give it a shot. Let's see if we can do a second wind and see if we can go fanfunded. Let's explore Patreon.
So many episodes would have a comment being like, oh, I could listen to Dave and Jonathan for hours, or I'd love to see this spun off into its own thing. We were sort of like, okay, like, put your money where your mouth is, then please, please and thank you. If people have been saying that for so many years, let's see if that is an option and let's try and do it on our own back.
Let's see what happens.
Yeah, it's awesome that you're giving it that shot. I think if any content can succeed in that vein, it's going to be something as hardcore and expertise centric as Expert Reacts. I think that's an amazing sort of thing to be able to build up again.
I think the people who love that content will no doubt be happy. It's an amazing sort of like put the playlist on of every single episode and just let it roll kind of series. So, yeah, I think I'm really glad you're doing it, Dave.
I appreciate that. Thank you.
Yeah, of course. I mean, I was curious what it was like seeing the response on social media when people realized the series was no more on GameSpot. I feel like people gradually picked up that you were going through what you went through.
And I was really glad to see that it got the kind of outrage that the decision warranted. So what was it like getting that kind of response on social media?
It was very odd. My biggest sort of, not regret, disappointment, I guess, is that the last episode that was uploaded for the Firearms Expert stuff didn't have me in it. So I wasn't able to address people directly.
It was, you know, I recorded the gameplay, but I think I was at a press event in Prague when the actual recording with Jonathan happened. So all I could do was leave a comment and I would have loved to actually talk to the audience. But seeing genuine befuddlement about it was sort of weirdly gratifying.
And seeing how much people said that, oh, they're going to miss it or they're gutted, was like helpful when it came to spinning things back up because it's like there was a big emotional response to all of that. So it's like, okay, if people are as excited for it to come back as they were confused of it leaving, they were probably going to be okay. But it was a very weird feeling like people are making Reddit posts about it.
Like my career has never made Reddit threads before, not like this, people would share my work, sure, but people actually discussing it and people in threads theorizing why it might have happened and I'm just having to stay out of it. That was very odd, but again, like gratifying and humbling to see maybe some of the people behind, you know, the comments or behind the view count. Like seeing them actually be like, I'm so disappointed that this has ended, that this was part of my Saturday ritual, or I'd watch it with my partner or me and a bunch of people from my Discord would get together to watch it.
That was a very weird, like depressing, but also elevating feeling if that makes sense. Like, sad that it's gone, but happy and blessed that, you know, I was able to see the people and receive those, like that much goodwill and that much support. So many tweets and messages came in after that, which was, yeah, super, super humbling.
The person who I felt sorry for outside of, you know, me and my colleagues who just lost their job was, there was a guy who requested a specific episode on a specific game every single week. And that had happened in previous years. Somebody requested literally like 52 weeks in a row, Order 1887.
Excuse me. I got emotional about the Order 1887 there. Requested that game every week, requested Order 1887 every single week.
So at Christmas we thought, as a little treat, let's do that episode. It might not perform well, but because it had become like a bit of a meme in our comment section, like people were like, oh, you know, keep it up one day they'll get to that game. And people were like celebrating him.
Well, let's do that episode. It's going to be a bit of a pain to capture, but let's do it. So we went and did that as our Christmas special.
And the reception was really nice because it felt like a community thing. The guy in the comment was like, oh my gosh, you finally did it. So when the next, when 2024 started, someone was requesting Valkyria Chronicles from like week one of 2024.
Oh, right. And for those who, for those out there who might not be familiar, it's like a World War II anime turn-based strategy game. It's very odd.
It's, I actually really, I'd play the games before that, but the setting is very, very unique. Yeah. So I thought, hey, let's do that episode for Christmas 2024.
I'd literally captured all the footage and I'd even learned Blender to get a good look at the weapon models. I was like extracting weapon models from the game data so we could see the weapons properly because otherwise it's like a third person strategy game. It's hard to see the weapons.
I said that in my comment, like, oh, I just finished capturing all this footage as well. And it made the Valkyria Chronicles subreddit and people were like, there goes my dream of finally seeing an episode. And what's funny since we announced EXP and we said, hey, it's coming back, that guy came back and was like, so should I start requesting Valkyria Chronicles again?
You should do it as a tier on Patreon, a really expensive tier where it's one person.
Three thousand pounds a month.
I mean, amazing to get that response so, Dave. I feel like it's deserved though. I mean, it's so rare that Games Media, anything you make in Games Media gets recognized.
And I think the only reason your stuff did is because it was of a very high quality and yeah, featured that real expertise and gave people something they weren't getting anywhere else. It was completely warranted and I'm glad it seems to have given you a bit of a slingshot effect to kind of kick off EXP, is that the case?
Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the kind words, but yeah, like people seeing it come back and already sort of having a trust in it, like the people that are working on it, the I think people can tell that it's going to be in good hands and returning faces. And we've already shown in our trailer in our first episode that we're trying to elevate the production and tweak it and make it our own again as well, which people are resonating well with. Talking about it for the first time and like teasing it across that first week and seeing people getting very excited was, yeah, it was so lovely, it was so great to see.
Yeah, that's awesome. Was it easy to get Jonathan back on board for this new venture? It seems like you got a very strong relationship at this point.
Yeah, I mean, we approached the Royal Armouries and said, because funnily enough, when we called the Royal Armouries, me, Adam and Chris, to say, hey, we've been let go, the things that we were talking about are unfortunately not going to continue. And like, I got really, like, I cried. Genuinely tears started to well up because I'd been, you know, part of, this relationship had been so consistent for so long, and it was stuff that I really cared about.
And I know, I knew how much people enjoyed it. So I did get quite emotional. So when it came time to, you know, ask them for another meeting and say, hey, we've got some ideas.
Can we run them by you? They were so incredibly supportive. They, they heard all our ideas.
They heard what we wanted to do. They were like, yeah, we'd, we'd, we trust you guys. The content's done really well for us before.
We've got a great relationship already. We know our brand would be in good hands with you. And because, because really like working so closely with another company, they are giving you an element of trust in their brand as well, because they're being represented on, on another channel.
And yet they were super lovely and super supportive and super eager for us to work together again. They're even nice enough to invite me over to Leeds to appear on their channel, which was super lovely as well. But they've been absolutely incredible.
And it's really gratifying knowing that they value our relationship as much as we do.
Yeah, absolutely. So you've kind of covered this in your video that talks about your plans to the channel, which people can watch now. What sort of content are you looking to put out?
What kind of games are you focusing on for your first series of videos with Jonathan on the channel?
We are expanding a bit of what we were doing with Jonathan specifically. So we will continue to do a... We will continue to have a weekly episode with Jonathan come out every Saturday.
We are starting with Black Ops 6. Funny enough, because we didn't get to do an episode of that previously. Right, right.
So we actually recorded it, but never went anywhere. So for us, it's sort of like the end of one thing, start of another. And there's a lot of really cool guns to look at in that game.
There's going to be a lot of stuff in the first person shooter space. But because we are no longer with GameSpot, the first four letters of that company being game, we want to expand into movies and TV and other mediums. So, you know, there's a lot more on the table now.
We've got some movie episodes lined up. We're also going to expand into other experts. So folks like Toby Capwell, amazing individual, knows so much around historical arms and armour, expressed interest in working together with him again.
He's actually, funny enough, I got him very into Warhammer when I first started showing him space marine armour. He messaged me a few days ago saying that he's just finished Book 53 of The Horus Heresy, which is crazy. But yeah, we're looking to get back into the shooter space, but also do a ton more.
Like our scope has increased both in the experts we're able to work with, but also the type of content we can do and the type of media we can cover now. So really excited to do more of that, have some movies and some other stuff as well.
Yeah, that's awesome. Well, I suppose like from here, then it's probably worth linking where people can go check out your stuff. Dave, link the Patreon, link the channel.
Yeah, if you go to youtube.com/atwatchexp or patreon.com/watchexp, that is where you'll find it all. That is where everything that we do in the expert realm, future documentaries, all that good stuff, that's where it's all going to live.
I'll link all that in the Patreon post for this episode at Backpage Pod on Patreon as well. So you can just go and click on that if you need an easy way to find it. But yeah, that's really exciting, Dave.
I wish you, Chris and Adam, all the best. Chris, a very nice man. I've met at two games comes now.
And just, yeah, it's really cool that you're working together and it's all the content sounds good to me. TV, Phil, moving into that is such a good idea. I think this you're right.
There's like a huge, you know, huge potential there in terms of finding a different audience as well. So yeah, that's awesome.
It was just an excuse for me to talk about the weird gun from Fifth Element for 20 minutes.
Well let's take a quick break and then we'll get you to talk about one of your other passions, which is Warhammer. And this is our craven attempt to finally do a Warhammer games themed episode of this podcast with someone who actually knows what they're talking about. So yeah, we'll take a quick pause and come back.
Welcome back to the podcast. Now to talk about Matthew's favorite subject, Warhammer video games. So, the other day Matthew did say to me when we were recording our Austin Powers episode, don't ask Dave, you don't want to know.
He was like, you're going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting in this one. And I was like, it's fine, Dave knows what he's talking about, we'll be all right. But yeah, so I suppose actually I will ask about your background with Warhammer, Dave.
I feel like the PC gaming thing unlocks my understanding of you somewhat, but sort of like how did this become like a big feature of your young life?
I owe it to my old friend Matthew Becker. He would invite me over for a little sleepover, hang out at this time, 26, no, about 14, I think, maybe younger, 13. And he painted Warhammer.
You go over for a sleepover, hang out with your mate, all that. I was like, oh, these little army men are pretty cool. What are they?
And he was like, don't touch them. They're my towel. If you touch them, I'm going to be angry.
Eventually, I wore him down enough that he let me paint one, which now is wild. If he somehow listens to this, thank you, because I'm not letting any random paint one of my Warhammer models. They're expensive.
You have to be real. You have to mean a lot to me for me to let you paint one of my Warhammers, especially when we were children and you need to make a squad of 10 last you in between the gap of birthday and Christmas. And he just let me paint one.
I really enjoyed it. Then from there, I think I dragged my mum to Shrewsbury. That was the nearest games workshop to me.
Wondered through the store. I was like, hey, those big green space nights are cool. Picked up my first box of Dark Angels.
And then every birthday, Christmas for years, I'd ask for paint, some brushes, a model, a tank. I think I painted on and off across high school. And then college happened, and you're 16, 17, and you think you're too cool for the hobbies that you had only 18 months ago.
Yeah.
So I stopped, went to uni, spent all my money on Strongbow instead of Warhammer. I think I picked it up towards the tail end of uni. And I remember trying to paint in my tiny dorms.
Like this room is not built for this. Put it away again and it wasn't until I joined GameSpot like 5, 6 years later that I wanted another hobby that wasn't video games. Because I'm sure you guys can appreciate this.
Sometimes at the end of a long day, when you've been playing video games, writing about video games, making news about video games, promoting video games, talking about video games, you kind of want something that isn't a video game to end the day with. So I was like, hey, maybe I can get back into Warhammer. And that was, yeah, I think I did that eight years ago.
And I've tried to be as pretty consistent with it as I can since. I've been able to inject my fandom into my work a bit, you know, unlocked the ability to go to Warhammer World and make a documentary, make Warhammer videos, expense a couple of models over a couple of years.
Nice, the dream.
Yeah, that was always fun when I was like free Warhammer, baby. That video I did with the Creative Assembly where I painted a tree man. That was, I think, the first piece of Warhammer I expensed.
Anyway, beautiful milestone.
Yeah, all uphill from there, baby. But yeah, so I just remained pretty consistent with it. I've always loved the lore, the setting.
I hosted a Warhammer Club in Loading Bar in London for a little while.
Oh yeah, I remember that.
Yeah. Yeah, that was fun. For a while, I was referred to as the UK Games Industry Warhammer guy.
I don't think that was as true towards the end of my career because so many more people got into the hobby, which was amazing to see. And yes, I've just kept it up since then. I think I'm wearing a Warhammer t-shirt now.
I am. Oh my God. Is that embarrassing?
Is this like wearing a Warhammer t-shirt to the gig?
Not at all. To a certain portion of our listeners, this is exactly what they want. They've yearned for this.
Myself and Matthew have not been able to deliver as people who were into this stuff as teenagers and didn't quite have the thing that a lot of my PC Gamer colleagues had where they all suddenly got back into it when they became sort of like turn 30 and had a bit of money in their pocket. And we're like, oh yeah, actually, I love this. I'm just going to do this the rest of my life now, which does describe a lot of the people that in sort of like myself and Matthew circles.
So yeah, Dave, I'm really excited to hear what your choice of best Warhammer games will be. What's the first one to kick us off?
So I need to clarify at the start. These are not the 10 best Warhammer games.
I was hoping this would be the case.
I have picked about 10, but they are 10 that either do I really enjoy or mean something to me. Like I said, they're not the best. So with that, I will start with Fire Warrior.
Oh yeah, now we're talking. You are in the right place to talk about mediocre PS2 games. This is our whole deal.
So yeah.
Remember it was, it was a, they were trying to promote it as a Halo killer.
Oh yeah.
Yeah. It wasn't a Halo killer. It was not very good.
I replayed it last year and I was like, woof, this is not aged very well at all. That was the first 40k game I think I played. And you're having a PS2.
That was, that was one of the things alongside stealing one of Matthew Becker's Tao. Playing that game really made me excited about Warhammer. And obviously my taste for games or my quality control for games has shifted.
Because at the time I was like, I love this game. This is sick. Now I look at it a bit less favorably, but it will always have a soft spot in my heart because it was the game I played at the start of my journey into the hobby.
The one thing I regret is that it came, one of the editions, or you could send off for something, there was a model of the player character from Fire Warrior available. I think he was made of lead or pewter. I had one and it is so, it's as rare as Rocking Horse shit these days.
I wish I still had it because that's like a relic now. But yeah, Fire Warrior, not a good game, but one that I will love. And it's weird now looking back at it because the lore is so messy.
You compare it to something like Space Marine 2, where they are very on the lore and want to be very true to the setting and narrative and lore that they have created. Fire Warrior, it doesn't make any sense. You're a single Fire Warrior and you're fighting like multiple chaos dreadnoughts or space marines.
You're picking up a bolt gun and shooting it without, even so much of a wrist sprain. It's not consistent with what you expect of Warhammer now. It's one of those games if you learn a lot about the setting and the lore and then go back and play.
You're like, hmm, I really need to switch this part of my brain off. I wish I could unlearn this knowledge just for this game here because it doesn't make a lick of sense. I think if there was a power level of characters in Warhammer, what's his name?
Kais, Kai, the Fire Warrior you play as. He's one of the most powerful entities in the entire 40k fiction based on what you can do in the game. And like Boltgun, the main character from Boltgun, the Sturnguard Sergeant or Sturnguard Veteran that you play as, Madam Kaido, there we go, nearly lost my Warhammer credit there.
It makes sense in that game because it's like a doom-like. So you can sort of let it go, but because Firewarrior is trying to like give a bit more story, it doesn't make any sense that this Firewarrior can do what he can do. Maybe this is my anti-Tao buyer showing, but...
Well, I've got to say that the renders, I've just fired this up on GOG, where it's 79p at present to buy Firewarrior, arguably what it's worth. And the Tau character models in it are duplo-looking motherfuckers, I will say, by today's standards. But I can definitely see why at the age you would have been when this came out, why this would really have an impact on you, Dave.
So yeah, that's a fun pick. What's your next choice?
Okay. So this one, I would urge you guys to check out. It's called Final Liberation, epic 40,000 Final Liberation.
It was Warhammer 40k's attempt at Command and Conquer. And what's the best thing about Command and Conquer games?
Tanya? Tesla coils?
No. Try again.
It's building bases? I don't know.
It's the cutscenes.
Oh, of course.
The shot for real to camera cutscenes. And Final Liberation has those, but in 40k. And they are amazing.
There are actually like very professional and talented actors role playing. It's not called role playing. It's acting.
What am I talking about? Acting as a commissar and doing it all in law and like shouting at a planetary governor. There are people in, I mean, by today's standards, not very well made orc costumes, like walking towards the camera and like grunting.
And it's such a time capsule. The rest of the game is like, whatever. But just those elements, seeing what used to be the nod or the GDI cutscenes from Command and Conquer, seeing Warhammer versions of those in between the missions is so, so good.
And genuinely, watch some of the cutscenes on YouTube or something, because they are hilarious and also amazing because they are, it's another one of those things that I respect a lot because they are full sending it. And this guy is, yeah, yeah, I believe that he's a commissar. The Orc guy, I believe a bit less, but it's such a time capsule.
It's incredible. I love it.
This will set you back £1.19 on GOG at present. You fired up some of the cutscenes from this when we had a beer in the Bethesda office last year.
Oh, yeah.
It was very enjoyable. So I could see exactly what this game meant to you from having that conversation, Dave. That's fine.
Well, that's awesome. What's your third recommendation or, you know, pick?
My, I'm switching over to fantasy now. Warhammer Dark Omen was another game that I played very early in my Warhammer journey when I was quite young. You might have heard of Shadow of the Horned Rat.
Yeah. Yeah.
It was a, I think it was the sequel or the one that came after that. And it was basically a very, very early Total War game on the PlayStation. You could build up units of mercenaries, control them like you would a Total War game.
You could field your cannons, shoot into a unit of goblins and see them dash across the screen. I think you were called the Grudgebringers. You were this mercenary gang.
You could get wizards in, shoot fireballs. You'd fight goblins, undead, orcs. But it was, you look at it now, and you're like, yeah, that's, that's Total War Warhammer, but way earlier.
And I remember it being really, really hard. And I played the first like three missions a bunch of times. But seeing those very pixelated steam tanks and cavalry, always remember fondly.
You know, seeing all the crossbowmen, moving your units around from, from one position round mountains and through forests to get a flank. It was, and I played this before Total War. But I think this was the first time where I was like, I'm going to be a big Total War nerd.
But yeah, that's, that's another old one that's, which by today's standards might not be very good, but will always have a place for me. Very nostalgic one for me.
Dave, do you actually play the game, the real game itself, or do you just collect and paint? Like, I'm curious if, if, if any of these games do capture the, what it is to actually play the game itself. I've played two games of Warhammer in my life after having some dark elves for a couple of years as a teenager.
From time to time, not as much as I would like to. I've played a bit more kill teams. That's like smaller scale battles.
Funny enough, when I made, when I, when I started the Warhammer event in London, it was giving me an excuse to play Warhammer. And then, you know, sods law, it was, most of my time was spent managing and organizing it. So I don't play nearly as much as I would like.
I'd like to play more. The last game I played was Necromunda, which is like gang warfare. It's a little, a little more silly.
It leans on the silly aspect of Warhammer a little more because you're just a bunch of gangers fighting in the sewers or something rather than, you know, stoic space marines advancing in a line for an objective.
Yes. These images of Dark Omen, they look more like how I remember Warhammer, the game, you know, the actual game to be.
It's such a great game. And I think that the game that captures Warhammer best, in terms of like a strategy game, probably is like Total War Warhammer 3 now. I mean, if you want to play Virtual Warhammer, you play like tabletop simulator or something.
But I think different games capture different elements of Warhammer differently. Whether that's the tactics that go into it or the lore and atmosphere.
Yeah, it's Dark Omen is not available on GOG, unfortunately. You can go buy a second hand PS1 copy on eBay for somewhere between 35 and 50 pounds. So, very ambitious for its time, though.
You can see from the screenshots that they're trying to do a lot with the PS1's grunt. So, I respect the effort for sure. What's your fourth pick, Dave?
I'll say the original Dawn of War.
Ah, perfect. A game I've actually played.
It's a great game. That's another one that I played in the grand scheme of things fairly early into my love of Warhammer. And I've always loved strategy games, RTS games.
Dawn of War is so good. There are so many great moments in it as well. If you're a Warhammer fan, like really resonate with you.
Like there's a scene where Gabriel Angelos finds some guardsmen in a crater and he says, you've you've held this position all by yourself for three days. They're like, yes, my lord. And it's like, yeah, shout out to those guardsmen.
Sick. And they have the voice that I now associate with a guardsman. If I hear that voice again, I'm like, that's a 40k guardsman.
And that's what a 40k guardsman sounds like.
That's what cannon fodder sounds like in this universe.
When I played that, I was always someone that wanted to try and keep as many guardsmen alive as possible. I was not sending them into the meat grinder, but maybe I should have. I was never good at like online skirmishes, but I played the campaign through a bunch of times.
And it had like really great DLCs, which I'll bundle in with it as well. When they introduced Sisters of Battle and Necrons, I still remember the story of... It has to have been a good game because it's the only game that's canonized a Space Marine chapter.
And I mean, made them into canon, not turn them into saints.
I appreciate you making that clear. I didn't understand.
Well, considering the religious themes in 40k, I was like, if there was ever a time to clarify. But the Blood Ravens didn't exist before Dawn of War, but Dawn of War made them exist. And now there's even interesting lore tidbits from current 40k that relate back to the Blood Ravens, how people theorize that they are a thousand, a secret thousand sun successor chapter.
And I've just lost half the audience there. I apologize.
No, I'll take your word for it.
Yeah, but the other half fucking loved it, to be honest. So that's fine. I loved Dawn of War as well.
It was, there's nothing about it as particularly revolutionary as an RTS, except the way it uses the license, I think. And, you know, kind of gives people that thing they've been imagining, their kind of dream kind of mashup of something like Command and Conquer with the 40k universe. So yeah, I feel like it's, it was a huge moment.
I had a friend on Play Magazine when I worked there, who said, why would I play any game that's coming out on PS3 when I can just play Soulstorm this weekend? And that was kind of like him for about a year. So, yeah.
I will genuinely go and watch the opening cut scene from the first Dawn of War every now and again, because it's just one of the coolest things that's ever been put on YouTube. It's so good.
Yeah, it's still the thing people talk about when any talk of the series returning comes up. So yeah, it makes sense to have this in the list. What's your next pick, Dave?
It will surprise you and go with Dawn of War 2. I actually like Dawn of War 2 more than I do Dawn of War. As much as I love the original Dawn of War, Dawn of War 2, the squad element.
The fact that you were, you know, you were what, one, two, three, you were anywhere between like five and ten space marines fighting so many enemies. It really elevated the power fantasy of a space marine. You know, you read all the books and if a space marines got a name and doesn't wear a helmet, you know he's going to be able to fight off like thousands and thousands and thousands of orcs or something.
But it played a bit more on the strategy of using a squad. So you know, you had to set up your your Devastators or the Heavy Balter in cover. You had you were able to flank with your assault marines to get behind the enemy or disrupt them by landing on them.
Tanks had weak, weak side armor and weak rear armor. It was the combination of because, you know, it was all under relic. It took everything I loved about the Company of Heroes games, which have been historically some of my favorites as well, blended that with the original Dawn of War and made like the squad combat based Dawn of War, which worked so, so very well for me.
You know, leveling up your guys, getting war gear. Oh, I'm going to fight a bunch of tanks this mission. Right, I'm going to give that bold guy a rocket launcher and see what he can do.
Oh, I'm going to be fighting loads of infantry. Right, chainswords and heavy bolters it is. That felt really, really good.
Had like a decently tight story and yeah, I really resonated with the squad element of it and the increase of power fantasy.
What's the consensus on this one? It started off, it sounded like you were being a little bit defensive about this one, as in not everyone agrees with you. Or is that a misreading of it?
No, it's always debated between one and two. I think most people favor one over two. Not a lot of people favor three.
You're surprised, you know. Three is not a good one. So the discussion is always one or two.
It really depends on if you're an RTS player, I think, or someone that likes different types of strategy games, something like a Dawn of War, because it's not dissimilar in how you control your troops. But I remember at the time, people were a little upset, I guess, because it was quite a departure from one to two. But after playing three as well, you look back at one or two and you're like, oh, we didn't know we had it so good.
Sam, as I was going to ask, what was the expansion you were obsessed with? Which Dawn of War was that?
That's the last stand in Dawn of War 2, which is amazing. David, I don't know if you've played that at all, where you basically pick-
Yeah, because that's when you could play as a Tyranid, right?
Yeah, and basically your power is just churning out more and more Tyranids to do your bidding. That is so good. I've played about 20 hours of that this year so far.
This year?
Yeah, it became an obsession for me.
It's the 18th of February.
Yeah, it was a huge thing. We've actually finished one of the maps now, which was really hard to do.
I never finished a map. Get me in on this. I'm installing Dawn of War 2.
Yeah, we just went at it for about something like every other Saturday for about, I don't know, eight weeks between December and end of January. We really churned through it. So yeah, it's the good shit.
I think Dawn of War 2 holds up because as things, obviously, it's not turn-based like XCOM, but I think that more granular customization and strategy has become a bit more in vogue in recent years. And so, 2 actually holds up, I think, the scale of it. Whereas at the time, I think, like you say, people wanted more of the scale of 1, or if not that even ramped up further than the scale of 1 already was.
But yeah, I think it really holds up.
You would have gone through the same thing I've had to go through a number of times then when it comes to reinstalling Dawn of War 2, and you have to install a patch to get around the Games for Windows Live stuff.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Is it not fixed now? I haven't had that problem recently.
Oh, is it? Actually, maybe? I might be wrong, but I don't think I had any issues last time, but actually, now you mention it.
I vaguely remember someone else who was playing with mention this. So, I might have already done it years ago and just forgotten that I did it. That might have been, I don't know, but yeah, Games for Windows Live, I remember getting it at the time and installing it, and that was again part of the thing that was a bit controversial about this game.
So yeah, good stuff, Dave. What's the next pick?
Well, speaking of controversy, I'm gonna actually pick a game that's impossible to play now, because I love it for the potential it had. Eternal Crusade.
Oh, of course.
It's as close as we've ever got to Battlefield in Warhammer, Warhammer in Battlefield. It never even came out, I think it never came out of Early Access, but it took the Combat of Space Marine and made it into a, I think it was like a 32 V32 or at least 16 V16 game mode. No, it must have been 32 because it was quite big.
It had a class system, it had vehicles and it had objectives similar to something like Battlefield 3. I've always loved Battlefield 3, loved Warhammer, loved the original Space Marine game. This was a blend of those.
When you ask people about their, if you could have any Warhammer game, inevitably, the thread will say something like Battlefield but Warhammer. This is as close as we got. It had the vehicle gameplay, it had the infantry gameplay, it had different classes, different weapons, progression.
It had, I think it was Loyalist Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar and Orcs. They were like specialists who could be like an Orc commando. It had so, so much going for it.
I remember playing it a bunch back when you could. When they said, we're shutting it down, development is not going to continue. I hadn't played it for a while, but I was quite gutted just because it was so easy to see where that game could have gone if support was there, if budget was there, if they didn't come up to as many development issues.
But I hope some studio revisits a format like this, because it was so much fun. It was unbalanced and a bit buggy, but everything outside of its issues made it such a good and promising experience to me.
Yeah. I have played this because it was weirdly at one of the PC Gamer events we did. Am I right thinking this was an MMO that they retrofit into a shooter, Dave?
It was something like that, yeah. I think that's one of the things that caused so many issues. Because they wanted a persistent war, I remember.
So like over the course of months or a year or something, you'd be fighting over sectors and you could lose them and something would happen to your faction, you'd have to fight it back and regain that ground to get that perk back, which I don't think really worked because most people just played as space marines.
Yeah, I could see exactly why the sort of potential of this would have been exciting, how you can see in your mind's eye that there's maybe like a better game to be made, off the back of it or pushed forward. That's a cool, a pick I was not expecting. I hadn't thought about that game in a long time.
What's your next pick, Dave?
I want to talk about Rogue Trader. That's fairly new in the grand scheme of things. It's a CRPG.
I love a good CRPG. This came off the back of Baldur's Gate 3. Owlcat made it, which they've got a track record of CRPGs in the past.
But we've never had a CRPG in the world of 40k before. You've never been able to role play in the world of 40k before to this level. Having that tool kit and the options and the character building and the dialogue choices.
This is what is nice about Rogue Trader, because you play as a Rogue Trader who are sort of outside the rules of the Imperium. They're allowed to do things like have an Eldar companion and go into battle with them. So you get to be this like cheeky frontiersman exploring the world of Warhammer within a CRPG formula.
I mean, turn-based combat and dialogue choices. And it does throw you into the deep end of 40k, but the writing is really solid and the dialogue system works really well is because it's got like a living glossary in it. So if somebody talks about the warp, for example, you could hover over the word warp and it'll explain to you what the hell the warp is.
So while it is a bit of a deep end game, I think it's actually really good for people wanting to get into Warhammer 40k because it can drip feed so much for you. And a Warhammer 40k RPG is something that again, I'd been wanting for years and Road Trader does a really great job at making you feel like you're a character, an individual in the 41st millennium. It's a great time.
The last third is a little rough, but it's very common in CRPGs, I feel. Not that it's any excuse, but it's definitely worth playing if you like CRPGs in general. And if you want to get into 40k, it's a great time.
And again, it's another one of those things that goes full send with its sort of silliness or just the setting of 40k. Like you have a guy with you called Abelard and whenever you meet someone, you can basically command him to announce you and he has to step in front of you and go, Behold, Rogue Trader Dave and reel off like your 20 titles. And you just get to stand there like all smug.
It's great. You can opt out of that. But if you want to go like full silly, super loyalist and if anyone looks at you the wrong way, and any sign of heresy, you put a bolt round through them, the game lets you do that.
And it works so well.
That's awesome. Yeah, I meant to play this one. Owlcat feels like one of those studios that is maybe two games away from having its larian sort of like original Sin 2 into Baldur's Gate 3 moment where they just become super, super huge.
And you can sort of see them on the upward trajectory. That's a cool pick. I have that in the old Epic Games press account, Dave.
So I will install that and give that a try.
I recommend it. I'd love to know what you think of it because, yeah, I think this is my favorite game they've made.
Oh, that's cool. Yeah, because I think that I was intrigued by the way it pulls in a few different factions and the way that you interact with different factions from that universe. I feel like it's something I just hadn't really seen them do in a game before.
So, yeah. Yeah, really cool. Are we on your penultimate pick?
Is that right? I can't count.
Three more written down so I can go fast.
Okay. Perfect. No, it's all good.
It's all good. What's your eighth pick, Dave?
Darktide.
Oh, of course.
I really enjoyed Vermintide, which this feels like a disservice. This was accurate when Vermintide 1 came out and people were saying, this is Left 4 Dead in Warhammer Fantasy. But instead of zombies, it's rats.
Instead of a gun, you've got a fiery staff and swords and bows and arrows, and also guns sometimes. Left 4 Dead is a horde shooter, but there's a bit more to it, isn't there? Because there's the story and progression and exploration.
It gives you the same feeling of Left 4 Dead, but in the realms of Warhammer. Again, I love Vermintide 2. Great game.
I think if I had to be, because I was toying between Vermintide 2 or Darktide, if I had to be brutal, I think Vermintide 2 is a more feature complete, better game. But because I gravitate towards 40k more, and Darktide does a phenomenal job at atmosphere, I picked Darktide. Also, the soundtrack smashes.
The soundtrack is so, so good, and another thing going for it is you get to play as an ogren, and instead of a grenade, he just picks up a rock and full sends it through the jawbone of a heretic, if you're accurate enough. So any game that lets you throw a stone at the speed of mach, fuck you, is on my list, frankly. It's so good.
It's exciting. The gunplay feels really good. The combination of gunplay and melee combat works really well.
They've got warp powers in now. It launched strongly and then had like a lull. It had some issues, and I know it had some controversy around monetization.
But if you can sort of see past that, it's an absolute blast playing with your friends. You know, I had a small group that played it every night around release, and it would be me with my O'Gren's auto gun. My girlfriend played as a psycho that was zapping people.
Another friend of mine, Johnny, he was a zealot with a flamethrower and a giant chainsword. The vibes are gruesome, grimdark, and horrible, but they are also immaculate.
Yeah, like I played this at release, and I felt like their mistake was maybe not being a bit more, maybe launching it in early access would have been a good idea for the original release, because it was just, yeah, like you say, they had to kind of go back and do quite a lot of revisions to it. But that was true for Vermintide 2 as well, that they ended up rebalancing a lot of it. And I think this is how Fat Shark work when they're making these games.
I think that's why people were frustrated. It's because they were like, we've been here before. We've played these games before.
You've let this out the cooker too early. Like, we're still going to eat it because it's good, but we could have let it simmer for 6 more months.
Yeah, it was great though, seeing their sort of art pass on this universe, like the environments and stuff, the textures of these very industrial levels. Just fantastic.
Which gets so lost because of the mobs. Like there's so many moments in that game where if you have a very rare lull and nothing is happening and you just take a look around, you're like, oh my god, they have realised what a hive city in 40k is supposed to feel like. And it's one of those games that's a bit staggering to look at.
Makes you feel so, so small, which you're supposed to in a 40k game, frankly.
Yeah. And I felt very represented by the Orgrin body shape. It's nice to see myself in a game.
That was good. Okay. That's great.
I'm pleased that you clump it together with Vermintide too, because I agree that you can dual wield both of them. They're both great sort of jump in kind of co-op games with a friend. So that's cool.
What's your penultimate pick, Dave?
I'm going to pull together the Total War Warhammer trilogy.
Nice.
Because those games have, you know what? Forgive my clicking. Let's see how many hours I've put collectively in these in these games.
So between the original, because they were always, I remember when they announced it, they said, oh, this is going to be a trilogy that by the third game, they're all going to merge together into one big game, which they have done with the Immortal Empires game mode. But between, across all three games, oh my God, this is actually more than I thought it was.
A man realizing what he's done in real time.
450 hours.
Wow.
And I wouldn't even consider myself very good at them.
That's a lot for a games journey who plays loads of games.
They're so, so good. The variety in factions you get, how Creative Assembly have realized the law of the old world and the end times, the units, how each faction have their own very unique play style and perk and units and abilities. Because, you know, that would always be a thing in Total War games, but the Romans versus the Gauls versus the Greeks can only feel so different, right?
Whereas Total War Warhammer, because they get to explore fiction, they are vastly different. And it just works so incredibly well, being able to play all of those factions together on the entire massive map in Immortal Empires. So you don't notice like, oh, I'm going to start at the Skaven.
I don't know if I'm going to have to fight against humans or greenskins or dwarfs. In terms of strategic options and strategic gameplay, I think it's more realized than actual historical titles, because you do have to apply much more in the way of strategy to deal with the weirdness that each faction has. Because you know, the dwarfs are going to be super slow, but they're killer at range.
I need to field an army that's going to be fast to get around the flanks. Oh, the Bretonians are going to have a lot of cavalry, so maybe I should have something that's using range or invest into spears and things like that. It's another one of those things that, again, just the scale of it helps its marriage with the fantasy, if that makes sense.
Like we think of Warhammer Battles as massive. So a game that lets you field 500 guys, dudes on a Pegasus that can shoot fireballs from the sky, catapults that are slinging little goblins with Leonardo Da Vinci-esque wings on them. All that scale comes together to make something that's true to the universe.
I must bloody love it because I don't realize I've got 500 collective hours over it.
Yeah. It's the feat of getting their arms around that entire universe as well. Then putting it all in the game over three games.
That's just people who know what those fans want to see in that kind of experience.
It's another one of those things that they've obviously earned GW's trust and the trust of the player base because they've been able to realize a faction. Like, Cafe only existed in books and art. But in Total War Warhammer 3, they were fleshed out into a full faction.
It's the sort of thing that Relic got to do with the Blood Ravens. They got to add their own mark onto the lore. And again, I don't even think I'm very good at Total War Warhammer games or Total War games.
I just like the spectacle of them. I like the power creep, the feeling of painting the map my colour, and just the options that come available to you as you progress through the game and you get end game events. And, you know, it feels just so satisfying and gratifying just fielding giant demons or something and squashing a bunch of scavenging.
Like, it's got spectacle to it that as much as I love the historical titles, they don't have quite as much.
Impressive is all that is, Dave. It's no Dark Omen, is it? On PS1.
Let's face it. Well, no.
But what is? You know what I mean?
No, that's awesome. I think it has created a bit of a conundrum for them about how do you actually follow up that trilogy. And, you know, obviously, you know, apart from those side games, they haven't really made a full historical game since The Three Kingdoms, right?
So maybe they are genuinely...
But even that is not historical, strictly speaking. Sorry, I didn't mean to be like, actually, that's not...
But, you know, I mean, yes, it's based on fiction, right? Historical fiction.
It's the middle. I always described it as the middle ground between historical and the Warhammer fantasy ones, because it... But I think there is like a game mode for Three Kingdoms that you can play that's a bit more historical.
But, yeah, it's been a while since they've gone both feet into the actual historical realm. But maybe we'll see it again. There's always been rumours around a 40k total Warhammer.
Personally, I can't see how that would work, but I wouldn't complain that if they gave it a shot. Obviously the player base has resonated with it because it has been, like you said, so long since they've done a full mainline historical title.
Yeah, a lot of money on the table if they do manage to crack 40k, I guess. So, yeah, that makes sense. By the way, I should apologise for calling it 40k.
I've been told by someone of our listeners who works at Games Workshop that it's really lame when people say 40k. So there's my... Just putting that out there, that I'm aware of that.
I keep forgetting.
Oh, no, I'm lame.
No, I mean, not at all. But if you say it's OK, that probably makes it OK, if you're saying it, to be honest. But yeah, it's all good, Dave.
OK, what is your final pick?
Well, it's got to be Space Marine. And I'm bundling it with Space Marine 2. You can't stop me.
Nice. Amazing games.
What's not been said about the Space Marine games, guys? What's not been said?
On this podcast, not much.
Yeah, I put it in my game of the year list last year. I thought it was just that kind of 360 style experience you kind of miss. But obviously, there is such texture to it in terms of authenticity and the way different bits of the lore are kind of incorporated in that bit at the end with the spoiler alert, Lord of Change was like, oh, I didn't actually think I'd see this in this game.
Yeah.
It's just amazing. But yeah, sorry. I don't mean to trail you there, Dave.
No. I mean, preaching to the choir. Like, funnily enough, I got my first writing gig at that fan enthusiast site that I mentioned earlier, GGS Gamer, off the back of a Space Marine review.
And I found it. Yeah, it's still on my Google Drive. And I was like, oh my god, I forgot about this.
Let me tell you, it's not well written. It's way, way, way too long because I just could not shut up about it, frankly, because I absolutely love that game. The first Space Marine, it was the first time, you know, an individual Astarte's got to showcase such a power fantasy that you got to play as one of these characters that you read about in the Black Library books that could fight dozens upon dozens of orcs and do all these mad feats of martial prowess and combat.
And you got to do that by mashing buttons and healing yourself by doing gruesome executions. And all that still holds up like tremendously well. Doing these big finishing moves, plunging a chainsaw into the gut of an orc.
It's still a spectacle to behold. And by today's standards, the gameplay of the original Space Marine isn't super deep, but you don't really want it to be. Part of you wants to shove your brain off and just enjoy the spectacle.
And I think that's okay. But the story still, I mean, it's still got merit today. People still reference the story, the characters, especially, you know, like Leandros.
There's a dynamic between all the characters that have persisted so many years later. And the fact that they were able to tap into an old fanbase of Space Marine, make Space Marine 2 both for that original fanbase, me, that was so excited for it and make it feel like something that harkened back to the original Space Marine, while also making something new and much more elevated than the original one ever could be, was incredible to see. Like, I don't know if I've been more excited about a game release because it was, you know, so long after the original.
And the original was so formative to my love of games, love of Warhammer. Like I said, I wrote about it very early in my career. Seeing 2 just even exist was incredible.
And the job that they've done with Space Marine 2 is nuts, frankly. Like I was genuinely quite gobsmacked when I first got hands-on with like an early build of Space Marine 2. The scale of the world, the weight of the Space Marine, just as it walks, how satisfying cleaving through Tyranids is, the ability to create swarms of Tyranids using the, is it the Horde engine or something?
Yeah, Saber's just like that. All their games are like, we've got loads and loads of stuff for you to kill. That's the whole thing, basically.
The fact that we're able to take the engine from the World War Z games and swap out zombies for Tyranids, basically, again, give you that power fantasy of seeing insurmountable odds and feeling so outnumbered within a few chainsword slashes, you're back in the fight. You don't feel outnumbered. You don't feel like the hundreds of enemies on your screen are even going to scratch the paint on your armour.
It's done such an incredible job at realising the power fantasy that playing as a space marine should. And I love it so much. The environments, the combat, the story, and even outside of the actual nitty gritty of the game, the fact that it's opened the world of Warhammer up to so many more people, it's like exploded outside of what is massive fan base, but still fairly niche.
The fact that it drew so many people in is incredible. Because I've always been someone that's like Warhammer will only get better the more people that are welcomed in, that can enjoy it. And now we've got things like a potential show.
And there was the whole secret level stuff that touched on the law of the game. Honestly, the whole podcast could have been me talking about how much I love Space Marine 2, because it's such an incredible feat of a team. You can tell that the team loved Warhammer, either that they started off loving Warhammer, or by the end of it loved Warhammer, because of the just incredible attention to detail in it.
It's a game that I've played a couple of times now, and both times I've noticed something new. I did a video back at GameSpot where I was looking for Easter eggs. And there are tiny references in there that you'd never, never, never notice unless you stopped to look for them.
But it all comes together to make the lore and the world feel so, so realised. And it goes back to the, something I've said a couple of times is that if you go full send into creating a world and make it as authentic as possible. It could be the maddest fiction, but if you make that fiction feel lived in and feel authentic and feel like the player can take big bites out of it and not feel overwhelmed, it works so, so well.
Like even even down to the, when you're in the zinchi areas and fighting those enemies, there's little particle effects. And if you pause the game and go into photo mode, those particle effects are letters from a language, a zinchi language from an old codex or an issue of White Dwarf. Like they didn't have to go that far into making their game feel authentic and making their lore feel fleshed out.
But I think part of them probably realized that, hey, Warhammer fans are going to go through this with a fine-tooth comb. And that was me.
Yeah. Yeah. And it's that thing of, we've got eight hours of game here and we're going to show you so many cool moments like stuffed within it.
It's going to be like necking a bottle of Ribena that hasn't been watered down basically. It feels like the approach they took. Like when you have that bit where all the Imperial Guard tanks are going over that bridge, or like the bit where the dreadnought smashes through the wall and kills a bunch of dudes.
It's just so well done. Yeah. And obviously has been a huge success.
And it feels like I said this in the podcast before, but it feels like a significant moment when a game like that outsells a Star Wars game, like Outlaws by millions of copies. It maybe feels like it's the moment for something like this to happen. For Warhammer, so great stuff, Dave.
Great picks overall. Really appreciate you going through those. I mean, very grateful to have your expertise.

I can't wait to see what they make. Thank you so much and we'll be back next week. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Bye.
