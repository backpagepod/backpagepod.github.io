Hello and welcome to the Backpage XL, a patriot exclusive episode. of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew. How did you find Superman, which we both saw last night? I've not seen your letter boy.

Matthew
00:36
I liked it. I th I thought it was a bit of a mess, but not as much of a mess as I thought it was gonna be. Basically all the stuff I thought looked terrible in the trailers I ended up quite enjoying. Like I liked all the the weird side characters. It's really, really silly. But then I think like the original Superman films are quite silly as well. Like Lex Luther is quite a buffoonish enemy with quite a a silly plan in this film. More than the sum of its parts, I guess.

Samuel
01:04
Yeah, I liked it too. I I think I could have done with one fewer side character. Like I'm not a big metamorpho guy, for example. Um but uh I did like Nathan Fillian's Green Lantern. I thought he was fun. Um yeah.

Matthew
01:16
I for me it was the I thought outside of Lewis Solane, I thought the whole Daily Planet lot was a mega bust Oh you didn't like Jimmy Elson in. I didn't Oh I thought I thought that was I thought that was fucking rubbish. Whatever the turn on with that character. I was like, I don't get I just didn't get the joke.

Samuel
01:32
Like well I didn't mind I didn't mind him, but the guy from the wire being Perry White, that guy was properly phoning it in. Like that was a proper way. Yeah, I just didn't think he was um he was quite the stuff. But yeah, it was I was there thinking, I wish there was just one more Lois and Clark scene because those bits were really, really good and made the characters seem really rich in a way that the Marvel films just are never able to do anymore. So um

Matthew
01:59
Yeah. I'm also I'm just such a sucker for Clark Kent talking to his dad. Like that's you know, that was basically the all of Smallville magic back in the day. Uh that particular dynamic, I don't know, it always gets me.

Samuel
02:13
Yeah, exactly. I like that they didn't cast um his parents as being too a sort of like I mean I I didn't even recognise the actors, you know. I assume they're like people you might see in the background of a TV show or something. But they're um yeah, I like that. It's a a slightly, you know, more reserved choice than having Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, which was Gave it a very different energy, I think. But he was good in it as well. Anyway, yeah, I liked it. It was I think I agree. I think it was slightly better than I thought it was gonna be. I think it's gonna grow in my estimation in my head as well because You know, if it had come along even like five years ago as well, when before we were at maximum superhero fatigue, I think it would land even even better than it does. But um it seems like people quite like it. And uh, you know, the I it was like surprisingly it was like superficially political, but there was quite a lot of like obvious political parallels in there as well. So That was an interesting choice, but um I'm sure the the usual people will get upset about that, Matthew. Um okay, good. So um I gave it three and a half, by the way. What would you what would you give it? Exclusively reveal that? Yeah, probably that Yeah, that's in I think that seems about right. Um yeah, it was a little bit more than a lot of things.

Matthew
03:16
I had a good evening at the cinema. I laughed a lot, sometimes with it, sometimes at it.

Samuel
03:22
It needed like one it needed an enemy that he could punch that was like a good a good villain. I think that was the one thing that Man of Steel had over it, is that Zod was like a proper bastard and he could beat the shit out of Zod. But here it's like He's gotta just basically beat up a video game enemy while Lex Luther's sort of on the on the radio in the background, you know what I mean?

Matthew
03:40
But uh Yeah, I d I kinda I didn't mind that. I actually qu I think I like Lex do through a bit more. I think you're just really out on Nicholas Holt.

Samuel
03:49
Uh I like a certain mode of Nicholas Holt, but I'm not sure that he has much more to him. in this in this mode, doing an American accent trying to seem a bit I don't know, like it was it was not exactly a banner villain performance, you know what I mean? It wasn't exactly like he brought loads of gravitas to the screen. It might have well it might as well have been anyone really. I don't know. I do I didn't think he brought loads of depth to it, but yeah, I don't know. I don't have an anti halt thing. It's just, you know, it's in like I say the great and the favourite, he's in a mode that's perfect for him, which is kind of like sort of wanker Hugh Grant mode. I think that actually works quite well for him anyway. Right. Um But yeah, there's my exclusive review. That Coron Sweat guy was was good and so was um Rachel Prosterhat. They were both like all amazingly cast, so But Well done, uh, to James Gunn and superhero movies, I guess. Um yeah, I'm curious to see where that goes. They make loads of fucking random films like Sgt. Rock and Clayface I don't think anyone will pay to see, but um whatever, that's his problem, not mine. Um okay Matthew, it's a draft episode, but before we get to the Shuttered Studios draft, which is all about uh the game developers that have been closed down over the years and the great games they made. Um it is a tribute to those studios and we are not repeat not dancing on anyone's graves for content. That's not the goal of this. Uh we're definitely beautiful flowers on their graves. Gorgeous flowers, um overpriced flowers. Um absolutely. Um but before we get to that Matthew, I did promise the listeners that I would read Edge's uh review to you of uh Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. Uh got a three out of ten from Edge, that one. Right. As good as Mine's Eye And so uh which I know which I know you'll agree with. Um so which they gave three in the same issue. So uh yeah, I did think that would just be amusing, but just because The Switch 2's been a funny old subject for you this year. Um, and this game as well was a bit of a lightning rod for discussion when when we did that episode. Um, so Like us, we imagine that your first goal on setting up a new console is not to sit around and read about its features, but to play with them. And yet the first exhibit we land on in Welcome Tour is a series of information boards explaining the ins and outs of Switch 2's new mouse control. Followed by quiz in which we regurgitate the information just fed to us. This is an oddly dry and clinical package in many ways. As you trot around giant renditions of the console outside and in, Nintendo's public mask of Cheery characters and fantasy worlds dissolves, um, bearing the most business like the the business like workings beneath. Any enthusiasm here feels inauthentic. forced through the mouths of NPCs in the virtual exhibition as they proclaimed their amazement at the genius of HD Rumble 2. The Disneyland promise of new Nintendo hardware thus Manifests as a school trip to the science museum. Not that there isn't a certain genius to HD Rumble to, and when you enter Welcome Tours, tech demos and mini-games, you discover they can provide moments of delight. The sensation of soaring a piece of wood in half, with vertical mouse movements and variable vibrations, is remarkable. We're also taken by a touchscreen variant of of Twister, a gamification of the kickstand. In which we're asked to adjust it to match a given angle and an exercise in face pulling mimicry. But these are magical moments, never more than that. And mainly it's the hardware that impresses us, not the game design. An early mouse mini game, for example, ably demonstrates the accuracy of the device, even when placed on a trouser leg. But the activity itself, which involves weaving a UFO beneath uh between spiked balls, is the lowest grade of fun. And also, well welcome to what takes us all over Switch 2 and its accessories. The bulk of attractions focuses on rumble or mouse control. There's only so much mileage in showing off 4K resolution or 120 FPS. with the latter over exercised to the point that a few of its minigames are a poor fit, revealing its limitations. The clearest signal that entertainment is of secondary concern here though, is that progress is gated not by minigames but by stamps. Which you collect by scouring each location until button prompts materialize, enabling you to label each part of the console. In short, Welcome Tour seems designed more to highlight the USB ports and air intake fans um than give you a game. The climax of our tour sees us trapped inside our new machine, running laps and poking into every corner, praying we'll find the last stamp to open the exit. At this point, one question about Switch 2 remains. Nintendo, how did it come to this? Oh my word. I mean Three three subscriptions.

Matthew
08:10
Yeah, I mean listen, ev everyone's entitled to to their opinion, you know. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna dunk on a on a fellow reviewer. Uh publicly anyway. I would say there's nothing There's nothing uh well, not someone who like, that's a that's a well enough reasoned review. Uh I do disagree with that. I'm surprised that a a review that concedes there are moments of magic and delight. it would still put a three on it, personally. For me, uh that's a real you know, a three is a bit of a it's a mind's eye, which I think also got a three. you know, in that it's not a very interesting game and it's technically fucked. So uh I wouldn't say that's true of Welcome Tour. If if you are interested uh or if if you are not if you're interested in, but if if the you know what it tells you about the console and its industrial design is interesting to you. you know, you probably give this game a few more points. If you don't, then yes, it probably does feel like getting dragged around a museum, um, which seems to be the the vibe of this. Crucially, it isn't a uh we had to pay for this, which s which was like my big fear, but it didn't do that. Uh that is that's sort of annoyingly hear and and thought out Yeah. Uh I mean I would say like, you know, if I was if I was feeling a fridge It wouldn't have got more than a six, you know. Yeah. So I'm not like I'm pretending it's like an eight or a nine here. I think three is harsh though. That's probably like the lowest the first party Nintendo game's ever got in Edge.

Samuel
09:51
Yeah, that's probably true. Although, you know, the Mario Party games probably deserve to get a three, but they never do, Matthew. So that's um that's unfortunate.

Matthew
09:58
Yeah, it's better than Mario Party. Definitely.

Samuel
10:01
Well, I would I think neither of them are really well, you know, I don't I don't have a massive problem with Welcome to all. I did just put it on that one time. for forty five minutes and then probably wouldn't play it again. Um but I I played it for eight hours in the end. Well you know so well we had a fair play. If you know I I've I d have you seen many proponents of it? Do you feel like you're in the minority when you talk about this game?

Matthew
10:21
No, I'm just I'm just surprised people weren't taken with uh You know what it tells you about the Switch 2 and like you know 'cause I I you know I've said it before, it's very kind of awata asks coded. Uh and people were always kind of interested in that and hearing those stories there. You I just uh d I don't know why they wouldn't be interested here, like If this was a physical museum that operated like that, if you were walking around this physical space interacting with and being told this information, I would probably find it quite interesting in real life. like i maybe people just don't want a a weird science museum. Like that's the thing, you know, it's the review says it it is like a trip to a science museum, you know, if you think that means it's a three, then fair enough, but you know, some some people like that.

Samuel
11:08
Yeah, I sort of um I stand by my original British Airways um leaflet aesthetic remark, which is definitely like my my sort of big take on this, but I've definitely wasted I wasted eight quid on plenty.

Matthew
11:20
The thing is th the thing is though, like, I don't want like fucking Yoshi telling me about variable frame rates. You know? Yeah. But that isn't a skin I want on a game.

Samuel
11:30
Yeah, but it's got the same drag and drive thing where it's a bit like This could have been more imaginative.

Matthew
11:35
I dunno, you know, we It's like, oh here we go, here's here's five shy guys coming to tell me about where they hid all the screws on the pro controller.

Samuel
11:43
Yeah, but it's it is uninspiring to look at as it stands. I mean, I don't know, it's sort of like by making it i I don't think anyone would even care if it if it was packed in. That's the thing. It's become a lightning rod of discussion. Precisely because it costs money. I don't even think Red Edge would have reviewed it if it was packed in. I think they might have talked about it in a feature or something or a news story or something. But That's the thing that's turned it into, well, it's fair game to review it, this thing that's actually largely informational and, you know, is is a game, but is probably closer to something like you know, you would play on you would put on your PC an educational game from about 1997, you know, it's a bit more that vibe than a traditional computer game. So Yeah, it's not like you ever sort of edge reviewing in Carter, you know? Um although that would be funny. Um so yes, nonetheless, um absolutely respect their opinion. Um it is yeah, I um I think I thought it would maybe um prompt a bucket of laughs as opposed to one or two sort of like, you know, bits of tittering from me. Um so perhaps it hasn't resulted in podcasting gold as expected. And um which is, you know, which is sometimes the rub with these things, isn't it? You can only pr you can only buy these things so far. Um so that's backfired and with that we move on um to the rest of to the rest of the episode.

Matthew
13:00
It's just it's just it's just too sensible a review to like knock it.

Samuel
13:06
It is. I think it I think the only thing about the review is that it it seems fairly Fine until it's like mild in terms of where it's landing on the game until you get to like the last paragraph. And at that point you're like, oh now it's like f Now it's time to take it out out back and put two bullets in his head.

Matthew
13:21
Well that's the yeah, that's what I mean. Like I think you could coast through a lot of that review going, This is gonna end in a five. Yeah, indeed. But it gets the end and it's just like Fuck you Nintendo and you're like, oh okay.

Samuel
13:34
Um that's all right. That's enough on this on that review, just because um I I think if someone that interrogated sort of one of the reviews I gave like to a a three out of ten Um I think I would find it like slightly perverse. So I th I think with that in mind.

Matthew
13:47
I would hate it because when I the the few games that I really kicked off about, like those reviews are so snotty and embarrassing.

Samuel
13:54
Yeah, absolutely. So You know, it is what it is, and um now we move on, um having not achieved the levels of payroll listeners. What an absolute wet fart that was. Okay, this draft then, as mentioned, the shuttered studios draft. After the last few years we've seen uh fucking loads of studio closures. Um, you know, no one is safe in this um this, you know, new world of Interest rates climbing and uh d publishers deciding they no longer need to make video games. Um basically fears of recession, people's um money being squeezed. Game prices going up at literally the worst possible moment. Why didn't you do it during COVID when people still had money? Um now people are gonna reject that outright and it might damage the long-term prospects of AAA video games, um, not good. Um some bad bad stuff going on. This has all trickled down to yeah, exactly. This is all trickled down to game developers as well, um a slightly uncertain future for games, even though Most of these companies like 2K and uh it's a bit it's a slightly different for Ubisoft. They have struggled a bit more, but you take two and EA, they're doing absolutely fine. They've got no reason to be to be laying people off. Um if they're doing it. It's because They want to. Um, so you know, that is what it is. But well, it's true, isn't it? Like EA doesn't need to lay anyone off. They absolutely don't, but they have chosen to because they are EA, so It is what it is. Um Matthew, I do want to ask about if you can remember the first time that a studio closure was a big deal to you. I. You maybe you read about it in a magazine or you heard about it and you're like, oh shit. Like I didn't even But maybe you hadn't even thought at that point that a a video game developer closing down could even happen.

Matthew
15:34
I I don't know, it's a tricky one. I was I was I really write racking my brains for this one because while loads of studios from the olden times have closed, it kinda happened in a less blunt way. Like they just sort of faded over time and then vanished. Like a lot of these studios, you actually look at them and go, are they even closed? And you look at their Wikipedia entry and they just sort of stopped making games. or like a game fell through. Like they weren't closed by a publisher that owned them. They just sort of faded to nothing. Like or Genuinely and it's quite recent. I mean you know, the the first time I could think where I was like, oh that's that seems quite major that that's happened was probably the round of Xbox studio closures that did like Lion Head and Press Play. That that felt like a big culling at the time, particularly 'cause I was working on official Xbox magazine and it was just such a unhappy story to cover. Like there's no official Xbox reading of that story that anyone enjoys, 'cause, you know, you're there to be, hey, Xbox is this thing and you're like, well this obviously sucks. Um You know, before that, like the only bit of studio news I remember making any impact wasn't the closure, but it was probably like Xbox buying rare. back in the day felt like a big loss to Nintendo fans and we mourned it for like many years and now magazines mourned it for many years. Um but yeah in terms of an actual like oh this has happened right now, you know, R. I. P. this studio it it it feels like It's not a recent invention, but the ones that stick out feel more recent to me anyway.

Samuel
17:18
Yeah, they do. You know, this has turned into a a trend in quite a horrible way. And it's come off the back of, you know, loads of acquisitions that at the time I don't think people really blinked twice at. I think that's because we hadn't seen that many acquisitions happen in quick succession before. So No one really knew what was gonna happen after that. I don't think I don't think anyone was out there though predicting that they would all it would all end in tears in the way that it has. Certainly the Embracer Group stuff. I think that was a bit more like, oh well, uh we you know, I guess that there's some reason that they're buying all these studios. And then when they start offloading them and absolutely shitting their pants repeatedly, it was a bit more like, oh, so you never had a plan. You were just You're just grabbing land and now the studios who might have been able to exist independently independently are literally being closed down because you can't afford them anymore or you don't want them anymore. Which was really, really grim. And so Yeah, I think it's um shot a light a bit on people who are maybe banging the drum for acquisitions um during um you know the last five years or so. and maybe doing a bit of corporate PR for those companies, you know? So what can you remember which studio you first noted closing? Absolutely. So for me it was definitely Clover Studio from Capcom. Um okay. Yeah, because I remember that happening just before I joined Play Magazine. And it they were so you know, they were quite a splashy studio because they had Mikami and they had um they had Kamir. And, you know, they had like basically, you know, rather than just being even though they were internal Capcom devs, they had broken off to be this sort of independent entity within Capcom, or at least, you know, semi-autonomous, you might say. Um and so, you know, and the and the first and you know, they were known as like the beautiful Joe people, and obviously everyone knew who Mikami was. And their first game, uh their first two projects were Godhand and Akami, which, you know, were just uh really like uh opposite ends of the scale. But seem to be like we're making original, bold, cool stuff, you know? Like um like Capcom as as they they always are, but dialed up by about fifty percent. And so Those just seem those just seem mega exciting and obviously I don't know uh Akami I was a tiny bit more mixed on and I love how it looks more than how it plays, but Godhand I obviously adored. And so those games were big deals to me at the time. And so yeah, them them closing. And then, you know, obviously platinum forming afterwards. Quite quite significant to me, you know. I like I like those and even by the even by the time I was like 17, 18, I knew who those developers were, you know. So Yeah.

Matthew
19:48
Yeah.

Samuel
19:48
I guess in my head though I have blended that in with platinum becoming a thing.

Matthew
19:54
You know, a lot of the like that's Like the less bitter version of this is this thing fails but from that comes or not this thing fails, this thing closes, and from that comes you know, this h other thing which is very much like it and, you know, has a few happy ears. So it the sting i in hindsight the sting isn't as bad, but yes, at the time you're like, well you know, this is where it's at, this is where the exciting stuff's happening. So definitely a shame.

Samuel
20:24
It's a good it's a good way of looking at it because you could argue that, you know, under a slightly in a slightly muddled generation for Capcom, the 360 PS3 generation. Would they necessarily have made things like Vanquish and Bayonetta? You know, probably not. They wouldn't have made Bayonetta because they already had Devil May Cry. So it maybe that maybe the Mikami would have made Vanquish because you know he'd already he'd already moved into the the shooting uh sort of like the direction of making third person shooters with Resi 4 and his team um making it that game. So That was plausible, but yeah, Bayonettab does only exist because uh Capcom did shut down Clover. So that is that's a good way of looking at it. I like that. I mean Uh in the lot in the long course of history, would I like to have seen what their you know nearly 20 year journey of Clover would have been at Capcom? You know, possibly, but you know these things are really just you don't know how they're gonna work out and you know, like you say, maybe half of Platinum's output has been a net gain um for for the culture, and then the other half is a bit of a uh why did you do that? And now it seems to have ended in tears, um, as these things often do. So Yeah, um so that's yeah, defin definitely close that stands out to me, Matthew. Um, what's the studio closure that's hit you the hardest over the years? What's the one that's been like Oh fuck, that's actually like that's genuinely terrible.

Matthew
21:37
Recently, I guess when like Tango closed, I remember thinking. Th they made quite a few games, they were all good, if not good, interesting. I remember thinking, you know, if that if that quality bar can't kind of sustain you, then then you know, w what can you do? Obviously I was really sad when Singh closed. Yeah they'd made some absolutely amazing games and it was quite I you know, the generally rarer to hear about studio closures back there, but, you know, that something which had been anointed by Nintendo or supported by Nintendo suddenly ceased to exist. that was always a bummer 'cause you just thought, you know, you've got to remember that that happened to Singh when Wii and DS are absolutely massive and you think, you know, Nintendo you know, could do no wrong not they could do no wrong, but you know, they w they were this incredible umbrella for all these weird sort of third-party studios that m basically made games exclusively for them. So like Y Sing of all people, um, was was a huge bummer. Particularly some of the other studios that they that are still going now. that I would say were like much lesser of the kind of weird little support studios around the outside. Um, you know, I was obviously quite down about that. Um I mean the real The real motherfucker for me recently was um Mi Me Me. You know, whose only crime was to have made the best three examples of their genre ever. It was just like, well, then what is this just a genre that you can't make? You know, like is is it just not sustainable? Is you know, have you hit you know I I cannot believe they they didn't find i they they found the maximum number of fans that they could possibly have found for that particular thing, the real-time tactics game. And so with them, you know, not just a gate a great game maker, but it just felt like a no to that genre, which I had come to really enjoy over these last ten years. So that was and you know, they just shut it down 'cause they couldn't do it. They weren't closed by anyone. They just sort of said, you know, we can see that we've run out of road and that's it for us. And it was just such a like non-event.

Samuel
23:50
Yeah, that was that was sad because in your head you're like, these these used this genre used to be so huge on PC, you know, those those commando games were And so it's the i the idea that Steam, with all of the bullshit that it supports, all of the like, you know, naff looking drug games like Schedule One or whatever cursed horseshit. f you know, f Five Nights at Freddy style horror crap and games with like, you know, games where you click on a banana or whatever and you're like, can't something with a bit of craft just like You click on a banana. That is Donkey Kong Bonanza. Isn't it a game called Banana Clicker or something? I think there is. Right. Every now and then you look at Steam Most Played, and with most of the games you're like, 90% of the games you're like Yep, good, good, good, good. And then you're like, dog shit, dog shit, dog shit. For stupid teenagers, for idiots, um, for streamers, fuck off. This is This is crap. This like this is not good. This has no merit. You know what I mean? That's like that's looking through the Steam bestsellers at any given time, really.

Matthew
24:51
Yeah, but then I guess Mimi me were like a decent sized team. They weren't slow at making games, but I always felt, you know, they they they kind of took their time to get them right. The reason they're real-time tactics games hit better than others, I think. It's just that they were very fastidious in how they built those levels and endlessly testing them and you got the impression that it was quite a lengthy process for them. But you could see the you know, the payoff to that work. That was that was what was annoying about that. I just wish Mimi Me had been able to last like a couple more years. I was just curious to see what would have happened if they'd got their games into the Switch 2 ecosystem with like an inbuilt mouse. Just 'cause the controls were always a barrier to entry on console. Like those games absolutely sing on PC, but they are they are just a little bit too fiddly, you know, no matter how good the p the pad controls are. So having a console that has an inbuilt mouse I'd I I would have liked to have seen what happened.

Samuel
25:52
Yeah, especially seeing games like Civ get a second uh shot on Switch 2 with the um with those controls. Yeah, I get you buddy. That's um that sucks. Um I I I was like uh the the one that's kind of hit me in recent yeah like the one that I was like oh what a fucking waste was um Irrational Games when they closed after Bar Shock Infinite because even though I know that You know, it wasn't having read Jeremy's interview with him, it wasn't Ken Levine's choice to close down that studio. It was 2K's. Um, you know, I would like to see the universe where they get different leadership for that studio. They built they built a you know a developer that can make that can make Bay Infinite. What w wouldn't everyone love to see the next thing that that team makes, you know? I absolutely would have done, especially because Whatever fucking new Bioshock game they've been working on, it's clearly in development hell because it's been like rumoured about for such a long time. They still haven't even shown it. I think it's been rumoured about for seven years. So clearly something is just like not not going as well on that project as it should do. So wouldn't it have been better to have made another Bioshock with a team that you had instead of starting again from scratch and Here we are, you know, twelve years after the original release of Infinite and there's still no no new bioshot game. I mean none of that seems like good. Um like lo seem like good decisions to me. So yeah, I mean that's that's the one where I was like, well, you know, they just made the most beautiful looking game. It's not the most perfect game in terms of gameplay, you know, but it's The next game they make will probably be a ten out of ten and we'll never uh we'll never see it. So that sucked. Um I'm sure you like me, Matthew, have similar anxieties about seeing Some of your favorites killed by the games industry shit show. And because I definitely keep an eye on certain developers, like the one I'm convinced that this is my prediction, that's all it is. They'll they'll close that team once the next game ships as a Jelly Survivor team. Right. EA will be like, I bet they'll give them like one to two years and they'll go, Yeah, they're gonna make something original now. And they'll they'll be like Ah, we decided to just fire them instead um and make FIFA um some more. And look honestly I think that's what's gonna happen to that team. And when that happens I'm gonna be so angry because I just know that's coming. I just like I'm I can feel it in my bones that they'll be like Uh if you're not making Star Wars games anymore, we're not waiting five years for your next thing, off you go. Um that's your reward for making these great games. That's my prediction based on EA's history, which I think is a fair prediction.

Matthew
28:09
Have haven't some of that team left uh Start up another studio isn't Stig Asmuson heading up a new lot that making a oh they announced it recently.

Samuel
28:19
Yeah, it's um Wizards of the Coast, right? It's like a Dungeons and Dragons thing Yeah, so you know, he's the the king of the the the best third person ac action adventure games, right? So um you know, in theory that you might see a load of them go off with him, which is good, because yeah, I think I think Wizards of the Coast is actually bankrolling them as well, so they're I m I imagine that g gives them a bit of stability. Is that where all my Final Fantasy trading card money is going, Matthew? I I assume it is.

Matthew
28:45
Um so yeah. Oh man, they got you over a barrel. It's terrible.

Samuel
28:48
Do you have this though? Do you have developers where you're like, you better not fucking close this down, you motherfuckers? Like I I worried about I worried about this with I. O. but they seem to be doing alright, which is good.

Matthew
28:57
Yeah, I mean th that that that's the one like if that happened That would that would really bum me out, like I guess if James Bond is just like a total disaster.

Samuel
29:06
Um I don't think it's the whole I've got a good feeling about it.

Matthew
29:09
Their involvement in the mind's eye thing, that gave me pause, so it's like what happened there, that didn't seem that didn't seem wise. Um But yeah, I I would be sad. I mean there's there's not many I feel like h hugely anxious for. I mean obviously playground have really got a land fable. Um but You know, they also make Forza Horizon, which is probably like the most successful Xbox first party game, or one of you know, if if not the top top definitely top five. So I think they're probably insulated from what whatever happens with Fable, but you know, I really hope that's amazing. A c a couple of years ago I might have had this anxiety about like platinum, for example. Yeah. But again they're c they're quite changed now and a lot of the people you know and love have have kind of left. Uh I am interested to see what they do next or what they've got cooking. You know, I'd I'd love to see them still succeed. I never liked the narrative of this one person's left, now this whole thing is worthless. Yeah. I think that that blows as an idea, so uh I'm still kinda hopeful for them to to prove me wrong. And I will say, while it is doom and gloom, there are some success stories that I find So kind of like heartwarming or at least well judged, like pleasingly well judged to sort of sustain themselves, you know, like I looked at Like you know, look at the reveal of like the new Luminez game this this summer. Enhance, I feel like they they just really know what they're doing. They really know who they are and what they're about and They've just made c you know great game after great game, very well considered. And that gives me some hope. I'm like, well, something good like that can still exist, so It's not all bad.

Samuel
30:53
AKA Love can still bloom on the battlefield, Matthew.

Matthew
30:56
That's uh Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. You just have to like I don't know, sp be smart about it.

Samuel
31:02
Well that's the other weird thing is that this has disproportionately hit Western studios above Japanese studios, right? And part of me thinks that's because the yen is worth so little that maybe Japanese developers are just good value, you know, um by comparison to I be I just don't think anyone wants to hire in California anymore, for example. Um, especially as like there's an industry downturn. So that's why I think that, you know, you're seeing much you you hear a lot more I hear a lot more about about Kodev these days and studios who are based in you know, parts of Europe or Asia where it's it is cheaper to pay the developers, but you know, it it de-risks development for the studio because they don't have to hire a load of people, they just get people to make bits of the game for them. um or it sometimes in in some cases the entire game. Um I think like Sabre Interactive are an interesting example of that. I think they've got a small leadership team or a smallish team in America and then I think Space Marine 2 was mostly made in Eastern Europe. Um I can't remember which country, which is quite rude of me, so apologies for that. But um, you know, and they did a great job and the the consumer doesn't notice. And so That's why I think you're seeing a lot of the the unionizing stuff going on in North America in particular, because their jobs are literally under threat from these shifting tides in the industry. So it's, you know, it's Definitely a sort of tricky time for them. But yeah, weirdly in Japan, not as badly affected. In fact, the only one I could think of when I was going through this in terms of like layoffs was I think that maybe Luminous studio being folded into a square in it. So I don't even know if that involved layoffs, but that's an example of a studio actually like closing. But I don't can't think of another studio that's closed in the midst of all this. Like there was some rumbling about um Nagoshi studio that he went up uh went off and made with one of those one of those Chinese mega companies. I can't remember which one. It might have been Netties. Um but I think there was a rumor at While that they were gonna like pull their funding from non sort of like um homeland um studios, but Nothing about that's come out yet, but you know, do I want to live in the world where I get to play both the Lyca Dragon games and whatever negotiate making? Absolutely, you know, that's give me that world. So um Yeah, it's not um it's not a good time, but um, you know, that's enough that's enough industry commentary. Onto the frivolous bullshit, Matthew. Um so shall we take a quick break and come back with the draft?

Matthew
33:17
Yeah, that's do it.

Samuel and/or Matthew
33:19
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

Samuel
33:33
Check me out, child.

Samuel and/or Matthew
33:35
Eight shooting for nine, five, boop and eyes. In the rolling point is nine, place nine. Eight shooting for nine, five, oopin eye. Who wants to come?

Samuel
33:49
Welcome back to the podcast. So, the draft. It's been a while since I've done one of these actually. I had to remind myself a little bit of how we how we do this exactly. So what we're doing then we've got 10 categories and we're doing something interesting where a studio can only be picked once. So you pick a game. From that studio and the studio comes off the board. So it's it really locks out a lot of different companies as you go. Um makes it more competitive and therefore more interesting as a draft, I think, Matthew. Do you think that's fair?

Matthew
34:18
Yeah, I think so.

Samuel
34:19
And we should add they're all studios which have closed. Oh yeah, that's it. Every single studio that we're gonna pick a game from has closed. And uh like we say, but designed to be a tribute to the great games that these studios made. And uh yeah, there there are other criteria though, so It it must be a name studio. You can't pick um uh uh K C E J, for example, which is the name of like a lot of A lot of the PS1 era in-house um Japanese Konami games were developed by them or um KCET as well. Um so You can pick a game that was developed by Kojima Productions, for example, or Team Silent, but you can't. It can't be a generic in-house studio. So we talked about this last night, Matthew, but I think there's a differentiation between you know, Sega made this and you know AM AM2 made this. Everyone knows that AM2 is, you know, the Shen Mu studio, the arcade studio.

Matthew
35:11
Yeah.

Samuel
35:12
Do you do you agree with that distinction?

Matthew
35:14
I do, and I you know agreed I wasn't gonna like particularly fight it. A lot of these teams, you kind of look at them and they were like consumed into like a b a bigger whole or they mutated into something else or they joined. You know, it there isn't necessarily a neat You are now defunct and closed. Just for the sake of my own sanity, I did prioritize things which had like which I felt had outright closed or weren't living on in some sort of zombie form. But yes, there are there are definitely lots of particularly on the Japanese side, there are lots of sort of like adjacent studios or like internal studios which don't exist anymore. Um but that's fine. I think I think we can We can navigate this fine.

Samuel
36:06
I think it's it's fair for the simple reason that, you know, you couldn't pick Final Fantasy XV because it was made by one of the business units of Square. Um but you could pick for spoken. I mean why would you want to, frankly, but you could pick it because that studio becomes Luminous Productions for its next title and then disappears again and gets folded into squares. So you can fairly say that that is gone as an entity. That is no longer they are no longer leading their own projects, you know. In fact, didn't you didn't you tell me that the guy who made for spoken is one of the guys on Donkey Kong Bonanza, Matthew? I think you told me that.

Matthew
36:37
Yeah, well the dire so the director of Donkey Kong Bonanza it came out in interview this week. is only joined Nintendo in twenty twenty. Um and they were saying, Oh, and he has a background in open world games and then people quickly found out that yeah, he was a quest designer on Final Fantasy fifteen. And there was something else he'd done. I think he did the Final Fantasy XV multiplayer mode, comrades. No, I think it was bad.

Samuel
37:02
It was bad mode there.

Matthew
37:03
Yeah, but I think he headed that up. So he's not like an he's not necessarily like an illustrious personal paper to now be in charge of like probably one of Nintendo's most cherished teams. Well he's not heading up, he directing what is basically the next big three D platformer from the three D Mario team. Yeah, that's kind of interesting. Like the idea of this outsider person.

Samuel
37:27
Yeah. But they said that they said the same about me when I became editor of PC Gamer Matthew, so you know, it's uh a pretty similar situation, you know?

Matthew
37:35
Yeah. Yeah. They sure did. I obviously am a huge nerd about the internal workings of Nintendo, so that that kind of jumped out to me because most of the people on that team are like lifers. You know, they've been working on the 3D Mario game since Sunshine, some of them since Mario 64. So the idea that they're now working under some outsider, I wouldn't like that personally if I was them, but Yeah, fair.

Samuel
38:02
Um that's that's interesting. I mean the only other thing that's worth pointing out I think with this draft is that We agree that if a studio came back under the same name, you can only pick games from its original iteration. So Telltale Games is the example Matthew asked me about, for example. Um so He won't be picking the Expanse video game, but maybe he'll pick The Walking Dead season one, who knows? Oh no, I can't pick the Expanse game, said no one ever. Um but that does mean of course that there have been two Kajuma productions. You cannot pick um de Death Stranding for example obviously but you can pick Metal Gear Solid 4 or 5 and I think you can also pick MGS3 subsistence technically, I think that's right. So that's a sort of like distinction that we'll try and navigate as we go. I don't think most of the picks will have that many complications to them. They'll make sense um straight off the bat, but Just wanted to talk about some of the um conversations we had behind the draft, Matthew. Give people a bit of context. So anything else that we should point out here? It's the snake draft. So um whoever g goes first, the second person gets two picks. Um but then it goes back to one pick each until we're done just to balance it out. Anything else, Matthew? No, I think that's all fine. Yeah, indeed. And we'll put the um we'll put the poll in Discord again in the announcements channel. That seems to work quite well. Um so we'll just we'll just do that. It's nice and straightforward and we'll run that for seven days. And like I say, we don't normally do drafts behind the paywall, um, but we had a quite a rammed ep rammed month and we had two guests that we didn't want to put by the paywall, um, you know, Jen and Matt Hadrahan. So I think that's um I think it was sensible to do that. And uh yeah, hopefully people enjoy it. We'll see how it goes. So the categories nothing.

Matthew
39:40
Maybe one day they'll get this as a free episode and they can enjoy that absolutely legendary edge review bit.

Samuel
39:47
Honestly, man. That might be like the The the bit of the podcast bit that in my head was like the greatest thing ever, and then an execution just simply fucking It's like the opposite of Games Corp.

Matthew
40:00
The th the thing is, I mean, not to too much how the sausage is made. Like, I'm obviously not gonna take a massive shit on an outlet that could potentially give me work. It's true. But no nor did I want you to.

Samuel
40:12
I just wanted you to sort of like I'm just waiting for you to have it. I think the problem is

Matthew
40:26
Uh people have told me it got a three. I think if you'd if I'd manage to somehow go in completely blind and then found out it got a three. Cause I had a little bit of like snottiness on Twitter earlier in the week, which I actually felt a little bit bad about, just in case anyone from that mag was reading. Um That's probably more the the vibe we were going for. But I've actually called off about it now.

Samuel
40:50
Yeah. I know I thought I thought everything like you said everything in the text is completely reasonable. Yeah. Um which is, you know, the sign of a good review. Like it's okay.

Matthew
41:05
For that game turned me into the Hulk when I read them. and I just wanted to like destroy the world because I thought they were so shit. Uh but uh again, I'm not gonna say what they are. Uh but that wasn't one of them because Edge is famous for good writing. It is.

Samuel
41:20
Um, you know what what is what is good is that the bit not being good has become the bit, which is so often the case with us. You know what I mean? That is so often the case with us. We it becomes good podcasting. by accident basically. So I think that's I think that's what's occurred here. I just like I let you down. No, no, that's okay. Um when you heard me sort of like discovering in real time that the bit wasn't good and you were cracking up. That that was the bit. You know, that was actually like the intended result in in some ways. So that's that's good. Um okay so the the 10 categories then Um so we have a few genre ones and then a few that are a bit more specific to um to the situation of of situations that have consumed different developers over the years. Category one, shooter, category two, horror or stealth? Category 3, 90 plus on Metacritic. Category 4, PC nerd pick. So that's up to either of us to define what that is, but I think it's pretty self-explanatory. Category 5, Japanese studio that closed. Category six, indie studio that disbanded. Category seven, studio was closed from twenty twenty two onwards, i. e. the current shitstorm we will find ourselves in. Category eight, studio closed more than ten years ago, so a slightly different era of this sort of thing. Category 9 studio is closed by EA because let's face it it's fucking loads of them. Um Category 10, free pick. Um so yes. Um actually doing a bit of like research in this, I couldn't believe just quite how many studios EA did close. I sometimes wondered Oh, was that a bit of an exaggeration? And then you look at it and it's like no. There were so many of them. Um Mythic, Westward, Bullfrog, like uh just yeah, um the pandemic. There were so many of them. So um not sure of those. Um so those are the Categories, Matthew. Any other thing you want to say about those before we get into it?

Matthew
43:01
No, they'll they're they're all they're all pretty good. I think there's there's some categories you can put a squeeze on by taking entries in multiple categories, so let's see what happens.

Samuel
43:11
Yeah, there's only two categories where I've got like only two picks where it could like I could feasibly run out. Um so we'll see how that goes. Um but Hopefully it'll be alright and uh yeah, we'll we'll navigate that as we go. So Matthew, do you want to do the coin to the coin toss? Yeah, what would you like? Uh tails. It is tails Okay, um I think I'm going to go Hmm I think I'm going to go Second. Interesting. Yeah, so you're first, buddy. Go for it. Oh, and you know that's where I'm at my weakest, because I hate making the opening move. Do I? I don't know. Uh yeah, I just uh it's it's tough. I I just want to get two off the board straight away rather than one. That's that was the thinking. Wasn't just for the purposes of driving you mad. Though that's just a, you know, a nice little cheeky benefit.

Matthew
44:02
Yeah. Okay. Uh Yeah. There is a so m there are so many there are so many Top tier things.

Samuel
44:14
About half of the categories are top tier, I'd say, this one.

Matthew
44:18
I've got to get one of my ultimate heart picks off the board that I think you probably would go for I I'm not sure which category, so I'm actually gonna I'm gonna go for free pick, which is a bit risky because it's quite an open category to begin with and a good place where you can dump anything. But for free pick I'm gonna go uh Lion Head and Fable 2. Nice. Yeah, that was one of my free pick uh suggestions for sure. Obviously Fable 2, a game we've talked a lot about on this podcast. I absolutely love it as a not just a very British take on the RPG, but I think a very elegantly kind of condensed take it removes a lot of the baggage and fat of RPGs, like overcomplicated nature of them and boils them down to something quite simple where you can roleplay more in the sense of dressing up. I'm not just saying that 'cause we did the episode with Jen and I've got dressing up on the mind. You know, but it is about, you know, shaping your character through their actions, becoming tall and lean and a kind of gentleman gunslinger by using lots of ranged con uh combat and only eating celery Or like some squat horrible demon who m munches on pies and commits sort of mild holocausts on on the people of this world. Yeah, I just love how reactive it is. Uh I love that you can kind of express yourself in it. I like that it's an RPG you can probably complete in about thirty hours. Uh it just sort of gets in, gets out, gets the job done. Uh Lion Head, hugely charismatic studio I think. There was so much personality and so much of the studio and a sense of different people at the studio in their games, you know, like just going to the graveyard ironically and find all the the names of like developers or jokey hints at at the development team on written on the gravestones, which has like a slightly different vibe when you go to it now. But yeah, a big loss, but a a good game and fondly remembered.

Samuel
46:19
Indeed, didn't win me the fucking 360 redraft, but um I like this game a lot. Um so uh yes, it's uh it's a s it's a solid pick. That takes Lionhead off the board, Matthew. They're gone. So no black and white, no the movies, which I know you love. Um so That's um that's that's gone. Um but yep, solid first pick. Um actually not exactly what I would have thought you'd go with first of all, so um that's okay though. Um alright, so I think people like Fable. Indeed, yes. So it I mean it's a weird draft. It's a bit the closest draft to it really is is the Metacritic under 80 draft we did where It was a bit like re research is so key to getting the the best results. Um so yeah, it did take quite a long time to prep for this one. Probably about Two hours of prep for me, maybe a bit more, Matthew? Is it the same for you? I've probably did about five hours. Wow, okay. Well m maybe Matthew um clear uh clear.

Matthew
47:14
No, sorry, just very inefficient searching.

Samuel
47:17
Alright, okay, so I've got two picks. Um I'm gonna go category three Metacritic 90 Plus. I'm gonna take Deus Ex, developed by Ironstorm, of course. So this is one of those ones where it's like, well, that's one of the best games of all time. I'll just grab that straight away. Um and I didn't think Matthew would take it first, so um happy to get it h here first. Obviously I picked this um ob I think I I think we th I did pick this in one of the drafts we did on PC Gaming and I I've played this in the lifespan of this podcast, twenty twenty one. Back then I talked about it. I've Finished it for the first time. It is a magnificent Cyberpunk immersive sim. It is really like uh in a uh I think everyone's image of what an immersive sim comes down to this game in terms of the reactivity, the way the different ways you can play it and also the different permutations of the story and how um detailed um and immersive the environments are even you know given the very primitive uh sort of like 3D graphics and limited set of t of you know textures and tiles it has to build those worlds. It's still extraordinarily good. It's still much larger in scale than any of the other Deus Ex games, um, you know, which are are also great. I like all of them, but this is you know, uh this is a masterpiece. This is one of the best games of all time. What do you think of this pick, Matthew?

Matthew
48:27
Yeah, but does it let you change your reputation in the world? By doing enough farts.

Samuel
48:33
No, you can't fart you can't farts so much you accidentally shit your pants. Um well there we go. Then I Then I think I know which wins this pairing. You you don't get to go to prison and then come back and be reunited with your wife and child. That doesn't happen to JC Denton in this. Um do go to prison. Uh oh yeah you do actually don't you?

Matthew
48:50
Um yeah. A prison of sorts. Uh yeah, I mean obviously I'm not gonna dunk on Deus Ex. It's quite a PC pick. I will say, which sometimes you know. Yeah, you've got to trust the listeners on this.

Samuel
49:04
I trusted them with um uh Fable TV. for the redraft and it didn't work out Matthew so Yeah well that yes there is that.

Matthew
49:10
Yeah that is true. Um yeah I had this as my number one pick for the PC nerd pick. Quite a lot of those, fortunately. A lot of studios closed down around the same time. Yeah, there are yeah, there are quite a few. Yeah, I i i it's a great game. I am I'm not too worried just yet. We'll see how we How uh things unfold.

Samuel
49:29
Indeed. Okay, so my next pick is gonna be for horror stealth, and I'm gonna take Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Pain. Um this is also one of the best games of all time. Um it's this is again like very immersive sim adjacent, but almost the other side of it, you know, third person game. uh where the the sort of physicality of snake as a character was massively upgraded as they moved into this. Very brief, unfortunately, Fox era Fox engine era of the Metal Gear Solid series. Um going around an open world, um, taking out enemies and then uh sending them off to your base to be brainwashed. Um going around with your dog. Uh going around with your mech, going around with your sniper lady in a bikini, um having great times, listening to the cure, um, and uh yeah, go through two um vast open worlds, one desert, one jungle. um that have very different feels to them, um cool things to discover, really interesting, yeah, open world immersive sim blends where there's there's a lot of making your own fun and then loads of cool tools of how you can mess around with the enemies to unlock as you keep playing, you know, way past the point where you you see the end credits. Um, you know, lots of arguments about whether this was um unfin with whether it's finished or not, but You know, I think either way, we both love it. It's a masterpiece of a game. It's the high watermark of, you know, Metal Gear Solid as a stealth game. Um, so feels like a obvious deck for this horror stealth category that I think could get a bit get a bit tight quite quickly. Um what do you think Matthew?

Matthew
50:56
And like Fable 2 also a game where taking a shit can have a direct impact on gameplay, so Um that's you know, that's more of a a threat to my Fable II dominance. Um You're gonna bring this up for every pick, like No no can't shit yourself. Um I'm just trying to keep my games in the listener's mind. This is a new tactic I'm playing with. I feel like I'm uh working out or or kind of i rehearsing for a more aggressive draft with Dave Scarborough next time we meet. 'Cause uh you know, i w it's been made known to me that he's gonna, you know, not uh not take it easy on me

Samuel
51:41
Well, yeah, I'm hoping Ash will bring a bit more spice as well. But it's funny as well, because some of some of the games we're going to talk about are probably going to come up in in that draft as well. So Yeah, it's um it's a bit of a dress rehearsal. I think that's next month we're doing that, isn't it? Um we've I've already started an email chain for that. End of August, you're gonna get the all-star Japanese game studios draft. So um that is currently being negotiated with the uh the the personnel of those two those two contributors. So this episode this episode's like training montage. I'm like Rocky on the steps. Indeed. So Deus Ex and Metal Give Solid 5, the Phantom Pain. I've I've kicked off this draft by grabbing two of my favourite games of all time. And um that's strong, so

Matthew
52:19
It's a good it is a it's a good pick. Um indeed. It's interesting because I felt like when you were talking about studios uh whether certain teams counted. I think that coloured some of my thinking about what you were gonna pick. Hmm. Oh interesting. So has it surprised you? Yeah, well I definitely thought you were gonna pick Silent Hill 2, which is why you were banging on about Team Silent.

Samuel
52:41
Well, I I thought it'd be good to try and pick some stuff I've not picked before or haven't picked in Hill. Um the other thing is I don't um yeah, I don't know. I think I've picked Silent Hill 2 in about three drafts now. So there's maybe a bit of mixing up going on.

Matthew
52:54
Yeah, that's fair enough.

Samuel
52:55
Yeah, uh interesting. Alright, well what's your next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
52:59
Only because I was struggling with the genre a little bit in terms of uh finding anything that I really loved in it. And this one is I think this one counts. I think we've in fact had this debate before. For shooter, I'm gonna go Irrational Bioshock. Oh yeah, good pick. Which I think you can do. Like Bioshock obviously no one is like, what's my favourite FPS sh you know, what's my favorite like gun feel of all time? It's probably not Bioshock. very spongy but in terms of perspective and it has shooting in it obviously I think that qualifies what is great about Bioshock you know, is the world building is the the vision of rapture and how it serves it up to you again with constant surprises as you make your way through this underwater city, one of the all-time great openings, but has other sort of cinematic peaks, a real sort of flair and a sense of the theatrical, whether it's, you know, Fort Frolic or the classic reveal that comes later. A game which I think has been sort of debated to death, which sometimes clouds, the fact that it it was just a really exciting, interesting thing to make your way through and, you know, still holds up and I haven't revisited it probably in the last five years, but when they bought it back out again on Xbox One or who played it and really loved it, thought yeah this still really holds up. So yes, I think Bioshock is a a crowd pleaser and it's more that, you know, I was looking at shooters and it's like, well I'm not gonna pick fucking time splitters, am I? So Yeah, but it's like there's quite a lot of shooters though, it depends on how you look at it.

Samuel
54:43
It's You know, I think um I had f I've got four picks for this category. Oh wow, okay. Yeah. Well I I I like I like this though, but you know what actually? It was if I didn't get MGS5 in Horror of Stealth, I was gonna pick System Shock 2 Um because I did think that would be like it's slightly more horrory than Bioshock is and it I thought that'd be a good like unexpected pick. Um but obviously now that takes a rational off the board. So Um that's obviously fair. Um yeah, I think that's a good pick, Matthew. That's solid, dependable, you know, makes sense. All right. Your criticism of my picks being um PC oriented with Deus Ex has been noted, Matthew. So for free pick, category 10. I'm gonna be taking Star Wars Rogue Leader by Factor V. Oh. The first time I've ever picked this in a draft. Um was this in your one of the things you're gonna pick?

Matthew
55:28
Yeah, this was in my I had this down for my studio at closed more than ten years ago.

Samuel
55:33
Ah yeah. Um fair enough. Well, I mean, you know, phenomenal, one of the best Star Wars games ever made. Still looks photorealistic. I think is lost to time as well in all the ways that people have heard us talk about before. You can't emulate this without it there being some fucking stuttery cutscenes and stuff. There was a time where on my Steam Deck this ran perfectly, and since then, whatever they've done to Dolphin, or I guess whatever's happened to the Steam Deck. It's now like slightly fucked and not running properly, and it's really annoying because I had one great evening with it, and then after that it's been a complete fuck show. So you still really have to play this on a GameCube to get the um to get the full experience. But What a game it is, you know, renders the Battle of Hearth, Battle of Yavin, Battle of Endor in amazing detail, has a load of original missions as well. There's a lot of like basically gorgeous clusters of stars in the background where you have dog fights with TIE fighters in this game. Phenomenal shit. Had a scale to it that The N sixty four can never do with Rogue Squadron and one of the all time great generational leaps and like I say still holds up in how it looks now Matthew and The you know, the use of the Star Wars movie sound effects and getting things like the lighting right at the the engines at the back of the ships and that kind of stuff. There's just so much love put into it and, you know, a a developer that literally hacked the GameCube to get um the results that they did out of this game.

Matthew
56:47
I'm just sad that we in a world with no factor five, we no longer get to see the name Julian Egerbrecht appearing in loads of articles.

Samuel
56:56
Indeed, an all-time um all-time great developer name For sure. That's really a greater loss than the developer going away, isn't it? Let's face it.

Matthew
57:04
Yeah, I I never played Lair, so I don't really know how it's properly ended for them. Like it's a game I only know from like videos and reputation. It's bad. I heard it was a duffer.

Samuel
57:15
It was duff. It was just, you know, it was never gonna do well in the first year of the PS3. It was Saddled with those stupid 6 access controls, it was completely doomed. I imagine I bet it sold at under a hundred thousand copies. I bet no one has this game. Um and you know that's just a shocker for one of y you know, uh Nintendo's greatest allies during an era where it didn't have much third party support, you know? So Yeah, um such as it is, um but yes, factor five represented there. So they come off the board. Well you know me I love her I love a man who controls like a uh like a starship, Matthew. That always works well. That's one of my favourite observations you've made on this podcast. Well

Matthew
58:07
There's a guy whose job it is to do like spaceship physics and then he gets given a man and he's just like, oh fuck.

Samuel
58:15
Do you know what actually? I I got um Slightly worried the other day because I I think I stole the words surgical precision from a review I read of of rematch and then used it in the podcast. And I was like, oh fuck. Should I I can't remember which outlet it came from, so couldn't attribute it back to them, but I thought it's such a good term for what? is in this game. But that's like a rare example of like semi-plagiarism that's made it into this podcast. And I was a bit like, uh I mean surgical precision is Like, that's not the first time I've heard those words. No, but if you saw it in two reviews of the same game, I think you'd be like, ah, that's that's weird. But I mean that's my editor brain speaking there. So uh anyway, what's your next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
58:51
For horror or stealth, I'm gonna take Arcane Austin and Prey. Fuuuck! I did not expect that. I don't think you even like this game. Uh oh no, I like it enough I don't think it qualifies as horror, 'cause it's got those little bastards that hide his chairs and then jump out at you. Oh yeah, it's definitely a horror game.

Samuel
59:08
Uh horror immersive some game for sure.

Matthew
59:11
Yeah, uh I mean Horror and Stealth, really. Yeah, I uh Like like really this this is a like triumph of environmental design, this amazing spaceship you're on, discovering all the mad little kind of districts of it. Also like A weirdly free-form exploring experience due to the fact that you've got that weird gun that can sort of make platforms so you can kind of climb all over the place. uh I feel like they gave you this adaptable huge feeling moveset and then created a space which really really let you go to town with it. Um which is probably my favourite thing about it is is just discovering this spaceship as a functional place and seeing how well they've thought it through like the you know, the bits which are sort of built for everyday people to kind of do their office jobs on board the ship and then going into the kind of weird maintenance level of it or kind of punching through and just seeing how they've really thought about every bit of how this place functions and every member of staff is kind of accounted for in the game. It's a brilliant, brilliant feat of of world design. I wish the aliens were a little bit more interesting. That's the only bit which stops this from being like absolutely top tier for me is I never found the aliens particularly interesting to sort of fight or encounter. Um it was kinda like get rid of these guys quickly. So that I can enjoy all the weird shit around the edges, but I don't think that's a particularly spicy take. The

Samuel
01:00:38
No, I can't wait to play Raf Colentonia's next game. It looked kind of a bit fallout y, you know? Um did you see the That doing the rounds thing, maybe it's maybe about a year ago they revealed that. Um so you know, cu curious to see what um he comes up with as a you know founder of the studio.

Matthew
01:00:52
Um Is this a shape like that that Western one he did? It has like the principles of it, but there is something about just how like immersed you are in that fully like 3D world with a first-person perspective in Prey that it's quite it's quite hard for me to to kind of take that step back or that that slightly more isometric view, which is probably a limitation of like studio size and budget. They had a team and they had a the wider developer machinery to make a game of the scale of prey and uh it was just so fun seeing those mines kinda plugged into that. But Yeah.

Samuel
01:01:29
Oh well I like Bray a lot. The it's like one of the all-time great environments to just wander around and look at. And um they did do a great job of making it feel like a contiguous uh setting. And uh yeah, I don't um there's just like some side quests and that that really stick in the memory. Um like the one with the chef, for example. Um that was just really great stuff. It was yeah, it was like e everyone should have bought it and they didn't. But this should have been the best selling game of its time. Uh it should have sold like five million copies. So one of those like really robust eight out of ten games I think. Um So yeah, I was a I was a huge fan of it. But yeah, like I feel like it and Dishonored 2 were quite close together and then neither of them were as popular as they should have been. But they were clearly like a cut above. And so Yeah, well you know, you can't can't trust gamers, can you? Don't fucking know anything. Um so yeah, such as it is, Matthew. Um but that's a good pick. Um I would have picked it absolutely under Studio was close from 2022 onwards, so that's um I think it was sensible to get that off the board. Well done. Um not what I expected from you though. So There you go, I like to surprise. You do, you do. Um okay, next up, like uh for example, not reacting to me reading out the um Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour review from Edge Matted. Okay. Um Category eight, studio closed more than ten years ago. Team Bondi's LA Noir is coming to the city. Oh, you fucker. What uh it's just right there, Matthew. I mean, ah, there's no other game like it. It's uh rockstar production values with basically LucasArt's point and click adventure mechanics in some ways. It's with its own very, you know, bizarre but incredibly endearing and playable um interrogation uh interviewing system. with NPCs and the cast of madmen. I mean listeners I I love Ellie Noir and I've I've I've started my campaign to get Matthew to do an episode on it with me. I think two giant men replay Ellie Noir would be great fun. Um let us know what you think of that in the Discord, but we'll do it after all of our GTA episodes, obviously. Um which are ha hanging over us, Matthew, aren't they? Very much so

Matthew
01:03:31
Uh I had a like unfortunately this being an audio medium, you weren't able to see that while you were reading out the Edge Well Contour review, my face was going through full LA Noir style contortions like doubt. and then a bit of incredulity, hmm, and maybe a mild a mild kind of like flinch of anger at the end.

Samuel
01:03:51
It's it's one of the all-time great video game period pieces, you know? It's just such a complete vision of LA at that time. Um it's not an open world game in the traditional sense. In in some ways I think it was a few years too early to be appreciated. It's such a for the 360 era, it's a pretty Pretty classy game in some ways, you know. It's a it's it's a little bit more Oscars than you know what I mean? Like it's it's got that sort of prestige energy to it that you just don't really I think L I think Red Dead and maybe G and GTA 4 did have that energy a bit too, but Elinoir in particular is like a proper trusty audience sort of game, and I do wonder if maybe in a slightly different era it would have done better.

Matthew
01:04:30
What do you think? Yeah Yeah, maybe it's a good idea. an incredibly expensive version of Ace Attorney probably could do. Ye But I just have such fond memories of this, like you know, reviewing this over an August bank holiday weekend and being down at my parents' house but being antisocial and just mainlining crime after grisly crime. Actually I was thinking of Ellen this week because there's a drama on Apple TV called Smoke about arson investigation.

Samuel
01:05:06
Oh yeah.

Matthew
01:05:07
And one of the reviews I read was like who the fuck gives a care about who gives a fuck about arson investigation? Like it's it's so niche and it's so boring. Uh which is Like exactly the criticism I always leveled at it that I thought it was weird that this game culminated in arson of all the crimes. Uh and it just oh it yeah, so I had LA Noir in the mind because of that, so I would have picked this.

Samuel
01:05:32
Yeah, it's like a flawed masterpiece Eleanor, I think. It's not it's by no means perfect, but there's so many high points to it. This this this game does so many particular things that I've never seen another AAA game do Um so yeah, it felt like a great pick. Um and I think good got variety on my side now, I think, with MGS5, Deus X, Lenoir, Rogue Leader. Pretty happy with that so far. Um Matthew, what's the next pick?

Matthew
01:05:54
Yeah, I mean my thing runs the risk of getting a little bit kind of ho horrory, like Bioshock Prey. Um Saying that, uh let's go for let's go for the triple whammy of grim places you don't want to be stuck. Uh studio that was closed by EA, Visceral Games, Dead Space. Ah, good pick, yeah. Which I know is very It's kinda like prey meat Bion Shock in a way. So I can understand people might want a bit more variety, but Dead Space is a good game. Dead Space is is of all the post Resident Evil 4, you know. imitators or inspired by games. Uh I thought this was the one which it just felt like super coherent. The the Ishimura is this amazing environment to explore, incredibly oppressive and perfectly designed for like horrible bastards to jump out of dark, shadowy places. You know, it's a world of shadowy corners. It's just just very, very well judged that. Um in the plasma cutter, uh you know, a truly sort of unique spin on that combat, uh and uh you know, a reason to kind of root yourself to the spot as things slowly crawl towards you and you desperately try to kind of hack off their limbs. I just I thought I thought this was really smart. I mean there was that quite shiny remake a couple of years ago. um which I think all it really did was underline that that game had the stuff to begin with. Um it wasn't like it didn't unlock some hidden potential in it. You were just like, yeah, this was this was always quite good. Um did weigh up Dead Space 2 as the slightly more action-y alternative, almost like the aliens to Dead Space's alien. Um but I think Dead Space One is probably like the pure idea of this.

Samuel
01:07:44
Yeah, I really like this game. Um Dead Space Two, yeah, definitely gets a bit of um naughty dog infecting the design of it. So it feels it feels a bit more data than the original does, which is Quite a minimalist game. Um I've not played that remake still, but the first game still looks fantastic. And uh yeah, very fond memories of um blasting through this one as uh yeah one of the th those um two year or three year spells where EA makes good things and then goes back to doing whatever it does. So good choice Matthew. Um I was scuttered the visceral went before they made that Star Wars game. I bet that would've banged. Okay, my next pick then. Studio that was closed from 2022 onwards, category 7. I'm going to take Fear by Monolith Productions. I mean I I was waiting for Matthew to take No One Lives Forever 2. Um I've I've denied him from doing that. So there's a slightly my PC nerd picks. But I do also think fear is a rad game of horror set pieces. Um atmosphere, physicality in terms of the um the character you play, the sort of like this is the thing that Molliff are really good at, just the the feeling of having a person, the environment in it, feeling like they're there, just the the sort of kick in this game is obviously quite a famous thing. But I think in general there's just a They there was just a generational leap here, like a a level of immersion that w was just super, super impressive. And playing it a few years ago, I think I always remember this as being like going through generic offices and um until a jump scare happens and that while there's some shooting in the middle. There's like that's like part of the game, but there really is like a a careful hand to the way that like the set pieces are structured and when the horror beats come in. And it's like a proper I mean like a it's a properly original mix to have a first person shooter with horror in this way. Like it's a full-on shooter. But it absolutely has the cred as a horror game. And so I can see I can absolutely see why it captured people's imaginations. It's a great game to go back to. They never got anywhere near as uh uh uh it never got anywhere near as good as it did with this first game. Um I did think about Condemned from the same developer. Um but Fear I think is just a slightly slightly better game. Uh Condemned's got a very kind of like grizzly specific energy, but Fear is like one of the best first-person shooters of this generation, so Um I think it's the right pick, Matthew. What do you think?

Matthew
01:10:02
Well I was definitely looking at monolith and trying to work out, you know, which of these things is gonna like l land the hardest. Because I think while there was a sort of outpouring of grief when they got shut down. I don't know if many people truly love like those Middle Earth games that they did. Like it doesn't necessarily feel like that was the thing that they will forever be remembered for. Like they had some really interesting systems in them. but they were quite hard games to kind of click with. I thought they always made the Lord of the Rings license or world, which is something I quite like in the films. feel quite sort of joyless by comparison. Yeah. Uh with um with So I felt like yeah, you probably had to go back. I was I would probably have picked No One Lives Forever Two, even though I think it's not as well known and probably wouldn't have made much a dent on voting. Think fear is the right pick in terms of like a a great game that they made that people may have actually played and have some fondness for.

Samuel
01:10:59
Yeah, that was that was the thing. It was a bit of a a bit tricky to weigh up in in that respect. Um but yeah, I think I agree with you on Middle Earth. It had the bad Assassin's Creed combat and the bad Assassin's Creed platforming. Oh maybe bad's the wrong word, but that really like plays itself boring kind of game design that I think games have stopped doing now and we've gone back a bit to rewarding precision and things like that and obviously some like Elden Ring can sell 20 million copies now so no one really needs a game that plays itself in that same way. Um so that which is which is a good thing. And so yeah, considering the fact that the the depiction of Middle Earth is quite flat and boring, it does I agree that they're not really uh to me they don't feel like beloved games. I feel like there's one beloved idea in those games that people make a big deal about and you know they they should it was the best thing about those games but I don't know everything else about them was quite mediocre I think. So um yeah I I understand. It makes sense to me. Okay, Matthew, what's the next pick?

Matthew
01:11:51
The PC nerd pick, I'm gonna go for Westward Blade Runner. Oh, motherfucker! That's the right risk that's the the right reaction.

Samuel
01:12:04
You finally got a reaction from me after all this time.

Matthew
01:12:06
I don't think you would have picked Blade Runner, but I think you might have wanted Westward.

Samuel
01:12:10
Yeah, that's I think that's accurate. I just I got two two things, uh three things swimming around this category, but Westwood I did want, yeah.

Matthew
01:12:17
The least convincing bit of drafting I ever did was trying to desperately remember Red Alert from like twenty years ago. Uh so I'm not making that error again and having you explain why red alert's good. Yeah. And I I won't I won't do you that favor the second time either. There's only so many times the listeners can hear me struggling to ex describe a game which I only remember because it had I don't even remember her name now. Tanya or Sonya? It's Tanya. Sonia was in EastEnders. Yeah.

Samuel
01:12:52
She just goes around like blowing up bits of Albert Square with C4 bombs, Matthew, Sonia.

Matthew
01:12:56
That's what she does in that show. I'm both mega icons of nineteen ninety eight. I I thought I'd put this in, I mean mainly 'cause I thought Westwood were a an an interesting kind of part of the gaming story which got shut down by EA. They were my other pick for the EA category, but I thought uh I kind of fell in love with the idea of having Blade Runner in the mix. uh from that thinking so I thought I'd shove it into this PC nerd pick. Quite a strange point and click game in that It has quite a branching storyline and there's some sort of weird hidden criteria judging like how the game will employ fold based on some shooting gallery bits and the order you do things and how quickly you react to certain things which uh normally I wouldn't enjoy because you know I uh what I liked about point and click games was just the sort of take your time to kind of really figure this through and adding like even a hint of urgency to that throws me off a little bit. But really like why you include it is uh it's an absolutely brilliant attempt to capture the look and feel and sound of Blade Runner with these sort of pre-rendered backgrounds. I mean it's probably one of the the most effective license games in terms of capturing the look and feel of a thing. Yeah, why not? Let's include it. I don't know if we've had Blade Runner in too many drafts before. Maybe it pip popped up in the PC draft, but All my picks for PC Nerdpick are kind of they're kind of classics that I that I don't have like a huge connection to, so All We know it's for a pick one that I actually played a lot.

Samuel
01:14:32
I will say that I will say this about this game. I think it's best better remembered for how it looks and how it sounds as opposed to how it plays.

Matthew
01:14:40
It's yeah, that's very true.

Samuel
01:14:43
It's very point and click game by numbers. I don't think the script is that inspiring. I don't think you'll I think like the the way it looks gives it the Blade Runner authenticity. And um like you absolutely like it's there's moments where you're shown bits of the city and you feel like, oh yeah, this I I feel like I am in the same world as you know, we're decades off, you know, hunting down Darrell Hannah or whatever. I'm you know, I'm in another part of this same place and it's So authentically done, that's a real achievement. But yeah, in terms of the actual gameplay, it's sort of like a bit I think a bit flat to play these days. They have obviously re-released it. Um I think it is Uh a good good drafting Matthew. That's what I'll say about it. It's a good drafting. Um okay, good stuff. So my next pick then Which categories are getting a bit spicy? Yeah, it's not too bad. I feel like a lot of the mega hot stuff has now come off the board. But I guess I should I might as well get Category 5 Japanese studio that closed out of the way. I'm gonna take Jet Set Radio Future for Category 5, Matthew. Hmm. dire developed by um smile bit who were an internal Sega studio who rolled back into Sega after the I think after the Xbox era uh the th that generation they were formerly known as uh AM6 And uh yeah, they are they are gone. They were like a bit like AM2. I think there was like a basically a a restructure that happened towards the end of that generation during that first attempt to do to be a multi-platform generation. And um Jesso Radio is basically like cell-sheded but some of the best sell shaded graphics you've ever seen. Kind of like Tony Hawk sort of trick game, but with a bit more of a focus on exploration. Um, like a larger sort of location, a bit of uh with an element of um uh graffiti going on as well. Um it was an absolute kind of treat for the eyes and highly playable and it was that thing where Xbox had sort of three to five Japanese games that were just like mega hot on the original Xbox because they'd gone out of their way to go and make those relationships and give them a bit of a fighting chance in Japan when that was the thing that matters to to Microsoft. Um, this is probably the best exponent of that. I've not played it in quite a few years. It's not easily replayed these days. I do understand that game Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is so close to what that game is that it's basically the same thing. But you know, it's a it's a kind of real one off and I think people I think people do remember um Smile Bit. I think this is a fair pick Uh Matthew. Um I definitely don't think there's anything after this that has quite the same visual style or imagination. This feels like a very singular series uh that uh disappears into a a s a slightly more conservative age of s Sega games. So yeah, an i an Xbox original classic and like I say still looks absolutely fantastic after all these years. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
01:17:27
Not when I have any particular kind of connection to myself. Are you interested in that They're do aren't they doing a new jet set radio thing? Yeah, I'm I'm curious about that, for sure.

Samuel
01:17:37
I mean, I feel like we haven't heard anything about those games for a while. This must be like a new crazy taxi and stuff too, right? But It has hasn't come up for a quite a lot. I think that was the the Game Awards two years ago. So yeah. Um definitely curious. And I I do understand that the art director of the original games rejoined Sega to make this. So yeah, definitely want to see how that pans out, you know. You know, I just saw a great comparison this week between um This game and Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 and 4 by Chris Donan. Um I thought this was actually like wonderfully put and sort of sums up how these games kind of coexisted because they were not really exactly the same thing, even if superficially they seemed like they were. So this is this what he said. Jessette Radio, another skating game, sings when you take out the timer and Tony Hawk, I think, sings when you whack it back in. This is probably because Jet Set Radio is primarily a platform and exploration game which skating is a cool way of getting around, Tony Hawk is skating all the way down, so it's about what you can do with a level right here and right now, and it's about what plan B looks like when plan A ended in a face plant. I think that is true. Like exploration is what I remember about this game and navigation as opposed to, you know, pulling off um rad tricks being like the main focus of it. So Yeah, love affection for it, um, even if it is lost to time a little bit because it's not easy to emulate. So yeah, like you say, curious to see how it goes in the draft, but definitely different to the rest of my picks. What's your next one, Matthew?

Matthew
01:18:57
Uh for a studio closed more than ten years ago, how are we feeling about LucasArts?

Samuel
01:19:03
Uh I thought about this as well, and I think it's a fair pick because they were an in-house developer and the publisher And the developer got purged at the same time. So I think that's a fair pick.

Matthew
01:19:12
Yeah, because they basically like there is a LucasGames department now, but I think it's like five people who basically license out the properties through other studios. So I feel like the studio as as we knew them, the makers of all those great Luxarts adventure games and um some other Star Wars games, I think that's That's so for studio closed more than 10 years ago, uh, I'm gonna take LucasArts, because that happened in 2013, so we just about make it. Uh and I'm going to take This is actually the tricky bit because there's like heart picks, head picks. I'm against LA Noir, that's quite hard. I'm gonna take Gwyn Fandango for that. Okay. I had actually written down Monkey Island 2 in my notes, but I think Gwynfandango might be a better one. Monkey Island Grim Fandango, they basically defined my game playing in the like mid to late 90s. Yeah. Uh you know, that's what I played, that's what I really loved. Cynically I'm trying to think our listeners' ages and what they'd probably most like, you know. I think Monkey Island 2 would get me a vote from like Ash Day, but would Gwynfandango, it doesn't have that kind of reputation. It's one of those games I can't really work out if it's just like beloved by five people or if it actually is a thing.

Samuel
01:20:35
Um, I think it's uh I think the setting is beloved these days more than the actual game part. Um the game part I think feels dated, but the the setting is still a one of a kind, you know.

Matthew
01:20:45
Yeah, but I think I don't know, I'd say that's true of a lot of their games. I mean literally all of them I would say. Yeah, like then they're not necessarily things you wanna Yeah, let's just let's just have it in for the sake of variety. I'm gonna go Grenfandango, maybe play on people's loyalty to two kind of noir-ish themed games Like, do you go with the more abstract one where a skeletal travel agent ushers people through the lands of the dead, or do you go through the one with Ellen Noir with the the uh Ken from Mad Men having a a really grim time for 25 hours. You decide which vision of Noir Cool you want to buy into. uh as I pick Grimfandango for studio at close ten years ago.

Samuel
01:21:40
We'll let the listeners decide, Matthew. Okay. Um all right, that's a that is an interesting pick. I definitely thought along those lines as well, so um that makes sense to me. Um Okay, so Let's take for PC Nerdpick, Age of Empires 2, Age of Kings by Ensemble Studios. Um I had two basically RTSs in the can for this one. Red Lert 2. Matthew obviously took um uh Westwood off the board, but this was the other half of RTS games that completely ate my life as a as a young man. Um basically took all the mechanics the first game, which were a bit of it's a bit of sieve. a bit of like managing your civilization and then the resource management and like um creating tons and tons of catapults um that comes with a classic RTS experience of um not really thinking through the strategy and just building all the radest units you can. Massively raised the unit count and just felt like the everything you wanted the first game to be. Just loads more factions. add like castles and shit. Just incredibly exciting game um for like a 12-year-old to kind of go into the map editor, drop like 15 William Wallace is in there and have them fight like fucking 19 Joan of Arcs or whatever. Just lots of like time wasting in the scenario editor. And a Sonya from East Enders. Um Just really satisfying to go through the different ages in this game and see your like little kind of wooden shacks and like wooden sort of like guard towers become these like castle fortresses, not in the Matthew Castle sense and the the Castle Castle sense. And building like these massive perimeter walls, having all these kind of like farmlands and stuff, and just seeing like your empire spread and then getting into these multiplayer matches where you just see fucking factions going at it and hearing all kinds of like horrible NPC screams and noises in the distance. Some of the most cursed sound design ever. Um brought back a few years ago in a very, very nice um definitive edition um by um I think Xbox has got a studio called Worlds. World's Edge that makes these and updated all the animations and stuff like that and really just stands up. It's not like the RTS game has moved forward massively since then. And even when I played Age of Em Empires 4, it was only really great because it was Age of Empires 2 again with nice graphics. And Yeah, so good. I mean just really expanded the palette of what the games were and felt like the definitive version of this game. So much so that I think they never really quite They never really got close to it again, and then the studio was shut after they made um the original Halo Wars. So yeah, uh one of the I think like one of the best selling RTS games of all time. And has really stood the test of time as well. Thoughts Matthew?

Matthew
01:24:14
My entire relationship with Age of Empires um is is through you talking about it on this podcast. So I'm gonna have to take your word for it that it's good. Yeah, fair enough.

Samuel
01:24:23
Um so Yeah, uh I'm quite happy with uh yeah, that's quite quite a lot of variety to my picks so far, which is what I was going for.

Matthew
01:24:30
So um what's the next picture? Well mine are all horror games set in like really claustrophobic environments. What's your next pick? For Indie Studio that disbanded, will we accept Campo Santo?

Samuel
01:24:42
Uh uh So I was thinking about this and I think that's Any studio because I disbanded was actually maybe too specific a word. I think any studio that closed down should be the criteria here. Well, because they were they were basically sort of subsumed into Valve. You can't you can take this. I'm just surprised you wouldn't take me me, you know?

Matthew
01:25:01
Uh just don't really think of them as an indie studio. I don't know. But they are, aren't they? They weren't owned by anyone. Uh yeah, well I might take well I might take them for another category. I don't want to step on my own toes. Alright, fair enough. Yeah, uh yeah, I'll go I'll take Campo Santo and Firewatch for this one. This might seem like a c a crushing lack of imagination. This was the category I struggled the most with. In terms of finding like lists of indie studios that have closed, like I know that there's loads. But it is quite a hard thing to find on the internet because if you search for like closing studios, you just get served a tidal wave of all like the massive AAA studios that have closed. So actually kind of cutting through that noise and I'm sure there's like a hidden gem here that I I haven't thought of. But Campo Santo onto a great thing with Firewatch. were making that was it called Valley of the Gods, the kind of Egypt sort of nineteen thirties looking adventure. Then they got purchased by Valve. And basically I think that game sort of canned and they've just been pulled into working at Valve. I remember at the time loads of people wrote editorials going, This seems bad, this little team's gonna get eaten up by the the big valve machinery and that seems to be exactly what happened. But they did make Half-Life Alex, so that's good. Yeah well there is that and I imagine they're all getting paid fucking bucket loads of cash so I would sell anything. For that. I would sell his podcast for bucket loads of cash. Me too.

Samuel
01:26:28
And then let Valve chew it up. And then start a new podcast called The Two Giant Men Video Games Podcast.

Matthew
01:26:33
And uh Yeah, once you've d but you'd have to there'd probably be like a non-compete for like two years.

Samuel
01:26:38
Yeah, but that's okay, I'd just sit on my arse and enjoy the money, you know what I mean? It'd be great. Uh uh uh no complaints here.

Matthew
01:26:45
Yeah So well that's not gonna happen. I don't think Valve are gonna buy us.

Samuel
01:26:49
Uh no, we keep asking for this billionaire to come along and allow us to just make two giant men play every episode.

Matthew
01:26:55
I just I know that there's there's gotta be at least one millionaire who listens to this podcast.

Samuel
01:27:01
I mean again, like if you want the the weekly backpage podcast, but we also make two Giant Men play episodes, like very regularly Uh that is it's within your grasp, my friend, you one millionaire listening to this episode.

Matthew
01:27:14
If and like the thing is, if you buy us, if you're the millionaire who decides to buy us, you can then tell us not to do things like read the welcome tour of you live or not.

Samuel
01:27:24
Like you have that control over the podcast. Yeah I never wa I don't I have to sign paperwork saying I'll never do a podcast bit like that again Basically. And I'm like, that's that seems harsh, but well, if you insist, you know, wherever it takes the money.

Matthew
01:27:37
Um, yeah. Uh but yeah, anyway, Firewatch. Ver very pleasing game where you walk around a national park putting out fires, chatting to a mysterious warden in a f another watchtower over a radio. and what you think is going to be a game about managing your firewatch in this national park actually becomes this character study that kind of evolves entirely through your discussions. There's a little bit of a a kind of mystery thread to it. Actually, like the first time I played this game I felt it it not misled me a little bit, but I thought it was gonna be one thing and then was quite put off by it almost like sort of veering away from that, like it suggests it's gonna be strange and supernatural and have a bit more of a kind of hook to it And actually, you know, mild spoiler alert turns out to be something a lot more mundane, but uh I think if you play it a second time knowing that you can probably like appreciate it a bit more for what it is. Yes, Campo Santo, you uh much loved for this game and enjoy your money.

Samuel
01:28:41
It was good. It feels like it was uh it was very much of that walking simulator era, wasn't it, where a lot of these games were coming out at once and That's always really interesting to play Stillweek Sideep last year, which I think is just has a bit more going on mechanically and I think needed to. Um but this was a you know def probably the best in terms of characterization of any of these games, you know? Um, which I think is is a key achievement and definitely comes down to the voice acting. And uh yeah, yeah, I uh, you know, it's uh you know we've got we've now got two um games on our list that feature that bloke what was in Mad Men Matthew, so that's good. Blok the bloke with glasses, he does all the tele adventures.

Matthew
01:29:17
Maybe he's the the poison touch for these studios.

Samuel
01:29:21
Brutal Um I cannot remember the name of that actor but uh did he play Harry and Mad Men?

Matthew
01:29:25
Sum Sumner. Sumner?

Samuel
01:29:27
Yeah that's right, yeah. And he played did he play Harry and Mad Men? Was that his character? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Um so yes, uh good stuff. Uh yeah, I like Firewatch a lot. Um would I revisit it? No, but that's because you only need to play it once and it stays in the memory, which is what's good about all walking simulator games. So yes. Good stuff, Matthew. Um, my next pick then. Um God, I really weighed this up. Shooter, is there's a thing where it's like, do I take the crowd pleaser um pick or do I take the, you know, like a something a bit more Esoterics. I thought about Ghost Squad for this, Matthew. Um, for example, which I believe was I think it was AM2. I think it was that part of the Sega Business, right? And I thought about TIE Fighter, but I sort of on the on the edge of what a shooter is, really, TIE Fighter. Um so I'm just gonna take time split as two because you don't like free radical. Um and I know the listeners will like this because You know, it was a much loved console shooter that everyone played with their mates. Um, had that map uh maker where you can make terrible maps and play together. Um really just like very, very rudimentary, the most generic maps you've ever seen. But Yeah, very enjoyable sort of pad-based FPS gameplay. Do I think it's the absolute greatest FPS of this generation? Not really. I'm not replaying it. It's very, very uh sort of like fiddly, um I would say, compared to playing something like Halo from the time. Um but it was like great fun. The different themes are very enjoyable. The levels are largely um pretty good um uh to to revisit. Some the ones that shoot you much more so than the ones that ask you to do a bit of stealth or something quite particular objective wise, then it goes wrong you have to restart it and you have a little tantrum. These are all things that have happened to me in the last few years. Um but I always liked the kind of like uh the ambition of having loads of different settings and loads of different characters in these games. It just meant that there's just a really kind of like fun, um, silly, I don't know, maybe even like slightly Terry Gilliamish approach to it. I think there was there was a maybe a bit of that energy to these to these games. Um and yeah, it just I think people still have a lot of nostalgia for for this series. Um people might tell me that Future Perfect was better than this one, but this is the one that everyone played. So Time Splitters 2 it is Matthew Thoughts.

Matthew
01:31:33
I was sort of an infamous non Time Splitters 2 liker, so always found it a little spongy. I think I was Hoping for or expecting a game to be as big a part of my life as Goldeneye and Perfect Dark. And it wasn't uh whether that's because of the game or changing circumstances, or yeah, just not being of an age anymore where a game could absolutely dominate my life. Um we'll never really know, but um I had Times with this too, played a lot of it, uh never really fell in love with it as a as a split screen shooter so I'm I'm not too bothered about that personally but uh it is very popular so Time splits two versus spiroshock. I did wonder for this one about uh Medal of Honor Allied Assault. Uh yeah, I sort of thought about that as well actually. Um but it's uh I don't know, maybe it seems a bit diminished in light of, you know, modern warfare and whatnot that follows it, but Yeah, I thought about this for

Samuel
01:32:36
Would this count as studio was closed by EA as well, um Allied Assault? Um because but I think they might have just disbanded because they fell out with EA and then they fucked off and Yeah. Then fell out with them. Um so yeah. Um and then well with the A again. Very strange. But yes. Um so yeah, I um yeah, Time Splitters 2 thing is I don't I think that the thing about Time Splitters 2 is it is It does basically have all the quirks a Goldeneye has in terms of it being a slightly odd sort of way of doing a shooter compared to the way you do a console shooter now, because You know, we didn't have the the same codified twin stick thing, but it was it was sort of like a stepping stone to where these things would go. I say that. Can you even play a fucking split screen FPS on a console now? Or what would you even play? I'd probably play the fucking perfect dot remaster, you know? So I don't know. Um that's uh that feels like it's a bit lost as a genre. sort of offering these days, which is kind of a bummer. Um but nonetheless, Time Splitters 2. I do I do like it. And at the time I really loved it. It's one of those games that just um ages a little bit, but I think it's still a good crowd pleaser for this draft. Um can I ask Matthew, are you are you not gonna pick Eternal Darkness?

Matthew
01:33:41
Uh it was on my it was on my list.

Samuel
01:33:43
Yeah, because you've ran out of categories for it, right? You don't you can't pick it now. Yeah. It's only because I thought that would be a sort of like GameCube Heartland game you would have grabbed.

Matthew
01:33:51
Um Yeah, it was somewhere li I mean

Samuel
01:33:54
That too is a bit that too is a bit dated though, I think, to go back to.

Matthew
01:33:57
But you know Yeah, I tell you what's really shitty. When you do these categories, you realise how many Okay, arch well, we'll see. Let's let's see. Let's see what happens. Redoing his draft on the fly. It's your pick now anyway, isn't it? So it's my pick. The problem with Eternal Darkness, so I could ha I could have it for Metacritic 90 because it's a 92. Is it really? Yeah. That's a bit high. It is high. Yeah. Um But I am a little bit worried about Bioshock Prey Dead Space and that. Like it's b it this has become a bit of an accidental horror.

Samuel
01:34:34
Yeah.

Matthew
01:34:35
Yeah, so then my thinking is like Clover Studio Akami. But I have also seen Akami not really move the needle in these drafts before. Do you want the PS2 redraft with Akami?

Samuel
01:34:48
But I didn't but not necessarily because of Akami. I feel like it's what what was the game that won it for you with that one? I couldn't was it I can't remember. Cause you got met you got M G two, not three. I just got a feeling there's not like there's not the buzz around it. Yeah, I felt that way about Godhand, so I didn't pick it this time. I don't think anyone gives a shit when I pick God. Yeah. Which is a bummer. We've become very cynical drafters, you know? We didn't used to be this.

Matthew
01:35:12
I'm I'm I'm gonna play on a on a current wave Of uh rev or not revised, restored nostalgia it's going on. I'm gonna take Neversoft and Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3. Yeah. Yeah, you could play a better version of that right now on a on a modern console. Well, but what you say yeah, you say that. But the reviews that I've read, plenty of people have said, you know what I you know it's it's good but like there's something to be said for like the particular music of of the original.

Samuel
01:35:39
So it's just the music, but literally the gameplay and how it looks, everything else Uh for three, not four, four has changed quite a lot. Three.

Matthew
01:35:46
Oh, three, I'm not- I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it. No, I'm okay with it. I think it's on people's minds at the moment. I think p it's reminder people of fondness. I don't think people think too deeply about it. I don't think they'll look at that pic and go Oh well it's not the modern HD version, they'll just be like, oh yeah, I like that again, I'll pick that. We have become such cynical drafters. Yeah, well it's very different to Deus Ex as well, because I know that people tend to vote in pairs for these. So like having something that's like quite a nice divide. Uh yeah. I think that's alright. I think also it's literally the highest Metacritic game you could possibly pick for this category. Because Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, weirdly, it's got like 96 on Metacritic. Everything else is like Nintendo and Valve games, so I think that's I'm alright with that. It's it's skateboarding, isn't it? That's it's it's good.

Samuel
01:36:39
Yeah, it is good, yeah. Um and it's it's even better, uh you know, on a platform you can play right now. Literally two days ago they brought out a better version of this. So that's you know, that's also uh available.

Matthew
01:36:50
I mean I read the reviews, it sounded like they've

Samuel
01:36:56
Well that depends on if you like the quest structure of the original, I guess. I mean y that's the game that you love, isn't it, the the fourth one?

Matthew
01:37:01
Yeah.

Samuel
01:37:01
Yeah. Why don't you pick that one? That would have been a bit more like You know, that is lost to time, isn't it? The structure of that. So wouldn't that be Yeah, but this is the h this is the h highest scoring game Metacritic. Okay, fair enough. Um all right, um so go with that um begrudged reasoning, um we come to the end of Matthew's um pick there. Um okay so I've got two categories left. Like you, I struggled a little bit with indie studio that disbanded, Matthew. Um it is like it is quite a tough uh tough category um because not many indie devs have like quite gone under. A lot of them have made layoffs. But few of them have been like properly um properly closed. So I did think that uh for this one I'm gonna go with Roller Drome by Roll Seven. I was gonna say Roll Seven Oli Oli was was my other pick for this. Yeah I thought about Oli Olly as well. That's a game I I that's a game I've played more than um um Rollerdrome but I did I did get this in a humble bundle a while ago Turned it on and it is a little bit more it's maybe slightly more my sort of thing. Because it's kind of a combination of third person shooter with like doing basically roller skating tricks. And so it has that sort of mega precision um sort of like timer-based gameplay of something that I that's that's my sort of thing, but I just completely missed it at the time. This was well liked by critics and I just don't think it sold very well, but I think this is one of those if you know you know games. And I did also suspect that whatever gets comes up in this category was probably not going to win the draft anyway. So I thought Pick something cool by a studio that people actually liked. And so yeah, it's um definitely like it looks the part as well. Sage cell shaded graphics. Just One of those cool sort of like bigger budget indies that came out of the last five years of the silly money times. And um yes, it ended in tears, but this was a cool studio. And this is a cool game. So yeah, I've um I I definitely wish I had played it a little bit more than a couple of hours of this to be able to comment on it more, Matthew. But it is a it is a cool thing that they made and it Yeah, rewards precision in a way I really like. What do you think?

Matthew
01:39:00
Yeah, I th I think that's a good pick. Also, you know, like while we are picking individual games rather than the entire body of work from these studios Having this particular studio like an interesting success story that we saw like, you know, start from very humble beginnings and very carefully kind of like grow their games over time and then, you know, get to a point where they're big enough to, you know, play with a slightly bigger boy who turns out to be uh quite careless with its acquisitions. Yep. You know, it's it's quite a i you know While bleak, it's quite it is quite an interesting little story. It's a g it's a good surf. It's a good studio to pick for this category, I think

Samuel
01:39:40
Yeah, that was that was part of it, 'cause I I I weighed up um Vlam Beer as well, uh and Nuclear Throne, which is a game I played a a bunch of back in the day. But Yeah

Matthew
01:39:47
Right.

Samuel
01:39:48
I don't know. I think that yeah, I I it was a bit of the latent affection for roll seven I was tapping into here.

Matthew
01:39:53
Um Yeah, I think that's I think that's 'cause I think that will factor into the voting. I assume when we do the lists it will say the studio and the game name?

Samuel
01:40:02
Yeah, I'll do the I'll do the game name and then I'll do the studio in brackets. That sound good?

Matthew
01:40:05
Yeah that sounds good.

Samuel
01:40:07
Okay, cool. Yeah, so that's my uh that's my penultimate pick, Roller Drome. Uh for Indie Studio that disbanded, category six. What's your Second to last pick, Matthew, is that right?

Matthew
01:40:15
Uh for Japanese studio at Closed, I'd like to take flagship in the Legend of Zelda Minish cap. Oh okay, interesting. Uh flagship being uh a bit like Clover Studio, a kind of Capcom mostly Capcom owned. I think it actually had money from Bandai and Nintendo in the mix as well. So it existed as like a little entity largely aligned with Capcom to the point that, you know, people think of Legend of the Zelda Minish Cap as the as the Capcom Zelda has this gorgeous uh art style on the GBA, which is helped by the fact that the game has a uh tiny giant mechanic where you shrink down to sort of Honey, I shrunk the kids dimensions and suddenly see all the Zelda scenery absolutely massive, um, which looks really really good in that the art style that they've picked. I ri I really like this game. I think it it was the first Zelda directed not the first, so it was a Zelda, one of the earlier ones directed by Fujibayashi, who is pretty much like Mr. Zelda now. Uh he did Scoutsword and Breath of the World and I think it showed like a a real inventiveness. I think he was working within the traditional Zelda structure back then, you know, overworld dungeon, getting item in the dungeon, use that item to solve the dungeon. But I think he really mixed it up with the nature of the items were very imaginative. and also using this this shrinking mechanic. I think he he found some like quite epic feeling set pieces in there and some really big weird boss design and a huge amount of fun, a really really underrated Zelda, like secretly one of the very, very good 2D ones, and flagship. I mean kind of one of those studios that just gets s sort of shut down at the end of their project. It's not like they failed or anything. Um I think people just like m move on from it. It kind of I don't know, it feels sort of If it was similar to Clovis Clover Studio to me.

Samuel
01:42:10
Yeah, I think I think this is a little less of a I think like Clover Studio was a genuine like falling out with those craters in Capcom.

Matthew
01:42:18
That was that wasn't this. This is a I th I'd say this is on like this is on the line of like, is this just a neat label for this group of people? Yeah. Rather than a studio. But I d I you know, they had their own logo and they don't exist anymore. I think it I don't know. I think it counts.

Samuel
01:42:34
Oh yeah definitely counts. Um yeah interesting pick. Uh getting a Zelda in here is is quite quite canny, um you know, because Nintendo doesn't close studios generally speaking so Um it's a good way to sort of you know slide that in sideways as it were, um, into the draft. Um which uh, you know, I'm sure your your Heartland Nintendo Sicco is always vote for you will uh will love this, Matthew. So, you know.

Matthew
01:42:55
I felt like I couldn't I felt like Singh, while I like them, I don't I just don't think they move the needle enough.

Samuel
01:43:01
I think that would have moved the needle. I think Hotel Dusk would have got voters for sure. Like that's like that's Heartland Castle.

Matthew
01:43:09
Yeah, but well I d I I don't know if it's too much of a bit now. The other one I thought about was Alpha Dream who made the Mario and Luigi games they shut a few years ago. Um I would have probably picked Bowser's Inside Story as as my favourite of those games, but that was quite a rare story of a studio that only ever made good and seemingly successful games for Nintendo but couldn't make it work. Um th there's not much written about why they shut down and what happened with them, so we'll never really know.

Samuel
01:43:39
Okay, well interesting stuff. I I agree Alpha Dream a little bit lukewarm as well because people seem to like those games less as they went on, so uh that's um that's tough. Okay, um my last pick then is um Studio was closed by EA I'm gonna take Pandemic Studios and take Star Wars Battlefront 2, the original one, 2005. Um, a game I've talked about in this podcast many times, most recently when describing um me uh parking an 8080 outside uh the rebel base where my brother was respawning and constantly destroying him. with it, um so he couldn't ever leave the base and him um getting increasingly annoyed by that and um it leading to a classic sort of like brotherly um tantrum slash fight um Great Christmas memory for me that, you know, like really just treasured. Um so that was that's a very, very fun Star Wars sandbox game that at the time just scratched an itch that no other game had really uh sort of like got to before, as in it was like all the battlefields as you saw them in the films, like depicted in the game, the scale of them, just loads of little rebel lads running along while walkers are storming. towards the Hoth Echo Base or fighting Ewoks in the Forest and stuff like that. This second one, which was made in a year, which is crazy. I'm sure a lot of people have PTSD from crunching on that game. They um added space battles to it. And so you had, and um I think um yeah, that's right. There's space battles to it, so you had a bit more of that kind of like outer uh like dog fighting and even more scale to it and yeah, giant kind of cruisers sort of like parked opposite each other and trying to sort of like park your X-Wing inside the um the Star Destroyer. and blur up all the insides, then escape again. Um really, really good shit. Just very, very enjoyable. Released in a classics package a few um a few weeks ago. A few years sorry a few months ago. I was um dismayed to see that the um there's a bit of revisionism going on with the DICE Star Wars Battlefront 2 Mathieu. Th was this happening on the Discord? It might have been. And uh people uh because people are now talking about this game like it's a lost classic when We all played it at the time and decided, yeah, it's fine, but that's it. And then and then it was basically like there was a storm of microtransaction stuff. But now people are talking about it like it's fucking Titanfall 2 or something. Like it's A proper I was just like honestly, I've lived to see revisionism happen in real time. And so the player counts are popping off for this. And like that is a That is a 7 out of 10 d game dog, and not one of those sevens. It just looks very nice. Were you annoyed by that too? I was definitely annoyed by that.

Matthew
01:46:15
No, I I don't I don't really get annoyed about what people say about FPS games from the last ten years. Uh just Just Nint just Nintendo games. Just Nintendo games. Yeah. And as proven in this episode, I didn't even get that annoyed about that.

Samuel
01:46:30
Yeah, I was disappointing. Just offline. It all happened offline. When you when you when you threw um key house into the uh into the A thing, Matthew Um So yes, Battlefront 2 AKA the good one. Uh that's what I'm picking here from Pandemic. Um I was very fond of this game and it was a mega seller, I imagine.

Matthew
01:46:51
There's a lot of nostalgia for this one.

Samuel
01:46:52
too and not really like anything else in my list.

Matthew
01:46:54
I do decide which which version of the game is better by its player count, so um tough but fair. Unfortunately for you.

Samuel
01:47:02
What's your final pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:47:03
Uh studio that was closed from twenty twenty-two onwards. Let's go with me me and pick Desperados 3. Um obviously I talked about this at the top of the episode. These were uh small studio making real-time tactics games, which if you haven't played one Picture isometric map, you control a squad of people, they've all got different skills, you can send them off to do things at at the same time, but it's all kind of m mm uh sort of moving, it's not turn based, it's all it's all happening in real time and there's a big emphasis on stealth and view cones. It's the genre of game where you click on enemies and a big green triangle comes out of their eyes and then you use that to try and sneak your agents around, uh except in Desperados 3. It's set in cowboy times, so it's kind of stealth cowboy game. They've all got very loud guns which can get them out of trouble in a pinch, but you never ever want to fire them. I think if you can get through that game without firing a single bullet, you know, you've you've probably done it right. But I love their powers, I love the little dioramas of Western towns and all the different kind of cliches from Western games. had this sort of voodoo witch doctor character, uh, who added some quite cool, almost dishonoured supernatural powers where you could like mind meld with characters and link characters to share the same fate and Oh thought that was really good fun. Just looks gorgeous. Very, very playable. I think the Discord played this as their backpage game club. They've got like a little kind of reading club style thing going on on the Discord. Um and people seem to be having a good time with it. Um maybe I'm misrepresenting that discourse, but um I think that was the that was my read. Uh yeah. Really really sad that Mimi Me couldn't make it work despite only making absolutely incredible games, but they left three amazing games, Shadow Tactics, this and Shadow Gambit, and they should be very proud of themselves.

Samuel
01:49:07
Yeah I've still not played any of those games and I should I should do at some point. I have all three of them. Um in various places. So uh yeah, I'm glad you did pick this, Matthew. Um yeah, a bit different to Firewatch to have. I I still do do still think of this as an an ind an indie studio, but um I know they're like reasonably size, but Nonetheless. Yeah, it's one of those weird label, you know. Yeah, yeah. That's ended up being a weird category, that fear versus uh Desperado's three. But uh such as it goes in a draft such as this. Um, okay, so that's it. That was your last pick, wasn't it Matthew? That was my last pick. Did you have any um sort of honorable mentions? I I thought that Prey and Dead Space were good drafting. I wanted those. Um most Storm Pacific Rift I had, God of War Chains of Olympus, was a backup. Um I did want to get Red Alert too, but um alas. Um that's basically I was thinking about real-time worlds with crackdown. Oh, that would have been a great a great shout for shooter or um

Matthew
01:50:01
Uh yeah. Yeah yeah. I I I was also thinking for the PC nerd pick about like looking glass with Thief 2. Yeah. That would have been maybe Black Isle for Planescape Torment. I thought about Black Isle for Fallout 2 actually. Yeah. But I I don't know. I just like they're important games, but I don't necessarily love them and I I don't know if um our audience is like you know super hinging on those picks.

Samuel
01:50:29
Yeah, we've come to I I think we've come to let the audience define it too much though. You know, I think they're We're starting to talk ourselves out of picks a bit too much with this. Like maybe for the Maybe. Uh maybe like with the Japanese draft we have to be a bit like We Y pick the things you actually like. Maybe that should be the focus in a bit less.

Matthew
01:50:46
I wanna win though.

Samuel
01:50:47
I've seen four people.

Matthew
01:50:48
The thing is I f I feel like that's how I started doing these drafts and then I never won and then when I changed and got a bit more strategic I started winning and I like the taste of it.

Samuel
01:50:59
Now you only win so that's um yeah which is um you know such as it is Um, okay, so yeah, I mean I I do kind of agree with you, but yeah, I and I'm quite I'm quite I did with this draft try and pick like half things that were half picks and half things that were I think would win.

Um some games we've not talked about before and some games we've not talked about in a while. So I think it had all the all the good ingredients of a draft. So go into the announcements channel on the Discord and you can vote. I will post the um the games after In fact I'll just put the games into the um Patreon post straight away so you got those for reference. Don't have to have the build-up or whatever. So you've got all the information in one place. I'll put a little spoiler uh sort of thing in there so you don't see it straight away when you click on the post, etc. etc. Just to protect the sanity of the draft, Matthew. Yeah, you've got to protect it. Indeed, but that was very enjoyable. Um, and as mentioned, we have a four-person draft coming next month, so we had a little time off from the drafts to sort of like recharge our competitive energy. This is a little dry run um for the carnage to come. So the Japanese All-Star Game Developers Draft that's coming uh next month once the categories have been decided um with the officers of Ashley Day and Dave Scarborough. Matthew, people will know everything else on social media, so let's get out of here. Goodbye. Goodbye.
