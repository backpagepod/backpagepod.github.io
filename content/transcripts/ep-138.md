Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's your weekend been? Did you eat too many bread rolls at Joe Scribble's wedding? Is that what happened to you this weekend?
Yes, I went to Joe Scribble's wedding and had terrible heartburn, and then ate two BAPs, and that pushed me into a very bad place, and I've had a bread hangover today, but I'm feeling okay now.
Okay, good, good to get a little status update there before I, having baffled our guest.
I feel terrible about talking about BAPs in front of our amazing guest.
Yeah, incredible guest. So this week's guest is Margaret Robertson, the former editor-in-chief of Edge, who worked on the magazine from 2003 to 2007. Margaret is a long-time game designer and consultant, among many other achievements.
Margaret, thank you for joining us, and how are you doing today?
Can I tell you a secret?
Go ahead.
I'm eating a BAP. Whoa.
Right, because it's the morning where you are, right?
Exactly, I'm eating a breakfast, sort of a breakfast BAP, although it's got chocolate in it because that's how we do things here, but yes. So, I'm working on my BAP handwork.
Okay, so not to pry into your personal life too much, but you hinted at it there, you just moved to Japan, right? So how's that going?
It's wonderful. I moved here at the beginning of the year, so I'm kind of six months in, and you're not supposed to say this, but it is sort of everything you ever dreamed of. It's a wonderful place to live.
It's wildly friendly and funny. It's full of interesting corners, lots of interesting games culture happening here too, and so it's a pretty great place to be.
Whereabouts are you based?
Our office is in Shibuya, that's where I am right now, and I live in Suginomi out to the west, which is kind of a little bit more residential and chill.
All right, that is so much more exciting than Bath. This is ridiculous. I mean, having lived in both, I guess you can compare, right?
Absolutely. But if you showed a Japanese person a picture of Bath, their eyes would fall out of their head, they would think it was paradise.
Some kind of reverse version of persona where you're a teenager growing up in Bath. I'm sure it'd be very exciting. Well, thank you so much for joining us, Margaret.
I'm slightly nervous, I've never spoken to you before. I don't actually know you, but we're very grateful to have you on, and your career is really amazing to read about. So thanks for taking the time with the preposterous time difference.
Got a lot I wanted to ask you about Edge, and then I want to talk to you about what you've been doing since then too, because games media was a small, but really important part of your career, and you've done loads of amazing stuff since then. So to kick us off, what are your memories of first discovering games, and what were the earliest games that were significant to you?
Oh, I have a lot of answers to this question. The first video game I really remember was at my friend Helen's house, which I think must have been on a C64, but I didn't know what that was then. And I don't really know what the game is.
I've never quite, I don't remember it that clearly, and I don't really, I've never really had much luck tracking it down, but it was enough to spark a little something. And then the other thing that is maybe the true answer is that my dad had an Amstrad word processor that came with BASIC, and my big brother, who was about 10 years older than me, would write quizzes for me when I was, I think I must have been very small. I must have been sort of three or four.
And three or four years are relatively easy to predict. And so the quizzes would be funny and would know things about what I was gonna say. And they were just, they were full of dad jokes.
They would ask me what the capital of France was, and I would say Paris. And then the computer would say, it's not Paris, idiot, it's F. And it was electrifying.
It was just amazing to have this sense of this computer responding to me, and it felt kind of very personal and intimate and magical. And that, I think, really set the tone of what I thought computers were for. And so after, I think a number of years of pestering, I got an Atari ST for one Christmas, which I swore I was gonna use for homework.
And now I'm here. That's a very, very straight line from that happening to me running a game studio in Tokyo. So that was games like Ranarama, which is still my Twitter handle, which I don't know if you remember, but was a, these days we might call it a roguelike, to be honest, was a little dungeon game where you played a wizard who'd been turned into a frog.
You explore, I guess, randomly generated dungeons and fight monsters and collect spells. And then you beat bosses by solving an anagram. I don't mean anagrams, I mean an anagram.
So the boss battles were unscrambling the letters in the word ranarama, which you will note is mostly the letter A every single time. That was the only mechanic. And to my young nerd heart, there was maybe nothing cooler in the entire world than a video game with fireballs and anagrams in it.
Yeah, and then, I mean, honestly, I would happily talk about nothing but all of the amazing games from that era today. I think there was a bunch of stuff. There's games like Dungeon Master and Mercenary and Damocles and Midwinter and Captive and all kinds of things that were just unbelievably accomplished and still really interesting from a game design perspective.
So yeah, I feel actually pretty lucky to have emerged into that scene. I think I got a really interesting education.
Do you think that growing up in that scene, it sort of predates there being this monocultural element to games where everyone's playing the same sort of console games?
I mean, completely. It was still, it still felt relatively underground. The, a few, I mean, there were just culturally, there were so many magical things about it.
The ST Amiga Wars of which history would say I was on the losing side as a ST fanatic, were weirdly culturally useful. So you had an immediate alliance at school with anyone who was kind of effectively on your team. I still remember, you know, at school one day when I was, I don't know, I'd be 12 or 13, I was lining up outside a physics classroom ready to go in and one of the big boys, one of the sixth years, saw me and walked over and it was a kind of a scary moment.
It was just not a thing that happened normally. And he narrowed his eyes and looked at me for a second and then dug his hand in his pocket and tucked into my school blazer a little pile of pirated disks for the SD because he knew I was part of the SD crew. And so I went home with this kind of exciting treasure.
And that was also part of it, that the piracy scene back then, you know, I am now someone who earns my living through game development. So I understand the harm that piracy can do. But at that time, the scene was so different.
I had no money to spend on games. So I was not a consumer that was choosing out of purchasing. And the piracy scene was super interesting.
So the way you got Pirated Games was you got them on things called CDs, which were not CDs. These were cracked disks. These were floppies that were known as CDs.
And they came from a cracking crew, like the Medway Boys or the Pompeii Pirates, you know, who I thought were like the most glamorous, sophisticated heroes, but presumably in hindsight were three 19 year olds in someone's bedroom. But the CDs that you would get would have a couple games on them that you were really excited to play, but they would also have like tech demos and music visualizers and just art, just bitmaps. And it was all relatively counter-cultural.
So, you know, remember getting anti-Gulf War ones and stuff. And it was just this incredible pipeline of weird digital energy. This, you know, the fact that some 60-year-old outside of physics class can slip me a floppy disk.
And then that night I'm looking at weird anti-George Bush propaganda made by a 19 year old in Portsmouth. Yeah, it was, it felt very narcotic. It was really, really addictive.
So yeah, it was, I have no idea what your original question was, but. That's where it took me.
Were you very aware of like the developers behind the games? If you have this interest in this kind of like, sort of middleman kind of cracking crew.
I was reading ST format at the time. When you, you know, when you have no money to buy games, then, then magazine demo discs were incredibly important in terms of having stuff to play. Yeah, you were, you know, you were seeing interviews and making-ofs in there.
I remember you will understand why I remember this so vividly. I remember they, one that had a making of the Prince of Persia and it had in it stills from the video that Jordan Mechner made of his brother running, his little brother running on a treadmill at home, which he used to like hand rotoscope. The incredible, you know, everybody was losing their minds over how fluid the animation in Prince of Persia was.
I remember staring at these kind of like muddy VHS quality stills of a kid in a pair of sweatpants in a suburban bedroom somewhere across the world, who the power of computers had transformed into this amazing hero that I've been playing in this game. So yeah, I think I did have that sense very early on of that kind of human connection of, oh no, there's a person at the other end of this experience who's made this amazing treat for me.
Yeah, yeah. Right, so as an extension of that, were you pretty engaged at the time with games media, Margaret? Was that something that was immediately on your radar?
Did you discover that a bit later?
I think I just gravitated straight to SD format because of the game demos. I mean, the truth is that most of the rest of my available pennies were being spent on Karang and Metal Hammer, so I don't know that I was playing a lot of other games mags. And SD format, I think, had just enough serious content in it that I could fog my parents off with this ongoing pretense that I was gonna learn how to program or do something useful.
So yeah, I wasn't really that aware. I guess Games Master was on TV still at that point, but I didn't become a magazine nerd. I was too busy becoming a games nerd, I think.
I actually inherited a desk from Metal Hammer when I went to Future London, and it was covered in stickers that were so old that I just couldn't scrape them off the desk. And I am so far from a Metal Hammer reader and sitting there making a Fish and Nintendo magazine. I just remember there was a sticker on...
I could always see it in my eye line. It just said, cancer bats. I have no idea what cancer bats are, but it was just always there.
And I had Mario on my screen and cancer bats on my desk and thinking, what is this? This is a silly job.
I would have taken that desk off you in a heartbeat. I wrote game reviews for Metal Hammer for a while and it was a great joy to review Mario for that audience.
Oh yeah.
What was their style guide like? Did you have to apply any particular, oh, it's Mario kind of like attitude to it?
No, I think they were very sincere. I think most metal people are surprisingly sincere.
Just terrible stereotyping on my part there, really. I'm curious Margaret, from there, what are the games that interest you throughout the 90s, I guess? Like what sort of leads you towards some kind of career focused around games in terms of what you're actually playing?
So it nearly all went wrong. I took it, I forgot this until you asked me, I took it a year out after I finished school for university and I lent my entire ST game collection to my best friend Colin so that he could play my games while I was away, because there's no point in them just sitting there. And when I got back a year later, he said I'd never given them to it.
It kind of ruined our friendship.
And I still don't really, I've not got closure on it, we fell out of touch. He was the most wonderful person. If there was the speck of wrongdoing that he did, for a start I don't believe it, because he was a very good hearted person and he wouldn't do anything wrong.
And then also he'd done a million unbelievably kind things in our friendship before that. So I bear him no ill will now, but at the time it was just this weird thorn that we couldn't really process. And so then I just, I came, I'd been looking forward to playing games when I got home and I got home and I had nothing.
I gave him every single disc I had. So I had nothing to play. And that was sort of the end of my games career.
But then I went to college, I went to Glasgow University for a year and one day there was an envelope in my mailbox saying that the university had previously had a competitive bursary program where people would apply to win a bursary, but due to cost constraints, they were no longer able to run that prize. So instead what they did was they just looked at everybody's exam results and they gave the bursaries to whoever got the best exam results. And they looked and I had got really good exam results because nerd and so here's a check.
So it was just this completely surreal windfall. And I say with great pride that I took that check and spent it immediately on a PlayStation One.
Oh amazing, that's very wise.
Because it felt like the right thing to do. And yeah, that PlayStation One went with me everywhere. It turns out you could, if you remember the size and shape of a PlayStation One, you can wrap it up perfectly in a pair of pajama trousers.
And so anytime I went anywhere, I would roll up my PlayStation One in my pajama trousers and take it with me. And yeah, that was, I mean, again, I feel that that timing was incredible. I mean, I think that a lot of people had experience with early PlayStation that it was like, oh, gaming is cool and it's for grownups and it's for club kids.
I think that wasn't so revelatory for me because having grown up through this kind of ST world, that stuff that I was explaining before about like music visualizers and weird propaganda, games hadn't felt like any, I hadn't grown up through console, I hadn't grown up with Mario and Super Nintendo. And so it didn't exactly blow me away, but it suited me down to the ground. It was like, oh yeah, this is what I love about games, this feels right.
And then also it was a way to have a CD player because you needed a CD player in those days. And so it was my music player for a long time, was how I listened to music, was through my PlayStation.
What games did you buy with your PlayStation?
Oh, I had very little money left once I bought the machine. And so one of the things I came home with was a game called Kaleek the Blood, which you should Google. It's one of the worst.
I had to play that whole wretched thing so many times because it was one of the only games I had. It's a very, very bad kind of doom-em-up. You could maybe tell how bad it is by the fact that it's called Kaleek the Blood.
It was not a good video game, but these are not gonna be in chronological order, but obviously a huge amount of Wipeout. I love games with all my heart. I'm not very good at them.
That my one gaming skill, claim to fame, is that I used to be able to complete a successful lap of the first track of Wipeout, which I think is Ultima, with the TV turned off. I knew it so well. I could do the track.
What a party trick. Listen, I did not get a good time, but I could do a lap. A lot of micro machines.
You could do two to a pad. So you could get four player micro machines going. A Jumping Flash, Bit of Rayman and then still a million demo discs.
So this would now be moving into official PlayStation magazine territory. Again, full price games were mostly beyond my reach. So those demo discs were...
I was sharing a flat with three other game fanatics and the arrival of that magazine every month was such a big deal because it was your chance to play some new games. And I kept those, I think I finally jettisoned those discs maybe in this move to Japan, but I still had a CD wallet full of... I still remember exactly how they look.
The official PlayStation demo discs were hugely precious.
I looked up Kaleek, it got 31 out of 14 for Mitsui.
Maybe I should revisit it. I've not been back. Maybe I was the one who was in the wrong there.
Or maybe there just weren't really any good PlayStation 1 games yet, I think is something that was happening.
So when did you figure out you wanted a career in games? Can I ask, did your brother making you quizzes have anything to do with your desire to eventually make games?
I think I never thought I could make games. I'd never got into the programming or creation side of things. It just didn't seem like a real job.
I mean, now you could go to college for it. But now everybody understands this is an industry that you can join. At that point, I knew that individuals, I knew that we talked a little bit about knowing that human beings make games, but they just felt like wizards.
It didn't really feel like a job. I was getting more and more and more interested in games themselves. We're now at a time where emulations becoming much more possible.
So I was having a chance to go back and check out all of the machines that I hadn't played. So I was turning into a scholar almost to this stuff. I was like, whoa, there was this thing we hear about, this thing called the Neo Geo.
Now I can figure out how to play some of those titles. So I was spending more and more time learning and playing and thinking and talking, but I didn't really think that I could make them. So I did the one game job I applied to is I applied to be the receptionist at, gosh, what they called Zunami?
Martin Hollis' studio after he left Rare.
Yeah, Zunami.
Yeah, they were looking for a receptionist. So I applied for that job, which was about as much as I could imagine myself being qualified for. I think I maybe never heard back.
But by that time, the focus for me had become much more on Edge and on the Edge forums, which is really where the next chapter started for me.
What sort of takes you from being the person playing Killik, the blood, to someone who's thinking really, you're calcifying your thoughts about games and kind of leading you to Edge? Because it feels like there's probably a little journey for you to take there. You mentioned emulation.
So when do you decide that there's, I guess, like that next level of how you think about these things and how you talk about these things?
It was just so exciting to get to talk about them. I think I was just kind of like exploding with amazement and curiosity about all these amazing things that I felt like people didn't really know about and I didn't have anyone to talk to about because, you know, again, I think culturally it was such a different time. Games were just way less mainstream, way less culturally accepted.
I mean, I remember when I moved to London, I would like, I remember one time I saw another adult playing, I guess, probably a GBA on the underground and I was like, should I go talk to him? Because I was just so excited to see somebody else playing a video game. And so that was the kind of vibe and so when you found your way to the Edge Forum and it was just full of other people who had exactly that same desperate need to talk to people, it was just a delight to be there, to get to hang out with people who finally felt like they were your crew, they were your right people.
And so I didn't really have a plan, I did have one thought when I started being more vocal on the forums, which was just, hey, there are people here who one day might hire you, so just put the effort in. Just be a person who posts good stuff and handles himself well, and you love this place, you want it to be great, just put the effort in. I just had an instinct, it wasn't a plan, but it was just an instinct of like, it's worth taking this a little bit seriously.
And so very quickly became a moderator on that forum, and then that started bringing me into contact with some of the people who ran the magazine.
Were they were they on the forum then directly?
They were called the underscores because they were Steve underscore Edge, David underscore Edge as their usernames on the forum. When I got my job, when I did finally get hired, my very kind boyfriend at the time got my favourite comics artist to draw a portrait of me wearing a t-shirt that said underscore on it because now I was finally an underscore.
Who's your favourite comic artist, if you don't mind me asking?
That was, I mean, you shouldn't have to choose, but that was actually James Kachalka, who does the sketchbook diaries.
Right, right.
On the indie side. But yeah, that I still have somewhere. It's still my avatar in some places.
So yeah, they were around. But I think the more influential thing maybe was that the forum started having meetups. We were all delighted to have found each other, but we still mostly had no nobody in real life that we were talking to about this stuff.
I think it was one small initial meetup that I didn't make it to. And then there was the first big meetup in Bath, I don't know, like 30 or 40 people traveled to it. Wow.
I was sharing a hotel room with a guy I knew only, I think, is Kagamusha, who I assumed would be a good dude, who was a good dude, but yeah, it was, you know, everyone was broke. It was a real ragtag bunch of people from kind of very different backgrounds and very different interests. And I think the Edge team helped hire out a bar for us.
Stee, I remember, had brought a 10 player Saturn Bomberman. I think somebody had an Xbox, I think Xbox had just launched and so nobody had really seen it yet. Yeah, it was just heaven.
It was just, you know, suddenly everybody there was somebody you could talk to about the stuff that you were most fascinated by. I made friends on those meets that have lasted my whole life and the network of friendships is bigger and stronger than that, that there are dozens of us whose lives are still interconnected deeply from those first meetings and many, many of those people are now still in the Games of Junior. I was just, I just met up in Kyoto on the weekend with someone I know from that first meet who has a game studio in Kyoto now.
So yeah, it was those, the four of those meetups were crazy, crazy influential.
Yeah, life affirming, I'm sure. What do you remember about the Edge interview process at the time? And I suppose, how did you end up applying for the job from being a member of that community?
Gosh, a few things happened. They had been advertising a role for staff writer, but they took the advert down. And so I hadn't, I hadn't really thought that I could go for it.
But I once it, the ever it went, I was like, oh, well, you know, that, that's that. I missed my chance. That was, that was never gonna happen.
We now arrive at the inaugural mention of Mr. Tony Mott in this podcast. It was only a matter of time.
Right.
Tony was running Game Central on Teletext. He was just restarting Game Central on Teletext and he was looking for people to write for that. So he asked me on the, via the forum, he had, I had been right, it had been worth trying to make an effort and write good content on the forum.
So he got in touch and said, did I want a column? And I obviously said yes. So my first, the first games writing I did was for a monthly column on Teletext Game Central.
I still feel weird every time I see that name in Metro.
No, but there we go.
That was amazing. That was an incredible, it was, you know, it was a huge audience. It was, you know, a million people read that thing way more than read any magazine I ever wrote for.
It was still a huge source of information for people. But you're writing, the discipline required writing for that format is incredible. I mean, you have a, you have a character, every line needs to be 39 characters or something.
And so you don't just have a word count, you have a per line character count. So they were like writing haikus.
But it was wonderful. And again, I got to know some of my other columnists there, I've become lifelong friends. So that kind of gave me a little bit of confidence.
And then I think Steve and David let me know on the forum that they were still looking for someone, even though the job posting had gone. I honestly, honestly thought if I apply and I get an interview, I'll get to see the office. And that was my goal.
I was like, I'll get to go inside the Edge office. I really think I didn't think I would get it. I thought they wouldn't harm me because I didn't have a journalism degree.
I was like, oh, this is a job for a journalist and a journalist should have journalist training and I don't have that. So all of the prep I did for the interview was like trying to learn how a magazine got made and what journalism is and things. I went in and did the interview and I don't think I did great.
I was super nervous. I later found out it was deadline day, I don't know what he was doing, scheduling interviews on deadline day, but it was deadline day. So he was exhausted and distracted, well, he wasn't distracted in the interview, he gave the interviews full focus, but he was obviously just in the middle of a very, very demanding day, and I walked out of it thinking, well, there you go.
I knew it wasn't really going to work, at least I gave it a swing, and I went to the pub to drain my sorrows. I guess it must have been with somebody, I guess it must have known. I just want to clarify, I don't think I was drinking alone.
What I didn't know is I had accidentally picked one of the future pubs, and so because it was Deadline Day, when the Edge crew finished the issue, they all showed up for a drink, so suddenly there was Drow, and I was drunk by that stage because see earlier story for details. I don't really know what happened, but I do have this kind of like flashback image of me having literally backed him into a corner, and I don't know if I was physically jabbing him in the chest, but I think there was some amount of finger waving, because I had just launched into all of my super passionate feelings about games and about Edge and about the magazine and what I thought it should be like and what was good and what was bad and how things could change and what things were precious, because it was fine. I knew I hadn't got the job, and I was a little bit loosened up for two.
And yeah, I think probably I got the call. James Bins, I think, gave me the call two days later and said, yeah, you've got the job. And he offered me, he told me how much the salary was, and I took a deep breath because I'd read all the books that said that this is what you're supposed to do.
And I asked for a slightly higher number and he laughed and said, I didn't need to give you that. I know how badly you want this job.
And I said, yeah, you're right.
Amazing. Well, that's quite a process. I was just going to ask you from there, like, how did you find the experience of joining the team at that time?
Like, what was it? Was it like coming into that as someone who had seemingly secured their job in the pub? I mean, was it then intimidating to just like to switch lives to I just work on this magazine now and I really wanted it and now I have it?
I do remember arriving very vividly. They were just about to move offices. It wasn't super clear they had really remembered that I was starting.
So I got there and they showed me to my desk and the only thing that was on my desk was a pencil and I sat there for a bit with this pencil thinking I don't really know how this is going to work and the first job they gave me was to review a packet of mental stimulation sweeties. I think they were called extals that were being marketed at gamers and they thought that there might be a funny sidebar in it, so could I write something about extals? So there was definitely a kind of, there was an initial thing where I was like, oh, I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't know how any of this works and I don't know if this is going to be okay.
But it was such a nice team and I knew the magazine so well and I knew games pretty well that I think it all came together fairly quickly. And then I think, I mean, I think also I was just on the road almost immediately. I think my second issue, I was maybe out at E3.
So it was kind of just real in at the deep end stuff. You were like, I guess I'm supposed to come home with photos, but I don't have a camera. So I guess I need to, how does that work?
I bought a little Sony Cybershot, you know, 2.3 megapixel camera or something. And I remember taking, taking photos of like the cable cars in San Francisco that are, have plaques commemorating Atari and just be, just being, I mean, I'd never been to America before, I guess. So it was, yeah, it was just, it was, it was eyes on stalks, nonstop.
Was that 2003 E3 you would have been at?
I think so, yeah.
Do you remember much about that experience, your first E3?
No, just being scared all the time. I think that the pressure felt intense of like, my job is to not miss anything and it's edge, right? So I really revered the magazine, so it was like, I can't phone any of this in.
I've got to come back with like the best access, the best insight. I've got to really do the job. And I had no idea how anything, I'd never been to, I'd never been to a game show, I'd never been to any kind of show like that.
You know, there was some stuff that the magazine had set up. So there was some things where I, you know, I had appointments or I had interviews with people, but I kind of knew that I was supposed to be like hustling and finding cool stuff and getting into good conversations. And I just felt really, really out of my depth.
And you know, you're jet lagging exhausted and all of that. So yeah, I just, I remember being at the show, I remember some booth that was like two stories high and had stairs in it. And it was for a not very good game.
And I just, I just, I just remember gobbling at it and being like, is this, is this cool?
Or is this stupid? Or is this important?
Or what should I, what do I do now? Do I, do I line up for, it was a lot of like, do I line up to go inside this thing for an hour? Because I, because I'm supposed to take a photograph of the inside or do I try and pull the edge cord and be like, hey, I'm from edge, can I jump the queue?
Or is that super rude? Or is this whole thing a waste of my time? Cause it looks a bit like it might be a waste of my time, but it's, but it's got stairs.
It was, yeah, it was kind of, I didn't have very good puristics for kind of like figuring out what I was supposed to do.
Right.
Did you play the edge card much?
Not really.
I don't really know. I think that's sort of not how the edge card worked. I think it wasn't so much a thing that you could like use on the door.
I think what the edge card did was it was like, oh, hey, it would be really nice to talk to Gabe Newell at some point. And then because you're edge, you get to do that. So it was kind of a slower burn playing the edge card.
So around the time you joined Edge, the magazine was synonymous with these concept issue covers, most infamously, The Girl Issue, which we talked about in this podcast before, but many others around the mod scene, mainstream games, taking over gaming culture or gaming, having a midlife crisis. These are all covers they ran. So how did the tone of the magazine at that time fit your sensibilities?
Was that sort of thing exciting to you coming into it?
Yeah, it absolutely was. I think, I mean, The Girl Issue is one of the issues that I still have, that I didn't work on. I've got the original, the Wipeout cover that's like number 74 or whatever.
And I do have a copy of The Girl Issue, partly just because I thought it was a beautiful cover. And I love that game. It's a great, it's a surprisingly wonderful game.
Yeah, I mean, it felt to me like it really fit with a lot of how I was thinking about games and what I loved about games that you could, you know, you could kind of like study them as artifacts and take them apart as machines, but they were also culture. And it was worth talking about them in those terms too. And so it absolutely felt to me like this is, this was Edge's home turf.
This is what Edge was for, was to be the place that kind of went beyond a remit that was just about servicing an enthusiast audience who just wanted to know, hey, what's out this month? What's good this month? And started being more critical, started being more big picture thinking, started looking at what happens when you plug gaming into other forms of culture, other societal shifts, other kind of like bigger questions.
If that had been all Edge did, I think that wouldn't have been enough for me, but because it was that combined with the kind of scholarship and the awareness of history and the interest in technology and the intense critical interest in the detail of the player experience, that together felt to me like exactly the right package for a magazine that was trying to be serious about video games as a cultural norm for me.
I mean, I must admit, I've now kind of just want to ask you your thoughts on Dead or Alive Xtreme Volleyball, since you hinted there that like that game is wonderful. Can you talk a bit more about that?
I mean, so look, I haven't played it since then, so I don't know how my thinking on it would have evolved. Partly, it was just a game that had women in it. I hadn't got to play many of those.
That was a little intoxicating. And it is a game that did feel a bit like it was a game about friendship. It is obviously, you put quotation marks of various heaviness around the friendship, depending on how you approach that game.
But that was a kind of game I'd never played before, so it was probably like the first dating sim, the first time I'd run into that dating sim mechanic. It was at a time when games were still mostly kind of brown and grim and violent, it was just this bottle of vitamins, just this beach delight of bright colours and foliage and blue skies and, you know, people who were pleased because you remembered to buy them a bracelet or pick up a packet of their favourite snack or whatever. I think a little bit that game, how you approach that game defines how it reads a lot.
If you approach it with a joyful, pure heart, you can have a pretty joyful, pure experience in it. But I haven't been back to it, so I wonder if now I would find it a slightly tougher thing to enjoy in that way. The volleyball gameplay I think was pretty decent.
I think it was a not bad volleyball game and volleyball is maybe a not bad sport for videos. Maybe we need more volleyball games. And it was called Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.
That's how, how can you not love a game called Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball?
Yeah, I'm so glad I asked about that because that's a really interesting way of looking at it. I suppose it's types of mechanics have only become really more mainstream over time. So it's not how that game is talked about in retrospect, really the way you just described it.
So, you know, it's nice to hear about it for sure. So it's been well documented there was an edge exodus of sorts in the first half of the noughties when you were very new to the magazine. Is there anything you can say about that and what was it like finding yourself as one of the most experienced members of staff in the wake of that?
I mean, there was a pretty weird feeling and you're right, it was pretty soon after I joined. So I think it was one of the things that kind of like maybe resonates more when you compress it into a little, salacious standing story rather than living through it at the time, I think. It's absolutely right that I did.
I think also because Tony was busy elsewhere at the time, so he hadn't been working so actively on the mag. I think there was kind of a moment where I, at sort of five or six months in, was the most senior person there because the rest of the, and of course, this is only talking about the writing, the editorial staff, the rest of the magazine staff were there. So Darren Phillips and Andrew Hind, we're still holding down the visual side of the magazine, which is a huge part of its identity and its continuity.
So some of it kind of like predates me joining, so I don't have a firsthand experience of it. I think there were some tensions around kind of exactly what your previous question was about, that the editorial team at the time was very focused on kind of like asking these harder questions and interrogating games as a cultural forum. Future is a company that makes money out of advertisers.
And so those two things do not necessarily sit super easily together. And I think some of the readership was chafing a little bit about these questions that kind of, I think to some readers felt like the magazine was calling them out rather than calling the games as a cultural forum out. You know, things like the Board to Death cover and the mainstream cover were for people who wanted to read Edge as an enthusiast magazine of like, hey, what should I be excited about this month?
Those are not necessarily the things that you want to be seeing. So there were kind of some tensions around that that I think contributed to the situation. But then I think really what happened is slightly different.
And you know, now what I'm doing is speaking for other people which is always very, very risky, but my perception of it at the time as someone who was just getting to know all of these people is that there was a personal dimension in it for everyone. So I think there was a background of tension around editorial direction, but there was also just a bunch of individuals who were in the middle of living their lives and they'd, I think mostly been on the magazine for quite a while by that stage. Burnout on Anymag, but especially on Edge, was pretty brutal, you're working incredibly hard, it's absolutely relentless.
And then also they were a very tight friendship group and so once one or two of them left, I think it just started to feel natural that maybe it was just time for everyone to move on. So what didn't happen is there wasn't some big incredible moment where everybody got up in an editorial meeting and threw their badges and guns down and said, I'm out of here. What happened is over a several month period, and I think this had all been brewing probably before I even got there, just kind of an end of an era emerged.
When it rains, it pours kind of thing.
I think there was some of that. So this is, like I'm saying, this is me speaking for other people. I also don't want to diminish.
I mean, I think everybody, probably everyone who's ever written for that magazine does it with their full heart and soul. So the pain when things aren't going right, when you feel like you're not being able to do the job that you want to do on it, where you are having to deal with internal politics or square difficult circles between advertisers' interests that are pulling the magazine in one direction and your editorial instincts, which are pulling it in another, those are deep and painful experiences. So by saying there wasn't kind of a big exodus, I don't want to diminish those experiences that people had that I think were really tough.
But I think it was just all a little bit more personal, a little bit more amorphous than it necessarily sounds. I would like to clarify, it wasn't that I had really bad BO. I do think a little bit, when you look back at it historically, it was like, well, Margaret arrived, and then immediately everyone quit.
Well, I asked you about this because I did think in the telling of it in miniature, it does make it sound like everyone left and then Margaret was still there. And there is missing context there that seems a bit unfair in this sort of a bridged version of that story. So, you know, it's nice to hear your side of it for sure.
So your rise to EIC was extremely impressive. On your portfolio page, you mentioned that you were determined to bring more diverse voices to the magazine, extend coverage of games beyond just console titles and create these more minimalist collectible covers as a kind of like approach to the design of the magazine. Does that tell the story of your impact on the magazine or was there more you tried to achieve besides that?
Oh, I wonder what mood I was in when I wrote that. I don't know. I mean, honestly, I feel like I don't know how big an impact I had on the magazine as, when you move to America, you have to start calling it editor-in-chief because everybody's an editor in America.
So in UK parlance, I was just editor. You know, I'd still, I think if you look back, probably overall, the biggest ways I had impacts on the magazine were just as a writer. I wrote a huge amount of copy my whole time there, including when I was editor.
I think I had a big influence in terms of who I hired and who I started, who I brought on as freelancers. So I think when I look back now, I feel incredibly lucky that the people that I was able to bring on. So working with Ollie Welsh, now of course, your gamer.
Chris Donlon, I gave Chris Donlon his first writing job, much to his horror. He sent into Edge like a fan contribution. He was like, I love the magazine.
I love the Time Extend feature. I wrote a Time Extend on, I think on PNO3, that weird catacombs. Yeah, yeah.
I read it and I emailed the Mac and I was like, cool, where do I, you know, can you send me your payment details so I can pay you? And he was like, no. I just, what are you talking about?
I just, I've read it because I love Time Extend and I love PNO3. And I'm like, yeah, but we're publishing it. So can you tell me your bank details, please?
And he was like, well, but is that okay? And I was like, well, we'd like to. Is it okay with you?
And he was like, well, yeah.
I mean, the truth is, now that I know Chris Donlon a little bit better, it was maybe also a very neat little Chris Donlon play.
He's a little bit of a trickster, but that was very exciting. We had Ihard Benchroder based on things that I knew of his writing from the Edge Forum. He was a journalist for many years, but is now a writer for games rather than about games.
He recommended Brandon Boyer to us. And then I think I wasn't an editor for that long. I was very green as an editor.
I knew a huge amount about the content, making sure the magazine had good content in it, but I didn't really have much experience of the business side of it, of the strategic side of it, of the how to plan ahead to get good covers, how to build those relationships, how to do those deals. I never felt like I worked for Future. I worked for Edge.
And my whole world was that room full of people. And I loved those people and I knew a lot about, or I hope I knew a lot about how to help them do good work and plan our lives and our content. But I didn't have a ton of experience for the bigger scale things.
I don't think you can look back and say, look at how much I was able to improve, say the diversity of voices right for the magazine. I think I hope to do that. I don't know that I did it.
I did push for more original IP on covers. And I did always love a clean cover and a dramatic cover. And so we, I think, concentrated a lot on using game art.
I was always excited if I could run a cover with a female rather than a male character on it because I was just a little bored of the army boys. And so I think I got to do the heavenly sword cover and the, I think the Mirror's Edge cover was my last cover. We're trying to commission more original art.
So we did the LucasArts cover with all of the LucasArts. I still don't really know how we didn't get away with that because it does have like Darth Vader and Han Solo on it. So I did a little bit of that, but I don't know that I, I think, I mean, also a little bit, I maybe revered the magazine too much.
I was like, what I was trying to do was perfect the thing that I had inherited rather than have any big ideas about how to change it.
Well, I think it was a really strong era of Edge. And if you think about the pressure you're under to continue it with most of the staff leaving, like to, you know, you still got incredible access just because of, you know, the outlet you're representing. And like, I think when you look back at the run of covers, it's a very strong and varied lineup.
There's, you know, there's some unusual stuff in there. There's some, you know, you work through some console launches as well, right? So, you know, I could, I think it, it's a short period of your life really, but it seems like you achieved quite a lot in that time.
No, that's very kind of you to say.
Just my observation from looking into it this past weekend.
Yes, yes, yes. Guilty as charged.
They're all brilliant additions as well.
I had to hire Alex Wiltshire at a higher salary than I was being paid at the time. He was so, he was just so good and so credible and such a grown up. We wanted him so badly and he was like, wow, this is nobody is getting paid well, right?
It's not like he was asking for big money, like everybody is scraping by. And he was like, look, I'm moving from London, I have a family, I'm taking a big pay cut. This is the number that I need or this doesn't work for me.
And I remember it was a thousand a year more than I was getting as editor.
It's like, oh, I guess I have to say yes to this.
Worth every penny. I should have learned from Binsey.
I should have played horrible.
Yeah.
I just didn't feel like it was going to work. He just wasn't bluffing. He was like, I've done the songs.
This is the number. And yes, absolutely worth every penny. Richard, I remember him showing up in a blue velvet blazer with a daffodil in the lapel.
He still wears that now, I think.
Yeah, but just so, so eloquent and characterful. And Morton just, I mean, again, Morton is just like, he's just such an obvious immediate horror the second you sit down with him, you're like, oh, you could be working for this magazine already, right now. Like I just, you already know your stuff.
Duncan Harris too.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so also I think when you kind of, when you look at those, when you do look at my runners editor, it wasn't, that didn't happen like two days after everybody left, that had happened after I'd had a chance to like build this team of people who I really loved working with and knew I could kind of rely on. So Ian Eviden, who was a production manager, the art team, yeah, I mean, it was just, it's a real, it's a real joy to bring that group together once a month and be like, all right, what are we, what are we going to do this time?
I was always very envious from afar, because I had a little bit of crossover time there at the start and then thinking, oh, what a team. I loved all of them, I thought that was just amazing. Around the Wii launch era of Edge, I thought was so good.
It was a good time to be Edge in terms of the hardware that was coming out, in terms of the way that the industry was changing. I mean, I think it's, it's been really influential on my whole career since, but yeah, like being, being there for the launch of the DS, for the launch of the Wii, getting to try that hardware out before anyone else knew what it was kind of capable of. Even the stuff that like didn't necessarily work out, just like everybody was, everybody was trying so many things, like Itory was happening and maybe that was going to be important.
And then, you know, Guitar Hero hit and these are not chronological, but you know, it was a moment, it was, it was a kind of a more chaotic and creative moment, I think, in hardware history than maybe the five years preceding and the five years after. And so yeah, I think it was, it was, it was a fun time to be Edge. And I think I had a fun crew of people.
Can I just say, everybody, including me, always talks so much about Edge covers, but I think the thing I always loved most about Edge as a reader, but as a maker and looking back at it now, is it's the in covers, not the covers that I care about the most. We poured so much energy into those things. So this is the inside front cover and the inside back cover, which in every other magazine is very expensive.
It's ad space, but Edge always keeps for a little visual joke. And I was also having a little look prepping for this conversation and just the amount of personal history and effort. A lot of this, it's not exactly that it was pre-Photoshop, because obviously there's tons of Photoshop happening, but a lot of it we didn't do digitally and sometimes because you couldn't and sometimes because we didn't want to.
Like I was amazed at how much of my own handwriting there is in those. Like you open an in-cover and it's like, oh yeah, I physically wrote that. And then we took a photo of it because that was the joke that month.
Or there's an in-cover for, just after World of Warcraft launched, where there's a single World of Warcraft character on the front in-cover and then on the back, there's a huge, it's a weird, it's like an eerie photo of a huge group of players on the, it's taken at night in the, I think in the Shining Flats, if you're a WoW player, just laid out, all lying on the ground, but in the shape of the edge E. And that was my, that was my, it's kind of weirdly beautiful. And that was, you know, I took that photo, they were team-amazing.
A lot of edge foreign people who played WoW together. And that was to, you know, to make that in-cover, we gathered 40 people for real in Warcraft one night. And coordinated, laying everybody down and found the right angle for the photo.
And there's so much of that. If you look at those in-covers, pretty much everything. If you're wondering if it's real, it's real.
And we went and found the thing or sourced the photo or whatever else. So yeah, there's a incredible amount of personal history invested in those pieces of the magazine. So yeah, you should do it.
You should do a whole, I think you probably could do an amazing special just on the in-covers.
They deserve reevaluating clearly. That's amazing. Just can't imagine ever having had the time to do anything like that when I was editing magazines.
By then it was already like, we have like two writers and that's it. But yeah, incredible. So I guess I'd like to cap off our edge chat because I really could hear you talk about it all day.
It's really riveting. And I still just think it's such a crazy, small short period of time, like it's four years. And yeah, that's just, you know, just knowing the kind of like, I could see why you wouldn't stay much longer because that's actually, I'm sure that progressing that fast is probably also burning you out slightly as well.
So I suppose like, what is the end of your time on edge like?
I mean, there was definitely some burnout. There was, I mean, you're right that we had that we, that we still had slightly bigger teams, but the workloads were insane. There would definitely be, especially, you know, you're doing, you're squeezing in 13 issues a year.
And those, the end of the year, when a lot of the games are coming out, I would routinely around then have kind of situations where it's like, well, maybe I just sleep every other night. And then if I, if I work, if I work through the night, Monday night and Wednesday night, we can get everything done by Thursday. And that's not cool.
I remember, I remember when the PSP came out, we had to get all of the games reviewed for the issue that we had the PSP launch in. And I was staying up all night to try and play, play these games, to get them reviewed. And this was at a time in my life when I had pet rats, because I desperately wanted a dog and I couldn't have a dog.
And I thought, maybe if I have six rats, it'll be a bit like having one dog. And I had fallen asleep playing one of the games that I was trying to get finished for review. And one of my rats had chewed through the charging cable of the PSP.
And there were no other charging cables, because this was like a pre-release. This thing wasn't out yet. You couldn't run to the store and get one.
And I had to turn up at work the next day and say, A, I haven't finished the game. I promised that I would finish last night to review it. And B, my rat has destroyed.
And I think probably what happened is I had to official PlayStation. We had to like buddy George or PSP's because they not had that happen to them. So, yeah, Burnout was pretty real.
Honestly, the end of my time there is sad and I don't really know how to talk about it. I had some personal circumstances happening that meant that I had to leave fairly abruptly. And I do wonder a little bit about the other universe where I could have stayed a bit longer and learned more of the strategic side of the business and maybe had a different experience of being editor than the one that I had.
And just have more time with that team and have more time to say thank you and enjoy being with them because as I think, it just kind of vanished a bit at the end there and I've always lamented that it had to end the way that it did. So, yeah, I think, but I couldn't have got more out of that time. I just, the people I got to meet, the places I got to go, the games I got to play, the conversations I got to have, it was an incredible education, an incredible opportunity.
I can't overstate, I think, how lucky I was getting to be there at that time.
Well, thank you so much for sharing your recollections there, Margaret, on Edge. Was there any, I guess, funny stories you wanted to throw in there just so you don't feel like you have to end on the...
I mean, the rat eating a piece of PC Gamer was pretty funny.
Yeah, it is actually, yes. Sorry. I mean, I think we got to the somber part after that and I was like, OK, I did forget that was quite a funny story.
What was the EA trip you were on in 2003? Was it like some Lord of the Rings or James Bond nonsense? I don't remember.
I remember it being a little underwhelming. I had kind of heard a lot of rumours of trips that were all like, they'll take you out to a strip club. Or maybe they just never took me out to a strip club, but it wasn't like that by the time I was there.
There was still a lot of drinking, and most of my funny trip stories are drunk stories. But they were weird and incredible. I remember being on a press trip in Finland, probably Nokia or something, and they took us on this kind of theme night.
We didn't really know, they were just like, everybody get on the bus, we're going to a restaurant. Fine. But then after we drove for a while, we got stopped by a Russian soldier who ordered everyone off the bus.
It wasn't something that it felt fake, but it was just like, nobody's really freaking out, so presumably this is kind of a bit. And then they marched us through the forest, and then it turned out that there's this Russian occupation-themed restaurant in Finland, because Finland was under Russian occupation for a long time. Yeah, it was run by a husband and wife.
He plays the balalaika. And I seem to remember eating haggis, which sounds unlikely, but that is probably a reminder. I do also remember drinking Kahlua for some weird reason.
And then they put everyone back on the bus and had to drive us back into town. Because they'd been giving us beers on the bus, everyone was so drunk and we'd all had this weird, terrible Russian occupation food and too much Kahlua. And I remember when I were on a bus and everybody started throwing up.
And they threw up so much that there was, you know you're on a coach, there's the aisle down the middle of the coach. There was like a little sea of vomit on the aisle of the coach. And when the bus had to break, it would kind of float to the front of the bus and float back again.
And I just remember sitting there drunkenly thinking, oh yeah, this is this is games journalism. This is, this is how it, this is, this is my life.
This is what we do.
I love that it was an Edge editor who brought by far the grossest press trip story we've heard on this podcast.
At TGS one year, we were at a Microsoft party. It was a pretty weird Microsoft party. There were drill instructors for some reason.
It was a pool party, but there were drill instructors. And we had a couple of drinks. And then it was kind of a slightly boring party in a few of us.
Because this is also the other thing is that you're on the press trip all the time with these other journalists who are either from sister magazines from Future or from rival magazines. But you all have a huge amount in common. You're probably mates.
There is this kind of lovely thing where you're sort of, you're on these kind of like weird excruciating working holidays with your friends all the time. Everybody's jet-lagging exhausted and filing copy at 3 a.m. But also everybody's amazed and delighted to be travelling the world and getting to meet their heroes and all the rest of it.
So they were very giddy experiences a lot of the time. And so we came out of this Microsoft party. It was in a hotel.
It was at a pool. We came out of the party. You're kind of going through hotel corridors to get back to the lobby to leave.
And we're walking down a corridor that is lined with, like, trestle tables that have food on them, like dessert on them, whatever, for some event. And then we get to the end of the corridor and standing there in business suits are all the senior managers of Microsoft Japan. And then we realized that the trestle tables aren't desserts.
They're cream pies. And that the senior management team were standing in front of this area that's been, like, cling-filmed off.
And we've had a couple drinks. And it's very, very clear that this is set up so that people can throw cream pies at the Microsoft executive team. But it's just us.
And so it was really, really clear that the only thing to do, the absolute only thing to do was just to leave, right? Of course. And we didn't.
We picked up every single cream pie and went through the wall at the Microsoft executive team.
And then we ran away.
And I think we did something terrible. I think we absolutely shouldn't have done it. I mean, it was definitely that was the plan.
It's not that we, like, assaulted people who weren't expecting to be assaulted, but we were not the people who were supposed to be doing the assaulting and it was not yet assaulting time. This was like, I think this was probably supposed to be a hilarious team building event for their team, right, for the people who were directly with them to come and have this silly laugh. And instead, this bunch of drunk foreign journalists committed this, I mean, just heinous act.
It's just, it's really terrible. We shouldn't have done it. But also, no one alive could have resisted the temptation.
You can't do that. You can't herd a bunch of drunk game journalists down a corridor lined with cream pies towards the Microsoft X-Box executive team and not have that happen. It just wasn't possible.
So yeah, there were definitely some more lighthearted words.
Deeply early noughties energy to those big news about press trips. Okay, great. Well, let's take a quick break then and we'll talk to you about what you're up to these days, Margaret.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, Margaret did loads of amazing things after leaving Edge, and still is. So, to start with, Margaret, what are you up to these days?
What brings you to Japan?
So, I have a small game studio here that I run with my co-founder. We're called Cabbage Systems. Good name.
Because we love cabbage and we love systems. And I think it's a studio that's actually pretty directly kind of informed by some of that experience of working on Edge. So, our kind of approach is that we make games for what we call Emerging Systems, which is just kind of like thinking about trying to make games in new ways, in new places.
I'm always really interested to figure out what it looks like to make a game in a new way or in a place where games haven't been before. Find out what kind of game you get when you make a game in those circumstances. And so that's kind of a lot of what we're dedicated to.
The thing that we're working on right now actually is a game that we're making inside Fortnite. So Fortnite, you may have seen, made their big announcement earlier this year that they're extending Unreal Engine to now enable you to create new game experiences directly within Fortnite and changing their business model to support payments to creators for doing that. And for a small studio, that's a really interesting, weird opportunity.
So when you're a small studio, often a bunch of games or a bunch of genres, really, are relatively off limits to you. Like maybe you're gonna choose not to work in 3D because it's just very, very intensive in terms of production values. You're probably gonna stay away from multiplayer and network play because there's just a lot of heavy lifting to get that stuff running smoothly.
There's some big challenges around porting or getting onto multiple platforms. Suddenly, if you're a small team making game inside Fortnite, all of that goes away. It's like, oh, day one, minute one, you're making games on a platform that gives you access to impeccable multiplayer, lobbies, matchmaking, anything like that that you would need.
You're on every major platform. You have all of your deployment figured out. You have an incredible 3D engine.
You have amazing camera behavior. You have awesome player controller programming. A ton of stuff that is usually a huge amount of effort to get up and running if you're doing your own project.
And then what you're doing is figuring out how you can reconfigure the building blocks of Fortnite and the tools that UEFN give you, Unreal Edition Fortnite give you, to make kind of new experiences. So that's been super fun. So our first game just came out.
It's a restaurant management game. Two rival teams competing to run the best pizza shop in town, except everybody has guns. That's kind of the elevator pitch.
We kind of designed it to be a combat optional, but probably inevitable game, but the support is kind of more divergent play styles and kind of different approaches than maybe a straight Battle Royale experience would have. It's called Fast Feud. Good.
And yeah, it's funny. It's actually reminded me quite a lot about a very different project we did years and years ago when I was working at a studio called Hide and Seek. We did a project called the Board Game Remix Kit, which I think the tagline we ended up with for was New Ways to Play the Games You Love.
I think I wanted the tagline to be New Ways to Play the Games You Hate because it was about how to remix things like Monopoly, Intruder Proceed and Cluedo so that they were more fun. And so you would just take all the pieces of those games and figure out if you could play them in new ways. So there's an amazing zombie survival mode for Cluedo where you're all trapped in the Cluedo mansion and you're protecting it from a horde of encroaching zombies.
And all of the weapons that you have in Cluedo are the only things that you have to fight the zombies off. So you're trying to survive the zombie apocalypse with the gun and the rope and the candlestick and whatever. There was an amazing remix, a two-player remix of Monopoly called Divorce, where you...
I think how it works is you start the game with everything. You divide up all of the property cards and everything, including all of the player tokens. And then you play a kind of more conventional turn-taking board game, but where you're having to relinquish and trade off goods to each other that you're breaking up through the process.
I think the win condition for that game is whoever ends up with the Scotty Dog player character is classified as having won the divorce, which does seem natural. So it was this kind of really, really inventive, joyful experience of what different games can we make out of this raw material. And working in Fortnite very much has that same vibe.
It's like, oh, there's all this cool stuff that's already there for us. Now, how can we make it our own? How can we build that into a new kind of play using the kind of tools that we've got?
So I'm somebody who... I love action games, I love shooting games, but I don't really love head-to-head competitive games. And so I sometimes feel a bit left out of, you know, a world right now that's kind of like, there's a big part of the industry that's dedicated to Fortnite and Overwatch and a bunch of other experiences that are rightly catering for that audience who adore those experiences.
They're great games, but they're not quite my games. And so getting to go into Fortnite and say, hey, what's a game that I would like to play here? What's the game that I would design in this space has been super fun.
Well, I'll have to check that out because I have a friend who is bullying me into playing Fortnite, despite me being an elder millennial who can't really pass it that well. And I keep sending him images from a Stanley elder abuse story as a kind of like joke of what our situation is like because he's about eight years younger than me. So I will check that out.
But yes.
This is a version of Fortnite where you can help your team win just by being really diligent at answering the phone and taking orders.
Okay, that is very appealing. So what games have you been playing lately, Margaret? What's been on your list of late?
I have been slightly busy with this while moving to Japan and opening a new game studio business. I can't stop going back to Slay the Spire. It's perfect and frankly seemingly infinite.
I'm so many hours in. I don't know if you folks are Slay the Spire people.
Yeah, not very good at it, but I feel like that's just part of the journey.
And 100%. So I have clawed my way up to like ascension level 10. How anybody gets to 20, I still have no real idea, but I'm still running into combinations and interactions that I haven't seen before and that I, you know, that game does such an amazing job of surprising you with completely predictable things.
You know, you have that moment where something extraordinary happens and then you go, oh, of course, because it's like, oh yeah, I get it. Absolutely. When that happens, then this other thing is going to happen and that's a thing that you could have, you know, you could have figured out yourself from the rules, but you just never thought about it in those terms.
And I love that combination of like games that managed to pull that off, I think, is a real design masterpieces.
Would it have been an Edge 10?
I think it's a pretty, what a dangerous question.
Do you still think in those terms? I'm always curious if people are used to review.
Yeah, but I was always more interested in Edge 7s.
Yeah.
I think...
That's not a surprise.
Yeah, I think we kind of... I mean, I'm from an era where Edge 10s were still exceptionally rare. So you kind of don't think about them because you just don't think you're going to run into one.
I think when I joined the magazine, there were still only five, so in ten years. So it was just, you know, it didn't really seem like a thing. Nines, eights and nines were always fantastically good games, but kind of sometimes just sort of like boringly good games.
Sevens were often games that were trying to do something new or weird and not quite nailing it. Tens were often games doing something new and weird and nailing it. But sevens were often like the most interesting experiences.
So yeah, I think certainly in my time in the magazine, there was kind of a sense of the fact that people thought that when we gave games six or sevens, it's because we didn't like them, when really those were the ones we loved the most. Usually those were the ones that we would talk about the most, but they just had too many flaws and broken bits to get a higher number. So yeah, I think I still sometimes I still look at a thing and think with a huge glory of affection.
That's such a seven, that game.
We're big fans of the seven on the podcast.
It's a massive thing for us.
I love the idea that the Edge 10 is the Edge 7 that got lucky.
A little bit. I mean, I think that's slightly selling it short. But yeah, I think there was definitely sometimes a feeling that the eights and wines could kind of be boring.
They would be incredibly accomplished. There's no way you could give them a lower score because they were just too cohesive, too well executed. But they maybe didn't win your heart in quite the same way.
Interesting. Matthew, does that make you feel any differently about your 10 for Skyward Sword?
Let's not talk about that.
Okay, fair enough. So, Margaret, after you left Edge, you worked on a massive array of stuff as a consultant. Your LinkedIn is rife with amazing things.
That includes some new IP evaluation with EA and Sony, which really jumped out to me as quite exciting. What are the highlights of doing that sort of work? Did Edge open those doors for you?
I mean, Edge 100% opened those doors for me through a combination of... Sometimes it'd just be in contact that I had of people who had a relationship with me, and then sometimes it'd just be in the reputation of the magazine. Sometimes that was people looking for very journalistically focused insights, so sometimes I would be doing kind of...
The teams would bring me in kind of midway through the development process and have me write mock reviews of how I could imagine this game being reviewed when it was released, that they would kind of use to gauge their progress and think about how they wanted to present their game and elements in it. I had a very weird job briefly, I think I'm not going to name the studio just in case, but at a major studio, they hired me to be a bad cop interviewer. So they were working with their teams to get them ready for a big event, to get them ready to send them out to E3 or whatever.
And they were working with a guy who was an ex-Olympic athlete and rather qualified actor somehow, both of those things at once. And so he was teaching them a bunch of kind of like positivity and how to like have feel comfortable and powerful and how they were moving and sitting and being on stage and how to use their voices and all the rest of it. And then they brought me in to ruin all of that by being an asshole interviewer.
So we did terrible things to these poor people. We would like set up the interview room so that they were sitting in like a really uncomfortable, awkward chair. And then I would be a really hostile interviewer and ask them a bunch of questions that I knew they weren't allowed to answer or really aggressive, negative stuff.
And then afterwards they didn't know. They thought they were coming in for interview practice. And then afterwards the broader guy would debrief with them how well they handled it and what they could do differently next time.
It was kind of the most fun I've ever had.
And then, yeah, sometimes it was coming in early on a project where they have kind of a huge design document for a major new piece of IP that they're trying to release and trying to figure out how much faith to put in it. And those were sometimes kind of like really painful processes. You know, and I knew a lot about games.
I knew a lot about the industry. I didn't really know so much about the flow of the production process. I think I may handle some of those conversations differently now.
But yeah, sometimes, you know, I would be coming in and writing big reports and saying, hey, I just think there is a fundamental design flaw at the heart of this project. And if I think if you change it to this other thing, then it might work. But I think if you don't, then if you don't want to do that, then you probably shouldn't move forward with it.
And in some cases, then those IPs didn't move forward. I don't think at all that was purely because of my report. I think honestly, if you're being hard to come in and do that kind of report on a piece of new IP, it's because there are already a lot of serious misgivings around.
It's potential. And that's never fun like that. Those were not the most fun I ever had because they were always projects that were full of life and excitement and possibility.
But sometimes it just felt like, you know, it's hard. It's hard to see how you're going to overcome this central problem. And it's better to say that sooner rather than later, maybe.
Wow, that's super interesting. I've never heard anyone talk about that sort of work before. The idea of the, you know, like mock reviews.
That's one thing. But the idea of this is still in a kind of larval state and we're just going to kill it before it moves further. Yeah, a wild thing to be involved with.
And probably hard not to get emotionally invested, I imagine, as well.
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I mean, the life of a consultant is a weird one. You come in and out, you don't have to deal with the aftermath. But yeah, I mean, I think I do always fall in love a bit with the team that I'm working with.
And what I now tend to feel when I'm doing it on these kind of projects is your value is often in being the bad news bearer. You're the person who can come in and say, hey, look, this bit is a problem. You need to stop.
And nobody else can quite say it that boldly because they do have to deal with the aftermath. They do have to stay in these relationships. And so it has maybe got difficult to have the perspective and the clarity of communication.
And so a lot, you know, I'm now a lot more experienced, a lot more experienced both hands on as somebody who's worked in a production environment and made and released a lot of games, but also a much more experienced consultant now. And being the person who comes in and says, hey, look, you've talked to me a lot about what you care about in this project. You think this component of it is delivering this thing for you.
A, it's not going to work and here's why. And B, it isn't the only way you can get to the thing that is really valuable to you. So what you should do is take this bit out of, just throw it away.
It's going to hurt, but just throw it away. And then revisit how you get the thing you really want because this isn't the way. And so it's a scary, negative piece of feedback, but it's one that has the seeds of something very positive in it.
It's like, no, you're still going to get the thing you want, but in a way that's going to work, or rather in a way that's going to risk sinking the project. And so if you're good at what you do, then sometimes even the bad news can be good news.
That makes sense. So among the other things you did when you left Edge, you worked with Channel 4 for a while, a number of games aimed at teenagers. I guess these would be called educational games, but they were sort of, I feel like it was more of a part of a targeted sort of remit exercise.
What was that like?
It was incredible.
Channel 4 took a decision at that time to say, so Channel 4, publicly funded, has a remit to deliver material for the good of the nation. They focus on teenagers, I'm not up to date with their current policies, but this is certainly true of how they were operating at the time. They had a focus on teenagers.
The way that they had previously been working is to use the airtime that they had available for this kind of content, which tended to be weekday mornings to put out TV content or a TV channel. But they were realising more and more that that just didn't make any sense. Teenagers were not watching Channel 4 at 11am on a Tuesday, or kind of they shouldn't be.
And so at the time when I was involved, the channel took a huge brave step to say, no, what these kids are doing was playing games. So that's, if our remit is to have an impact on their life, that's where we should be. So they took their whole budget and put it into Interactive.
And then it is an educational remit, but they also tried to be providing something complementary to what the BBC was doing. The BBC does a huge amount of educational output and indeed a huge amount of educational games. And that's very curriculum focused.
So they're doing a lot of stuff to like help you learn French verbs and revise your physics homework. So Channel 4's focus was on, was much more on life skills. So suddenly you have this remit to make games that are about mental health and sexual health and managing money and all these kind of other like soft skill things, figuring out how to deal effectively with the pressures of social media, how to stay safe online, these kind of like vital skills that kids need to be taught, but that aren't covered by the curriculum.
And so we got to do an amazing project as well as some more historically based games. So yeah, these are things that you now can't play. They kind of thrive for a moment and then go.
But yeah, we did an incredible project called SuperMe that was about building mental health resilience and using these kind of incredible puzzle games and action games that were based in fairly heavyweight psychology research about the kind of mental patterns of reflection and kind of mental balance that kind of breed good brain hygiene and could we build games that would fight those kind of mental habits to grow in teenagers. Yeah, it was a really incredible time. And working with super cool game designers, we really did make a game that really did get released on the Xbox that really was set inside a diseased vagina.
It's still a point of great pride that a huge amount of sex education doesn't get conveyed. So I worked on an amazing game called Private that was about, it was a little squad action game about STDs that had so much educational content in it and was so unashamed of being like, hey, bodies exist and there are words that you can use that describe those bodies and sometimes people experience illnesses and we can talk about all of that without anybody's head exploding. Yeah, it was a wonderful project.
Classic 7 territory.
Yeah, I remember that getting a bit of buzz at the time actually. There was quite a few articles around about it. Obviously it hasn't been made, it's a shame it's no longer available, but yeah, like you say, a very cool thing to have worked on.
So you're also president of Game Design Studio Hide and Seek. You mentioned that earlier. In that time you worked on Sherlock Holmes and Sesame Street Games, among others.
Was it maybe even a Skyfall game you worked on as well? Is that right, Margaret? That's pretty awesome to read about.
And you moved to New York to set up their office there. So what was that whole period of your career like?
Super fascinating. So that was very, very much a bay, being a studio that was designing non-traditional video games. So we did do some kind of like traditional mobile games, but a lot of what we did was kind of games that crossed between platforms or crossed over into the real world.
So one of our biggest projects there was we ran a citywide street game across the whole of Edinburgh for one of their New Year's, New Year's Day celebrations. You know, we had kind of, it was a 12,000 player game. I ran a 5,000 person game of basketball in the grass market, if anybody knows Edinburgh, and nobody ended up in the hospital.
So that was cool. So yeah, we did a lot of physical based stuff, a lot of board game, tabletop based stuff. And then there are digital work, nearly always like kind of like crossover between elements.
So that Sherlock Holmes game was a, it was a really early Facebook game. It was a prequel to the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes movie. So the last five minutes of the game were the first five minutes of the film.
The film opens with Sherlock Holmes triumphantly solving a case. When you're watching the movie, you think that's just a snappy introduction to kind of like set up the characters. What the game did was explain all the detail about how that case got solved.
I strongly suggest you never make one of these. It was a real time, eight week, collaborative, two player detective game. So you joined the game, you did a personality assessment that assigned you to be either Holmes or Watson.
Then you had to pick from your Facebook friends, the friend that you thought would make the best partner. So if you were Holmes, which of your friends would be the best Watson? Which of your friends is the best Holmes?
Then over eight weeks, a case unfolded in real time that you were exploring a whole bunch of ways. This was a long time ago and we had AI chat bot interrogations. So if you were Holmes and you were interviewing suspects, you could just talk to them direct in a chat interface and get natural language responses back and try and get them to spill their secrets.
We had a bunch of action mini games because if you remember the Robert Downey Jr. this was the... Go Richie. These were the Go Richie, Sherlock Holmes films.
There was a lot of punching and shouting. Or a lot more punching and shouting than you would associate with Sherlock Holmes. And then we were also collaborating with the films.
So we were like filled a bunch of stuff on the sets and with the actors from the film, not with the leads, but with other actors. It was an incredible project, but yeah, a collaborative detective. So Holmes and Watson would see different evidence each week.
And then at the end of each week, you had to agree on a deduction and you would stake your reputation. You earned reputation points throughout the game for all the things you did. And you would wager your reputation on the deduction and then see how you did.
And that would change the events unfolded in the following week. So yeah, we did one of those. We did a very different project for Skyfall.
We designed an MI6 entrance test that would patch you in. If you wanted to apply to MI6, it would patch you in directly to an agent in the field who needed help. And again, we're using a bunch of AI chat related technology for that.
And you would talk them through missions and they would send you photos of like, hey, I'm peering out of an air vent and this is what I can see. What should I do next? And you would help them figure out.
That's so cool. Yeah, we made some very, very cool stuff and a very great team. So yeah, Alex Fleetwood founded that company.
I joined him in London soon after he got it started in London and then moved over to New York to found the New York office a couple years later. And then it was from New York that we ran things like the... Yeah, the Sesame Street Project grew out of a project that we did for street-based games where we would just paste huge...
With permission, we would paste huge stickers in specific locations around London suggesting games that you could play in that specific environment. Hey, somebody stand on that thing over there and then you could see this thing and then do that. And we'd invent all these rulesets that would turn to kind of make the city playable.
And then we started realizing that we could do that anywhere. So we had a project called Tiny Games where it was a mobile app where you could say, hey, the three of us were in a bar and we've got some straws, what's a game that we can play? Oh, there's two of us were in a train, what are some games that we can play?
And we would be able to generate a game for you in that environment. And the team at Sesame Street loved that idea and they were like, hey, could we do one but for three-year-olds? And then there started the toughest sequence of play tests I ever had to run in my game design career where you were trying to design these games for three-year-olds and testing them with three-year-olds who are unsparing in their criticism of what you're doing.
If it ain't fun, they are going to let you know right away. So yeah, I learned a lot from that audience.
Incredible array of stuff that you worked on there. You then worked for Dots in New York for many years while also working with NYU. It's pretty amazing as a post-games media career goes.
And now I guess I just picture you carrying your PS1 demo disc with you across to New York with you. But what was that period of your career like following Heidensee?
I mean, I was so excited to be in New York. The games scene, the games culture scene in New York is incredible. And NYU has definitely been a huge part of that.
So the game center department there was one of the first really heavyweight academic games centers. And so I worked for them as a long time as their industry liaison. So kind of trying to connect the larger games industry with the academic side of things.
And I helped run the NYU game incubator program for 10 years, which has been kind of enormously successful in championing, helping to fund very early projects and take them from student or hobbyist contexts into something releasable. So that was very cool. And then, yeah, DOTS was super, super lucky.
I arrived just after their... So two DOTS might be a game that you know, very, very aesthetically beautiful puzzle game. I arrived just after they released two DOTS itself and then was there for five or six years.
I was their first senior game design hire, so I kind of built the department there and ran their new product pipeline for most of my time there. So just iterating, eternally chasing the perfect puzzle game. The puzzle games are, they're so easy to dismiss, particularly from kind of like a serious game design perspective, but they are so demanding and so interesting and so deep.
I've worked for years and years and years on really nothing but games that were about manipulating and matching abstract shapes on a mobile phone screen and you'd think that it would get boring and it just absolutely didn't. There's just so much depth. I'm still fascinated by them.
My co-founder at Cabbage, a lot of what brought us together initially was a puzzle game, was Drop 7, speaking of Edge 10s, although it was a retroactive Edge 10. I don't know if you remember that. It was a super abstract puzzle game, very, very kind of restrained, but just basically perfect, just a thing that is a basically perfect puzzle game.
He'd worked on that, and I'd been amazed at just kind of the clarity and the purity and the insight that that puzzle game had. I still love working on them, I still love thinking about them. Dots was just years and years of getting to do that with a super talented team, amazing artists, a really, really kind of like lively prototyping environment.
You know, this is the excitement and the heartache of game development life. I worked on, I think, probably hundreds of prototypes there and certainly many, many, many dozens that don't see the light of day, that don't make the cut. And they're wonderful, but only you know about them.
And gradually over the years, you lose the ability to play them, servers get shut down, and you leave things behind when you move on. And so you just have to, you kind of have to live in the moment as much as possible and just enjoy getting to do, you know, getting to be that inventive on a daily basis.
I'm sure you learned an absolute ton from all of those prototypes. So yeah, definitely, definitely not wasted. I'm assuming that some finished products came out of that process.
Yeah, I did. I did a game called Dotson Co, which was kind of like a side sequel. And there's a rather lovely Apple Arcade title called, I think it ended up called Garden Tales.
We changed the name at the end, I mean, to get it right. I think some puzzle games can be a little bit kind of abrasive and high energy. And they, you know, they're kind of, I play a lot of Candy Crush, but the Candy Crush approach is to kind of like assault you with sparkling saccharin every millisecond.
And it's not necessarily very tranquil. So Garden Tales was deliberately a game designed to be about kind of beauty and spaciousness and nature and pleasure. And it's very, very lovely.
It released actually after I left Dots. So I don't get credit for the final quality of the product, all credit to the team who led it after I left. But that was one that they kicked off and has a special place in my heart.
So yeah, if you've got an Apple device, Garden Tales is worth a look.
Oh, that's awesome. That's one amazing thing to have worked on for sure. Thank you so much, Margaret, for talking about your career.
There's so much more I'd love to ask you if our time zones were more compatible. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I really appreciate it.
Where can people find you on various channels? Where can people play Fast Feud?
That's a good point. So if they followed Cabbage Systems, it's probably the simplest thing to do on Twitter or I think on threads. That's a good place to find us.
And then I am still sort of Ranarama on Twitter, although I think I got a little bit of a scramble with my Twitter account. I think someone pointed out to me, my name, just for the record, is Margaret Robertson. I know that's a thing we all know, but I'm just saying it.
Someone just pointed out to me a little while ago that if you write down Margaret Robertson as a one word, I have the word retro right there in the middle of my name.
Margaret Robertson, retro.
And I thought that was very cool. So I think my Twitter handle is currently Margaret underscore retro, which I thought was going to be super cool and now turns out to be incredibly clumsy and hard to communicate out loud. So apologies.
Cabbage Systems, easier to find and type.
I felt very like a very cursed individual reaching out to you on LinkedIn. That felt very wrong to me to ask someone to come on a podcast via LinkedIn. I feel like I'm putting the wrong foot forward here by messaging you on that platform.
So I will go and seek you out on other platforms. Thank you so much, Margaret. And Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
MrBuzzleHunderScorePesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts and the podcast can be followed at Back Page: Pod. We'll be back next week with a new episode.
Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone.
