Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and joined as ever by Matthew Castle.

Matthew
00:27
Hello.

Samuel
00:28
I forgot to say it's an XXL episode, Matthew, and uh absolutely fucked it. So yes, we're behind the paywall, and just in case you didn't think we were behind the paywall, that maybe, you know, something had gone horribly wrong, here's the sound. Of me opening a monster energy drink for a Sunday evening pod. I mean, here we are. It's all off the chain. Do you know what I nearly tried to do? A hum version of the madmen theme. to kick off this episode, but it's so fucking hard to do that theme tune in any kind of like hum version because it's like catchy but you can't really hum it. Y you know, you're a big theme tune guy. Where do you stand on the Mad Men theme tune?

Matthew
01:06
Yeah, I I like it. It's a a theme tune I will listen to. I don't skip the credits on Mad Men. There's a mournful element which is difficult to capture in a hum.

Samuel
01:15
Yeah, exactly. So I didn't bother doing that, and uh yes, here we are. Yeah, so why did we rewatch Mad Men Season 1 for an XXL episode? Well You know, I think it's one of the great TV shows to talk about and think about. And, you know, I I've I've discussed a show a bit in the past with Matthew, but not to any huge extent. But, you know, back when I was a um uh imagine and then you know some of the time I was at Future, uh, Mad Men was a huge part of my life and you know I watched tons of it read tons about it. In fact, you know, doing this episode reminded me of just how much there used to be more of a an active media landscape covering TV shows episode by episode. The idea of being in a conversation and now I don't feel like that really exists at all in the same way. Um just because media's been decimated or bought by bastards, whatever it might be. Um so yeah, I I did want to start by asking what was your relationship to Madam at the time, Matthew? It's not something we've discussed much on the podcast before. It has come up, but Did you ever watch it weekly? Was it a must-see for you?

Matthew
02:19
Series one I remember reading about but not watching it wherever it was broadcast. I don't even know where you could watch season one, but I BBC four baby. Okay. Well that's that's where that's where I watched the rest of it for sure. But I um got season one for Christmas. uh th the year the DVD came out of it and remember sitting up in my room uh in my old bedroom uh watching mad men on my laptop, uh like a real loner, being very antisocial that Christmas. and uh yeah, just kinda getting my head around it and working out what it was. Weird show to watch at Christmas 'cause it's you know, quite bleak in lots of ways where I thought it was just gonna be like a zany laugh right set in the world of advertising, which some of it is, but a lot of it isn't

Samuel
03:06
Yeah, it's a really interesting show. It is a drama set in the initially the 1950s, but primarily the 1960s, about this fictional ad agency, uh Sterling Cooper. And uh well I won't sp say anything about what happens in the later seasons, but things kind of evolve from there. And you know, the main character, it's this character, Don Draper, you don't really know much about him. As the show starts, you peel back more layers as you go. Um, but it's quietly an ensemble piece, so I don't ever quite think of this as just John Hamm show. There are so many different characters in the show that really give it this. This richness and the people feel very real and we'll we'll definitely talk about that a bit in this episode. And yeah, I I watched the um I remember exactly when. I saw the first adverts for it because it was being advertised in spring 2008 and I remember hearing about it just before I went on the Metal Gear Solid 4 review trip And I remember bringing it up at the table at dinner and being like, any of you see the the all the kind of slightly weird BBC advertorial bits for Mad Men? Because it had like interviews with the cast and Matthew Weiner and stuff, and I thought I I honestly thought it's BBC four, so it's probably a bunch of pretentious wank, but it does look quite quite um upscale. And, you know, I was really getting into prestige sort of TV at the time, that sort of high-end drama, watching HBO stuff, you know, watching the wire, what have you. But and um yeah, I sort of um I just gave it a go based on based on those out of curiosity, watched it on the initial run on um on BBC4. and thought it was great. It aired yeah basically a year later than it did in the US where it started in 2007. So from there ran for eight years, ended in 2015, so it's been off the F ten years now. Um yeah, it is a fixture of the likes of Prime Video and Netflix in the UK. The whole the entire series is is currently up on Netflix, so It's kind of become one of those TV staples, I think, and I will admit that in a landscape of TV that this year I think is just plainly not very good. I found it quite appealing to jump back into this um into this show, Matthew. So uh Uh what happened to you after season one? Did you watch it pretty regularly for the year?

Matthew
05:16
Yeah, I did, yeah. I yeah, I was just in on it then and and watching it uh as it as it broadcasts. I don't remember it there being any other people in the office who I was sort of friendly with who are super into it. Uh like I did it wasn't a show I talked about, it was just something I watched and enjoyed. Like I don't think you'll find a single madmen reference in like Endgamer or O and M or anything. Like it it just felt like uh obviously a thing I like. Um Yeah, it was yeah, kind of pri yeah, private. That makes it sound weird and salacious.

Samuel
05:50
Well, it's funny, I I only really had A couple of people I spoke to about in the office. Matt Handraham was definitely one of them. I guess he would have been he left Imagine in 2010, so I guess he would have been there for maybe the first three seasons. I remember talking about it with him because he was a massive like um fiend for good TV. Right. Just devoured good TV. And also um uh my boss uh on sci-fi now he later became one of the big bosses of Imagine and later one of the big bosses of future Huge Mad Men fan. Um really got hooked on it. And we both did the same thing where we watched it. I watched it on Monday mornings before work because it aired on Sunday in the US. I refused to pay for Sky to get it after it left BBC4. I thought, fuck that, you're not getting my money just to watch one show. And um watched it on like my iPad on some free TV online info illegal stream basically and just because I basically just didn't want to encounter encounter any spoilers in the wild. But you're right, this is never really a a big it was never Game of Thrones, was it? The Madman never had that following.

Matthew
06:52
I definitely had some friends outside of games magazines and journalism who said in maybe more like traditional forms of business who did note that like Don Drapo you know had become a bit of a cult figure and you began seeing sort of drapery kind of pictures in like ad sales meetings and things like this. Like I I think a certain tier of people really sort of associated with it in thought. Like didn't necessarily like So under unders I don't want to say I understood it on a surface level, you know, as if as if I, you know, um get it in some deeper way, but You know, if I think if you do come away from madmen just thinking, oh that guy's fucking cool and I should be more like him, um that's that's probably like a a bad lesson.

Samuel
07:40
Um it's sort of like one of the defining weird dynamics of the show, right? That it's it's like uh you know, it's about people doing terrible things, you know, you know, cheating and sort of drinking too much and m you know, m misbehaving in the workplace and all this kind of stuff. But it there's a fine line between glorification and you know it sort of like it criticizing those things and I could easily see why it'd be misinterpreted, you know?

Matthew
08:07
Yeah, I I I just think a lot of people watch like you know, the carousel pitch at the end of the season and thought, oh, I should pitch like that. And it looks yeah, I a very clear memory of a of a friend saying like Oh, I've uh you know since Mad Men started I've been in some pictures for things and you realise that they're trying to do like a bit of a Don Draper in the meeting and it's absolutely mortifying.

Samuel
08:32
That's just so cringe. Um yeah, I mean it's the idea of uh yeah, I think um it's it does have a very mannered way of presenting its the the in universe ads that they do pitch and You know, I've I've worked with a lot of like ad salesy people who you know, some of them are good and some of them know what to pitch, but a lot of the time they don't really know the subject as well as you might as the editor working on the magazine. And so yeah, I mean, I remember like uh just some of the things you would get pitched, you know, that where there was like no editorial ins oversight whatsoever or oversight from people who understand what the subject is would just be the most blue sky kind of nonsense. And then if it got sold, you'd be like, how on earth are we gonna do this terrible thing? That is suddenly like my problem and it's been dropped on me. And Yeah, I could see uh uh kind of like there's enough vacuous people who work in ads that I could absolutely see that being like uh devastating, the impact of that. That's quite funny. It's an interesting show. I mean I when I started watching it Oh actually I want to ask you this first, but like how many of the actors in this show did you recognize when you started watching Mad Men? Because it is a show that has made so many careers.

Matthew
09:47
Yeah, I knew January Jones from uh three burials of Milkita's Estrada, the Tommy Lee Jones sort of modern Western, which I really like. It's a great film. And uh I think that was sort of her big breakout film role, so I I I knew her from that. But aside from that, it's it's really just like the occasional guest star. who turns up like someone who comes in as as like one of the clients or, you know, one of the rival businessmen. You know, there's a lot of like, oh, it's that guy from that thing. Um I think uh Lee Garnor, the the head of Lucky Tri Lucky Strike Cigarettes, is um like one of the main characters from Northern Exposure, Holling. Um so whenever he turns up I'm like, oh there he is selling cigarettes, that's weird. Um But yeah, outside of that it was a real like Yeah, I didn't know who any of these people are. I know um What is Chops was in Angel, but I hadn't watched enough of Angel for that to be like a thing for me.

Samuel
10:47
Yeah, Vincent Carthaizer plays Pete Campbell. He yeah, he played Angel's Son in season three of that show and You know, really interesting because he was a he was a very hated character, Connor. Um he was, you know, like uh basically welded into the show. There was a a bunch of plot mac machinations that went down to make him be in the show and then he was like a total shit, the character in the show. And so I found it kind of perfect that they tapped into like what seems to be like a fundamental lack of likability to, you know, the persona he puts on screen. He's a good looking guy and like, you know, he's he's ran into some like trouble uh quote unquote in the last few years I will say if you read about um working on the TV show Titans, I have no real comment. I interviewed him once. And he was extremely affable. And I was like, wow, you are so different to this character. Yet there is a commonality between Connor and Pete Campbell that they are just the most Uh just characters you can't help but hate on some level. Well absolutely like petulant, you know. Yeah, absolutely. Just this childish energy, even when he's in his 30s making this, you know. So that's interesting. Um, I did recognize Christina Hendricks from Firefly. Um, she plays The woman who Mal Reynolds accidentally marries when he's drunk, but turns out to be, oh, is she called like Saffron or something? Um kind of name like that. Yeah, she's in like two episodes of Firefly. So but she's sort of like I would say in the universe, I would say that she's just like She jumps out more in the in the in this show. Just somehow they styled her. Um she styled very differently in Firefly. Um but yeah, in in this show, you know, obviously with Joan, there's a uh you know, that character kind of becomes her own sort of fashion influence, you know, and like a big talking point of the show. Um so yeah that That was about it. Like um it was to the show I oh wait, I'd seen I don't remember that show um Ed with Tom Kavanaugh that used to be on Channel Four. I'd seen John Slattery in like one episode of that when I was off sick, like years earlier from school. And that's the only time I'd ever seen that dude. Um and so, yeah. And then John Ham, no, never seen him in anything. He was like complete, a complete blank canvas to me. But the reason I wanted to ask this is I think that Is to the show's benefit. Like it it does you don't really come into the show with all these preconceived notions of an on-screen persona for all these people. They are, you know, it it's fun to get to discover who all these actors are. Did you get that feeling when you watched it?

Matthew
13:22
Yeah, but I I would say th that's true of like a lot of these prestige shows, you know, in that they just become those characters 'cause you don't you don't bring any kind of baggage into it. You know, outside of like Maybe like Ian McShane and Deadwood. You know, most of these you know, of this period, most of these actors were made in the in these shows.

Samuel
13:45
Um the wire is very similar.

Matthew
13:47
Yeah, and kinda like launches them. So yeah, I it it it definitely helps. I wonder if there's an element of like casting people who look sixties appropriate as well. Like y you don't want like modern celebrities who are already kind of famous in the modern age 'cause it's probably hard to to, you know, take them in that environment and put it in put them in this this place and the sort of authenticity of the look of the show is is like one of the highlights.

Samuel
14:15
So who is the most famous person who ever joins the cast of this because or like who is the most famous upon joining the show, the most well known because I wonder if it's Harry Hamlin who's it who's one of the ads partners of a different agency later in the show because I I knew him from Veronica Mars. I knew him from that joke in Arrested Development because he's from an he's on I think he's in Boston Legal or some show like that from back in the day. But is there anyone more famous than that coming into this?

Matthew
14:46
Probably not. I can think of. Um I'm trying to think about some of the the the the women that um Don has affairs with over the years if any of them were sort of semi-famous in their own right, but Yeah, not really.

Samuel
15:03
I think they all kind of pick it again.

Matthew
15:05
Because Maggie's new being like billions. And so now she seems very like familiar to me, but she wasn't at the time.

Samuel
15:12
And she was in um Sons of Anarchy as well, right, after this. So yeah. And yeah, it's same with the um uh Faye in season four who becomes the um I don't want to say I'm just gonna say the hot mum in Stranger Things. People know who I'm talking about. The non-win owner rider hot mum. Yeah

Matthew
15:30
But she has different I think she has maybe her hair colour is the same actually, but I made a um f for one of my secret Santa's one year for someone in the office, I made them a personalized mug which was just covered in pictures of the mum from Stranger Things 'cause they look They like that character. I won't name and shame who it is.

Samuel
15:48
That's very good of you. Um yeah, so I think that help that helps. But you are right, actually that is it does have that in common with other shows at the time. Um but I think it particularly helps when you're making a period piece because You don't want to be sat there thinking that's um that's uh just a really random example, but um oh that's William Peterson. um from CSI but in the past. You know what I mean? Like with slicked back hair. Like I don't you know what I mean? Like he d when someone has that much baggage. You can or like that's Hugh Laurie, you know, just oh ha house ended early so he joined Mad Men. Like it's At a certain point I think it can take you out of it, but if you can anonymize the characters somewhat, I think it helps with placing them in the nineteen sixties. I guess actually while this was on Alison Bree, who plays Pete Campbell's wife Trudy, probably the best known from like something else, because community was on at the same time, and she was like doing double duty on this and that. And so That was, you know, it was kind of that was kind of surreal seeing her on that because you didn't really there's no other character from this show who like was on another show at the time, really. But um yeah. Um, so here's a key question, Matthew. How do you think Mad Men Season 1 holds up now? Really, really well.

Matthew
16:56
Better than I remembered it, so I should say I I hadn't re-watched season one. uh since seeing it originally when when we did our madmen rewatch I actually joined Catherine towards the end of season three. Um and 'cause in my head I remembered this being like a a bit m a bit bleak or I only really remembered the unhappy times and I didn't really have any interest in seeing that. And actually it was a good reminder of how much of like the the show's all round DNA is in there that these are troubled times and troubled characters, but it also has a lot of the workplace drama that I enjoy, has a lot of the humor, a lot of these characters are already like, you know, their sort of final selves out the gate, which is which is quite exciting to see. And That I didn't remember, so it was a a real pleasant surprise. Like I'm pretty sure I've said on the pod before, like, you know, I prefer the the later seasons of Mad Men, but I don't know if that's actually true. uh having re-watched this, I thought, oh no, this is this is really good. Um I just think there's like a timelessness to it, uh probably because of the 6D setting. Um uh that helps. I think it's also a show that you're gonna relate to it quite differently depending on like where you are in your life. And watching this as a Very underpaid staff writer with like no commitments. Uh y you can't really relate to anyone in the show at all. Like, they all seem a w world away from you or like powerful or successful, even though within their business there are you know, the executives and then there are the kind of lower people who are sort of striving to kind of get a to to kind of climb the ladder. Um but if you I think if you just watch it when you are a bit older y I think you can maybe appreciate some of the family stuff, some of the work pressure stuff, some of the sort of ideas about how these characters carry themselves. Um Yeah, I mean that it's not like a shocking revelation that a twenty-three-year-old and a twenty and a forty-year-old are gonna s see different things in this, but I th I thought it was like particularly rich for that. Um Because it is so much about, you know, very relatable things. Much more relatable than like you're a cowboy on the frontier or a mob boss, you know? It's yeah it's like how how do yeah, and it's interesting. Like I I I think really the the m the major split between like your professional self and your private self and uh you know, how you can be very successful at one and fuck up in the other, you know, or vice versa. I think that's I think that's really interesting.

Samuel
19:37
Yeah, also the idea of accumulating par like a past and then the past becoming this like great weight, you know? where the the consequence of your decisions kind of carries around with you. You definitely need to be on this planet for a few decades before you you have anything approaching that really. Um You know, not that I stole a man's uh, you know, sort of identity in the Korean War or anything, but I mean everyone has some some version of that. You know, everyone's everyone goes through a lot in their adult lives and Everyone makes mistakes and everyone makes good decisions and like you say everyone has that push and pull between work life and home life. Um I would say when I first watched it I did lock into Both the Peggy character and the Pete Campbell character who are young and ambitious, you know, doing different jobs. Peggy is a uh you know a copywriter so pitching ads and then pete is basically an account manager and so he's managing the relationships with clients and The show is very good at kind of making you understand how those two things work in step with each other so it doesn't bog you down in in mechanics, but you sort of organically pick up how the business of Sterling Cooper works and how you know uh and how like uh as a woman in the sixties, Peggy's opportunities are scant and so when she gets them she really has to take them. um in order to stand out. And for Pete, he feels like he's never really getting the you know, he's never really has the trust to be given the opportunity to take big shots or to show what he can do creatively. That's his frustration, is that creatively he cannot, you know, he cannot uh participate in in the copywriting work, which is what he actually wants to do. a stuck managing relationships with clients, which he doesn't think he's very good at and he's perhaps not very good at in this first season. Um so, you know, I definitely And John Ham was so old John Hamm seemed um so old to me when I first watched this and it's funny because he is like the most late thirties looking man of all time because he's got that permanent stubble, you know, that permanent sh sort of shadow. But Yeah, it's um I think it's really, really stronger to rewatch. And I hope for the I hope this wasn't too niche to drag the listeners through, but I think this show, I thought this was like a mega prestigie thing when I first watched it. And it is extremely well made and still looks amazing. Like you say, it's timeless. But It's also very, very entertaining. Even though all the things that happen in the plot are not like, you know, what a another TV show's plot twist would be, like a train crash or something like that. It's It's much more, you know, it's it's a much smaller show in that regard. It's got about two seasons worth of plot in this first season. A lot happens. Um, it's so meticulously planned out. Some episode the episodes are all still pretty standalone and exceptional at doing so, but the the wider picture it builds up is also very successful. It's like a Proper five-star bit of TV. Yeah, so very entertaining. Phone automatically down during this and the 13 episodes pass like, you know, nobody's business really. Um So I do want to ask you about the wider cast of very distinct characters in this, Matthew, because I actually would like to know who some of your favorites are. Um some actors who have very minor roles in this season become so much more in later years. Why do you think this show is better than arguably all others at developing an ensemble?

Matthew
23:03
Uh I mean it is like impeccably cast, but to a level where You imagine there was like a huge amount of temptation to give like every character their shot? Like there's so much potential in everyone. like not just the characters as written, but who plays them, like the look of them, the w the weird sly humour that emerges from them and uh you know, watching this season, knowing where they do take those characters and who that they sort of drill down into and who they kind of humiliate and who they lift up. Uh y you can just see like Like w that just have the most amazing collection of sort of toys to play with. Um that really helps. Um I just thought I I also think It does help that it is about a workplace and I think the nature of a workplace, like the rhythm of an office and how it works and how clean weeks work and how the people you directly work with changes based on the things that you're working on. Like that that is just a very good like breeding ground for uh for an ensemble drama in terms of like being able to match up all these different characters, just on a technical level. Like if there's a if they want to put together like anyone in that office, they sort of can find a reason to and it all feels quite natural. Um and like working in an office as well. Like the characters do change, you know, when you i in real life when you're when you're in an office, like b big people, you know, big personalities can enter your lives and people can change and as people's fortunes in their professional life changes that can impact their personalities. And I think it draws on all that so it seems super relatable. Um, you know, working in games magazines was nothing like working at this advertising company, but th there are some like core truths of like what happens if thirty people are on a floor together. Um and that's stuff I I've yeah, I really kind of clicked with.

Samuel
25:01
If they if they are discovering what to do with the different characters, it's very well hidden. It does it only a few of them do you really sense that You know, this was like a background character who just took over the show a little bit. But there's even characters who are just like a memorable face who who you know will have a very significant role in like one scene. um like years down the line, but they might just be a secretary in the office in this season, you know? But you can see the writers developing some kind of like you know, uh sort of some thoughts about who that character is and and then like finding ways later on to plug them back in, you know?

Matthew
25:39
Yeah. That that episode where they have the big office party, that's that's so good for that all that kind of character work. 'Cause you can see them suddenly going, Oh shit, we've actually got like twenty quite interesting people here. Like even the big players, like everyone does something kinda weird in that scene. And you know, whether they're directly involved in in the the interactions or just like a background artist looking on in sort of shock or or kind of like ging someone up to do something terrible. Uh I I I thought that was that was so good.

Samuel
26:10
I love that about it. It's just some c there's some characters who you might only relate to for one specific reason, but Don Draper is the only one who really feels like a total alien in this or I say that like Roger Sterling as well um you know one of the co-owners of the agency feels like a slightly more heightened kind of character as opposed to like a real person you might work with in the office. Like he's a he's a little bit You know, he's sort of a a showman. You know, he li he just likes showing off in meetings or in any sort of situation. He likes having a drink, he likes having fun. Um I wouldn't say I've ever met anyone who really resembles someone with that exact energy. Right. Um Burt Cooper as well, the other owner of the agency is just so eccentric. It's almost kind of like it's so unlikely you'd meet anyone like that in the in the real world. Um so there are c some characters like that, but yeah, definitely I agree that party scene shows you just how how broad the ensemble is, how many of them are great, and how even These characters who just have maybe like two scenes in episode just completely stick their their faces stick in your brain. So really successful in that respect. Um how do you think that season one compares to later seasons of the show, Matthew?

Matthew
27:21
Yes, I'm so like I said I I I am really fond of the later seasons. I think from uh you know, if you're interested in like the success of the business, which is like quite you know, it isn't really what Mad Men's about, but i i it is a plot line, like the the the fortunes of this ad agency. you know, because of of sort of what happens uh, you know, after season three where the show goes in a slightly different direction. I I just enjoy I enjoyed the kind of nuts and bolts of the workplace um a little bit more then. Um but uh it's I th and I I just think because we spent like four seasons in that mode It's it's kind of overwritten some of my memories of this because that's that's really what the pleasure of doing this episode was. It was like reminding myself of Oh actually th there were all these characters in this office. You know, it didn't just become this this office sort of drama and environment didn't just kick off in season four. Like it it's all here, just in a slight a slightly different mode. Um you know, uh characters change. I I I don't know. I feel like there's maybe uh like this sets up a lot of like relationships which I you know, I just like how they come to sort of fruition in in in the later seasons. Um you know, I I really like what happens with Peggy, you know, I really like sort of Peggy and Don's professional relationship as it matures. Like early on, it's f it's fun seeing it spark off and it's fun seeing the early beginnings, but that becomes like one of the richest things in the show. Like weirdly, when I was watching this, like My memory of Mad Men was that it kind of was a show about Don and Peggy. Through like that was the major through line. And Peggy's definitely like a a a big character in season one, but not not in the way that I remember. And and likewise, uh it's it's kind of more of a Don and Pete show season one. Um which is not at all how I remember it. Uh so yeah, i it wa It's just I don't know, it's all good, is my uh quite vanilla tape.

Samuel
29:35
Yeah, I think um so I I adore season one and I think it's got some of the show's best ever episodes in it because I think this is the season where Matthew Weiner is treating it like he's doing John Cheever short stories. And so there'll just be like an a self-contained arc for a character within an episode. I'm not saying that later seasons don't do this, but I think it becomes more densely serialized and knotty and characters have fewer sort of side quests, you know? Um not necess not necessarily always the case, but I think this very pronounced in this season when there's an episode with like a Betty spotlight, you know, or or a Peggy spotlight or a Pete spotlight. And it kind of rotates and yes, I think just some some all time great character moments are in this um in this first season and they often punctuate episodes that just focus on that one character or mostly focus on that one character. So Yeah, I I love that about it, and I think that you know one, two, three are kind of a set. I think I thought the show was the best TV show I'd ever seen up until the end of season four. And then There's I think season four is when there's like quite a long gap between f I think there's like almost two years where it's off the air. Right. And There's quite a lot of behind the scenes rumblings about how The Walking Dead had its budget cut because AMC had to pay X amount of money to the to air madmen and like they had to have fewer ads because Matthew Weiner demanded it or s there's like all this kind of like behind the scenes drama. It's almost two years where it's not on. And then when it comes back it's still really good and I still watch it every week, but I definitely remember having my phone out in the last two seasons. Oh, okay. In a way that I n I never did in the first the first four. It just became I watched it every week at the same time, but it became a little bit less essential to me. And be curious to see how I I find that on a rewatch. It's no real slight against the later seasons in the sense that They're re they're always really good at introducing new characters. There's never really a blocker in Mad Men, you know? There's never a kind of like, what's that guy doing here? And when there is, it becomes like the subject of intense fan scrutiny and discussion, like the character Bob Benson in later seasons, for example, who is a kind of a Bob one of the all-time great memes that came out of this show. Um but a character who, you know, you don't know exactly what his deal is and the the layers that always peel back of these characters until you do finally understand who they are and it's there's a very complete vision for who they are.

Matthew
32:10
Um I think that i in those later seasons though you also get the sort of like You know, wouldn't it be funny if we shot this character's eye out? And those kind of swings. I just I respond very positively to to that kind of nonsense in shows. uh where you're like, how do we move this character along? They've got an eye patch, that'll do. Um And he's gonna do a dance in the middle of the office. That that stuff I'm into. I I thought the first season was uh way more sopranosy than I remember. Uh in terms of because Don is still at like still at home a lot and has a home life It feels like it's a show of you know, that is more about, you know, if you do this for a living and but this is you have this troubled home life and how these two things relate, which is kind of the whole Sopranos pitch, is like, what does a mobster do when he gets home? You know, where this is like, what does a guy who sells the American Dream do when he gets home to less than the American Dream? And There they were just uh it's a broad observation. Anytime they're in the back garden of the or the garden of the Draper house, this is just pure sopranos, this show. Like the a mobster in his garden and Don Draper in his garden, like it looks really unnatural to see him out there ever. Um Like it just doesn't belong. And all the weird stuff that happens out there with like Betty and the birds, that's like very, very soprano coded as well. Uh and it definitely loses that as it goes on, that that particular thread. I mean, partly out of necessity because that home life, you know is upset in certain ways. So um yeah, I just yeah, that I mean maybe that's just cause I happen to have done a Sopranos rewatch more recently and that was on my mind. So

Samuel
34:06
Well, I watched the first two seasons of the Sopranos. I can't I can see that. I mean, you know, Matthew Weiner, it's worth pointing out, was a writer on the Sopranos. It's how he it's one of the uh the big breaks he got. Before that I believe he was a s a writer on the TV show Becker with Ted Danson, Matthew, which uh I'm j I know you're a big Becker guy, huge Becker guy. When's your Is the Becker Rewatch gonna follow the Fraser Rewatch? Following the two? I've I've never watched Becker. I I couldn't even tell you what Becker. Is he a doctor? He's like I he's basically Dr. House, I think. He's just a quite grumpy psychologist or something. But it's a odd fit for Ted Danson's persona, I remember thinking. It wasn't quite wasn't quite right. Um another one that I caught uh much like Ed with Tom Kavanaugh on um Channel 4 on a probably a pretend sick day when I was in year ten or something. Um yeah so that's that's probably true. I think that It does the show does get a little bit more focused on the work life. Like you say, the the fortunes of the company is a major part of the show. It's a it's a it's sort of like a more objective plot-based reason to be invested as opposed to an emotional one. You know? Even though it does obviously affect the emotions of the characters. Um but yeah, I remember that definitely. Definitely around the sort of season three, season four time. That in particular, that was like a hu definitely number one in my head is this is what the show is about right now. And then It sort of shifts focus back to the characters, I think, a little bit more after that. Though the that's always still a part of the plot for sure. Um Yeah, I so I I mean you may not agree with this. Why don't we have any returning shows as as good as this on TV now, Matthew? What happened to this? What happened to this? What happened to fucking succession? What happened to Barry? What happened to all these five-star shows? Better Cause all Breaking Bad Where the fuck happened to TV? Why is TV so shit now? Go.

Matthew
35:57
I mean I still like TV. Like I it's primarily out you know, after games the thing I consume more TV than I do film. We watch loads of it. Maybe not all of it is a lot of it isn't isn't five-star TV. L Uh what's happened? I mean obviously you know, not just streaming, but the the nature of of like attention spans on streaming and you know there's more and more being written about the kind of underlying style of streaming shows, you know, how that they're meant to sort of consider themselves sort of background noise rather than TV shows you lean into Um, that's a huge difference. Like the prestige TV shows or this prestige era felt like they kind of demanded your attention. Like you couldn't have your phone. You had to really like you know, the plots moved there were a lot of characters, there was a lot going on, they were often set in worlds that didn't fully explain themselves. I think those shows d still do exist. There's just not as many of them and this may be not like a couple of gold standards at the moment for us to lean on. I think where I differ is that I think like there has been like this emergence of Like the mini series or the self-contained series where a lot of good stuff is done. Like maybe the the the sort of devil's bargain is you can get these amazing actors who used to be in films. but they'll only do one season. So you end up with like, you know, one of the best TV shows this year, you know, unless it really shits the bed, is gonna be that task. TV show and that feels like it's six episodes by necessity because it's got Mark Ruffalo in it and you know that that's gonna like limit how much time you can actually make the thing. That's where TV's getting quite good is that and anthology shows I guess are pretty good. Um I think there's lots of good TV still, but it is drowned out by just how much fucking TV there is. Um and so much of it. Like the Netflix show are just like they're designed to be quite inoffensive, like three star shows. And that's that's a that's a huge bummer.

Samuel
38:00
Yeah, I mean you know Adolescence is an absolute standout mini-series from this year. And I'll definitely check Task out because it looks like Trad HBO in the way that HBO sort of stopped looking like stopped making shows like that in recent years um as its own streaming platform has become a big deal as its own its own CEO seems like a rather a strange chap um when you read about him and I I've seen so much like stuff written about that guy and I don't care about him whatsoever, but there is a correlation between he runs Warner Brothers and HBO makes fewer good shows. That's just a a fact. Right. Um so and then I think that Yeah, like it feels like the number of miniseries is still scant. Maybe it's two or three shows like that a year, if you're if you're very lucky. And yeah, I think that's fair. But it's just sort of like there was just um You know, there are quite a few shows like this i in this sort of time window. Mad Men's one of the ones that really kicks it off. The Sopranos is definitely the starting point, but F through the end of the noughties into the early 2010s, it feels like this was the the template in some ways, you know. Um and uh you know, while very few of them got to the got to these heights, some of them did and it was it was it just seemed like it was a a slightly better age for T V than than it is now, you know? Um you know, where it's like it's franchise shows, Taylor Sheridan shows or, you know, like the even Nick Santora who is one of the s Sopranos writers like Matthew Wyner, he's the sh creative Reacher, you know Reacher is like a I think a good version of what it is, but it what it is is old TV with a bit of you know modern sort of like streaming service budget and sheen to it, you know? So Yeah, but uh yeah.

Matthew
39:45
Anyway, doesn't stop me from watching fucking three hours of TV any or whatever it is.

Samuel
39:50
Well as long as you're enjoying yourself, I'm I'm happy with that. Um but anyway, I just sort of felt that a bit watching this. I was like, oh, when was the last time I could watch a show and just feel like I I would organically put my phone down and not be desperate for it to end, which is how I felt watching episode two of Alien Earth the other day. Um but anyway. Um so Matthew Weiner is a complicated figure, Matthew. Um I have no intention of trying to re-cancel him here um but I will say if you go and read about I don't know, it's always under personal life on Wikipedia, isn't it? The thing that they can cancel for. Um but in this case um it involves another of his writers and something he allegedly said to that writer that caused her to leave Working in Hollywood and so I will definitely mention that. Um and also say that he seems to be a complicated man more generally. Um because There is recently a piece from um actress uh Zosiah Mammoth, who is in the show Girls, um, who is in a few episodes of Mad Men, but Not that many. However, she did leave a bit of an impression, not least because I think she's one of the most distinctive looking actors in Hollywood. Like you'll recognise her her face instantly when you see her, I would say. Um And he just sounded like uh it's she does not name him, but it's largely speculated based on a scene she mentions in the story, um, lining up with the show, of a creator of a show screaming at her over the way she handled an envelope and just seeming like there was a culture of people being complicit in allowing that to happen or They expected that sort of behavior from this creator. And let's say it is Matthew Weiner. He's a Oh we I think we're uh we're just about covered. This would cap the this would get through legal at future net. com Matthew. Um He his worst creative instincts also seem to win out when he made the Roman offs for Amazon, which is considered one of the TV vanity project bombs of the last few years. But I guess I just wanted to talk about him a little bit, because I do think that he is the reason this show is really good, but I also wonder if what this show is. tied to its setting is so specific that maybe he's maybe it's not as simple as like you take him out of this and he makes something else and it's immediately as good as Mad Men, you know what I mean?

Matthew
42:03
It's interesting that you know Mad Men is about you know, c compromised people who are brilliant at their jobs. And uh i like I you know, you don't want to say like, well it has to come from somewhere or wow, the reason it really nails that is because This is like true to the creator, um, even though it does you know it it sort of sounds that way from what people say. Um yeah, I mean I I I I f I found all this stuff to be a massive bummer. Um like not just for the like people impacted directly, like you know, the the writers and you know actors lower down the food chain than this, but y you know, it just paints a picture of like i it has to be tolerated by like a lot of talent. Uh and that's kinda you know, they're they're uh they're quite a like they seem like quite a cool bunch. Uh and the idea of like st standing there while this guy like bellows in someone's face and not being like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you know uh that that's that's kind of I don't know. You know It's a shame, innit? It's a shame. Yeah, I d I don't think it I don't think it like massively dents this. This isn't like a you know, I don't s I don't struggle with enjoying Mad Men uh like as a result because I think perhaps because it is about like I say, you know s some like quite ugly characters. Uh I think it'd be different if it was if it was just like a fun time. Wasn't everyone wasn't the sixties cool, but it isn't that, you know, it is is quite a sort of challenging, messed up show. Like it's m one of the more unpleasant collections of characters that you sort of love.

Samuel
43:46
Um so yeah yeah, I never watched Romanovs either, so I heard it had one absolutely killer episode. And that's the episode that's got, I think got Christina Hendricks in it. That's apparently like amazing. And I know someone who watched all the other episodes and she said they were fucking terrible, but that one episode, because that is an anthology show. Right. That one episode is apparently excellent. So um yeah. Um I don't watch it either, you know.

Matthew
44:11
Yeah, I mean you could say, oh, it's telling that he hasn't like you know, made another great TV show after Mad Men, but then th that might also be it's very hard to make TV shows anymore uh in that mold so maybe that's what happened. You know, may if if you you know you're not gonna make something that's compromised, so you don't make anything at all. But then I don't know. You see like um who's the better core soul? Um The guy who was on X Files as well. Um Vince Gil again like He seems extremely good vibes and just seems to be making a a good TV show after good TV show and imagine his next one will be amazing too. So you know, it doesn't have to be the way.

Samuel
44:51
No. And it m it just makes you wonder if I don't know, like um it's easy to say that he's cancelled and he's not working because he was cancelled. And, you know, I would say that by what I understand the definition of cancelled to be, he is. But It might also be that if he's maybe not fun to work with, and I'm just sh purely speculating here, why wouldn't you work with someone like Vince Gilligan who is demonstrably pretty chill dude? Quite fun to work with, had a great guest appearance in community season five. You know, it's sort of um yeah, I I definitely agree with you on that.

Matthew
45:25
I'm very much the Vince Gilligan of Games magazine editors. Am I the Matthew Weiner of Video Game Magazine?

Samuel
45:32
You're the Damon Lindelof. Oh, that reminds me of the oh god, that's not good either. Um after reading that lost piece a couple of years ago. Um No, that that reminds me of something I I saw um the comic book writer Matt Fraction posting about, which I think is is always the thought that swims the s uh top of my brain when I'm thinking about madmen, which is that Everyone who thinks they're Don Draper is actually Pete Campbell. And it's true for so many people you meet in life, you know? And Um and I it's fun it's funny because I definitely identify with Pete Campbell more than any other character in this show. Like always. Like how petulant he is, how sort of wounded he is over the most pathetic nonsense. I'm definitely like not as big a shit as as big a shit as him in the workplace. In fact I most people would say I'm quite a good hang in the workplace I think. Now people in the Discord may not feel that way, but that's different. That's not that's not work. That's my spare time. Um and I have to read it. So, you know, it's a slightly different paradigm. But yeah, I don't know.

Matthew
46:34
I that's a I just think that's kinda true.

Samuel
46:36
Do you know what I mean? Like this I think there's a lot of guys who thought they were Don Draper after the show came out. But there's something just real about Pete Campbell, you know?

Matthew
46:44
Yeah. I think I had the good grace to watch this and go, like, if I'm lucky on Paul Paul Kinsey. Paul Kinsey. A bit shlubby, kind of Drops the drops the occasional like seems to be quite a good hanging in the office, quite good at banter. Um yeah, like not too powerful, won't ever be powerful That's that sounds about right.

Samuel
47:07
Did you get with Joan once?

Matthew
47:08
Do you have a version of that Matthew? Absolutely not.

Samuel
47:12
Um that's the other thing actually is that you know you mentioned the the magazine kind of um w way you go into this of thinking about the show I guess is that those you know those those guys um uh yeah so uh you've got basically like a group of guys are about About the same age. It suggested they all came into the Sterling Cooper about the same time. So you have Harry, who's like an accounts man who becomes wait, no, he is he's a creative guy, isn't he? He becomes a TV creative guy in later seasons and a little bit in this season you've got Paul Kinsey who is like a big big writer nerd Sort of writes his own screenplays, watches the Twilight Zone. That's a key feature of like one episode. Um you've got uh why have I gone not broken all these names down? Ken Cosgrove, who You know, it's played by Aaron Staten, who is immortalized in you know in Ellie Noir as um why have I forgotten his name? Fuck's sake. Gonna have five hours sleep, Matthew. Who is the guy in Ellie Noir again? Yeah, Phelps. Yeah, Cole Phelps. Um and then you have is that everyone actually? I think I say called Gown, they're sort of Salvatore Artist. Yeah, not quite in the same group, but there's something just sort of like You know, it's it it because the time the time frame in the office politics is definitely like tips over into misogyny and mischief, I would say. Um but like um there's something about those guys interacting that feels very magazine y, you know what I mean?

Matthew
48:41
If one of those guys went on to start a podcast, the others would definitely all appear as guests at some point. Out of those guys

Samuel
48:48
The Harry guy is definitely the podcast creator, I would say. Like he's he's apparently I I've uh old friend of mine said that she met him at like some board game panel at a board game expo, and I was like, yeah, definite podcast material. Obviously Obviously he is best known for in video game circles for being in Firewatch as well. He's the main character in that. Um I have not written down his name. Is it Michael Gladys? Is he that guy? Um or is that actually that might be Paul Kinsey. God I'm bad at this. Should have written down more names for it.

Matthew
49:14
The actor uh no, it's isn't it ha isn't it S Rich Sommer?

Samuel
49:18
Yes, well done. Well remembered Obviously all of these motherfuckers in Ellen Noir as well because um that is the magic of Elinoir. It and madmen are you know inextric Inextricably linked.

Matthew
49:28
So uh They're all in there accused of like burning down a deli or something. And then pursing their lips when you accuse them of burning down a deli.

Samuel
49:38
Me The most confusing one is when Pete Campbell turns up in overalls and he's a DIY man or something, and you're like, I don't think so. That doesn't quite fit. Um I do love that about Ellen Noir, but um yes, it's Funny just how season two of Mad Men Coded Ali Noir is. Um and final thing I wanted to ask you, Matthew, before we get into discussing some of the episodes in more detail. Um because I think we've avoided spoilers quite well here. So I would hope that anyone who and I'll put this in the episode description, but anyone who's not rewatched Mad Men for this episode, you can see that too much homework. Completely fair. I would hope that this first hour at least holds together as a kind of like remembering what the show is like without spoiling too much. Um I did want to ask you how you think Don ranks in the Prestige TV bastards top five, Matthew. Did did you have you made a list? I have made a list, yeah. So have I. Should we start with our number fives? Yeah, well I've actually put Don Draper at five. Ah, so he's he's he's my number four higher on my list. He's the number four. I kick off with Kevin Garvey from The Leftovers, who is not quite as bad as Don Draper. Didn't steal a man's identity. did cheat on his partner and gets into some other Oh does he kill a guy? I think he does actually. Yeah he kills that woman. Maybe he should be higher on this list actually, but he's my number five. Who's your number four?

Matthew
50:58
My number four uh is Walter White. Higher on my list. Oh Jesus Christ. Absolutely parody.

Samuel
51:04
Yeah. Um what's your number three? Logan Roy. Oh I put oh shit, that's a good shout. I put a string of bell here actually.

Matthew
51:11
Um I I put Logan Roy here because It's hard a lot of these characters you you're weighing up like have they killed someone against like all the other stuff they've done Yeah. That's why I put Don Draper low. It's like he technically hasn't killed anyone. I'd say he's a moral, not evil, uh, and also impressive professionally. That's like the pro Well, Walter White, I my my notes read, justifiably angry, but channels it into evil. And becomes more evil, does more and more bad things. He's quite unpleasant by then. The thing about Logan Roy is he doesn't have the He doesn't have the good hang defense. Like he's quite a charmless man. He's not he's never hurt anyone, but he's a sh he's shitty. He's a terrible dad. And he isn't like good to hang around with because he's just so angry the whole time.

Samuel
52:01
Yeah, he's a man who's been allowed to Uh but to Fester because no one can ever tell him no. So every every shitty impulse.

Matthew
52:10
I think a lot of these people you you're always thinking, ah man, but they were funny, you know. they did that funny thing in all those episodes and that kind of cancels out some of the murders they did. Um but I don't think Logan Roy ever does do that.

Samuel
52:23
I guess just I don't think Stringer Bell actually ever kills anyone directly, but I can't forgive a thing like the death of D'Angelo Barksdale, you know? That's uh that's tough. But then I don't know, again, maybe Kevin Garvey should be higher because he does kill a person.

Matthew
52:36
So uh Stringabell as well is is also like a Quite an impressive self-made businessman. Like if he's very cool. If he managed to pull it off, it would uh it it would be okay, you know. And and there are some like shittier people who have an easier ride than him

Samuel
52:50
Yeah, for sure.

Matthew
52:51
But um then he gets um actually no, I don't want to spoil the wire for people, so Well that sentence can only end in a couple of ways.

Samuel
52:58
Of course then he gets

Matthew
53:00
An ice cream van Let's just say that.

Samuel
53:04
That was a really wild twist of season four of the wire, but uh yeah, he did get an ice cream. Just he just drove around Baltimore like peacefully delivering ice creams to people.

Matthew
53:15
Doing a re up on his fabs. My number two is Tony Soprano.

Samuel
53:22
That's my number two as well, Snap.

Matthew
53:24
Evil but working on himself.

Samuel
53:26
Yeah, and you know, I would say a good hang like about 40% of the time. Which isn't you know, that's enough, I think, for a prestige TV lead. um of this era. Um who's your number one?

Matthew
53:37
Well I he's not technically in lead. He's a little bit of a side character, so maybe it's cheating. I picked uh I thought it had to be some someone from Deadwood, because that is just like a a town of bastards. I picked George Hurst, who he's only in season three, but he turns up and he's just fucking awful to everyone. He gets his he's got this horrible bloke who does like terrible things to people's heads and things. Um thoroughly unpleasant and uh it just goes completely unpunished. Uh Just yeah, he's the he's the deadly combination of like evil and charmless, um, which makes him the ultimate bastard. But I'm curious who your ultimate TV bastard is.

Samuel
54:19
Oh, Walter White is one number one. Oh, Walter White, yeah. I think when after um I don't want to start spoiling breaking bad actually for people now either. He buys an ice cream van. Again, another great um sort of great arc in season four of that show.

Matthew
54:34
It's one of the Ryan Johnson episodes. It's a bit of zany.

Samuel
54:38
It's just called Van and it's very uh Fans are divided over it. Um Is the best possible outcome for a prestige TV lead being Raylon Gibbons, Matthew? Is that as good as it gets really? Like your cool You're in a like a good show, a verifiably good show, but you are like pretty awesome. Is that the best outcome?

Matthew
54:59
Yeah, that he is pretty good, though even he's like a little bit uh keen on shooting people you know dead in the streets and things. Like he kills a lot of people. He probably kills more people than Tony Soprano. Or Walter White. Uh or George Hearst kills. Oh, and he does say it bec he's a lawman, but mmm, I don't know.

Samuel
55:19
Yeah. Especially those like Week uh you know, Villain of the Week episodes in season one where those guys get off, you're a bit like, Wow, that was um pretty extreme. I guess uh What a remi uh a nice reminder that we're in the United States of America in this show and that they have their own way of doing things.

Matthew
55:34
Um there's a great scene where he gives someone a bullet and he goes, The next one's coming at you faster and I I love that. That's such a That's such a cool way of saying I'm gonna shoot you if I see you.

Samuel
55:46
I love that episode in season one, where he loses his hat and then has to get his hat back from those guys who beat him up. Like that's a a great bit of character building for that show. Um yeah, good stuff. Um do you think you could beat up Timothy Oliphant if pushed? Obviously not. Uh it's like he's gonna be in much better shape than either you or I. Do you think both of us could take him combined? I held back his arms, you weren't the chest.

Matthew
56:10
I've yeah, he does he you know, without spoiling it, he does he gets to do a bit of fighting stuff in Alien, you see, so I've I've got a a quite a Uh he gives quite a strong impression of someone who could probably like tear me in half.

Samuel
56:24
Shit. Yeah.

Matthew
56:25
But I mean he's playing a pr pr he's pretending to be a robot. In real life that wouldn't happen. In real life, if you punch him hard enough, milk doesn't come out of his ears, you know.

Samuel
56:34
Well, um, you know, that's a little if anyone knows Timothy Oliphant, there's a good little pitch for his next project there. If he just wants to fight two of us, pay-per-view, we'll broadcast that and Who knows? We'll create a new tier for that. The uh the XXXL tier. Um and it'll be like twenty one pounds and run for one month. Uh actually more than that really. T I think it's gonna be a lot of upfront costs for that.

Matthew
56:56
But we'll search like fight. pay-per-view fights and see what they t typically charge to watch a YouTuber, you know, fight a now retired, probably disabled boxer.

Samuel
57:08
What a damning indictment of where where that sport is at. I mean Yeah, what a piece of shit that was. Um, okay, Matthew, shall we take a quick break and then come back with the uh the discussion of episode by episode Mad Men Season 1? Let's do it. Welcome back to the podcast. So got some little notes to talk about each episode here. It's not gonna be the most involved conversation. We're gonna try and run through all thirteen episodes in about an hour. See how it goes. So um First up we got Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, episode one of the show. New York, the 1960s, in the ego-driven golden age of advertising, everyone is selling something. And nothing is what it seems. Um, this episode very much establishes Don Draper as a man who is successful in his job of being creative director at this ad agency, Sterling Cooper. but perhaps a little trapped by it and knows that the the next pitch he makes is basic basically just always has to be good in order in order for him to keep surviving in this. Kind of like gilded cage situation he has. Sort of like the the pitch of episode one. And then the twist of the character, if you want to call it that, revealed at the end of the episode, because we see him, you know. Cavorting with another woman, this woman called Midge, who lives in New York, this artist. Um, is that he is married? He has uh a home in New York State somewhere, um, off in the sticks. And it's uh yeah, it basically establishes Don Draper and all the different dynamics um that kind of revolve around that character. And well, there's already a lot going on in this first episode, Matthew, but um this is also the first proper bit of like in universe ad pitching we see. And Don is struggling to come up with a pitch for Lucky Strike, the um tobacco manufacturers who are the main account of Sterling Cooper, and people who have to be kept happy. and um he's pitching the cigarette ads in the midst of this damning evidence that cigarettes do in fact you know cause lung cancer and kill you and so what they pitch is is a bit of a challenge. And he ultimately pitches um It something a slogan that says it's toasted for Lucky Strike. And it's interesting because it wins them over and Don is sort of struggling to come up with it, but in the moment he comes up with it is because he asked them Um he asked the the people who run Lucky Strike, like how do you make your cigarettes? And they just ri run through a list of processors and they they say toast it at one point, he goes there and he goes, Lucky Strike, it's toasted. Everyone else's cigarettes They give you lung cancer, but Lucky Strike it's toasted. And I want to ask you, is this a good ad, Matthew? What do you think?

I guess given the challenge of the brief, which is to talk about cigarettes without uh r uh contradicting the kind of medical advice which is which is like the challenge of the thing. It's like how you talk about it without really talking about it. It's quite wholesome selling it as like a cereal or something. You know, it sounds like cornflakes. That's what it sounds like. Um which is why I think it's quite a good Yeah, I think I think this is one of the stronger pictures. Like some of the other ones he gives the whole sort of spiel and then what he actually comes out with, I'm like, eh. I don't know if I necessarily feel that. But this one I think I think this is a pretty good it's the demonstration of his superpower in the show or his ability to kind of sort of sell it. I think when you're working on any kind of cr creative idea for clients, I I don't work in advertising but we we sort of do work on sort of marketing videos for for entertainment products, films and games and things. And you are always reading through the brief, waiting for the the magic word to jump off the page that's gonna like unlock it, or the thing where you're like, oh that's the thing, you know, that's the that's the good idea and that's the big idea. So maybe there is a little bit of draper in us. But I've never come up with anything as good as it's toasted. No. Um

Samuel
01:01:11
Move over Uncharted, that's pretty much up there, I would say.

Matthew
01:01:14
Um That's that's my pitch, everything. There is one in a later season, there's a guy who comes in and like His whole his whole kind of pitch book is like the w is like one phrase over and over again, then Don accidentally pitches it himself and then they have to hire the guy to buy his idea. Do you remember that?

Samuel
01:01:32
Yeah, is it like the the something somethings? Uh is it like the cure for other common something? That's it.

Matthew
01:01:42
Yeah.

Samuel
01:01:43
Yeah That was yeah, and then they're just stuck with this hack writer and it's yeah, that's um that is funny. I think it's toasted p I personally think this would be a bit too elevated to go over the and it and would go over the heads of like the common folk of the nineteen sixties. And you know, and the the point that the the show uh you know makes at the very start is that you know, people smoke cigarettes as a matter of habit no matter which, you know, socioeconomic bracket they belong to, right? And so the idea of like, you know, the right ad can convert someone to you know, try something else, then uh yeah, I think it's toast is just a little bit too clever, personally. It's not it's no the carousel, um which we'll talk about a bit later. Um What did you make of this episode generally, Matthew? Did you have any um sort of notes off the back of this one?

Matthew
01:02:31
Yeah, I mean uh just just how you know well formed all the characters are out the gate. Uh like also kind of quite weird rewinding the clock on Peggy a bit. You know who she becomes in the show and how successful she becomes and it's quite funny seeing her this sort of quite sort of timid version of her who's sort of awkward around all these characters who she's gonna end up having quite a lot of power over. So I have always struggled with uh the kind of affairs part of Don Draper. Uh like it's like his least attractive quality is is like how shit he is to his family and he's in relationship with this this sort of uh sort of bohemian artist character and I never really b bought that as like something he would necessarily do or like a lifestyle that he would he would buy into or be interested in. And whenever they come back to that character in that storyline, which is only in a handful of episodes, it it always it just falls a little flat for me or I don't really buy it. I think how did these two people meet? like w what was what was the appeal of it. Um it didn't r d that doesn't make sense to me. But aside from that it's uh you know, just a classic bit of pilot work really.

Samuel
01:03:46
Yeah, that's a a good observation about Midge. I mean, she's what I'm talking about when I say that. Certain characters have side quests in this first season because no other main characters interact with Midge or ever even meet her. She is like her own you know, sort of strand of storytelling that goes on in the show. And she I I think she's the sort of thing the show doesn't do. Like his affairs in the seasons going forward always connect back to the main plot in some way. And This is the only um affair he has that doesn't really do that in a direct way. Um so yeah. Um yeah, so you get also um uh Pete Campbell, who is um Not taken seriously by Don Draper in Sterling Cooper. This guy who's desperate to basically have his job. Get out of managing accounts and um pitch creative. Um he you know uh take seems to take some pleasure in humiliating Pete or at least won't give him any val the validation that he craves. Um and uh you know, in a uh Peggy who is also understanding the dynamics of the office in terms of being objectified by men and that being a part of her everyday reality now that the way she's dressed and the way she looks is is you know part of her how her value is perceived. Um you know they end up sleeping together at the end of this episode which is you know a key a key event in the in the show. And it's funny because Peggy sees Pete get humiliated. But these characters, you know, have a sort of like odd relationship over the course of the show and I kind of just wanted to ask you about that really like why why do they sleep together and what is the nature of that relationship ultimately

Matthew
01:05:26
I I took it more as as just a a s quite a naive act to sort of show that she isn't you know, she's so not part of this world or so sort of unnatural in this world, Peggy that is when she turns up you know, she isn't like the other secretaries and in the aftermath of this, you know, doesn't sort of isn't as careful as sh as she should be. And But I thought that was more about the sort of sh like, you know, I took it as just them showing us who who this character is as someone who's who's quite kind of alien to this world. who then, you know, eventually kind of unlocks, you know, a different kind of potential and s you know, once she works out, actually, you know, she has got this this skill and ability and then her relationship with everyone changes. I don't know the actual Pete and Peggy thing. I it's I've always just felt like there's some you know, a weird awkwardness between them. It's weird because I feel like in later seasons it just it it it really doesn't it's not that it doesn't go anywhere, but it it just isn't really the focus of the show at all. And maybe because of that it's it's hard to sort of like read too much into it.

Samuel
01:06:33
Yeah, it sort of comes back around every now and then is sort of the how it how it's used. But you know, their their sort of personal lives are on completely different tracks. Um But there is some kind of connection between them. Um yeah, I think it is a a thing where like uh They both sort of need some kind of validation um at the end of that that particular the period of this episode. Um I think that's probably part of what it is. as well as um you know maybe as being like naturally attracted to each other. But but for Pete I think it's definitely about he craves validation. He's simply not getting in other parts of his life. Um and like you say Peggy Peggy's naivety is a big part of that too. Just find it interesting because it is one of the dynamics that the show uh those the relationship between the characters evolves. It's it it ends in a very different state to where it begins here. So just wanted to ask about that. Um Okay, episode two, Matthew. Ladies Room. Don continues to conceal his complicated personal life, even in the face of Roger's invitation to open up. Um this is a very like um much more of a Betty centric episode. Um I will say one thing I noticed watching these back is that even in the episodes that are focused around a particular character, there's always stuff going on with the other characters. Um There's always it's always an ensemble drama. Um and so that's that is good. But you have Betty played by January Jones, Don Draper's wife, um, become more of a focus here, and she is having some challenges being a housewife. Some she this is the I think this is the episode that's got her having a very small car crash. Um I think that's right, isn't it, Matthew, this episode. Yeah. Um she just sort of drives up onto like someone's lawn and knocks over a water feature. It's no big deal, but um for a second you think it might be. Um but it's it's interesting because it it sort of like reveals the show to be more than what it seems to be in episode one. However, Betty is a character who I think um got a bit of a mixed reception as the show went on and I couldn't ever work out if the writers were giving her a fair shake or not. I I was wondering what you thought of that, because later seasons she is sort of It sort of suggested that she is infantilized and that she is basically like a little girl who always wants to get her own way and has a missing piece of her life because her mum died. quite young. Um I just wanted to know what you made of that character.

Matthew
01:08:59
She she is tricky 'cause she's like a little island compared you know, on the side of the show where everyone else gets to interact in this office environment. I think she gets to have like less fun than everyone else because she doesn't have all the the sort of you know, office banter and larks and all that kind of quite kind of attractive silliness that maybe takes the edge off some of the other characters, like harder elements. So she's left to deal with like y you know, the beginnings of you know, a breakdown or being unsatisfied with her life. But like that's re that's sort of the main thing she has to deal with. Um and she just gets to sort of unload it all on her s sort of very pregnant friend who keeps turning up in in this season, um, smoking and drinking away, which is just like you know, the show's quite slyly funny about just terrible health uh advice in the sixties. Um Yeah, I uh I don't know I feel quite I feel quite sorry for her because sh she's treated horribly by Don in so many ways, um, even though she is quite keen on him. Uh And as the show goes on, just due to like them growing more distant, like she doesn't really have a reason narratively to be in the show, but they've kind of kept her in because she isn't it's like a It's almost like they keep her around because she is a main character and it almost feels like she's not just there to like for them to go or you know, well we're trying to paint this picture of the sixties, you know, it's this very masculine world. Maybe we should paint the experience of like a housewife as there is this housewife who is is is a big part of the story through Don. Let's use her to like drill into that element, which you know, there is a lot of you know, w while they are still kind of together, there is a lot more um i it allows them to go into some domestic places that they can't go later in the show, but then when they aren't together, y you know, it's kind of like what's she get up to, like left to her own devices and what kind of a mother is she gonna be and you know, it's more about her and her daughter and that relationship and it it there isn't really any other character like it. Um She's she's not really like part of the ensemble, but sh despite being a huge part of the show.

Samuel
01:11:22
Yeah, it's interesting. I think you're right. There's a you know, there's a definite depressed housewives on antidepressants from the, you know, golden age of the fifties, you know, and like the idea of you know, everyone just s suddenly having, you know, like these nice homes and and you know, it's the stay at home mum boxing women up there and you know basically taking away jobs they might have had during World War II or putting them in their place and you know just uh they are sort of like just a a facet of American life and don't get to do anything more. And that's, you know, definitely part of what they're commenting on with that character. You're right, she's never really part of the ensemble. It's not like she ever becomes like a ha like a copywriter and works in a for a rival agency or something. It's it's It's like a bit of an event when she turns up in the office. Yeah. You're like, oh my God, what's she doing here? Yeah, it's like Superman and Batman meeting or something when she meets Peggy in the office. You're like, oh that's weird. You know, it's yeah, so um it's you you're you know, Don does treat her terribly. I would say the thing you said about um about watching this with through a different lens. Is that I again I think saw her as an older character when I first watched it, but you know, she's in a I think like mid to late twenties in this. And so you realize like what a tragedy it is to spend if you don't want to be a stay-at-home mum all the time, if that's not you know, if all if you think your self-worth is tied up in more than that. And that's all you can do, and you are that age and you don't have any other prospects. That is like quite that is quite a sad character. Um so yeah, it's uh it's effective.

Matthew
01:12:57
The one one thing I will say for it is there are moments of like real affection between them which I don't remember at all. Like I I just remember that them having like quite a horrible marriage the whole time and it kind of inevitably going in the direction it goes where actually Th you know, there's lots of bit where there's lots of bits where, you know, she's very supportive or there's several scenes where she goes to the city and they go on like double dates and he's out with her and, you know He uh maybe it's he's just like proud to have this sort of trophy wife, but there seems to be, you know, something more there. Um where yeah, in my telling of it in my head, it it wasn't like that at all. He was always very f like frosty and cruel to her. Um but, you know, nothing is nothing is that simple in Mad Men, I guess.

Samuel
01:13:49
Yeah, it's um you know, the thing I always uh just thought was so worked so well about them as a couple is that they they look like a couple who would be in an advert about like like the perfect couple, you know, uh like a dinner or having like a picnic or something like that. Like you can imagine them in a 50s drawing of a man and a woman, you know, having the perfect life. And that's yeah, because they're just both such beautiful people. So yeah. Um It really it really works on that level. Um, and then Don is getting his wife's therapist to spy on her. Is this one of the five worst things he does in the entire show? It's pretty evil.

Matthew
01:14:25
Yeah, that is that is pretty bad. It's weird that thing you sort of said about her being quite sort of sort of infantilised in in in her behaviour because She does get herself into a lot of trouble by s like having a bit more curiosity than the other housewives. Like she seems to have like a a streak of daring to her, or like she's open to certain things, or she gets herself into sort of awkward situations like no one else does. Yeah. But then whenever she's there, she just makes Don really cross. It's uh it's quite an odd it is quite an odd part of this show.

Samuel
01:14:58
It is actually. I never really thought of it in that way because I always just thought of it as an ensemble drama and I thought, well, that's just, you know, part of the the fabric of it. But you're right, it is like its own little universe. She's got her own you know, friends and neighbours and people only she interacts with really. Um yeah.

Matthew
01:15:17
If you look at the people she interacts with, they're really odd compared to the people Don gets to interact he gets to interact with all these cool adults. One of her main co-stars is like a really weird little boy.

Samuel
01:15:27
Um played by Matthew Weiner's son. And I would say one of the five strangest boys who's ever been in like a TV show or film, like very strange. So I'm making a lot of top five lists in this um this episode. We're not gonna be doing that as a countdown, by the way, the five strangest boys. I'll let you fill in the gaps at home, but um Yeah, or like uh, you know, like a a Francine, her gossipy housewife mate, who is a bit a bit more archetypal and Yeah, I mean that's you know more focus is drawn to that in episode three, Marriage of Figaro. Um this episode um Pete returns home from his honeymoon excited about his new marriage but conflicted about his past encounter with Peggy But I'm gonna be honest with you that th you know, that is part of this episode, but I would say that the main feature this episode is it's a birthday party for is it the daughter? Is it Is it Sally's party or is it the Sun? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. So Don it has to build a Wendy house and a garden, and he does so while drinking about eighteen beers and then just gets more and more wasted. Um while all these very cursed adults, the parents of the ch of these children at this party come to their house and sort of like swan around, um, all being a little bit well, not all of them, but some of them are just a little bit disgraceful. or kind of gross or like um just depressing to listen to or tell off-color jokes. This it's very r this is something very real and then Don has this kind of mini existential crisis is meant to fetch the cake and then j the for the birthday party then just fucking drives off. And then returns at the end of the episode. Um, Dave Scarber's also been watching Mad Men, and I just texted him saying, Is this what you're like when it's your kid's birthday party? Because he's the only the only parent I know of a child. Um So yeah, this this feels like the most attention the show ever draw draws to the most attention the show ever draws to the idea of Don and Betty being friends with other couples. outside of Sterling Cooper. It's again that sort of like side quest heavy season thing I keep saying. It's not really a strand that has any r relevance to anything else. It's all really just in this episode. Um but I was wondering what you made of all this, the the birthday party element of it.

Matthew
01:17:36
I think this is what I was talking about when I said like it reminded me of the Sopranos. I think this is like the most Sopranos the show ever is. because, you know, the Sopranos took great pleasure in seeing what happens when this incredibly powerful mob boss was having to deal with like really mundane family shit. Um and particularly stuff where there were like you know, strangers or polite company like in his house, like when he has to deal with regular humans and not people in this in his crime world. you know, the sh that's almost where the show had like the most fun or like came to life the most. And this this feels like his slight equivalent of that of just, you know Here here are the the real normies that he used to deal with. Um but of course I I think by Don's standards Because he's so abnormal in so many ways. You know, because he's literally like not who he says he is and is pretending to be like another person entirely. You know, I think everyone seems um sort of slightly strange or threatening to him. Um like he spent a lot of the party like spooked and sort of filming people on his camera and Given how smooth he is in the office, it's quite weird, like what a bad host he is in this.

Samuel
01:18:51
He doesn't really engage with his home life in in a sort of in a in a full way. And it's sort of like It's obviously part of the frustration of the marriage for Betty, and it's something that Don seems to have no self-awareness about, or if he is aware of it, he doesn't care about addressing it. And so You know, all of that only makes you more sympathetic towards Betty, I would say. Um, yeah, really interesting. But I do like this episode. Um, and I do like the sequence where he's filming on that camera and then just sees that couple having a very sincere moment together and then that seems to be the thing that triggers his existential despair and to just drive off. I mean, I just like all of that. It's very So I say there's just a I think like um the John Cheever comparison people make with Mad Men, I really get that vibe from this episode. Um but I see what you mean about the Sopranos thing. That does make sense actually. Um okay Next episode then is New Amsterdam episode four. Pete Campbell oversteps the mark when he pitches an idea for an ad campaign to the head of Bethlehem Steel without telling Don Draper. Draper wants him fired but learns a lesson in corporate politics. Pete's wife wants to buy a Manhattan apartment, but he has to approach his cold and distant parents for a loan. Pete's in laws, however, are more forthcoming. I started taking these from a different, uh longer source, um as the episodes became more detailed, Matthew, um for these summaries. Um this episode introduces Pete Campbell, Pete Campbell's wife, Trudy. Um say, isn't Alison Bree lovely, Matthew? I mean, I was watching this thinking what a great character she is, because she's got that very particular voice that is like a bit shrill, but she actually like feels very 60s in this quite authentic way. Um yeah. And I like that her energy Ca countess P quite nicely, you know.

Matthew
01:20:37
I think she seems quite sort of s sincerely into him, despite him being like a bit of a rat boy in so many ways. He doesn't like he just never really realizes how lucky he is. Hmm. But I don't know, maybe that's just sort of projecting the sort of Alice and Bree of it all. It's a really good episode though. The stuff at the company I think is my favourite stuff in Mad Men you know is definitely the It like nitty-gritty of like professional politics and workplace politics and not just the, you know, which bit of work gets pitched and is the work good enough and will we win this account, but the the idea of basically Don's sort of told to sort of you know you can kind of keep keep your enemies close in in business. You see like conflict in the workplace and how it plays out in so many different ways and whether people can harness it for something more as he d as he sort of suggested he does here. I think that's very well observed.

Samuel
01:21:34
Yeah, for sure. I think um i it's basically like round one of uh Pete tries to topple Don Draper in some way and then gets his ass handed to him. Um but there are many more things going on behind the scenes. Like you say, office politics um at work. And you know one of uh one of those things is you know the fact that Pete Campbell is from a you know what was um you know a very wealthy and influential New York family. And so Burt Cooper, this is the episode where you meet Burt Cooper, I believe, Matthew. Um it's actually I might be I might be wrong there. That might be the previous episode, but In any case, one of his early appearances, this the other owner of um of Sterling Cooper who um walks around with no shoes on. And um is often trimming flowers. Seems to be a bit of a chapanophile as well. Yeah. A lot of that going on. You get on with them well, I think, Matthew. Body pillow off screen. Yeah, if only Burt Cooper could have lived to see Evangelion, I think he'd have um had a or chainsaw or chainsaw man, I think he'd have had a great time. Um yeah, so And so basically Pete, without him realizing it, is protected from being fired uh basically by the fact that, you know, he he is from a a family with a lot of influence. And so You know, there's a lot of like invisible things at work here, but Don is not from a background like that, does not have that generational advantage, and class becomes, you know, a sort of part of the episode. Um But I did want to ask about Pete's family here, who you meet. His mum reappears. I think this is the only time you ever meet Pete's dad. He's wearing such tiny shorts, Matthew. I found it very di I found it very distracting w watching this. But um I did really like the actor who they got to play him. I think they're really good at casting bit parts in this, but what do you make of Pete's whole kind of like family situation here?

Matthew
01:23:26
It's not so simple as like you know, he's completely sort of insulated from any f future problems because his you know his his family's powerful. And that is what happens in the episode. Um but it's not just, you know, he ha he does have his like own ambitions and There's like a a very relatable like shame in having to turn to them. Like that is one of like Pete's few redeeming features, I think is that actually he d he like does want to sort of, you know, m make it on his own. I think he does want to be a success, like, on his own terms. When r you know, I think the show suggests in this episode at least that he could have like a much easier ride, you know, pursuing something else that his parents respect. Um and that's, you know, that's that's sort of quietly decent. More broadly I do like the the the class stuff in this with particular you know Don's I think quite loyal to you know, Peggy because he sort of sees in her, you know, she doesn't really come from anything and has, you know, real skill and, you know, he he kind of admires that and I think that's, you know, yeah, anyone who's who's you know, worked in a you know, a low paying job but has, you know, strived quite hard to do well within it. You know, I think they'll sort of see a bit of themselves in probably both those characters.

Samuel
01:24:55
Yeah, for sure. I think it's it's what's great about the show is that even as they're in this very elevated situation, you know, you you can empathize with that as a viewer, that anyone anyone can. Um I like that.

Matthew
01:25:07
You ever had you ever you ever had uh uh like a sort of a peggy in your life. So when you feel like, oh I gave them a bit of you know, I recognize something I could kind of give them a bit of a boost.

Samuel
01:25:18
God, can I really take cred I would never take credit for anyone else's success. Like a little bit with um uh Don Pepe, who is now one of the people who runs Eurogamer. Um but even then I've I think I've um I think I could have been better than I was. Um It's i it's funny though, I I think that um I got better at this as I went and when I left Tech Radar my Uh the person who now runs the entertainment section of tech radar said to me, You were a brilliant editor, and I learned loads from working with you. And so I thought That's cool. And it's nice to be able to pass that down. I don't know if I ever right really sort of plucked anyone from nowhere and felt like I gave them a huge break. How about you?

Matthew
01:26:00
Uh no, no, I you know, I was I was lucky with the the the staff writers we hired were all just you know p good people in their own right. Needed a little pointing in the right direction, but I can't I don't feel like I, you know, dis discovered anyone person you know, they were they were just good people and made life quite e uh quite a bit easier. So I c I wish I wish I'd given someone some like big inspirational speech at some point, but I don't think that's ever happened.

Samuel
01:26:27
No, and I'd you know, and I sort of um

Matthew
01:26:29
I don't think I've done any damage, you know, as as and that's like that's about the best you can hope for, right?

Samuel
01:26:36
Yeah. I don't think yeah, I don't think I did. I don't think working with me was a net loss for anyone who worked with me, which is I mean what a what a great thing to be able to say about yourself really. But um yeah. Um But I do yeah, I I too like the class aspect of this show. It's just another dimension for you to think about as a viewer. Um especially because Burt Cooper doesn't know that much about Don Draper, but he knows enough to know that he's not from you know, landed gentry basically. Like it's it's a it's a different world he's from. Okay, next episode Matthew, 5G, episode five. Don Draper is shaken when his past life comes back to haunt him. After his picture appears in a local newspaper, Adam Whitman, a man who claims to be his younger brother, approaches him. Don, or Dick, as his brother knows him, initially denies everything, but in the end admits to having taken on a new name. Lots going on in this episode, Matthew. Um a key part of Don Draper law um sort of peeled back here. I guess um let's start with that actually before we get into the really fun part of this episode, which I'm looking forward to discussing. May arguably the reason this podcast is even happening, I would say. Um, what do you think of the Adam plot in this, knowing what you do about the Dick Whitman part of that character and how the real identity of Don Draper is eventually uh uh revealed?

Matthew
01:27:51
It is really s you know it's really sad and tragic that that this, you know, relationship doesn't get to go anywhere because of all Uh Don's quite weird baggage. Uh it's it's quite weird going back to these episodes before all that stuff is properly explained. because they s i you know, they treat it like a mystery hook in the show, like there's a dark secret in this man's life and Actually, once it's revealed, the the show kind of deals with it like pretty neatly and the sort of moves on from it. Like it doesn't hang over the show at all. Um, at least in my memory. Maybe there's a bit more of that in season two and three than than I recall, but certainly by the end, like i you're you're talking you know, the show is is definitely dealing with the emotional fallout of what he does in his youth and and and taking someone's identity. But I wouldn't say it's like, you know, a major bit of peril. Where here it if like for one episode or a couple of episodes it feels like his life could be ruined if something comes out and I I I don't know, that almost sort of s that sort steps on the toes a little bit of you know, what's actually important and what what he comes to realise is important later on in that, you know, letting that kind of fear get in the way of this relationship with someone who actually, you know It's like one of the very few people who does know the real him and uh I f yeah, I don't know. I i it's it's like it's brilliant drama, but I f I found it like pretty depressing this one

Samuel
01:29:21
He is very, very sad. Um, because Adam has just had like not a very good life and and yeah, he is basically rejected by Don outright here, who Don who is you know, basically sculpted himself into, you know, um this you know, almost kind of like pencil pencil draw you know sort of like hardline pencil drawing of a man, just like the all kind of like facade basically and Adam is the only person who can truly s see through it. It's got a bit of um again, it's that John Cheever thing I keep saying, but like that is what those short stories are like basically where there's just a this is it's just very they're just very sadly written, you know? Um And I think there is actually something a little bit comic booky, personally, about the the sort of who is the real Don Draper element and the idea of like a hidden past that becomes revealed. That is pure Arguably that's like pure soap opera, but it's also pure kind of like yeah, I think pure comic bookie as well. Um the idea of having like a another sort of identity. Um and I do think it's also one of the most trad bits of plotting of the season because like you say it what the show rests on is not this. It's like a it's a feature of the show, but it's not what drives the show like you say. And so in some ways it feels like, oh, the next episode of Mad Men, like someone from Don's past knows of his deep dark secret. It's very Not all of the m very few of the plots in Mademois are anything anything like that, you know. The the peril is very, very different.

Matthew
01:30:49
So Yeah, I mean that's like fucking history of violence, that plot line. man sees face in newspaper and realizes it's it's someone from his past. Exactly.

Samuel
01:30:59
Comic bookie, you know, it's very very much in that vein. Um I was gonna ask if you think this was s the only time I've ever thought this, but does Don Draper fully work as a character? And I asked this because I'm not sure everything he does tracks in this episode. And he's basically like an alien in how he behaves. Like it is he is trying to like cover up his past because he knows he has a dark secret, which we later find out about. But he is like building this myth around himself. Um I think that Uh honestly, that how good looking John Hamm is helps the writers get away with the fact that I don't think that everything he does to Adam makes sense, like pushing him out like he does, because I'm pretty sure that in the timeline of the show, I might be wrong that the original Don Draper's wife, Anna, already knows he's Dick Whitman at this point and has forgiven him because I think it's the end of season two when They they reveal that backstory. And so it's just callous in a way that I I'm not sure if it makes sense two seasons down the line It might just be they haven't thought it through. I don't know if you had any thoughts on that.

Matthew
01:32:08
But I don't know if it is the the the Dick Whitman of it all that is freaking him out. Like I I I took it purely as His great fear is is being found out as basically a deserter, right? Right. You know, for having got out of the war by pretending to be someone else. And that's a cr you know, that's you know, it's a literal crime. That and they so it's the crime that he's he's scared of being caught out for and anyone from his old life basically opens him up to that. Um You know, and on top of that, y although you don't necessarily know this at this point, you know, w in hindsight, once you've seen a few more flashbacks to his childhood and you understand like the very rough place he came from. You could maybe understand him being a little tense about that life coming back, you know, like either he's embarrassed or ench ashamed of like where he comes from. and he doesn't really want to deal with that. Um, you know, the the sort of tragedy of it is he's it it well I feel like the show does suggest that he kind of uh overcomes those concerns and is about to make amends but can't, um, because of what happens later in the series. I just think it's more the criminality of it. Yeah, which is an element that is only relevant in Series 1 really. Yeah, okay.

Samuel
01:33:27
That's that's fair enough. That's a a fair interpretation.

Matthew
01:33:30
I think you're right. That's the more interesting element of it, is the tension of stepping into someone's life and what the like the emotional fallout of that is and having like a debt to some other people who are keeping your secret and Uh yeah, I I I I find that they they do more interesting stuff with it. That's what you said it's least interesting to me i in these opening episodes.

Samuel
01:33:57
Yeah, that's fair enough. Um, okay, now for the dessert. Um, Ken Cosgrove has a short story published in Yeah The Atlantic in this episode. Ken Gos Cosgrove prior to this, a bit of a like One of the slightly I would say the handsier, kind of more aggressive with women and a little bit sort of boys club. guys in the office. Um, you know, it's just interesting. And then this kind of like shows, you know, that he has some intellectual layers basically and creates a lot of jealousy. Um that he has this story published because he's the one who achieved it. Maybe the most games journalist coded thing I've ever seen in a prestige TV show. What are your thoughts on this this storyline?

Matthew
01:34:43
The things that that seem really relatable is someone has d diligently be doing something quietly their in their own time and it pays off. That's happened a few times at feature where you're like, Oh right, oh fantastic. You know, you are happy for them because of your mates, but you're like it it it can come out of the blue sometimes um where you're like oh right uh and then the other two things it gets is the is can Ken He's like rightfully proud, but it like veers into obnoxiousness with like how he just keeps bringing it up and he's like printed out copy you know, he's got copies of the magazine to share and You know, he's letting everyone know and everyone you'd get a bit sick of it. It's c you you tread quite a f a a thin line or quite a tight rope. you know, when you achieve anything of like the amount of goodwill that you can have before it becomes bad to everyone. You Um That's that's very realistically uh depicted. Uh and of course like Pete Campbell's this desperate scramble to achieve something in his own life. and his frustrations I mean that's probably the most relatable bit um of like oh shit someone else has done something so I better do something Um and then feeling cross that it doesn't work.

Samuel
01:36:00
Yeah, pimping out my wife to get it. Something uh basically a shitty stor short story published in the In a magazine for boys.

Matthew
01:36:07
It's sort of like the Yes. Neck uh my one of my favourite lines in the in this season was next to the ad for the exploding cigar.

Samuel
01:36:15
Yeah, it's um That's all well observed. Um i it's interesting actually, the this season has more scenes of bit park characters interacting than I remember. So you'll get like two characters who are not even close to being Like m the in the main supporting cast having their own compos having their own scenes together. Like um, yeah, basically um Pete Gampbell's wife and her former partner who is the editor at this this magazine. Um is yeah, like they they there's like a whole subplot tied around um those characters and it's i it's some it's a bit unusual. There's something similar happens with the Rachel Menkin character. You get a few scenes of her with her sister talking on the phone and Um just interesting. The show is always happy to give people the spotlight um in service of characterization, you know, um, not just to move the plot forward. Um but I yeah, I love this Ken Corsgrove uh short story um idea because it is an element that recurs with a character as he goes. Like he never becomes like a a best selling author and quits working in this industry. He is always tied to this industry, but he has more success than anyone else. Um I was wondering this is a really I guess a slightly odd question to ask. Do you think there's an additional layer? of connection that you have to Ken Cosgrove because you know he's the main character of Elie Nawar. Like it's fundamentally his face in this TV show. If you watch any clip on YouTube of Ken Cosgrove that someone mentions Ellen Noir in like the top three comments like every single time. But does that change the relationship with the character at all, Matthew?

Matthew
01:37:52
I quite dislike that character in L. A. Noir. Like I'm not a I'm not you know, he's he's quite unpleasant. I mean he's a bit Don Drapery, like he's not uh like morally good person and in a way that I sort of struggle with and I don't take I don't bring any of that baggage to Mad Madmen. Like I quite like Ken in in the show. Um You know, I think he's one of the uh not n nobler people, because you're right, he is he is quite handsy, but you know, he does achieve things. You know, he does he does Yeah, take a few swings. There are uh there are a lot more kind of pathetic characters than him in this show, at that kind of tier. Uh I think he's like s by the end, if you add it all up, I think he's like one of the like better behaved characters.

Samuel
01:38:38
Yeah, he is. I think he he matures in a bunch of different ways. And has some like really great one off scenes that are are definitely embedded in my brain as all-time highlights of the show. So yeah, I'm a big fan. Um okay, episode six, Babylon. A taboo office romance is revealed at a brainstorming session. Peggy proves to be more than secretary, opening up new opportunities for her at Sterling Cooper. Meanwhile, Rachel Mencken faces her conflicting feelings for Don after he seeks out her advice on a new campaign. Not really talked about this yet, but one of Don's affairs that sparks up in the background is with um a client, so Mencken's department store, um basically this old Jewish family in New York who are losing. Market share, their shop is a bit old fashioned, so um they employ Sterling Cooper to basically freshen them up. Um and I would say it's some of the most effective Don stuff in this season is his interactions with her, I think that works really well. So I will ask you about that first of all before we carry on, Matthew. Uh what do you make of that relationship in this season?

Matthew
01:39:42
That makes way more sense to me than the the stuff with um is it Mitch? Yeah Mitch is that Yeah, like 'cause she's I mean like Mitch is clearly like a you know, a s a smart person, but uh um Mencken is so different to to Betty. You know, like there's that you know they're they're sort of worlds apart and you can sort of I think you get a better idea of of you know And yeah, which uh in you know, is I I I kind of th it's still it's still bleak. Oh he does that to Betty, but it seems uh something about it seem uh maybe this is me this being slot, it just seems less sordid. Than meeting in this grubby apartment with Midge. I d but um I don't know. Yeah, it's both bad.

Samuel
01:40:50
They are both bad. It's just it feels like there's a a layer of real feeling to it, I suppose. Um yeah. Yeah, it's not just like lust, you know? No, and also you see a lot of Rachel Mencken's side of it and how she's wrestling with the fact that she knows Don is a married man and um and so therefore entering into this affair like it has a timer on it or it doesn't seem like a good idea. Um yeah, just a just an interesting character, very memorable. You know, he has a lot of affairs in this show, but she's a very memorable character. This is also the first time the show pairs up Roger Sterling and Joan Holloway, which I consider one of the fundamental relationships of the show, but I've forgotten that it's actually relatively brief. Um, I think that they just have real care mystery, these characters. And you know, it's not something that's a feature of the show up until this point. Shall we talk about John Slattery and Christina Hendrix some more Matthew? Because they are such key parts of the show. Do you want to pick up from here? Abs absolutely brilliant characters.

Matthew
01:41:47
I mean the the fact that they're sort of bit more senior, bit more experienced, slightly kind of detached from the general kind of rabble that makes up the rest of the ensemble, so they sort of float above it. they seem, you know, uh sort of unattainable in a way, you know, both quite sort of glamorous characters in their own way. I think John Sattery's absolutely brilliant. Like I'd never I you know seen him in anything before. And I feel like over the course of the season they tap into more and more like just just how good he is. You know, like he doesn't really make As it doesn't make as big of an impression in maybe like the first like five episodes, but I think in this one, yeah, you f you finally get this sense of like, oh, this guy's just really sly like really f like funny in like in the world funny, like very believably funny and a sort of uh, you know, person you want to spend time with. Joan's a weirder one because she She's she's like really unpleasant, which I'd forgotten about. Yeah, to the other women she is, yeah. She's like great in the company and she's like really loyal and hardworking and and she gets you know, dealt quite a a bad hand as the show goes on. But she's so like there's like a real bitterness to her. Yeah, like one of the you know, one of the knottier ones, like up there with Don for me, I think.

Samuel
01:43:06
Yeah, and definitely gets to have it gets a lot to do in subsequent seasons and Yeah, it's funny because it does uh someone uh compared um Roger's delivery, line delivery, um, to Bill Murray to me, and that really unlocked the character for me a bit of like, oh yeah, that is the kind of like very particular sarcastic energy. Their voices are very similar. His like cadence is very similar. And so I think he's able to bring so much to the show in that respect. It's perfect that he's got like this you know, white hair, um that he is like seems older than he actually is. Um it's uh a lot of that is kind of perfect and Uh yeah, I think um it's interesting because I think I feel like John Slattery maybe because he's credited as a special guest star in this season, maybe he wasn't like so into it and then realized what or or maybe he just thought, I'll you know, I'll hedge my bets a bit. And then obviously this becomes his defining role of his entire career. Um, and like he's su is such an amazing character who again goes on quite a journey in the seven seasons here. Um yeah, I r I really like I I I love them both and it's just amazing how all this ensemble as they dig into it, they there's so much talent there and so much potential with the characters. Uh they're just So well thought out. Um so we've got Freddie Rumson in this show, um who I think is a relative of actual Bill Murray, um, Matthew, I believe that's right. I think it's his brother, um, the actor who plays this guy Um, he is like an alcoholic um ads man. Um, does he only exist in this show as a plot device to move Peggy's career forward, which happens in this episode as she makes observations on um Belle Jolie lipstick and women not just wanting to be oh yeah yeah basket full of Yeah Yeah. It's like I guess so.

Matthew
01:44:49
'Cause I guess he represents the best mind they currently have on the account. And so to sort of show that they do need yeah, a new perspective. He basically exists to be the old bad perspective. Yeah. Um And not much else outside of that. I can't really remember what happens with him in later seasons. He's like an alcoholic then has to leave, basically. That's his um trying to set up a th like an agency with I think Peggy.

Samuel
01:45:16
You might be thinking of Duck Phillips.

Matthew
01:45:19
Duck Phillips, yeah, okay.

Samuel
01:45:21
Um, but it's um yeah, it's he does reappear later in the show, sober. Um but He's still very old school and Peggy's in a very different place when he comes back. That's what I remember about him coming back. But yeah, it's certainly these early seasons. It's In this, certainly in this season, all he really does is prop her up. And it's quite interesting because I didn't I didn't think about him as a a plot device at all when I first watched it, but it seems quite obvious watching it now that that's that is why he's there.

Matthew
01:45:46
Um the other thing I was gonna I was gonna say this episode has that great scene with the uh one way mirror where they're watching everyone put on the lipstick. Yeah, um didn't you say you made a note of um They all gather and uh the

Samuel
01:46:08
Ken Cosgrove, story published in the Atlantic, but also just like um HR disaster horn dog in in this sh in this episode. But Joan like she really leans into it. It's it's it's a funny scene. Well that's the interesting thing with Joan, isn't it? Is that She is fully aware of her what her exact power and position is in the office, but it's still one it's still a position where she's subjugated. And And then as like Peggy's career develops, she feels threatened by that on some level. And it's it's just really well a really well c well thought out character in terms of how she thinks about herself and how she slots into that office dynamic. She's Queen B, but like there are limitations to what that can really get you. Um yeah Um so, um and yeah, there's um uh uh there's a side plot in this where Don goes off with one of Midge's other lovers. um to uh go go watch uh some like beat poetry being read out. This show doesn't have a lot of respect for like hippies and counterculture, does it? Did you notice that watching this? I remember working with someone, uh imagine, who Criticize that as an element of the show. Like that they clearly do not give a fuck about those people and actually like dislike them and think of them as It's meaningless. Um but what what do you think?

Matthew
01:47:29
I mean the c I think the characters do. You know, it it basically exists as a punchline for sort of Don to go and sort of sneer at or roll his eyes at, you know. or at least realise the limit of the relationship he can have with this person because this world that she's in does like absolutely nothing for him. Yeah. But they are I mean they're definitely playing it for laughs. Um and probably uh yeah, laughing at it more than like with it. Um but that's that's okay. Like a show's gotta have some perspective. It can't be polite to everyone.

Samuel
01:48:07
No, it's true. Um yeah, I I it's a definitely a a good wrinkle, but again the midge stuff in this probably the least successful strand of the show. Um yeah Episode 7, Red in the Face. When Don invites Roger home for dinner, too much alcohol fuels repercussions between Don and Betty, and between Don and Roger. Joan puts Roger off for the weekend Spending time with her roommate Carol instead. Pete exchanges a wedding gift for a rifle and then shares a hunting fantasy with Peggy, laughing out loud thinking of that. Um I think it's one of the best Mad Men episodes ever. Um it's the episode where Um Roger um yeah does hit on Betty in a pretty ugly and pronounced way, um drunkenly, and Don is aware of what's happened and unnecessarily publish uh punishes um Betty for it. Um and then Don gets his revenge by basically um taking him out for cocktails and oysters, getting him really drunk and eating loads of this food that You know. Basically creating trouble and then paying the the elevator, the person who mans the elevator in the um Sterling Cooper building. um to pretend that it's out and they have so they have to climb up the stairs and ultimately causes Roger to vomit in the lobby of Sterling Cooper in front of the um in front of a potential client. In fact I think it's Nixon's people. He vomits in front of Richard Nixon's people. Yeah. Um and it's actually like one of the first big shocking moments in the show in terms of every now and then because the show's like sort of base frequency is quite mild that when something quite extreme does happen, it really seems like it might as well be a meteor hitting the planet, you know what I mean? So It does jump out. I I I love the the way that unravels in this. What do you make of this episode?

Matthew
01:49:54
I I th I thought this one was absolutely brilliant. The knottiness of whatever's going through Don's head when the way he chastises Betty for something which is like absolutely isn't her fault mega depressing but then at the same time he clearly like knows what's actually going on because he punishes Roger with this this brilliant scheme Yeah, Pete, and again, this this is one of the things that Pete with the hunting rifle, that feels very sort of soprano-y to me. A kind of just what the fuck is going on here and someone who just like introduces like a little bit of chaos into their life and and has some fun with it and then they just sort of see where it would naturally go, which is just Yeah, him swapping a a very chintzy chip and dip plate uh for a rifle and then his wife being really cross with how selfish he is. There's so many big laughs in it. but also some of the grimmest character relationship stuff. Perfect kind of cocktail.

Samuel
01:50:58
Yeah, there is like um something so ugly in the show when people drink too much. Like when it when the excesses take over. The it so the show's really good at showing like what an ugly side of their business it really is. Um it does remind me of um Going on PR lunches back in my imagine days where they take us out and we'd have like eight cocktails on THQ's dime or something. And then, um, or like going out with for Christmas dinner with Rockstar, then going back after a bottle of wine and then one of the editor-in-chiefs like tutting at us as we come back into the office being quite loud and obnoxious and being like Go Just the t just the tiniest bit of relating to that while I was making twelve grand a year and not living anywhere near the same world as these people, Matthew. Um I love the Pete Campbell and his rifle plot line. Um you say it's very soprano-zy, but I think it's just It's Pete's like sadness at the bad thing he's done. It's sort of it's just Pete can be such a child sometimes. And it's the fact that you don't even see Alison Bree on screen. You just hear her off screen berating him. And his sort of like slightly pathetic energy. Oh, it's so good. I just love it as a bit of Pete sort of like B plotting. It's really, really good. Um Episode 8, Matthew, the hobo goal.

Matthew
01:52:15
Well you gotta say uh um walking up the stairs with Roger to make him be sick at the top has got big Final Fantasy VII Shinra HQ energy. Yeah, it does. Um it does. Um if you don't take the lift, I suppose, yeah. Um endless stairs of like, oh my god, how many more of these stairs are there? And It's just like a a little it's a little kind of odyssey they go on and wait, even Don's pretty bad by the time he's reached the top. Yeah. But all in aid of um fucking Roger Up. No, like they bump into some like other characters along the way, like canoodling in the corridor and things. So it's good stairwell that. Yeah, it is.

Samuel
01:52:53
I love um the music that plays in that as well. It's like a little bit of like uh sort of repetitious David Carbonara scene setting where it's a little bit playful, but a little bit like the longer this goes on, the worse it's getting. Um Really, really good. And yeah, Don just knows that he can endure it better than Roger. That's um that's the interesting thing about it. And uh Yeah, it's it's really good stuff, man. Um one of my favorite episodes ever, like I say. Um and Don's face at the end, his grin as Roger is sat there looking like basically uh near death. Um just great stuff really. Um episode eight, the Hobo Code. Pete Campbell and Peggy Olston start an office romance. I don't think that's actually true. Um this summary is actually incorrect there. So Well done to the uh the the wiki people at fandom for that one I guess. Peggy's Peggy's copy for the lipstick account goes over well and the men in the firm congratulate her. A new telephone receptionist Lois Sadler takes a liking to Salvatore Romano, but his own interests seem to lie elsewhere. Hmm, wonder where where those are, Matthew. Um I'm not massive on young John Hamm flashbacks in Mad Men and this episode has uh quite a lot of them. Oh wait, no, that's not right. This one doesn't have them. This one has young Dick Whitman played by a different actor. And I think they work extremely well. In fact I would say this is probably my favourite flashback and definitely the most memorable one in the entire show. The actor they get to play the hobo in question, a man who lost his job in the Wall Street crash, um, is an e is excellent. And it's got that of mice and men feel of Dick Whitman grew up on this this farm and they're not rich either, but they make it work and that's all the work there is. Did did this stick in your memory similarly?

Matthew
01:54:47
Oh yeah, this is ri I you know, I don't remember this, but this is really, really good. Um and just sort of hits different. Um, you know, being a bit older, I like that it's him like Yeah, like basically the like learning about his his s stepdad or his is it his step no it is his dad. Yeah, that's right. His stepmum, that's right, yeah. But he's you know, he's It's complicated father relationship anyway. Um, but learning that he's like a a bad man or considered a bad man from you know, very unlikely source which is this sort of hobo basically leaving like a Google review on a fence post. Um That's what the hobo goad is. Uh I really like that that performance from the from the the hobo actor as well. That's Um Paul Schultz, who was um the very horny priest in Season One of the Sopranos.

Samuel
01:55:40
Oh right.

Matthew
01:55:41
Father Phil. He keeps coming round and he's Um Basically all the housewives fancy him and there's a suggestion he's he's about to have an affair with like six different housewives and eventually he kind of uh uh gets called out for it and is sort of humiliated. uh a great a great little kind of very minor character but very memorable. Does he have uh does he almost have a thing with Carmela, is that what happens? He he does, but then he she sees that he ha basically has the same routine with like an one of her best friends. Right. And so she kind of calls him out for it and says, you know, you're an awful man for doing this 'cause he's he's gonna He keeps going around to people's houses when their husbands are away and getting fed like huge Italian dishes. Um he's like this sort of like It's got this weird like feeder thing going on. Yeah, yeah. That's funny. Um great great. So uh but yeah, he that I I really I really like that scene. Uh those scenes are are brilliant in this

Samuel
01:56:36
Yeah, super super good. It's it's just that um you know I keep saying the John Cheever thing.

Matthew
01:56:41
Again, this is just very I guess like it is a bit I've not read any of these short stories. I should I I'm sort of like pretending I'm just like nodding along as if I know what that is.

Samuel
01:56:50
Well I only read it because everyone at the time was saying John Cheeva was like a a uh in inspired the kind of like sad writing of madmen and that they are like because of when they were written they are period stories and that they are about uh they are quite about quite sad small things like the um the one that sticks in my mem in my memory is there's this couple who get this radio that can tune into basically any of the um any of the apartments in their buildings they can hear the people um what they're like what's going on in their lives basically. And so and hearing their like, you know, their intimate secrets, their their arguments, and this couple become kind of fixated on doing it, but then um become more and more conflicted about it as they go and they learn more and more about it. And it basically Uh what it kind of the point it makes is that, you know, th to them, everyone around them seems unhappy, but then as they're they kind of like fight over this radio and what it's done to their lives, their lives are as m messed up as any of the people who are in the apartment block. And that's the one that really Stays with me. I think that might be his most famous it might be his most famous one, but um yeah, that certainly you know I read that about fifteen years ago and it's stuck in my brain clearly. Um I don't think I read the entire thing. I think I read like two-thirds of the like his his short stories. They are they're they're really really good.

Matthew
01:58:17
His famous story, The Radio That Could Listen Through Walls.

Samuel
01:58:23
I think it might just be called like the big radio or something like that. I can't remember. But in any case, yeah, I guess like um, you know, there is a bit of a Steinbeck kind of vibe to this as well. Um no doubt that is something he was going for. Um let's talk about Sal Romano a bit, Matthew. So I would say that it is evident that he is not His sexual orientation. I think it's fair to say that his sexual orientation is up for speculation in this show because of how how he conducts himself and how he interacts with people. I wanted to know. if you think that there's any awareness from his co-workers that he is secretly gay, or is a suggestion they just wouldn't know in the nineteen sixties because of, you know, the the world they lived in and where right how homosexuality was perceived.

Matthew
01:59:12
I read it that they absolutely know and sort of humor him. I know it sounds terrible, but I think there's when it cause whenever he's talking about women and he i it sounds very unconvincing and there's a lot of like side eye between the other like particularly the younger guys. People move on quickly. There's almost like a yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know, like almost like a we don't have to do that. Like we don't have to have this conversation because we know that's not really what what you're about. But it's almost like even though there's that, I think there's also an understanding that if he ever acted on it you know, it would be game over. So yeah, I i I d it's kind of a weird I sort of f I sort of flip flip-flop on this in terms of I think there are moments where I feel like They actually seem quite progressive in the way that they they kind of let it be and don't really question it. Yeah. Um but then there are other times where it feels like Oh, actually they are sort of smirking a bit as like, uh this guy, you know, 'cause he's clearly a really talented artist uh and you know, valuable to them in the company, which is maybe why they do kind of you know, again I say tolerate him, but you know, for the time. But yeah, it's he's a weird character. I I find him quite broad. Um he's like the he's maybe like the other character who doesn't like work for me one hundred percent along with like the mid stuff in this season just because I think it is quite big and on the nose. Um Yeah. But then there's the scene where like that the there's the scene where he's approached by the the other, you know, another kind of b closeted gay guy at another company. And you know, he acts uh uh you know, it's almost sort of front with a sort of front that it's that it that that he's been approached or you know, he's so kind of sort of s I don't know, scared of being found out that he kinda l won't l sort of let himself kind of give in to that part of him and you know, that's the more kind of tragic side of it. But I find in the office some of his sort of very out of place gossip and, you know, sort of terrible kind of a attempts at like sort of sort of catcalling i is is uh yeah quite embarrassing to watch.

Samuel
02:01:36
That's interesting. Cause I I think that I think you're right that the the men No, but it's like unspoken of what the kind of the rules are of him being there and him being allowed to exist there without it you know, without his orientation being questioned. Um But it's it's also but that some of the women do not know. Joan definitely knows, um you can tell. Yeah. Because Joan is just a little bit more worldly than some of the other women who work in this office. Um and yeah, but I think that maybe it it might also be a bit of the Betty thing where it's like Well, housewives were a feature of this time period, and so we want to draw attention to it. Closeted gay people were definitely a feature of that period too. But Sal obviously never gets the time d you know, to to develop in the same way that Betty does. And so I think that maybe it does leave it feeling a bit broad, like you identify there, you know. Um Thing is, I really like the actor and he is a character who exits the show and then never comes back. And I always thought it was a bit of a bummer, um, because he it's quite a it's quite a sad end to the character in some ways. Um but Yeah, and I do like some of the ways in which they peel back those layers, but I think I can see I think that's fair criticism.

Matthew
02:02:59
Um I think I think they they get into it a bit more like in the second season where he sort of is in a relationship and there's a bit more kind of going on, but here it's just like The one thing you need to know about this guy is he's secretly gay and like that's th there's like a lot of that in this season.

Samuel
02:03:20
Yeah, that's true. Uh I'll have you know that when I sing bye bye birdie, I'm very masculine, Matthew, but um Um this is also the last Midge episode. After this, like I say, all of Don's love interests intersect with his work or home life. I think it's a little bit, you know, structurally more streamlined. Um you didn't look like Midge, right? Were you happy that she got binned off at this point?

Matthew
02:03:40
Uh like I never really bought that relationship, but she it's not like a bad performance or anything. I think it's wild because Don gets that like huge check and then wants to take off to Paris, isn't that this episode? Yeah, that's right. There's something quite depressing about that of like Oh, I've got this huge windfall and I just want to blow it on not my family and not Betty and all that. That that's that's super super bleak to me. Especially because you see

Samuel
02:04:05
scenes where Don says they can't do certain things 'cause they don't have enough money that year. Yeah. And and you just realise how much he's in control of everything that's going on in Betty's life and Yeah. Um okay, um good segue into episode nine, Matthew. Shoot. Don is courted by Jim Hobart, head of a larger ad firm who offers him more money and more creative resources to join them. Betty Draper rekindles her interest in modelling after Hobart suggests that she should try it. She doesn't realise it's all part of the strategy to get Don on board. Perggy Olson is fretting over her weight gain but doesn't appreciate Joan's advice about getting ahead in the office. I think this is one of the this is probably the best ever Betty episode of Mad Men. Um, you know, it actually intersects with Don's life a little bit. She is being uh uh she's a pawn being manipulated um you know by uh a rival agency to y to to court Don and you know she gets chewed up in the machinery of of his career basically and it's heartbreaking for her. And I found it very effective and I thought January Jones is really, really good in this episode. Um, it also has a great device at the beginning and end of the episode where Um there is like a friendly neighbor with these birds. Um then halfway through the episode um the the dog that um Dom brought back in an earlier episode for the birthday party gets one of the birds um kills it and the neighbor threatens to basically shoot the dog. And then at the end of the episode having lost out on um the modeling career that she didn't know she wanted again, but then realized she really did because it was a part of you know her life that belonged entirely to her and She found it very validating. When that's taken away, um she gets out a rifle and starts shooting at this man's birds while smoking a cigarette. And I think one of the greatest shots ever.

Matthew
02:05:52
put on television is her with that cigarette hanging out of her mouth, um copying the rifle.

Samuel
02:05:57
Great stuff. What do you think of this episode?

Matthew
02:05:59
They've spent this whole season talking about like what's wrong with Betty or Betty worrying that there's something wrong with her and then She actually gets like a bit of drive, a bit of agency, and you get a sense of maybe who she was before she met Don or before she had children at least. you know, and and has a shot at this career, a thing she's, you know, good at and you know, does a good job of and yeah, it's just it absolutely tragic that it comes as part of this sort of other ad agency power play. So that that stuff's really strong. Um I I like the whole I I like it whenever Like Don is courted by another company, or there's some talk of like going to a bigger company, or what that means. Like, I like it when it gives us a bit of context about what would be attractive to these people or what speaks to them 'cause in this episode there's a lot of emphasis is put on the fact like if you come to us, you know, we're gonna let you work on an airline. which is, you know, you don't have an airline, that's that's gonna be one of the most exciting things possible for you. Um, you know, apparently in this world that is that's that's super exciting. But uh I I just like hearing, you know what i what is it would you use to try and bag, you know, this this talent at your company, you know, what is the thing that speaks to them and Um yeah, I just thought it was interesting that the the airline is seen as like the sort of holy grail of accounts to work on. Yeah, it's uh what's the airline again?

Samuel
02:07:27
It's a very famous American one. Pan Am, that's it. Really um, I like that as well actually, because that that's definitely, yeah, like a a larger part of what the show is. as it goes forward. And you also get a bit more of an idea in this episode of how Don is perceived by um Burt Cooper and Roger Sterling about what his value is and how they show that value to him. Um I think that's really good. I I I've read that there's a certain amount of dream logic in Mad Men um to some of the storytelling. And I definitely think there's times where that seems to be the case. Sometimes what you're watching might be an extension of reality rather than like what's actually happening. And I'm not saying that like this is like a hard fan theory thing. But do you think Betty is actually shooting at the birds at the end of this? Because there's never a follow-up to it. We never see the neighbor again. We never see what the fallout is of her just shooting all these birds. And like that if that happened in like your street in this kind of neighborhood. That would be like the thing people talked about for five years. Remember when like the housewife went insane and killed all these birds? That would be what everyone would say in the street about about the end of this episode. I don't know, just don't know what you thought of the the ending here.

Matthew
02:08:45
this season. Like she's she's been quite an outlandish presence in this neighbourhood, so I don't know if I'd necessarily blink an eye at her with the with a rifle. Um Yeah, I mean it's a great is a great image for sure.

Samuel
02:09:00
So Peggy starts gaining weight in these episodes. How do you rate the makeup, Matthew, for um larger um Elizabeth Moss?

Matthew
02:09:10
Yeah, I mean it's v it's very like prosthetics from like fifteen years ago. Um it's quite heavy-handed Like, I I I would have thought, you know, this writing team is very good at suggesting quite subtle character moments and beats. I'm surprised they couldn't find like a better way of illustrating this change, uh than banging her in like a giant sort of rubber body. Um It is yeah, it is quite unnatural. Is it it's uh it's pregnancy related, right?

Samuel
02:09:50
It is because in the I think the previous episode, that's when she has the um she sleeps with uh with Pete in the office. I th I think the suggestion is that it's from that second encounter rather than the first one. Right. So I th I believe that's the case. Uh so yeah. Um I was I'm always distracted by this because when I worked on X360 magazine, I worked with a guy who called Dave Shaw who said that she with the makeup on, the weight gain makeup, looked like Desperate Dan from the Dandy. And that just like ri I mean I don't think she does, but they do add like they sort of curve her chin a little bit. Yeah, yeah. And it does just doesn't quite look right. And then when you see her again in season two, you realise, oh yeah, Elizabeth Moss does look like a regular human being.

Matthew
02:10:33
You just forget because of how the makeup is done in this big season. I guess the the whole kind of sort of unknown unknown pro what's I don't know I can't remember what the term is for that when someone doesn't know that they're pregnant, apparently it happens. Um ph Phantom pregnancy is that phantom pregnancy is that what that is? Oh maybe might not be I don't know. Yeah, well i uh it's I know uh listen I know it happened, so I can't question it and be like, mm, seems unlikely. Um but it is it's like one of the s sort of It is one of the soapier kind of plot mechanics of this. You know, I I guess along with sort of Don's stolen identity I I feel like this stuff doesn't really happen as the show goes on. But I guess it you know, it sets up some other interesting stuff with her and the actual fallout of it all is quite interesting. But I don't know, I don't know if it's uh if I ever found it like Hugely believable as a plot.

Samuel
02:11:31
Yeah, I get what you mean. Um it's uh But she's smart, you know, she's not that naive. No, and it's sort of like it's her shape is still not really like pregnant. You know, she never really has like a you see uh I mean it's really obvious when someone's pregnant, even if they're like supposed to be in this case, like eating more from being in the office and the stress of being in the office and being objectified or whatever their their logic is for it. Um it's it's one of those leaps the show asks you to take as the audience. I think it's um fair to say it's quite soapy. I think it's it it definitely gives the relationship between Don and Peggy an interesting hook to go forward in terms of likely both in terms of their understanding of each other. But yeah. The other thing I wanted to ask about this episode, the Nixon and Kennedy storyline in this season, Matthew, does that do much for you? Uh not really.

Matthew
02:12:25
I think that that's mainly because I'm just uh uh i ignorant of what they stand for outside of like very broad strokes and also slightly confused about like the political alignment of certain characters. Yeah.

Samuel
02:12:39
Like the politics of their office is quite odd. Yeah, it's a bit strange. I think it's the show just wants to to demonstrate that it's grounded in that period and wants you to feel like the real world is happening outside of the the walls of that set of that office you know um that's that's my theory of why it's such a key part this ep this season. Episode 10, long weekend. I don't have many notes for this one, Matthew. Um this is the Roger Heart Attack episode. It's Labor Day weekend, and most of the men are sending their wives away for a few days. Don Draper's wife Betty is dreading the thought as her father and his new girlfriend, whom she detests, will be staying with them. With the election approaching, the team of Study and Cooper is gloomy since the Nixon campaign has not been following their advice. Roger Sterling was hoping to spend Friday night with Joan, but having just seen the movie The Apartment, she is feeling a bit used. Um yeah, don't have much to say here other than like this key Don and Rachel Menkin episode And, you know, they uh there's I think he reveals in this episode actually that, you know, he's not really called Don Draper. And it's certainly Does he get her to leave with him? This is already slipping out of my memory. It was like a week ago, Matthew, but this is certainly a key, a key moment in that relationship. Do you have any other observations about this episode? The s scene with

Matthew
02:13:53
Wh where they're like shacking up with the twins in the office is like really skeevy. Gross, yeah.

Samuel
02:13:58
Yes.

Matthew
02:13:59
Not good. Like these characters you're like, oh they're really cool and then you're like, this is actually like very seedy. These actresses look super young. And yeah, it's all it's also very grobby. Isn't it like Joan's flatmate is sort of in love with her? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and that again is just sort of like an awkward bit. There's a lot of there's a lot of scenes in Mad Men where someone like reveals a huge emotional truth about themselves and then the show's just like Well well, but uh you know, I think it's best that we just all forget about that and never ever talk about this again. And then the person's like, Yes, okay, I'll just swallow my true self forever. Yeah that happens a lot and that's and even this character who's only appears in this like one episode, you're like, Oh, I'm bummed for you that no one gets to be there. their like true self in this show. Yeah.

Samuel
02:14:49
Um and to sort of blot that out, um, Joan and her roommate pick up these two guys who are just so gross as well. Joan could do so much better. I mean like it's it's shocking the standard of guys she settles for here. Um and that's kind of a feature throughout the show. She ge shacks up with some slightly weird guys. She's definitely got an older man thing going on, Joan. But some of them you're like The state of that. I mean Jesus. Um Episode 11, Indian Summer. Um Peggy is given a difficult assignment. Roger's health-related issues provide new opportunities for Don, and Pete grows more frustrated. Betty finds an outlet for a growing dissatisfaction. So Roger's had the heart attack and he's doing a lot of reflecting. And there's a scene with Um him and Joan in this where he is being made up because he has to meet um Lee Garner Jr. and Senior, the Lucky Strike people, to reassure them, their biggest client, that he's okay despite his heart attack. And he's obviously not okay. And um Joan puts makeup on him to make him look a little bit less like he's dead, basically. Um and there's a line where he says, I'm so glad I got to roam those hillsides to Joan. That I think is my most my favourite bit of madmen dialogue ever. Because it's beautifully written, it's horny, but in a sincerely romantic way, and it perfectly encapsulates Roger as a character. Um that said I do think they they kind of uh I feel like they abandon a little bit the Roger Health problem thing in later seasons. Oh like why do you think they sort of rolled that back a bit so it wasn't like oh is Roger gonna have a heart attack every season basically.

Matthew
02:16:22
I mean I guess i if it hangs uh you know there's there's not much dramatically you can do with that and it would be a bit of a bummer And he is just like his fun mode is just too attractive a mode not to engage with. Yeah. So you have to kinda like brush it under the copper. He just miraculously gets like much healthier so he can go on all these adventures. Like If his if his weak heart stopped him going on his like drug odyssey and whatever that episode is, season five or season six. Um uh that would be s like a real tragedy. So um I'm glad that he gets better. I do like the bit where they all they all the fallout of them it bringing him in for the meeting and he has like a second like micro heart attack and everyone's absolutely horrified that A they'd bring him back in and that he's gonna like jeopardize this account and they're sort of sheepishly trying to deal with the lucky strike guys. uh there's a lot of truth in like just the pure shamelessness of business.

Samuel
02:17:20
Um yeah. It's got a bit of the energy of that episode where Homer goes down the gorge in the Simpsons on the skateboard. And then the ambulance drives off and then like the bed tumbles out and he goes down the gorge again. There's just the tiniest whiff of that to this storyline. Um kind of sad for Betty that, you know, she invites an air conditioning man into her home um in this episode. And there's like the suggestion of sexual fantasy to it. Even though I don't think the air conditioning man's actually thinking that at all. I think he's just hoping to to sell something. Um he didn't seem like that look like he was tuned into that at all. Just wanted to note that that that was a bummer because she has all these invisible expectations that Don has set for her that rules that he does not live by himself. And so Yeah, I mean what a bastard really. Um so yeah, I mean I um don't really have anything more to say on that episode, Matthew, so I'll bounce to the next one, which is a really fun episode, episode 12, Nixon versus Kennedy On election night, um the Sterling Keeper staff pulls an all-nighter filled with debauched antics while watching the returns. Pete's ambitions cause him to challenge Don directly. Don remembers his past as a soldier in the Korean War Um so at the end of the last episode, Pete got the box from uh Adam, Don's real brother, that was um yeah, it was addressed to it was basically it reveals that he's Dick Whitman. And so in this episode We have Don being blackmailed for the the now vacant head of accounts job. Don has been promoted as a result of Roger's heart attack and obviously being um almost being poached. It's the second big Pete versus Don moment of the season. I actually forgot that there were two moments like this, uh Matthew. Um, I think not knowing how Burt Cooper is going to react to the revelation of Don Jacob being Dick Whitman really makes this. Um, what do you think of what do you make of this whole plot?

Matthew
02:19:08
I love that the thing that seemingly triggers Don to sort of call Pete's bluff on it is Peggy voicing that, you know, why is it so many, you know, bad people just get to do whatever they want around here? and she sort of uh speaks to Don's sort of you know the the core s the at the very core of him there is like a there is a righteousness um despite all his terrible behaviour um that she sort of gets through and I think that's you know, so he he's kinda happy to kinda call the bluff because it's the right thing to do is just to not let the sort of snotty, well-off people kind of r walk all over you. Um yeah, it's a big you know, we were talking earlier about the kind of class stuff in this. It's like the big biggest class play. of Peggy kind of yeah tapping into that bit of him. I really like that and I really like that um Burt doesn't give a shit because he's clearly just like so driven by profit and sees the value in Don that he doesn't really care, you know, what he does as long as he keeps doing it. Um yeah, I mean that's my read on it anyway.

Samuel
02:20:18
But Yeah, I think that's just right. I also really like Burt's observations on loyalty and how firing Pete may not necessarily be the right outcome for this, even though he gives Don the opportunity to do so. Um yeah, and so I really I really like that. It's a great kind of culmination of the whole back and forth between Pete and Don this whole season. Um and also I think by clearing the decks for this they allow both characters to move on to different plots in the next few seasons, which is a really good good writing move.

Matthew
02:20:47
Um but but also he brings up um s I think like a Japanese idiom that uh a man is what he a man is whatever room he is in, he says. Um what kind of man are you? What room are you in?

Samuel
02:21:02
I think that's a good observation about how people morph themselves to the situation and I don't know, I mean like I um Uh I don't know, I feel like uh I don't know, I don't really know how to answer this.

Matthew
02:21:17
I'm in a dining room with like terrible damp problems.

Samuel
02:21:20
That's the room I'm in. Am I that? Um, I have two empty beverage glasses on my desk, loads of like discarded tissue from where I've got a slight sniffle. Um a limited run version of like Doom Eternal on Nintendo Switch. This has just been recently cleaned. Up until about a week ago, it looked like a dog lived here by itself. But I had a flat inspection so I've really sorted out. Loads of fucking Batman comics behind me on a big shelf. Um you would be so disgusted with how I stack my books, Matthew. It's like a fucking like disaster. No, I just need some proper bookshelves really. You wouldn't approach it. Um no, that was a de that was a separate pile. That's a different problem brewing elsewhere in the flat. Um yeah, this all has to be resolved at some point. Um anyway, yes. Um I do enjoy that that um that idiom and I do think that this is a yeah there's a great bit of dramatic tension to this. Um the party sequence though I think is the most fun bit of the episode because They wait until the management had cleared out and then they basically have um yeah, like this uh uh everyone drinking a lot of this disgusting menthol based um liqueur. And um yeah, just Uh getting wasted, sleeping with each other, sort of like falling out. I mean, it's just really, really good.

Matthew
02:22:37
Um It's so accurate a depiction of an office party that I found myself fretting for them in the way that I do at actual Christ uh actual office parties where I'm like, oh no, what's if someone knocks a d a computer over and we can't fix it Uh that's that's the kind of person that I am. I can't even have fun at a fictional party.

Samuel
02:22:59
Oh, I definitely had a like a couple of dramatic Christmas parties at Imagine that just had like various personal dramas going on. Um and like it it does bring to mind that I I definitely don't have parties like this now. I'm way too old to to behave like the blokes doing this or any like even approaching that. Um but yeah I know what you mean. Like there's a there's a bit of a like I feel bad for Peggy when someone's vomited in her bin. And like no one will own up to it or even care or even engage with her about the whole thing. Um and I love when they find um Paul Kinsey's terrible play, um, which has a character called Ho Cosgrove in it um who is referred to as a hack, that hack Cosgrove. And then Ken just goes, that's Crackerjack Kinsey. I I mean, all that stuff is so so good, right? I mean, yeah. I this this this gets to reveal a lot about that's sort of like third tier of characters in the show, right? That that sort of develops as it goes. Mmm. Yeah. Like I think that Kinsey being a shit writer ends up being the feat and not very good at his actual job, ends up being the feature of the the whole thing of that character really. And finally Matthew the Wheel, the f episode thirteen. Betty discovers a secret leading her to re-evalue her marital situation. Uh that secret, by the way, is that um her therapist is indeed um spying on her for her husband. Um Pecky gets promoted but receives news that may interfere with her career, I'll say Pete brings in an account through his father in law but has to commit to his wife in return. Don't professional and private lives affect each other in curious ways as he's left to fend for himself. Don elects not to spend Thanksgiving with Betty's family. Um I mean one of my questions here was why is Matthew Weiner's son in this show and why is he so fucking weird? But we've covered that already Matthew. He is weird.

Matthew
02:24:54
Just don't do it.

Samuel
02:24:55
It is odd. She's just uh yeah, either it's because she does relate to someone who's that young because she is infantilized as the show. later point, you know, makes a ca makes a case for. Or she is just so desperately lonely. She'll talk to anyone who she feels will engage with her. um or understand her in some in some way. Um that is weird. Um the carousel uh the for for Kodak, I you know, it is the sorta like signature fictional ad of this entire show, right? The pitch meeting is probably the most famous moment of the entire show. Um is it a good ad, Matthew?

Matthew
02:25:36
I mean he sells it in the room. Yeah, I think so. Achieves everything it's meant to achieve. I like that it's such a good ad that it sort of seemingly sells them on his own family for a little bit. Um which is like mega depressing. Um like it's almost in like miniature like what happens at the very end of the whole thing, you know, at the end of the the last season where It's it's kind of like everything we've learnt about him this season kind of adds up to this this this brilliant kind of pitch, you know, where you know everything he almost like learns across his life. you know, adds up to this this brilliant idea at the end of the the very show, um which won't spoil if you haven't seen it. I do think it's really sad, like, that he has that little that sort of fake out straight after where he sort of rushes home to be with his family. And then it's sort of revealed that it's it's like not real and his house is empty and you're like, oh, this is just really grim. For a second you think he may have like fixed himself. Um and fixed everything with this one's advert. It's just an advert in it.

Samuel
02:26:41
It's a great final moment because it got me thinking, what if Mad Men was cancelled after that? And You know, a show it's it's it's hard to even imagine a show this good, a world where it could get cancelled just because the sheer quality of it is so obvious, you know? It's like I as a commissioning, you know, editor or producer you'd be like, well we can't cancel this. Have you fucking seen it? It's like thirteen of the best episodes of anything I've ever seen. Um but imagine it did and then people watch this sad moment as that was like the last bit of Mad Men you ever saw. You'd be like, oh there was this brilliant incredibly sad show that was on AMC, you know, t eighteen years ago. That oh my god, there's like they released a DVD of it ten years ago and it's like it'll cost you eighty quid to get on eBay, but you must watch it. Like That could have been mad men's reality, you know, um, but um fortunately it wasn't. I uh yeah, I think I agree the carousel is a good ad. That's a great bit a great contrast at the end. And then yeah, you do have the um Peggy's actually pregnant reveal here. Um, and it is still something that people argue about on Reddit, actually. Uh I did a bit of reading on this. Um phantom pregnancy is not the correct term by the way, Matthew.

Matthew
02:27:55
Unrecognized pregnancy is the Phantom is when it it looks at you're pregnant but you're not

Samuel
02:28:00
Yeah, you it's like a combination of psychological and hormonal factors that lead to that, basically. Um so yeah, it's um it is uh it is a leap the show will ask you to take. And it is I remember watching it at the time thinking, what? That came out of nowhere. Um yeah, anything more to say on this on this plot? Do you like the way that it's picked up again in season two? Because it does lead to a great What are the all-time great Don Draper lines and scenes, you know?

Matthew
02:28:26
I I haven't rewatched season two yet. You know, I'm going to off the back of this episode, but I don't really remember what happens, um, apart from it being like A bit sad for all involved, but eventually okay for Peggy's professional life. So yeah, I I need to pick I need to pick that up. But um Yeah, it's it's I like I s I said earlier, I I I I do find it uh a little bit soapy. You know, I know that it it goes to some interesting places and it creates some interesting common ground between Peggy and Don. That's what I do remember. And that's like worth it, but I think in this particular moment, it almost serving it up as a twist is a bit odd. This isn't really a twist show.

Samuel
02:29:12
Yeah, that's true. It's really odd.

Matthew
02:29:13
But where it's a bit like, you know how you all thought sh you know, we were sort of s saying she was getting a little fat in the office. Well actually it's because dum dum dum and that's uh I don't know. It doesn't do it doesn't play tricks anywhere else.

Samuel
02:29:27
No, I mean the other, you know, if you had to make a list of like the top ten twists in Mad Men, this would be in the top five. The lawnmower would be in the top five. I don't think there'd be much more in that list, you know? It's probably Roger vomiting would be in that list, to be honest. That's how um yeah, that's how few twists really occur in Mad Men. Um Yeah. Um okay, well that's season one, Matthew. Um did you have fun revisiting that? I I found this very a very cozy rewatch despite how sad the show is. How about you?

Matthew

Yeah, I d I did enjoy it. I was watching a lot of it uh before work. I'd get up and watch an episode between eight and nine and um Yeah, it was fun fun going to work. I mean l especially like I said because I do you know, we do do you know client work now and pictures and whatnot and it's nothing like this and it's it's the stakes are completely different but Um I do I know the sting of work that isn't accepted and the joy of uh w work that well, maybe not dazzles, but you know, gets you over the line. Uh so yeah, I have a newfound uh respect for the fine work that they they do in this show.

Yeah, for sure. I mean the closest I ever really get is like PR pictures, you know? And it's sort of like those are those can be fun, but every now and then I'll pick one where I'm like, oh that's too general or I'm not sure I've got fully got my arms around that one and then I read it back or I th it sounded really good in the moment and then after I've sent it I'm like oh that could have been stronger and Yeah, there's there's just a I think if you work in any creative industry, there's something about this show that's relatable. Um but it also just looks amazing, you know, from the sets to the the actors themselves, the costume design. It's a really yeah, uh you know, it is a sad show, but for some reason I find it like a a real comfort watch now. So um yes.

Like I say it's just gonna show how bleak things are in the rest of the world. That that that this pocket of awfulness seems great.

It's like well th they thought this is as bad as America would ever get in the sixties. They had they had no idea what was to come, you know. I thought that watching Nashville recently actually. What in the s that's a bit like Oh, can you believe how bad America is in the mid-70s? And I'm like, you got no idea, brother. You have no idea what's coming. Yes, anyway. Um okay that was the episode. Thank you so much for your support. We recognise this as quite niche, however, would love to hear some feedback on this.
