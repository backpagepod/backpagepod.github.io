Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined today by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
How's things with you, Matthew? How are you getting through these unending lockdown days? A question I think I asked almost exactly on the last two podcasts I've had.
The only thing that keeps me going is that promise of 20 more minutes of WandaVision every week.
I think you're gonna say the promise of 60 more hours of Yakuza in every single Yakuza game, because that's what you're doing at the moment, right? You're burning through those.
Yeah, I'm still, spoiler alert, I'm still on Yakuza 1.
Nice, okay, yeah. Yeah, it's funny, because I've mentioned that before I've been playing Ghost of Tsushima, and I'm just coming up to the point where I've unlocked the last island, and I'm 57 hours in, and it's like, yeah, I sort of, I started this game in December and thought this will be the year I clear my backlog, and like, it's almost March, so I think I've really just shat the bed on that one.
Yeah, I'd make this point before about living on the island you've unlocked. At this point, you've unlocked the majority of the island. You've got two-thirds of it is under your control.
Really call it a day now.
Yeah, the Khan can have like the top bit.
Let the Khan have it. Let him have the third island. You've got the majority of it.
It's a win. That is a win.
Yeah, also the combat is, it's like not that complicated. It's a bit more complicated than Assassin's Creed is, but like now I've been doing it for so long that it's been getting quite repetitive, but in the last five hours, I've unlocked the ghost stance, which basically means that if you kill five enemies without taking a single bit of damage, you do this move where the screen goes black and white and you can insta-kill three enemies in a row, and that's pretty fucking cool. There's a bit where you chop the boots head off.
That's good.
Oh, that sounds great. I never got that far. I got to the second island and thought, nah.
Again, you wanted a broker with the game. Look, you've got one island now. Like, just get on with your lives and we'll move on.
Well, I got to the second island and then a load of bastards turned up on the first island, setting a light to all the buildings I'd liberated. And I was like, what's all this about? This doesn't seem fair.
Yeah. Oh, man. Open World Games.
What a trip. Matthew, before we get into this week's episode, I'll explain what the episode is shortly. But it's been a kind of week of minor gaming revelations.
I suppose I was curious if you had any take on the big news of the week. We like to keep this podcast timeless if we can because a lot of people discover them after the fact when they've listened to one they like and they go back and listen to the rest. So we try not to be two of the moment unless it's super relevant.
But here I thought it was reasonably interesting. Did you tune into the Sony state of play this week? I did.
Did you get excited about Crash Bandicoot 4 in 60 frames per second?
I thought it was funny. When you open with Crash, you know you're in trouble.
People were so hyped for it. There was so much chat online about, we're going to see God of War, they're going to announce some new games, we're going to see this, that and the other. And then when you open with Crash, you're like, something's wrong here.
So wrong.
I thought it was fine. It felt like very much a rehash of their last state of play. It was pretty much the same line up.
It was more like an update on, remember those games from six months ago? Here's how they're doing and here's how they're looking.
It began and ended with games that you can already buy and play on your PS4, which I thought was bold.
We have said on this podcast that is one of the appeals of PS5 at the moment is just playing all the games you liked from the last gen, but very shiny with nice frame rates. So I'm glad they did that. I was hoping they were going to announce a load of first party things.
They've just done God of War. I'd quite like them to do Uncharted 4 at 60 frames. That would be nice.
Oh yeah, that would be good. And Horizon as well. That would be nice.
I think that ticks off most of the major ones. Bloodborne, of course. That's the one everyone wants.
Yeah, that's the one everyone prays for. Yeah, I thought this was fine. I thought Deathloop looked absolutely amazing and pulled off the incredibly hard trick of a very good pastiche of a James Bond theme tune.
I actually really liked the song in the trailer. I thought it sounded great and it really sounded of a kind of piece with those sort of older Bond themes. People kind of parody that stuff a lot, but it's actually quite hard to get right, I think.
And it just, I don't know, that game kind of clicks for me a little bit more the more we see it.
Yeah, it feels like they're sort of in the difficult position of, we've made another immersive sim game with a bit more action, and we want to sell this as a kind of fun action game. And they are sort of doing their best to kind of pull that off, and I respect that. I think it looks really good, but it does look like it's got a lot, it shares a lot of DNA with Dishonored, right?
Like the movement and the combat, which, you know, is no bad thing for me, but has always traditionally seemed like a hard sell to a sort of mainstream audience.
Yeah, definitely. But I think the fact that... I don't...
I'm sort of selfishly... I'm glad that they're leaning into that more. I'm glad that, you know, there's more obvious Dishonored powers in there.
You know, there's the kind of the blink and the domino power and things like that are quite fun. I mean, I've not... I was a little worried if it was just going to be standing alone as like an action game, because I don't know, you know, from watching it, my concern was always that the gunplay didn't look particularly great.
It looks a little floaty and you can never tell until you try these games for yourselves. But just looking at the footage, I was thinking, does this look quite right as a shooter? So I'm glad that there is more to it.
Also, interestingly, there was a little interview with the director, the creative director, was talking about like going into a bit more depth about how it worked and was saying you're in this time loop, but you're not against the timer. It's not like you die, you know, which I sort of assumed it would be for some reason. I assumed it would be like a couple of hour loop or something, but it seems that the messaging was you can take your time and you can kind of feel this world out a bit, which to me is like a very key ingredient of the Dishonored games, and I was worried that that might be missing from this.
So, yeah, I think it's going to, I think you're right, I think it's going to be a lot more Dishonored than it maybe looks.
Yeah, and I think fair play to them, like being exclusive on PS5 I think will be good for them because people will be looking for things to play on that console, and obviously so much is going to get pushed back this year. So there's a release in May in between Returnal and your favorite series, Ratchet and Clank, Rift Apart, which I know is obviously your most anticipated game of the year. Yeah, so I think just that kind of association will probably get people who wouldn't have tried it before actually to pick up this kind of probably quite oddball sort of immersive simmy game.
But yeah, I thought it looked impressive too. What did you make of some of the other stuff there, Matthew? Did you have any opinion on the Final Fantasy 7 stuff they revealed?
Yeah, I mean, that one's odd because it looks like they've added a substantial amount. But I know that all the people are really nuts that game have already played. I'd kind of be kicking myself a little bit if I had played it that recently.
And to then think, well, this is all fine. But it won't be like, you know, the majority of this I'll have played before. I don't really know.
Like, as someone who has played it, are you pumped for the idea of replaying it?
Well, I don't think I'd replay it. But I think it's cool that like if you had missed it the first time or if you wanted to replay it, the redo they've done it looks like that spot on what we just talked about. You know, 60 FPS upgrade looks really crisp.
I think that, yeah, that's like that is like a nice thing to sort of enjoy. You made the joke, of course, Matthew, about how you can now retrieve 4K urchins in the game side quests, which I enjoyed. I also found it quite funny that on Twitter people were kicking off about the name being daft.
It's like Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrate. And yes, it is daft. But like, have you ever paid attention to a Square Enix game title?
They're quite into these very silly game names. Besides, in the week after Project Triangle Strategy, surely the Final Fantasy VII ones are less egregious.
A nice upgrade. It made me chuckle that they're giving away as PS Plus. But, if you get the PS Plus version, you don't get the PS5 upgrade.
Yeah, that was so confusing. They also happen to be remaking Final Fantasy VII again on mobile. I thought it was quite cool, actually.
People seemed to have a problem with that as well. I thought it was all fine. If you like Final Fantasy VII, you don't have to play it.
I thought it looked good. How about the other stuff, Matthew? Did Returnal take your interest at all?
How into that sort of games vibe are you? This arcade-shootery thing?
Again, I have to try it for myself. I think to see how it feels. It's not quite my cup of tea.
I don't even know really how to place it. It looks a bit of... It reminds me a bit of that...
What's that Capcom one with the person who used to jump around a lot?
The person who used to jump around a lot?
It's like a third person behind. It's got a weird name, PN03.
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.
For some reason, I always think of that whenever I see this sort of arcade-y, over-the-shoulder thing. Yeah, like, at Housemarque Studio, I sort of... I get that their stuff is really admired by people with a real kind of arcade sensibility, but I don't necessarily share that sensibility.
It's not quite my cup of tea. But I'll definitely give it a go. You know, I'm interested to see how it does that.
You know, I like kind of time loopy games. I do like games that try it and sort of take the kind of roguelike, roguelike thing and do slightly more kind of poppy things with it. You know, I'm open for it being really, really good.
Yeah, I think the thing that sort of made my blood run slightly cold is remembering that that game is 70 quid. And so that's like... Yeah, yeah, all PS5 first party games of that scale, I guess, are 70 quid.
And I thought, I don't know, I don't want to spend 70 quid to play this. And I don't think about price that often with games, but that 70 pound price point does make me think twice a little bit.
Yeah, like at a push you'd go, you know, an ultron, shiny, amazing new Uncharted 5, even then I'd slightly begrudgingly pass over my 70 quid as like a pure gatekeeping fee, I have to pay it to play this thing. But that's a big, that is a big ask. I thought, yeah, for some reason in my head, I thought it was going to be like a 30 pound, 25 pound thing.
Yeah, that would have been spot on, but no, you go onto your PS5, it's there on the store homepage, 70 quid, that's like...
Blouses.
Yeah, that's going to be a point of contention this generation for sure. But Matthew, what else happened this week? So we had the Pokemon something or other, Pokemon Presents, I think it was, live stream where they revealed a remake of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, two games that when they came out, I remember thinking, oh, this is nostalgic, it's the DS times and I can play a Pokemon game.
And now those games are being remade 14 years later. Yeah, so they're remaking Diamond and Pearl as Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Did you have any thoughts on this?
I mean, we're not really Pokemon people, right? We talked about the idea of doing a Pokemon episode and we don't think we're quite up to it.
No, I mean, I've spoken before about, we had to do Pokemon stuff in the mag, not begrudgingly, well, I did it begrudgingly. I had to write a lot about Pokemon without really caring for it. It's always been a bit of a hole in my sort of Nintendo fandom, probably the big hole.
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of weird because, yeah, it's odd to see them remaking games which came out, like, when I was doing mags, you know, we covered Diamond and Pearl in NGamer, you know, I remember, so we're getting into the realms of, we're going to start catching up with the remakes soon, you know, and it'll be like, we're going to do remakes of the remakes, you know, is it going to be, yeah, HeartGold and SoulSilver or whatever it was, you know, are we going to start repeating, is it just going to eat itself and carry on remaking itself forever?
Yes is the answer to that.
Yeah, I mean, that's just fine. I think people already know whether they're going to like those things or not. I don't think they can do anything to those games to turn on people who aren't interested.
I mean, it just is what it is, and it's massive. So why would you? What did you make of the new Pokemon?
Yeah, so Pokemon Legends Arceus, or Arceus. Pokemon fans, I'm sure, will be tearing their hair out hearing me say that and not knowing the difference. My little brother has explained to me what this Pokemon is before.
It's like the God Pokemon, right? And it's like, I don't know, in the kind of realm of Pokemon mythology, I suppose it sounds vaguely interesting. But to me, from the outside looking at it, it looked like the Pokemon version of Breath of the Wild.
So it was the more interesting of the two things they revealed. What did you make of it?
Yeah, basically that vibe. I thought it looked pretty shonky.
Yeah, a bit cheap. A bit cheap looking, I thought.
But that's Game Freak. That's through and through. Their games have never been visual wonders, but they've always seemed to get a pass.
I thought they kind of plotted along with their old 2D look for so long, and when they did their first jump into pseudo 3D, those games were ugly as hell. They were so ugly, and that was always the most egregious bit of covering them in the mags. It was always like, wow, this is such a jump forward.
And I remember just thinking, no, it's not. They look terrible.
Is that the 3DS ones you're talking about there?
I think they didn't bring in a bit of pseudo 3D into the last DS one. I swear, Black and White had...
Black and White.
A town which was like a... It was almost like a 25D, like rotated on a plane kind of thing.
Yeah, that's right.
But they've never been a visual powerhouse, which I don't really understand because those games make more money than anything in the world. You know, they have so much money to throw at them and to add vacuous polish, which is basically what I'm asking for. For a series I don't like.
Well, I don't think it would change the fundamental appeal of those games if they just actually looked nice. Yeah, I thought this... I don't know.
I saw someone put the kind of character on a grassy sort of plateau side by side with Link stepping out onto that cliff at the start of Breath of the Wild, and it was like the Pokemon one looked like a sort of pre-viz for Breath of the Wild from like ten years before Breath of the Wild. It's almost like a sketch you'd do on the... Something like this is what we want Breath of the Wild to eventually look like, not five years after Breath of the Wild, here's where we're at.
I'm a big believer that art design can carry these things. Being a Nintendo fan has never been necessarily about the raw visual heft of things. But I always think that they're just taking their fans for a ride a bit.
I'd be really cross if something I loved kind of treated me with that much kind of contempt to release something that looked as ropey as it does. But that's why I like other franchises, not Pokemon, because I'm not a fool and will not be taken for one.
I'm a game freak. Brutal. I must admit though, I do sort of agree with you.
I don't understand why, I mean, if you compare Pokemon to any other major Nintendo series, it does look several steps down in terms of visual quality. And you do think, with all that money, you could hire a load more artists and make these games look shinier. And I think the problem is that this seems like quite a bold departure in setting.
It's set like you're making the first Pokedex and exploring this world with slightly more historical elements. And I just thought it would look quite boring. And I thought nothing about the setting really captured my imagination.
The idea is great. I think that's a great idea for a game to kind of like lean more into a sort of open world Pokemon experience. But yeah, I agree with you.
I don't know why it looks so cheap. It seems just bizarre when I think Sword and Shield were like the best selling entries in like a decade or a decade plus.
Yeah, I mean, I guess the fans get what they ask. You know, if you're going to buy games which do look the way they look and you're going to give them a pass, then why bother? Why bother improving things?
I do feel like maybe the tide is turning a little bit. Like the Pokemon chat that reaches me these days, and I don't go looking for it. In fact, I've muted a lot of terms on Twitter so I never hear about it.
I see a lot more dissent and annoyance from fans about certain decisions. Anything I hear about Pokemon tends to be a bit more negative these days. But I don't know if that's just because I've done such a good job of sticking the positive Pokemon discourse in a Twitter limbo.
So it might be that.
I'm more curious about some of the Pokemon indies that are coming out. My pal Jay Bayliss is working on Cassette Beast, which he was the artist on Wargroove at Chucklefish. Really nice looking game.
So capturing that Nintendo aesthetic, but kind of contemporizing a little bit of an indie spin.
And I noticed that Ten-Ten seemed to get quite a bit of love when he came out.
Yeah, I think there's some more kind of like monochrome Game Boy looking ones too. So yeah, maybe it'll be like, you know, Metroidvanias in a few years and we'll just be awash with them. But yeah, that was the contemporary games chat I wanted to do, Matthew, before we got into today's episode.
So this one then, it's been on the cards for a little while, but basically the premise of it is the trial of Samuel Roberts. I have been buying hoarding games on eBay for like several years now. And it's like a habit I've sort of slipped into, particularly during the pandemic, because you can't really go to a pub or do anything at the moment.
So you might as well just spend your money on complete horse shit. And I know a lot of people are sort of doing this. I don't buy like loads of really elaborate, expensive stuff, but I do buy a lot of like what the fuck kind of purchases.
And I thought it might be fun to run through like a whole bunch of those in a row, Matthew. And then you kind of deliver your verdict on whether I go to some kind of like games prison at the end of it or not.
Yeah, yeah, basically, it's as well thought out as that games prison. You're going to go to games. Yeah, I should make it known that I don't know what a lot of these games are, because I know that you buy a lot of games, but you also talk about it in quite vague terms, which does suggest that they are of dubious quality or of baffling kind of intent, you know.
So I am intrigued to see what this this ancient games collection kind of looks like.
Yeah, and to be clear, this is like definitely a kind of a like a lighter episode, like off the back of Best Games of 2007, like a three hour episode, we wanted to just sort of, you know, do like a slightly shorter, leaner one. And I've been looking for a way to audit my shitty purchases for content for some time. And here we are.
So there's that. But also, Matthew, in our first section, we're going to answer like a reader question that sort of like ties into this quite nicely and talk about games buying habits. So yeah, we've just we talked for a little while there.
So why don't we take a short break? We'll come back and we're going to talk a bit about games ownership and the idea of a kind of pile of shame, as it were.
Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.
Matthew, so the listener question that we had to kick off this conversation was from William Lobly on Twitter. We already thought of this idea a little while ago to put me on trial for my shitty game purchasers, but this tied in quite nicely. So we thought we'd talk a bit about sort of game ownership.
So, hey Japs, love the podcast. Quick question, you frequently mention how long to beat, and I'd be interested to hear each of your Steam collection totals. Not only a bit of a laugh, but might make me feel better about my own backlog.
Thanks. So Matthew, do you have your sort of Steam library totals at hand? And is it that relevant because like, you're kind of a more recent PC gaming convert, right?
Yeah, so I really wasn't doing much PC gaming before I started working on Rock Paper Shotgun. So yeah, it's pretty patchy. By total, do we just mean the total number of games we own on Steam?
Yes, yeah.
Yeah, my total is 324.
Okay, my total is 1001.
Yeah, so I feel like I should qualify that a little bit by saying that obviously I worked on PC Gamer for six years, so a long time. In that time, obviously you get sent a lot of games for coverage and stuff like that. Some of the stuff in here is like, because of the way Steam doesn't really categorize things properly, I've got Arma 2 in here and Arma 3 about ten times each, either because of their expansions or they've got different servers or whatever it might be.
That's because on PC Gamer we did quite a fun Arma Olympics feature, so the Bohemia, the developer, sent us all of the expansions so we could play it. So it kind of stacks up, but I definitely have some bad hoarding habits in here. What about you?
What's the overall vibe of your Steam collection, Matthew?
I think it's okay, actually. Where it maybe gets a little weird is we did a segment on Rock Paper Shotgun, the YouTube channel, called Reviews Roulette, where we basically just... Any Steam codes that got sent to the Rock Paper Shotgun kind of general account and didn't make it to the main site, hadn't been claimed for proper write-ups or reviews, we just played them sort of sight unseen on the YouTube channel in a little video, and we played like ten minutes, and then decided on the spot whether we'd want to play more of it or not.
And that was like the review. It was quite popular, except I always used to feel terrible because I remember thinking, these people who'd spent all this hard work making these games, but then here's this absolute shit head saying like, I'm only going to play five minutes of it and make a judgement. Which is like basically everyone's worst idea of what a Gamescom journalist is like.
So I feel like I set the course back several years with that one. But I did it for lols. So yeah, I did it for the lols.
Yeah, that's it. That'll be on your gravestone, Matthew. Yeah, I sort of, it's funny, actually, your thing about being sensitive towards developers, because I have that now too.
And I cut a load of stuff out of the 2007 episode where I was dunking on PlayStation Home. Like, I called it a piece of shit, and I felt so bad afterwards, because I thought, I played this for about three hours. I have no idea who made this.
And like, if I heard this, how would I feel? And I would feel terrible. So I deleted it, because I felt bad.
So I totally feel you on that. Yeah, exactly.
You got that power.
Well, there you go. Again, I'm just trying to keep the, you know, just trying to like fight the cause, man. It's tough out there.
So yeah, I was curious, Matthew, about what your relationship with games buying is generally, because I sort of like, I'm definitely leaning more towards being a sort of hoarder type. I've tried to keep it leaner in recent years because I don't own property. So when I move house, it's a fucking nightmare.
So you don't want to necessarily have like 45 PS2 games following you around every time you move house. So I'm a bit more careful with that. But what about you?
What are your sort of like game buying habits like generally?
I mean, they're massively skewed because of the career I've had. And I will preface this by saying I've been very, very lucky to work on Nintendo mags where I got most of my Nintendo games. We either had kind of communal copies I could borrow to play or download codes, which I claimed.
It's slightly very fragmented because of that. One of the annoying things because of Nintendo's lack of shared profiles or profiles that you could easily transfer between machines, I've amassed over the years several 3DS which has got three games I like, another 3DS which has got 10 games I like, an American Wii U which has got this on it, two UK Wii U's which have got that and that on it. So it's a bit of a nightmare.
It's mainly digital all over the place. I have to turn everything on and plug everything in to find anything. So my Nintendo collection is basically a massive bust at this point.
I'd say the games that I own the most of are probably 360 games because I didn't get them for free because I had to buy them because I was on Nintendo Mags at the time. I didn't have a PS3 until late. I do have a PS3 now, but I think I own Uncharted 2 and 3, and that's it, pretty much.
Last of us as well. Yeah.
No love for Heavy Rain or Beyond from Matthew Castle.
So I've got quite a good 360 collection. A lot of them, I don't know if this is terrible. I've only got the discs.
I throw away the boxes. I just don't want game boxes all over my house. I'd much rather have books now.
I've got loads of books, and my book collection is growing faster than any other collection. There used to be a DVD fiend in my teen years and early 20s, but that's turned into books now. And I just think it's classier to hide the games and put the books out.
I want people to come in and think, oh, he's a bookish fellow, rather than what are all these six out of 10 360 movie licensed games. That's not really the vibe I want to give out.
Yeah, you would rather have Japanese crime fiction than 50 Cent Blood on the Sand, is what you're saying.
Yeah, that's the thing. There's a big difference when someone comes into your living room and they're like, oh, Dickens anthology. And if they come in and think, what's Blazing Angels?
So that's the kind of distinction I'm trying to make. I'd much rather the former reaction.
Yeah, that said, Matthew, if I walked into your house and I wanted to find a DVD box set from 2006, let's say I wanted to watch like Nip Tuck Season 3. Oh, yeah. I'd probably find that in your living room shelves somewhere.
Yeah. Basically, I feel like my living room is also the back end of most movie streaming services. If like all the things that came to star recently on Disney and everyone was like, oh, wow, all this stuff.
I haven't seen this for years. And you're like, I mean, that is just what my living room is. So, you know, alias, whatever.
Yeah. I mean, a very particular window of like 1999 to maybe 2008. I got you covered.
Yeah. Yeah. You do also have a lot of Switch games, but I was wondering, do those belong to Katherine?
Because you've got like a massive, like Switch collection in the, like those shelves in the top right hand corner of your sort of living room.
Yeah. Katherine's got a more traditional game collection. She does have, yeah, she keeps the boxes and things.
I'd say like 90% of my games are digital codes from like reviewing things and whatnot. The few boxes I've, yeah, I'd say the few boxes I do have are things that I've specifically had to buy because I couldn't get, you know, I couldn't convince anyone to let me do it as freelance. So rather cynically, most of my, like the things I go after freelance stuff, I don't want to buy.
Which is terrible. It's just terrible. So if anyone gets like an email from me sniffing around, that is very much the motivating factor.
Well, I don't know. It's more like, I suppose it's good in a way because you're genuinely interested in playing the game. So you, you by reviewing it have an actual curiosity about that thing.
So I'm probably working too hard to defend you there, Matthew. And I should simply be calling you out. But yeah, so for me, it's quite different.
I did actually have a massive clear out when I moved from Bournemouth to Bath in 2013. I got rid of a lot of 360 games, either just most cases, they're all like, they've all got these labels on the front that say like promo copies, not for resale, because obviously I got them through work. So they actually just have to go in the bin.
Yeah, like I've got quite a lot of those still kicking around. Like, I tend to hold on to the ones where I think, well, people will probably never port these to other systems. Like, Syndicate by Starbreeze, or like Shadows of the Damned, you know.
Yeah, so we're all we're like the 360 versions, like the best one. Or, yeah, or it's a fucking really weird game, like 007 Bloodstone, where I just seem to still write for some reason. But yeah, I sort of, I must admit, I've gotten slightly more into like games collecting in the last few years, like not in the sense of, I will buy every single game on a format, which the retro game is at editor Darren Jones would do.
And it was like, it was quite a thing to behold, but also like he owned a house. So it's a very different sort of story.
House must be stacked with games.
Yeah, it is. It's, yeah, I imagine it's like a very valuable, I won't say where he lives in case like Robert's not casing the joint. But yeah, I think doing this podcast as well as naturally made me a bit more interested in like that particular period of time.
So sort of focused on collecting like kind of GameCube games and then also like DS games and PS3 games a little bit. And I think that actually interest in those formats is going up because some key games have been trying to get hold of. I've seen the prices rise in real time.
So yeah, so some of your favorites as well, actually, including like Ghost Trick, for example, a game that I almost got for about 25 quid, like three or four years ago, and now can sell for like up to 100 pounds plus, a copy of that.
Really?
Yeah. Yeah. And Akamiden, that's another one, the sequel to Akamiden.
I should sell my copy of a Ghost Trick in Akamiden.
Yeah. I mean, you know, if you ever need to like put your kids through university or whatever, then, you know, that's an option. Yeah.
I think it's, I think that's probably a natural result of like our generation having disposable income and being like, well, I'll just, I'll just hoard this stuff that I wanted when I was a bit younger or whatever. But it's not really healthy as we'll get, as we get to like my list of games, you'll understand that sometimes it just results in poor decision making.
I had a funny thing with eBay in that years ago when they did Borderlands 2, I think it was 2K made these Borderlands 2 top trumps as like a, I don't think they were a promotional giveaway. Like they were maybe part of like the press pack, but they were like formally done. They were made with top trumps.
And I remember at the time thinking, one day, you know, top trumps are like a very collectible thing. And I thought these are ultra rare, like they're literally not sold. These Borderlands top trumps are going to be worth loads.
And I can't remember how it came about. But like we were, I think we were on O&M at the time. So not even, you know, we weren't even covering Borderlands 2.
But I ended up with an envelope of about 20 packs of Borderlands 2 top trumps. And I genuinely convinced myself that they that this was like, basically like owning like Amazon shares in like 1992.
Bitcoin. You were there with Bitcoin at the start, you know.
Yeah. And this was it. You know, any of those stories of people who lose their hard drive, and they're like, this hard drive was worth 2 million now in Bitcoin.
And if only you could find it. I thought this bag of Borderlands 2 top trumps is going to be worth like 100 grand in like 10 years. So I had to take them with me through all these office moves.
And every single time I was moving offices, I'd get to a point where I found the Borderlands 2 top trumps. I'd check in on them. And they weren't like, they weren't worth anything on eBay.
And I was like, well, maybe we'll kind of check it. And just after a while, I remember just eventually getting to the point of just like, ah, screw it. I just can't be bothered.
I think I left them in like the future games cage when I left LXM or something. So maybe they're there as like, like hidden gold. Someone will dig it up and it'll be worth a fortune.
Well, like in the walls of Key House, they'll find Borderlands top trumps. I'm going to like, I'm going to look in real time, actually, like what they, what they cost on eBay to see if the price has gone up for them. Because I, oh, they're selling for about like 12 pounds each.
So not that much to be honest.
Oh, I should get them back. That's like 200, I've got 200 quid's worth. I've got so many, I'd drive the price down.
That's the problem. I'd flood the market with Borderlands 2 top trumps.
I remember these being all over the Imagine office as well. Like they were just, they were like on like top of a kind of games cabinet for about like, I don't know, probably five years. Just like, yeah, just completely unloved.
Quite a nice idea for a promotional item though. But yeah, that's another great, great Matthew Castle story of woe there. But yeah, so you don't have that sentimental attachment to sort of physical games and Matthew.
Do you think that's like instilled in you from just being on NGamer or O&M where like your game ownership is a bit fragmented, like you say?
Yeah, I'd say definitely. Like the leap I have to make, the amount of work I'd have to do to have like a valuable collection of anything. It's just, it'd be like starting from scratch, so there's no point.
I do get occasional pangs of like envy, I guess, when I see people post pictures of like maybe older stuff, not really the era I was covering, but you know, just older stuff because game art, you know, game box art was like more interesting or nicer, you know, like when people have like interesting old sort of, they're collecting like Japanese sort of Famicom games or something, and those boxes just have a lot more kind of character to them, because then it's like, oh, that's a nice like visual thing. That's just a nice thing to have rather than like the value of having the game.
Yeah.
Yeah. But like the problem with like Wii games is the box, you know, I can't really see people collecting Wii games in that way, because they're so sterile, you know, the boxes are just very kind of like clean and very Wii. So I don't know if like in 30 years it will have quite the same appeal.
Yeah, I think you might be right. And there's a few Wii games in my my selection coming up, actually. And I noticed that basically demand for Wii games is like tiny.
Like there are a few select ones from Nintendo that sell for a decent amount. But otherwise, yeah, that market doesn't seem to exist for it, possibly because the yeah, it just wasn't. It's not a Nintendo console that diehards really kind of value.
But GameCube, on the other hand, if you've got a copy of Baiten or Baiten Katos, oh, good lord, you're going to be rich, my friend.
Really? I think Catherine does.
Oh, there you go. That stuff like that does well. Like that Pokemon 3D game they did, Pokemon XD, Gale of Darkness.
That's another one that sells like mega amounts. I sometimes read these like pointless articles. They're like, these are the most valuable GameCube games or whatever.
And Paper Mario, the Thousand Year Dora. That's another one that sells for like loads of money.
Oh my god, I've definitely got... Oh no, I think I threw all my boxes away. I've only got them discs.
Well, that's good because that is a game you genuinely love, right? So you'd want to hold on to that one.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, well, there you go. You can ponder that, Matthew. But how much do you sort of spend on games a month at the moment?
Is it all kind of tied to the job for you? Or do you still buy stuff?
Yeah, I mean, so cynically. Like, I only buy what I haven't been able to get my hands on through work, really. So not that often, you know, I probably buy like one full price game every couple of months.
But is that terrible? I play a lot of Game Pass as well, I should say, you know, that, you know, that and I play stuff from like, you know, PS Plus or whatever. I've been using that PlayStation library to fill in a few gaps.
Yeah.
One of the major advantages of not having a games collection is that actually things like subscription libraries, they just don't have any sort of stigma attached to them. You know, it's just fine. You know, they're there.
Most of my games are digital. So I don't care. I don't care about actually having them on the shelf, which makes those services a lot more attractive.
Because I see a lot of people when they if they have an argument against those services, it's because I want all my games, I want them all on the shelf. But if you don't feel that way, the new age is actually pretty sweet.
Yeah, I think I think I actually don't really mind the whole ownership part of it. I think I'm more into owning Nintendo Switch games than I am owning like PS4 games or PS5 games. I think that might be partly due to the presentation.
I have one of those really nice little horror cases that contains all my Switch kind of like cartridges or whatever they are, little little cards. That looks nice. I had the same for the DS as well.
So that makes like collecting those a bit have a bit more appeal. But no, I think Game Pass, like I played Doom Eternal on Game Pass. I don't need a copy of that on my shelf.
It's fine. I played it. I moved on with my life.
It's all good. I think if you're coming into games now as well, I do wonder if the idea of something like Game Pass or PS Plus will fundamentally change your perception of like whether it's worth buying games or not. Like we just talked about Returnal being 70 quid.
And if you're paying like, I don't know, £12 a month for Game Pass Ultimate, and you get this massive library on PC and Xbox, by comparison, I don't know. You can see why Game Pass is so enticing. And over time, I feel like as Microsoft throws billions at just getting these game developers to make stuff exclusively for their platform, that service is just going to keep growing in value, much as Netflix's library of originals now make that a very valuable service.
I'm into it. I dig it. Sorry, that's not a very eloquent point.
The idea of coming into games like completely new now is wild, just how accessible and how amazing that would be. Because even B-tier stuff, if it's new, it's still exciting to you. If a PlayStation 5 was your first ever games machine, say you're like, I don't know, 12 or something, and somehow this is your first thing and you get it with that subscription, that would be wild.
Same with the Xbox Game Pass. There's a crazy good amount of stuff on there. When I go through a list, I'm always absolutely amazed and think, wow, what a thing.
I consider myself a hardcore N64 fan. We maybe owned 12 N64 games, like through the whole console life. So it's just a, I don't know, really different age.
Yeah, that was everyone's relationship with the N64, I think. Everyone had 12 games and like 10 of them would be the same as other people's. And then you might have one dodgy wrestling game.
Yeah, ours, it was like the same as everyone else, except we also had Beacher Adventure Racing and the Xena Warrior Princess fighting game.
Amazing. Was it a better age? Only you at home can decide.
Matthew, we'll take a short break then and then we'll get into the list of my egregious purchases.
Let's do it. I'll put on my judges robes. Let the bullshit commence.
Matthew, welcome to Games Court. Wow, look who's on the list of jurors. We've got Wario, we've got Tales from the Sonic Games.
We've got that lady from Puzzle Quest. There's a lot of people here. We've got one of the blocks from Tetris.
Yeah, the square.
Listen, why are you welcoming me to Games Court when you're on trial?
Yeah, that's a good point, actually. Why don't you welcome me to Games Court?
I love the idea of a court where the murder suspect is like, welcome judge.
Yeah, sorry, why don't you?
Don't really know how to deal with this. It's quite a power play.
I suppose I was kind of picturing it like the Phoenix Wright version of law where the judge is slightly baffled and bewildered at all times, but then other people are just sort of hijacking it.
You do have the witnesses who just take total control of the situation, so you're going to be one of those troublesome witnesses are you?
Possibly, yeah. I might just like that guy in the second Phoenix Wright. I'll have my little wrist phone out and start calling someone halfway through.
Well, I look forward to breaking you and seeing your hair explode into like a thousand different angles.
Yeah, and then I start swishing a glass of wine around when you know that I'm evil and guilty. Yeah, so Matthew, I suppose you should welcome me to Games Court then. Why am I here?
What's going to happen?
You know, Samuel Roberts, you are here in Games Court. You stand accused of wasting your money, I guess, on bad pre-owned games that you've bought online. And this is the court of good taste.
You will be judged by one of your peers, me. And yeah, basically, I'm going to decide whether or not your games collection was worth it or not. And, you know, hopefully we'll get into the psychology of a twisted criminal or a game collecting genius.
We'll find out. Basically, I'm going to decide whether each of your purchases was good or bad. People may be wondering what power I have to decide this.
It's just, I guess, invested in me by the court, I guess. And yeah, we'll add them up at the end and see if you're more good than bad. And if it was bad, you're going to be executed.
Wow. Executed.
Well, it's the Ace Attorney system where it's all like really fun and lots of comedy, but the threat of like death hangs over the whole thing.
Yeah. I mean, I'd like to suggest, first of all, that if this is a good taste court, the judge has a conflict of interest because he once owned the Xena the Warrior Fighting Princess beat-em-up game.
But I owned more good games. The other 11 Nintendo N64 games were better than that.
Yeah.
So it bounced out and I was found not guilty by one of my peers.
Yeah. I see. Yeah.
Okay. The system works. I'm prepared to go along with that.
Yeah. I'm perfectly aware this is a very frivolous idea for a podcast episode. I don't think this is the peak of insightful content by any means.
I just thought it might be quite fun. Is that my opening statement?
I don't know where the jewelry factor into it. We're painting this picture where we've got Wario out of bed for whatever reason. Now he's not really going to play a part in it.
Like I say, the square from Tetris is here in a suit to watch and comment on the situation. Yeah, I watched it. I just hired Miles Edgeworth to defend me, actually.
That might have been good. But yeah, it's too late now. It depends.
This is also already at risk of turning into a Phoenix Wright fan fiction scenario. Yeah. Okay.
So what's going to happen there, Matthew? I've got 18 games here.
Yeah.
Well, the first one is actually two games combined, but they're linked. So I will go through them. And then as you say, you will decide whether I'm guilty or not.
I will tell you the price of each purchase as well.
Yeah, that'll factor into it because there's, you know, if you've really, if you've bought something foolish, that'll count against you.
Yeah, I think actually on the price front, I've actually like, I've done it reasonably well. And I don't think like I've got that much to like worry about or like apologize for. Maybe a couple.
But yeah. Okay. Let's let's kick off there, Matthew.
So Exhibit A, first two games combined. So we have Yakuza Kiwami 2. That was £12.99 and Yakuza 6, £10.
I bought those on February 22nd, 2020, right before the pandemic kicked off. So this is like a year's worth of my foolish purchases, by the way. Yeah.
So the justification here, like you, I thought, well, I'm going to play all the Yakuza games at some point. Still haven't done that. Still on zero.
But I thought it would be good to have them at some point. And then they all got added to Game Pass, making this purchase completely irrelevant.
See, this is the thing. I mean, you couldn't have known they were going to be added to Game Pass. But it's a tricky one, this, because I haven't played.
I haven't got to two or six yet in my playthrough, because as mentioned earlier, I'm only on one. So I've got a bit of time to go yet. I mean, this is tricky, because the idea of buying into this series, that makes sense.
They're very popular. They're good games, widely held to be good games. I'd say that's...
they're quite new games to buy pre-owned, like online. They are, but I'd say... It's not like they're hard to find, or they've run the risk of going, like, vanishing.
No. I got them as well because they were cheap. I thought £12.99 for Kiwami 2 and £10 for Yakuza 6.
Pretty recent games. That's not that bad. So, yeah, I think that was the thought process, really.
I really would like to have played all the Yakuza games at some point. There are so many of them, and they're all so long. But we're planning a Yakuza episode down the line as well, so I can sort of partially argue that it's for that.
But, yeah, overall, then, Matthew, do you think they're like... Do you kind of sound a bit on the fence about these two?
Yeah, I mean, if you bought them now, that would be mad, because they're on Game Pass, but you bought them before Game Pass, so that doesn't factor into it. Good intentions, good games. I think these are a good purchase.
Oh, thank God. Like, yeah, you just sort of bang the hammer, and then everyone starts talking in the courtroom.
Oh, no, you're the judge. You wouldn't shout objection. We need another person for that.
Maybe we'll bring Catherine on at some point to be Phoenix Wright. Anyway, yeah, so...
It's off to a good start. You're currently... I'll let you in on something.
Currently and not being executed.
Oh, fuck. This is exciting stuff. Man, maybe I'll make it out of this alive.
We'll see.
They counted as one, not two purchases.
Yeah, I think it does because they were the same day at the same time. So, yeah, that's fine. Okay, so exhibit C then, Matthew, is the last story on Wii.
This was £43, the most expensive of all the games I bought here, because it's quite rare now. It's like harder to get hold of. And this I bought on the 12th of May, 2020.
So we're quite deep into the pandemic at that point. And I couldn't go to the pub, so I thought I'll just buy like a Wii RPG. I probably won't get around to playing.
But I'd quite like to... Nope, I have not. It's still on the shelf.
But I have good intentions, you know? Like, if I can find a way to sort of clone myself, then I'll get my younger self to play this game and have opinions on it. But...
Okay, we're gonna have to get in a expert witness here to tell us whether cloning technology is currently at that point. I don't know that it is.
Who would that be in Phoenix Wright? Would it just be like some fucking clown who's a pervert or something? And he's actually like a genealogy expert.
Yeah, basically.
Yeah, so again, Matthew, like the sort of defense I would use here is that The Last Story is a game that like brought you and your wife together originally.
At least it wasn't why you bought it, I'm hoping that would be weird.
That'd be really weird, wouldn't it? That would suggest that like this whole podcast is an attempt for like me to sort of stalk you and learn more about your personal life. No, I didn't.
I think I sort of, I looked at this and also, I think actually, you know what might have prompted this was when they released Xenoblade Chronicles Remaster. And I thought, oh yeah, this is one of those like, was it Operation Rainfall RPGs that came to Wii? Yeah, yeah.
So I looked at this and Pandora's Tower I looked at and that looked too shit to play these days. But The Last Story, I thought, The Last Story, it wasn't very long and how long to be. I thought I would probably play this at some point.
The next time I plug in my Wii U, I will play this. But yeah, what do you make of it?
Yeah, I mean, like you say, it is the game responsible for my marriage. So that's good. That works in its favor.
That's a big tick. I think, I actually think this, I think this is a sound purchase. This isn't a game that's going to like live on again, anywhere else.
I'd be very, very surprised if this ever resurfaced. I just don't think it was popular enough, but it is good. It's an interesting game.
It's an interesting artifact as it's like, you know, probably one of the least known, or probably the least played, Sakaguchi JRPGs. So that means, I think it ticks a lot of boxes. It's an important game in that sense.
It is a good game. I think you will enjoy playing it. It's got some interesting ideas in it.
I think this is a good purchase.
Wow. Okay, cool. So a two for two.
I mean, you know, I don't get too excited yet for those hoping that I don't get executed. We've got a long way to go. So Matthew, next up, Exhibit D.
Zone of the End is the second runner on PS4. I bought this for £5.95 on the 1st of August, 2020. So as people who listened to last week's episode might remember, this was the game I reviewed that got me my first staff writer job on Play Magazine in the UK back in 2007.
So I have a sentimental attachment to this game. It's a Kojima produced game. I don't think he did anything else on it though.
Like a mech combat game, very good. Re-released on PS4 with a VR element. I have no idea how that could possibly work without making someone vomit because this game moves so, so quickly.
But yeah, I thought £5.95, that is a good price. I will play this at some point. And it's a really nice looking PS2 game that probably stands the test of time on them PS4.
So that's my defense, Matthew. What do you make of this one?
Yeah, but you could have bought it digitally, right?
Yeah, but I don't think I could have bought it this cheaply digitally.
And it feels a bit wrong to like mark this one down when it has a nostalgic connection, but letting the last story through because it has a nostalgic connection for me. Yeah, if... That would be a bit unfair if I judged my emotional history to be more important than yours.
Yeah, I mean, it would be funny if you said, well, this game didn't introduce me to my wife.
So, execute it. Well, actually, that's a very good point. I don't know, like an HD remake or something.
Probably be a more interesting purchase if you'd bought the original.
Well, but you can't buy that one on PS4. They only remastered this one.
No, no, I meant you bought the copy of Zone Avengers 2 on PS2.
Well, you see, I own that, but in my parents' house, like many miles away.
I think you already own a copy of this game. I think this is a bad purchase.
Oh, shit. Oh, man, I walked into that one. Okay.
Okay, like, it's not like egregious because the price is quite low, but I think this is a bad pointless purchase.
The hammer bangs. All right, Exhibit E. This one's definitely going to be close to execution.
So we have Star Wars Masters of Terrorist Carsey on PS1, a Star Wars fighting game. I paid £8.95 for this on the 31st of August 2020, deep into the pandemic there. Some retro pandemic vibes.
Yeah.
Why? This was never good.
No, this was not good. This one I bought because it was just something I always coveted as a kid who didn't have a PS1, and I thought, well, I'm an adult now. I can just buy this game on eBay, and if it's shit, the stakes are very low.
That was before I knew that I could be executed for such a thing, of course.
Yeah. You see, eBay should add that as a disclaimer. Are you sure you want to buy this?
This could be used against you in GameCourt at a later point.
Yeah. It's actually just occurred to me as we've been recording this, that this whole thing, this whole idea, is basically like a back page joke that we turn into a podcast. Yeah, which is sort of appropriate.
But yeah, fighting game where you can put Luke Skywalker up against Boba Fett and Luke Skywalker can lose. Yeah, quite a cheapish fighting game. I don't make any sort of real defense for this one.
It was just a kind of curiosity purchase.
I think that curiosity would have been sated if you'd just watched a video on YouTube. I think this is a bad purchase.
Yeah. Fair enough.
It's a bad game. I don't really go in for ironic purchases or anything like that. A bad game is a bad game.
I don't care. No.
Okay. Jesus. Well, that's...
Yeah. The hammer bangs. Oh, yeah.
Onto the next one. So, exhibit F, Matthew. R-type Delta on PS1.
Side-scrolling shooter. It's £7.16. I bought this on the 6th of September, 2020.
Again, I think a lot of these cost about the same as a fancy beer does from Independent Spirit, my local beer shop. And I stopped drinking last summer.
Is that our first sponsorship?
No, they didn't pay. I'll maybe actually cut that out in case it seems like they did.
No, it's fine. I think we should go to them and shake them down for money now, though.
Yeah. By the way, when are you going to pay us for this sponsorship? And just play the podcast in front of them.
Yeah. So R-Type Delta, this is the first one on our list, Matthew, that I have actually played. So I do like this game.
I do think it's good. It's one that as a young boy, my cousin had a chipped PS1 and he owned this game. Really nice looking 2D shooter built with 3D graphics.
I think one of the nicest looking games on PS1. And yeah, even though it's rock hard, I did enjoy playing it for the two hours or so that I played it last year. So please factor that into a decision as you determine what happens next.
That really works in your favor that you played it. It shows that it did have genuine worth. I must say, I'm not hugely familiar with it.
I'm not very good on me, on me R types.
Listen, I'm just going to trust you on this one and say that this was a good purchase.
Oh, thank God for that. Jesus Christ. The stakes have never been lower.
Okay, so exhibit G.
I want you to say after the Star Wars one was considered bad, a very badly rendered Chewbacca stormed out of the court in disagreement. He left the jury box. I think it was Chewbacca.
It could have been a Han Solo. We just don't know based on the graphics.
Oh, amazing. Exhibit G. This one's going to be interesting because this could go either way.
So it's Mad World on the Wii. This was £3.94. I bought this on the 6th of October, 2020.
So Mad World was one of the games that Platinum made with Sega when they were first founded. I assume that Mad World was of some significance to you in your endgamer days, Matthew, because it was one of the hardcore Wii games that were around. Do you remember much about this one?
Yeah, we were incredibly excited to see awesome people making something that looked awesome. It actually looked quite bad on the page, Mad World. I liked it in motion.
It never looked fantastic. When you took screenshots of it, it was quite hard to make this game look brilliant on the page, I thought.
Black and white, but the blood was red.
Yeah.
I actually think this is a good purchase. You're a fan of Platinum, the idea of owning their work. They're an interesting studio whose work I could foresee people wanting a full collection of.
Mad World is an interesting one. That's quite cheap for what is still quite a good playable game. You'll have fun with it.
My problem with Mad World is it was good, it was fun, it was so funny, but it was never quite delivered the full package. So actually, this makes more sense, I think, as a pre-owned game than it would have had as a new purchase. So I think this is okay.
Yeah. I would have bought this if it was more than £10. This came from an intense period of me just seeing which of the good Wii games do I not have and should I try and pick them up because no one really cares about the games.
This is definitely an interesting Wii game and interesting is the backbone of most pre-owned games collections, I would say.
So it was never quite like Bayonetta in terms of its critical reception as well. But yeah, that was sort of similar. That was like part of the thinking actually because I do also own Infinite Space, a game that I know that you're like one of the only people in the world who...
Oh, I love Infinite Space.
Yeah, yeah. So, you know, Platinum, they made some cool stuff when they first launched.
Did you buy Infinite Space pre-owned?
Yes, but not this year. I've owned Infinite Space for about 10 years now actually. I've played it but it's very good.
That would have been an easy, good purchase, but alas.
That's another one that I think is actually incredibly hard to find on eBay.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. So, yeah, I think...
That's a cult classic.
Absolutely, yeah.
I called that when it was new. You were like, this is going to be a cult classic.
No one will buy this, but good lord. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So, yeah, Madwell then, Matthew, that's worked in my favor. That's a good one.
Okay, good. I think this next one is going to be an easy sell as well. So, Exhibit H is, has, is Chewbacca come back into the courtroom or is he just, is he gone?
No, he's still cross.
Okay, fair enough. But the, the square from Tetris had to take a call from his wife. So, yeah, yeah.
Slight recess there. So, Exhibit H is Ghost Squad on the Wii. Now I bought this on the 6th of October 2020, so this is long before our 2007 podcast where it came up in your top 10.
Yeah. Listen, if you've listened to our 2007 podcast, you'll know where I stand on Ghost Squad. It was one of the best games of 2007.
It's one of the underrated Wii games. It's a great light gun shooter. Since that podcast has come out, I've seen a person of good taste, Ashley Day, agreeing that Ghost Squad is excellent.
Also Simon Miller, the Ghost Squad kind of crew is growing by the minute.
You don't call them the Ghost Squad squad. That seems like a missed opportunity to me.
Oh, well, I'm not that sharp in the morning hours when we record this podcast. But you are welcome to join the crew, the squad, the whatever, as an owner of this game. This is a good game.
This is a good purchase.
Yeah. £2.50 delivered to my house. At that point, how is it even...
I mean, that doesn't feel right, does it?
Yeah. I mean, how is that even worth it for the people selling it? You know, like it's sort of...
I would rather... You wouldn't... If someone paid me £2.50 to go to the post office, I wouldn't do it.
You know what I mean? Like never mind, like send them a game.
That wouldn't get you a quarter of a chicken sheesh wrap from the kebab house in Bath that I use, sometimes on Deliveroo, that you will play Ghost Squad for a lot longer than it would take you to eat a quarter of a chicken sheesh wrap.
And it would, yeah, it would have less... Harika less havoc on your intestines as well, I would guess.
Yeah, and it won't make your hands smell of garlic as much. Unless something's gone very wrong.
Yeah, so yeah, that was 250. That was well worth it.
Oh yeah, for sure.
Yeah, so that is one I've not played yet, but I definitely will play. In fact, like I have actually plugged in my Wii since we had our Mario conversation with Catherine, so it's on the cards. Next up, then, Matthew.
You found the empty plug sockets, did you?
Yeah, I just had to unplug about five different, more essential devices in order to make it happen.
A life support machine.
Yeah, in order to facilitate an unsuccessful console from Nintendo that was very poorly used.
Sorry, Gramps, I wanted to play Ghost Squad, ironically, which you have now joined.
I love this idea that I am recording this podcast with my grandpa who's on a life support machine in the same room as me. That's so fucking dark, Matthew.
Man, your lock-down must have been raw.
It's been a tough year, what can I say? And I told my grandpa, look, grandpa, like, buy Masters of Terrorous Car Seat, it might be the only thing that makes you better. And he was like, do what you have to!
Yeah, but yeah. Okay, exhibit I then, Matthew. The Grand Theft Auto triple pack on the original Xbox.
This was £10. I bought it on the 23rd of October 2020, which I can't remember if this was when we were in lockdown again. Who knows?
Last year was basically one big lockdown. But yeah, so this was the original GTA games. I feel very strongly that GTA needs the original radio stations in order to be the games they were.
And all of the newer versions of Vice City and San Andreas strip out some of the music. And I don't love that. And I've still got an Xbox 360, which can play all of these games backwards compatible.
And while I'm not sure when I will ever play them, San Andreas is the most likely one to play because I never finished that one. This is why I bought these. So I could play GTA as they originally were with all the radio stations intact on my HGTV.
What do you make of it?
I mean, I was going to say, you know, the fact that you can still play them. I mean, that's a pretty good argument for owning them. You know, the music thing, I guess also I had an awareness of that in the back of my head.
But that's quite a big deal breaker. So the idea that you're, you know, this is a pre-owned purchase as preservation. That's it.
I mean, you can't really argue with that.
Yeah.
God, I was hoping these games were all going to be really bad, unwise choices. But I actually think this is sound also.
Yeah. So in this case, like, you know, I wouldn't write a wanky op-ed about this, right? But like when they took 1979 by the Smashing Pumpkins at GTA 4, in my head, I was like, oh, I have a really strong memory of like associating the game with that song.
And I get that Rockstar probably paid like a 10 year license to have the song. And at some point, they're legally obliged to take out. But I've been playing it on the 360, so it can't be patched and I can't have that song removed, which sounds extreme.
But like, it's actually quite important to me to preserve the experience as it was, because the music, Rockstar would have paid so much for the music in the first place if they didn't think it was fundamentally important to the sense of place in those games. So this is something I feel weirdly strongly about. I know that sounds quite arbitrary, but it's important to me.
And I do love the GTA games, so that was my thinking, Matthew.
But listen, that's good enough for this, Judge. I think this is a good purchase.
That's good, yeah. Yeah, so yeah, Tommy Vissetti in the courtroom just did a little kind of like a little cheer. It just sort of went, fuck yeah.
Well, that's for all you know, I had to say this was good, or their thugs were going to rough me up.
Yeah, exactly. They'll beat you to death with dildos, because that's what happens in GTA Vice City, probably. Anyway, so exhibit J Matthew.
It's TimeSplitters 2 on the GameCube. I bought this for £12.95 on the 9th November 2020. First-person shooter from Free Radical.
Probably considered the best in the series, or at least it's the one that people remember the most. Do you have any take on TimeSplitters as a series?
Unfortunately for you, I hate TimeSplitters.
Okay, what's your sort of reasoning there?
I just don't like the feel of it. I think it feels like you're shooting weird Nerf bullets at things. I think it is a fundamentally unsatisfying thing to play.
I've never understood it. I know people love it, and I know it's probably one of the later split-screen shooter games that people are obsessed over. I just do not get time splitters.
I've bought several time splitters games because they got, you know, 90s or whatever in the magazines I read, and I've never got it. I just do not like the feel of it. Yeah, and just to say, you know, it's a monkey.
Oh, yeah, I guess. Yeah, I sort of... But that's such an unpopular view.
It seems terrible to mark this up as a bad game just because of my terrible judge bias.
I think I know what you mean about the shooting. I don't dislike it, but yeah, I sort of see what you mean. Maybe it's something just about how bullets sound and feel, but it does feel like you're sort of like whomping people with bullets rather than like hitting them.
I kind of get what you mean in a kind of weird way.
Yeah, and it just... It always felt kind of quite strict. Even though the campaign, which I know, you know, again, has its fans, just felt like...
almost too arcady, like too soft and arcady. Lots of things just running at you, like waves of enemies. I don't know.
I feel like I need to add something to the bad list just for the state, just for there to be some drama in this court.
Well, you're definitely about to get one after this. So, yeah, don't worry about it.
You know what? Listen, I'm going to add tiny splitters to the bad purchases just because I don't like it.
And I feel like it's a readily available game in pre-order. It's not like a rare, like, oh my god, watch out, there might not be any time splitters, too. I've got a copy of it that, you know, I'd happily give you.
You could just say, like, you should have asked me for a copy.
You should have asked me for a copy of this bad game.
Yeah, Bang's Gavel.
I know people on Twitter will be like, oh, time splitters are good, but, you know.
I don't know. This is another one I have actually played on the list. Obviously, I've played it before on PS2, back in the day.
But I do think that the campaign is quite flawed in this. Like, the changes in setting, I think, even though it's an interesting conceit that you go to all these different time frames, the mission types aren't that interesting. And if people really rack their brains, I think they'll struggle to come up with any mission from this campaign that's, like, classic in the way that a GoldenEye level was classic, or a Perfect Dark level was, you know?
Can anyone name a map from TomSplitters 2? Can anyone name?
I do remember the multiplayer maps quite well, actually. I don't remember the names, but I remember the layout of them. I thought it was a really good split-screen shooter.
That is part of why I bought it. So when the pandemic ends and I can have friends over, I can play this game in split-screen if I wish.
Well, that to me feels like a future threat. As a friend of yours, I don't want to play this in split-screen. So I'm going to say this is bad.
Are you saying you're not going to come over and in front of my dying grandpa, play Times Square 2, who's having any of the worst times since I plugged in the Wii U and unplugged his life support machine? Is that what you're saying to Matthew?
If I was your grandpa, I wouldn't want to be in a world where people are playing Times Square 2.
All right. Well, the next one's going to be a lot more straightforward. So Exhibit K.
True Crime, Streets of LA on the GameCube. £1.80, 12th of November 2020.
£1?
Yeah, £1. This is less than the price of like, I think it's about the price of a Greg steak bake these days. Yeah, so True Crime, Streets of LA.
You'd have more fun putting a Greg steak bake in your GameCube, I think.
So did you play this back in the day? Like a GTA clone that had Max Payne kind of like elements? Actually, I think had better combat than GTA did at the time.
But yeah, otherwise for setting them quite a rough open world and was totally a very odd game and felt a bit unfinished. Did you play this?
Yeah, so I think I rented this from Blockbuster.
Oh, a perfect rental game. That's what it's for, a rental.
Well, that's the thing. So I remember reading a lot about this and thinking like, this is going to be, this is GTA on the GameCube. This is what, you know, this is the missing piece of the puzzle.
We're never going to get GTA. So this would be great. And I think the magazines were sort of selling it like that.
I imagine there would have been some cover lines, which is like, this is like Nintendo meets GTA or something. That's what I would have done if I was been less about that.
Meets Uncharted.
I'd say this is GTA meets Sonic Boom. A game which isn't going to exist for 15 years. Yeah, this was bad.
This is a game that's built to sound cool to teenage boys, but it's just the whole thing's ropey.
Yeah, OK. So yeah, it was a real kind of like minor nostalgia purchase. Who knows?
I might have been hungover that day.
Did it have rappers in it?
I think Snoop Dogg was an unlockable character. If you went around its massive open world and collected like 20 of these different collectibles, which I didn't do.
20 bongs!
Yeah, and this is right around the time that like Starskin Hutch came out, so I don't know. Snoop Dogg was like a fun novelty figure, I guess. But yeah, OK, we'll move on from that one then, Matthew.
That's bad. That's more like it. That's what this court wants, a bit of drama.
OK, good. There's a bit more to come, so get excited. So next up, we've got Lord of the Rings, The Third Age on GameCube.
I mentioned before that I bought this. I paid £10.49 for this on the 14th of November 2020. I bought it because someone on the GameFEQs forum said it was a bit like Final Fantasy X.
And to be fair, so did some other reviews. They said it was quite derivative, but I thought a Lord of the Rings or JRPG sounded kind of interesting. I bought it, I haven't played it.
You'll take, Matthew, as the court?
I mean, so this is a game. I just don't remember this game at all.
Yeah, I think it's like one of the last EA licensed Lord of the Rings games, which they were actually some of the better games based on licenses that they made around this time.
Yeah, they were okay. The movie adaptations were okay. They were quite flashy, quite shiny looking.
Yeah. It's a bit hard to say, oh, I'm just going to put this in the bin because I don't remember it. It seems a bit arbitrary.
But then like this whole thing is a shab. So, you know, this is not a real court.
No wonder Chewbacca stormed out.
Yeah, Aragorn just shaking his head in like the front row.
But you haven't played it.
No, it's again like the big obstacle here is plugging in the GameCube. You know, it takes up the slot that is occupied by the Xbox 360. So it's tough.
I mean, I haven't got amazingly good reason for it other than trying to kind of create a sort of frisson of drama. So I'm going to say it's bad.
Yeah, fair enough.
OK, so it's just like you've basically bought a game on a bit of hearsay that it's like something else, but not to the point where you've actually tried it to see if it was like that. So, yeah, it seems like a very wasteful purchase to me.
Fair enough. Also, we're getting, this point, we're getting very close to like Black Friday last year, and that is a very stressful period where I can't always account for my actions. So that and True Crime Streets of LA were kind of caught in the maelstrom.
We've heard this defense in this court before and it just doesn't hold up.
OK, fair enough. All right, so exhibit M. Actually, how am I doing so far, Matthew?
What's the kind of score? I'm just going to tell you, it's tight.
OK, all right. This one's not going to work in my favor either, I don't think. So exhibit M.
I wish suspects were like that in court where they're about to say something. They're like, listen, the thing I'm about to tell you is going to make me look like a murderer. And they're like, OK, don't put too much weight on this next bit because this is the bit where I seem worst.
But there's going to be some stuff later where I seem better. And so just bear that in mind.
Yeah, ignore the bloody candlestick.
And it's like, oh, no, it's just a bit with a knife. All right, yeah, you're not going to like this.
Yeah, pay more attention to this picture of me and my kids on holiday in Cornwall. Yeah, right. So I don't think this will work in my favor.
Exhibit M. The Sly Cooper Trilogy on PS3. £12.80 on the 17th of December 2020.
Oh dear, oh dear. This is a bit like turning up at court and your crime is murdering the judge's daughter.
Yes, it's exactly the same. Yeah, so this is, I did have the first Sly Cooper game on PS2. It was really good, looked really nice.
Well, was it really good? It was like 8 out of 10 good for the time. Sort of like a stealth kind of platformer.
I think I bought this because I just bought Ghost of Shire and I was like, oh yeah, what else was it they made that I liked? And I enjoyed the infamous game, so bought this on a whim. I think I paid slightly too much for it.
If it was under 10 quid, I think it might be more justifiable. But also this judge has a notorious grudge against a certain generation of PS2 mascots platformer, which I can't imagine is going to work in my favor, Matthew.
I mean, let's not beat around the bush with this one. You're basically... Well, I was going to say you're supporting the career of a wronger, and you're not.
At least you bought it pre-owned, so no money goes into Sucker Punch's pocket and encourages them. So it's not a harmful purchase in that sense. It's not like buying it new, which that is a serious grudge.
I'm willing to accept this is one of the more interesting PS2 mascot games in that it's got that bit of stealthy vibe. It's not just terrible platforming. It's got a bit more going on.
I think this was a good series. It had an audience for sure.
You can say that about all the others as well.
Yeah, that's true. I mean, of the others, I'm sure we'll do a podcast about bad... this generation of platforming icon inverted commas down the line.
Yeah, the little Nintendo wannabes.
Yeah, so I think the first Jak and Daxter games are very good, actually. I think it's got really nice movement and a nice world to explore. But almost none of the other ones I'd really defend.
I'm not the biggest Crash Bandicoot fan. In fact, I haven't even... Yeah, I don't really love Crash Bandicoot.
But Sly Cooper, yeah, I thought the first one was pretty good. It was right off the back of Metal Gear Solid being big and suddenly stealth games were everywhere. Yeah, it was quite a cool little stealth game.
I argue that a raccoon that steals stuff is an amazing idea for a character. But yeah. Well, what does the court think?
I think I've got a certain amount of cred to live up to.
You can't be seen to be lenient.
Not really. I've got to be seen to be tough on certain crimes. I've got a reputation and I just like...
This is borderline. But I think it has to go on the bad pile.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Just because. But you know, you will. If anything, if I was you, I just wouldn't have brought this one into the conversation.
Like, this is your fault.
Yeah. But I wanted to be honest because I think that creates some more interesting kind of like podcast. Well, the people at home can decide that.
They might have turned off by now.
But your honesty may have may have sent you to the chair, I'm afraid.
Yeah. Well, a livid crash bandicoot.
But I guess we'll find out in a few games time.
Yeah, exactly. A livid crash bandicoot at the back of the courtroom just threw his trousers at the judge in a rage.
He would have done that anyway because he's a deviant.
Yeah. Okay. So Exhibit N, Matthew, is a game you mentioned earlier on this podcast, Piano 3 on the GameCube.
£10. I bought this on the 19th of December, 2020, and it was quite cheap for a copy of this game, which is a little bit collectible, I think, because it had some kind of mud on the box.
Oh dear. You were doing so well. This was so compelling until we got to the...
I didn't know that when I bought it. It just seemed to be a bit muddy. I don't know why.
So you bought a muddied copy of P&L 03?
Well, the disc is fine. It's just the box. The box looks like it's caked in a little bit of mud.
I mean, you are asking a lot of the judge here, I feel. Again, I applaud your honesty, but it feels like you're almost challenging me. You're daring me to try and put this on the good pile with the mud.
Yeah, I've created an interesting quandary.
It's the idea of buying someone else's filth. It's just... I don't know.
I sort of... I make no apology for the mud, but £10 is a good price for this game.
Yeah, I mean...
I did buy it after I watched that Shinji Mikami documentary on Archipel as well. I was kind of like, well, this is the one game of his I've never played, so I thought I'd pick it up.
I think a bit like the last story and a bit like Mad World, this is an important piece of the puzzle for several interesting strands of development. The kind of the Capcom 5... Was it the Capcom 5, I believe they were called?
Mikami, The Connection, I mean... It fits your MO, it fits your interests. I am going to be a kind judge.
I'm going to ignore the mud that you've brought into this court. And I'm going to add this to the good pile.
Okay, well, this is like the most certain kind of like crime of mine. Even after I bought it...
Again, I love it when the suspect tells me that.
Yeah, so these are my...
This is the video footage of me shooting them in the head. This is the thing, when you see it, you're not going to be able to unsee me as a criminal.
It's a bit of that, yeah. So let me establish context, right? This was the week they announced...
Bethesda announced as making an Indiana Jones game with MachineGames. And I thought on a whim, on a lunchtime, I would buy Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings on the Wii for £4.45. And this was January 13th, 2021.
So the thought process here, Matthew, this game does contain a copy of The Fate of Atlantis, the very well regarded PC point and click game. So that was the primary reason I bought it. That's the reason I bought the Wii version as opposed to the PSP version or whatever.
But I know that the main game here is a piece of shit. So what's your take, Judge?
I may actually surprise you and say that I think.
This is an interesting Wii game. Wow. I think this is not a good game.
I wouldn't say it's a terrible game. I think it's actually got some OK stuff in it. It's an interesting game because it's largely held to be the Indiana Jones game they were making for 360, kind of salvaged for Wii, I believe.
Yeah, that's right. Like San Francisco based, kind of like.
It's got one absolutely 100% broken bit of motion controls in the game, which I really hated. But I actually don't think this is horrible for £4. Fate of Atlantis is one of my favourite.
So that's okay. Buying it just for that's fine. You know what?
I actually think this is good.
Wow, that's a shocker. And it wasn't covered in mud, this one. That's important to say.
Han Solo from the fighting game has turned into Indiana Jones and is celebrating.
But it's still poorly rendered.
But he's still horribly, horribly rendered. And he can't control his arms because he's got bad motion controls. So he's just pinwheeling all over the shop.
I'm having to get the guards to hold him down.
Yeah, so that was the thinking here. I will actually play this one because I also noticed that Xbox Live Games with Gold, they gave away the Emperor's Tomb, the other original Xbox Indiana Jones game. So I'm sure you, like me, had a little bit of an appetite for indie content afterwards.
Yeah, this is like an underplayed, not totally horrible, had a couple of interesting ideas, quite a cinematic conclusion.
Wow, okay, there you go. Well, that just makes me want to play it more. So it was worth unplugging my grandfather's life support machine after all.
Yes.
Okay, so we're nearly there, Matthew. Exhibit P, The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass. That was £12.98 on February 15th, 2021.
So the reasoning here is fairly obvious. I thought I owned this. I mentioned on the podcast, I thought I had this in a box of games.
But I actually didn't own this one. I just owned Spirit Tracks. So I went and bought it because I liked all the stuff you said about it.
And it's funny because after you told me that this was like an underrated kind of Zelda experience, loads of people put this quite low in their list of the best Zelda games. And I wondered how you felt about that, Judge.
I mean, it is probably low in the grand scheme of things, but that's still low in a list of classics. So, you know, I agreed with lots of what people said. This is a good DS Zelda game.
I actually preferred it and Spirit Tracks to A Link Between World, which a lot of people overrated in their Zelda lists, I will say. But that's a point for a Zelda podcast down the line, I think. Yes.
Phantom Man of Glass, I stand by it. A great DS game, like a blockbuster DS experience. You will definitely get your money's worth out of it and have a good time.
This is a good purchase.
OK, fair enough. Yeah, I thought that was a pretty good price, because again, like DS games are starting to creep up on eBay. I think more and more people are holding these.
OK, so three more, Matthew. Exhibit Q, GTA Chinatown Wars on DS, £7.95. I had a copy of this.
I think I gave it to another Imagine journalist when I was still at the company many years ago. I remember playing this and enjoying some of the different minigames and lockpicking and stuff like that and mastering the drug economy. We mentioned this on a podcast too, and that's motivated a lot of these purchases.
So yeah, I thought I'd pick this up and I thought £7.95 is a very good price for Chinatown Wars. A kind of curio, but according to Metacritic, the highest rated DS game of all time, which seems a bit high to me. But yeah, what do you make of this one, Matthew?
I really, really like this game. I felt like, again, at a time where quite late in the day, quite a lot of people were making budget things and just trying to cash in on DS. I think Rockstar didn't want to let their side down.
I think they've got a certain kind of commitment to quality, and I thought they delivered quite a full, full, decent experience with this. This is, yeah, I think this was a great GTA on DS, kind of reverting to the kind of top-down style of the older games. It's probably my favourite version of that.
It's the best version of that for sure, yeah.
Yeah, this is a good game. Seven pounds, I thought it would be harder to get than that. A good purchase.
Yeah, who knows, maybe this podcast will send the aftermarket for these games fucking soaring, and it'll be impossible to get hold of.
I should note, as I say all that, I nervously look across at Tommy Verzetti and give him like a little nod just to make sure I'm not going to get beaten up outside again.
Yeah, okay, yeah, fair enough. Yeah, this judge is under a lot of pressure.
A huge amount of pressure.
Yeah, so two more Matthew. These are bang up to date. These happened the last like three days, so we've made it through a whole year of purchases.
So this is another one motivated by the podcast. Therefore, I think this is an unimpeachable choice, but it's Zack and Wiki, The Quest for Barbaros Treasure. I thought Matthew Castle putting this on his top 10 list of 2007 will send the value of it skyrocketing.
So get in on the ground floor, I say.
Wait a second, that's insider trading.
Yeah.
Now I have to send you to actual financial court.
Yeah, this one was only £5.21 delivered. And I thought...
Oh my God.
Yeah.
I'm so amazed by that. I thought it would be, like, you know, hard to come by.
Yeah, but no, this is weirdly easy to get hold of. So, yeah, I thought that was a great price for something that you...
That's a great price for a game I talked at length in last week's 2007 list about why I like this game. Zack and Wiki, it's a good game.
There you go.
Good puzzle game, interesting Wii game, interesting Wii controls. Kind of a bit of a sort of dead end, like they didn't do anything more with it. It'll probably never come back in any form.
Zack and Wiki, thumbs up.
Well, there you go. You might notice the judge goes lenient on more Nintendo-oriented games.
Well, basically telling the judge, Judge, I bought a load of stuff off your recommendation last week. And then the judge is hardly going to be like that shit.
Yeah, how fucking dare you, sir. Yeah, so this last one, though, has nothing to do with that. And it's quite an odd choice.
And I'm looking at thinking, I hope this is good, because it hasn't actually arrived yet, as I say this. But it's Tony Hawk's American Skateland on DS. I paid £11.95 for this.
It's one of the highest rated games on Metacritic on DS, a 3D sort of like Tony Hawk experience. And people said it was actually legit. And I'm sort of getting back into the DS, 3DS mindset a bit of late, because we've got an upcoming Best 3DS Games episode that we're going to do.
And yeah, so I've been sort of planning it a bit more again. This one, I'll admit, is a bit of a frivolous purchase. I've no idea if it's good or not.
And the price might have been high for what it is, but what does the judge make of this?
This is a weird one, because the thing I pictured in my head, I'm just looking up to see what I... You know, I'm actually... I've got to put my hands up and say I haven't played this one.
My memories of Tony Hawk and Nintendo from NGamer were bad, because it was all a little bit downhill jam. And then there was this terrible DS game where it came with, like, this colourful, like, painting platforming game. It was like two games in one.
One was Tony Hawk and one was this painting thing. It was really weird, which I thought this was that. And I was like, what the hell?
Yeah, okay. Well, Vicarious Visions, they're pretty good. This is one of the best rated games on DS.
Yeah, I mean, look on Metacritic, it's, like, really high up. It got, like, weirdly high scores, and I'd never heard of it. And I looked up the screenshots and I thought, it looked pretty good for a DS game as well, the 3D.
Well, listen, I'm going to have to put my hands up and say, like, you know, I can't really put this on the bad pile, because I feel like I should probably also buy this game pre-owned to play it, to see, so I have an opinion of it, because it's currently slipping through my DS knowledge cracks in a rather embarrassing way. Yeah, I can only say that it's a good purchase. It sounds like an, you know, on paper, it's an interesting DS game.
If it's that highly acclaimed, Tony Hawke, you know, the last of the good Tony Hawke games, maybe.
Yeah, well, certainly from that era, because like you say, this was around the time that Guitar Hero sort of started to like poison the water a bit and led to all these Activision games having like peripheral elements or being like more, quote unquote, casual. So, yeah.
I mean, that's, I mean, if anything, this is quite an apt end because it's like the big dramatic upset. Like the judge just doesn't know what to make of it. He just has to trust in the quality of the suspect.
Yeah, there you go. I mean, yeah, like Chewbacca in the audience just roaring, you know, just like hands in the air. Yeah, so, yeah, it's a weird one, but it was an informed purchase.
I looked it up and I thought, wow, the people, the critics actually like this one. I'd never heard of it. But yeah, a DS Tony Hawk game that wasn't that kind of isometric thing that was in some of the older ones that looked terrible.
An actual 3D Tony Hawk game on the DS. So it might be shit. We'll see.
We're going into that wild kind of like, yeah.
I mean, it's quite early DS, so maybe people were just going delali and excited about DS.
Might be a bit over excited. But yeah, that was it, Judge. You have all of my, all of the evidence is in front of you now.
Only you can decide.
How many games in total again? I just want to make sure my numbers are right.
So there were, it's like 19 games in total because the first two were bonded into one.
Yeah.
So it should be 18 like exhibits, as it were. What have you got?
Yeah.
You're going to tell me you've got 12 and I'll be like, ah, fuck, I must have really messed this up.
No, no, no, no, that's, that's all right. Well, you, Samuel Roberts, you stand accused of wasting your time and money. Well, mainly your money on buying these games.
How will I be executed, by the way, if I'm found guilty? What is the execution?
I mean, unfortunately, it's not really a comedy answer. It's just lethal injection.
OK, will it at least be like, I don't know, sort of like Rosalina from Mario doing it or something like that or some kind of game theme?
Well, it will be a state sanctioned executioner. But if you want them dressed up as Rosalina, I mean, we can do that.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I don't know. Nintendo might not like that.
Well, this is not, you know, it's not necessarily what you want your brand associated with, is it?
Well, this is not an official Nintendo court. You know, this is like Matt Castle.
Yeah. But if it gets out that like, you know, someone dressed as a bit of Nintendo IP has been executing people, it might not go down. Anyway, listen, let's not jump the gun here.
Got to find out if you're getting executed first.
Yeah, true.
And this court finds you not guilty.
Oh, wow. I can't believe it. Oh, wow.
On a score, a mighty score of 11 to 7, you are not guilty.
Wow. I mean, I thought I would honestly thought that like some of those latter entries, you'd be like, well, this is horseshit.
So, you know, it was there was a time when the bads overtook the goods, but you pulled it back. But there is a twist. You are found not guilty of buying bad pre-owned games.
Yeah.
But you are found guilty for the death of your grandpa who you unplugged to plug in a Wii U to play Ghost Squad.
Oh, shit. A little did I know.
I now reveal to you this entire cooperation was actually a sting to get you to admit that.
Wow. It's like an episode of Black Mirror.
And Chewbacca, that was actually the head of the Metropolitan Police in a costume.
Okay.
So, yeah. What do you make of that?
Well, I mean, a twist like, you know, worthy of the best crime authors really.
How many other podcasts have a twist like that at the end?
Yeah, very few.
Where one of the hosts is accused of killing a family member.
Yeah, so that was like a whole very, very bleak, runny joke there. Quite a funny one. But yeah, just to be very clear, like, there are no other people in my flat.
It's just me.
And yeah, I'm also not actually a judge.
But then isn't that what someone who killed their grandpa would say?
Well, there are no longer anyone else in your flat. That's true.
Yeah, exactly. I'm technically correct. But it's too late.
I've been found guilty. I'm prepared to accept my punishment.
Rosalina, do the duties.
We did it, Matthew. Thank you for indulging my nonsense there. That was good.
You've got a good games collection. But you need to play some of these games.
Yeah, that is the thing, isn't it? I blame Ghost of Tsushima for being so long. But yeah, I think that it was...
I've definitely gone through a phase of hoarding Nintendo games. And I don't regret it, because I think my collection is relatively decent. So even though some of the ones in there are a bit odd, I realize, and caked in mud in other cases.
Yeah, there's stuff to love in there. And I stand by most of my decisions. But it doesn't matter now because I'm being executed.
So yeah, it's a good run.
You can play just one of these 18 games as your last supper. Which one are you going to play?
I think Sly Cooper, just to stick it to the judge.
We sent him to hell with a smile on his face.
I think I'd probably play Tony Hawk's American Skateland to see if it's any good or not. And then as I kind of work that out, I'll be injected by Rosalina and then dead.
This is where you find out it's pure 6 out of 10. And you're just like, what a waste.
Yeah, he died as he lived playing 6 out of 10 games. So Matthew, that is the end of the podcast. We definitely made the most out of that very daft feature.
And I hope people enjoyed it. If you hated it, we're only going to do this podcast once because I'm not going to keep buying games like this and cataloging them on the podcast. But I thought it would be fun to talk about buying habits.
Do you have any other thoughts, Matthew, that you want people to go away with?
I enjoyed putting you on trial. I'm up for putting more people on trial for things.
Yeah, that could be a good format that we revisit. Yep, so Matthew, we'll return next week with another episode. We already know what episode we're doing next week.
It's Game Developer Interviews From Hell. Is that one you're looking forward to?
Oh, I'm looking forward to it because I am bad at interviews.
Yeah, same. We're going to do some name dropping followed by the usual mix of self-loathing about stuff we did 14 years ago. So, it should be a fun one.
But Matthew, where can people follow you on Twitter?
You can follow me at MrBazzle underscore Pesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter. If you want to follow the podcast, it's BackpagePod on Twitter.
You can also email us at backpagegames.gmail.com. You are welcome to send us questions. You've probably noticed that we read out questions when we get sent them.
You can also tweet us questions too. And if you'd like to leave us a review on the platform of your choice, it'd be much appreciated. We've had a lot of really nice reviews on Apple of late.
So, thank you so much for people who have bothered to.
Yeah, it's very kind.
Yeah, like it actually really makes a huge difference as well, because whatever their charts are based on, it's got fucking nothing to do with downloads, because I like most downloaded episodes will be really low. But then the next, like the lowest one will be like really high. And I'm like, well, this seems like a made up chart.
But I think it's actually partially based on reviews and stuff to see how engaged people are. So it does help. However, it's not necessarily your problem.
So if you don't want to do it, I understand. But yes, thank you very much for listening. And we'll be back next week.
Bye bye.
Bye.
I think that was a good little bit of preamble there, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was jolly.
I also managed to eat a Renny.
That's good, that's good.
Did you hear me?
Nope, I didn't actually. There was a bit on Best Games of 2007 where I thought, is he eating a packet of crisps?
I assume he would, but there was a bit of rustling at some point, I don't know.
That might have been Renny's.
Okay. I'm gonna have to keep this in the podcast, I'm afraid. It's gonna go at the end of the MP3.
Yeah, Matt Castle's very corrupt games court that's under the watch of Tommy Vercetti from GTA Vice City. Yeah, behave yourself or you might get beaten to death with dildos. That's just how things work in this justice system.
Yeah, so Matthew, to close out, I'm gonna cut that deal, those pics are very dark. That's so dark! Why did I say that?
And now I'm gonna be like, oh, and follow us on Twitter. Oh dear.
Hahahaha! It's very, very hard to segue from one to the other.
That's like an Alan Partridge kind of like, and then the co-host looks at him like, what the fuck? Yeah.
