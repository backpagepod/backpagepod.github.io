Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Riddled with Covid, it's, yes, Matty C. You have an illness that, you know, I thought you didn't hear much about anymore. And in the last few weeks, Covid seems like it's making a comeback.
It's, you know, perhaps the least favorable comeback, you know, outside of Boris Johnson, that one can imagine, really. But, how you doing, you okay? Have you played Bayonetta 2 this week again?
No, no, the piece of pop culture, which suffered for me, ingesting it while diseased, was the Tim Robinson film Friendship, which I really wasn't in the mood for when I was poorly.
Two stars on Letterboxd from Matthew Castle.
Yeah, I got really cross watching it. It was like, fuck this film, fuck this stupid man. So yeah, that was, maybe I'll come back to it when I'm less riddled and see if it holds up better.
Or maybe I'll just lock it in as that experience and never go back to it.
Well, you know, that's a beautiful thing in and of itself, for sure. So yeah, it could have been Bayonetta 3, but hey, that can wait for the next time you have Covid in three years or whatever. Yes, I mean, the podcast has been around so long now.
I remember that time you got Covid. Was there a time before that? Is this the third Covid for you?
I think it might be. I got bad Covid after Gamescom like two years ago. And then I feel like I've definitely...
The thing is, I just get a lot more colds, which could be Covid. You know, we live in this age now where everyone's like, eh, it probably is. But what can you do?
Like, this is just the way of the world now. We all get two absolutely stinking colds at random every year. And that's just a lot.
Though people are also saying to me, well, that's just because you're older now. You know, you shouldn't compare yourself at 40 and what happens to your good health in your 20s. But I definitely think Covid has a role to play in it.
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, this is the one thing, one good thing about working from home is I've just not, I've had, I think, about two colds in the last three years. It's been, yeah, it's the one good thing about it.
You're just completely out of, out of, yeah, in your own bubble.
The problem is I just love The Office Bants so much. Like, this is very much, I'm paying the, it's like the iron price, the Bants price, is that I get very, very ill and just assume I'm going to die twice a year.
That's tough. Well, we will keep the episode a bit shorter because Matthew's throat is under attack from Covid. On the fifth time you get Covid, you should get some kind of like prize, a little punch card prize, like I've got five of these now.
What can I get?
A free Subway.
Yeah, a free iced latte from somewhere. I feel that should be a thing that someone can facilitate. But we do have a lot of games to discuss in this episode.
Primarily Silent Hill f, which we've both been playing. I've played a bit of Ghost of Yotei, Matthew's played a lot more of that, and a few other things besides. But first of all, I wanted to do something I've been meaning to do for two weeks that I've failed to do.
I wanted to shout out our listener Emily on her new baby, and yeah, just say congratulations, and that's from your husband.
Sorry, that made it sound like you were saying you were her husband. You were saying, I want to congratulate you. That's from your husband, me, Samuel Roberts.
Let me f, start again. There's a reason we don't do shout outs very often, okay? This is not my first, I'm not f, Chris Evans in the 90s.
And that is of course from me, your husband.
For f, sake. This is so weird. Okay, yes.
Emily, who introduced her husband, Chris, a separate man to the person talking right now. A patron supporter and a mega fan of the podcast and a level designer in her day job. A very complimentary, whenever someone who actually works in the games industry, listens to the podcast and makes games and doesn't think we're f, we're f, Wollies, which is key.
And also like one of the most reasonable discorders, you know, there's only a handful of them, the really reasonable ones.
Oh, I mean, that's the gold standard, really.
Exactly. That's really the highest praise I can give, I can give, Emily. But yes, congratulations.
And yes, Chris asked, Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater is the game that she was playing before. She delivered a baby. We're curious to hear our thoughts on the game and any suggestions for games to play while caring for a newborn, Matthew.
Have you played any of Delta yet? You got a copyright?
Yeah, I've got a physical copy, but genius that I am. I have a PS5 Pro with no disk drive.
Oh, shit.
So it hasn't really...
You make a podcast. You can get a disk drive. It's all right.
HMRC can pay for that one.
So yeah, I've not got a great answer for Emily. This is a terrible bit all around for Emily. I'm so sorry.
Yes, I've played a bit more of it and I think maybe Chris probably sent this before we put out the What We've Been Playing episode where we did talk about Delta a little bit. But yeah, I think generally pretty impressed by it. I hear that they've improved some of the performance issues with it.
It's one of those very demanding Unreal Engine 5 games. And, you know, even my PC with its 3080 Super or something like that, some combination of numbers and letters is like not necessarily performing the best with it. So, you know, I think they're still working on it in sort of drips and drabs.
But I have no real problem with them sort of revising the art style of the game. It's not like they're deleting the, you know, the original game, which would have been much more of a bummer. Sometimes that does happen on Steam.
So that's not happened here.
What a classically reasonable Back Page take.
Well, I think sometimes I worry that my takes are formed too much against people on Blue Sky complaining about things all the time. Did you see that fucking thread? I'm sure you did, going, are there any more good games on top of these good games?
The only good games are Red Dead Redemption 2 and then like one other game, The Half-Life 2 or something. Did you see that thread doing the rounds?
Yeah, I did. I didn't read it in that voice, which has really brought that tweet alive for me. You should do voices more often, man.
That was great.
That's not one of my best ones. I've got some great voices I do. Of people I know in real life, I can never ever repeat publicly because they're kept to a very careful secret from the people who get to enjoy those voices in private.
Do you do one of me?
No, I don't, actually. I do use that sticker, though, on WhatsApp of you having eaten the big sausage at a Games comma. I will confess, I use that as a reaction emoji when people are like, send me bad news, and I just use you looking depressed after the sausage.
Oh, good. Oh, God, my face is associated with bad news. That's really what I aspire to.
Well, look, I mean, surely that is better than me doing a voice impression of you behind your back. Do you do an impression of me behind your back? Is that part of your office patois, your type five in the office?
It's not part of that? No. Okay.
No, so I can't remember where I was, but yeah, that sort of thing, whenever I see that, it takes way too much headspace than it should.
Yeah.
And then I worry that when I come up on the podcast, I feel like I'm trying to fight back with very reasoned takes for everything. You know what I mean? We're not a hot take podcast.
I know what you mean. I just, I feel though that, no offense to the guy, but a relative nobody and it gets elevated. It's not like it was said by Miyamoto, then it's a talking point.
Right. It's just like, here's what a random guy, it's like, yeah, loads of random people have shit random opinions. You know, it's just, I don't know.
I've kind of, I'm just trying to steer away from dunking culture in general. I'm such a fence sitter these days. It's terrible, terribly vanilla man that I am.
Well, I get it because I didn't quote tweet that and dunk on it because I agree. I don't really believe in it. And the only reason it's come to my attention is because other people are getting het up about it and wasting energy on it.
And so we all waste energy on it. And that becomes social media for the day, which is very depressing, really. It makes you think we should all get the fuck off of there.
And we should, but we don't. So yeah, but anyway, sometimes I just think I see a take that annoys me so much that I just have to fight back with like very reasonable, sensible opinions. I feel like that's the only way forward that the Internet age has really given me.
It's just stand against the tide of nonsense and kind of SEO stuff and just be like, no, it's fine that they change the colour of the lighting in the final cut scene of Snake Eater when he's saluting the grave. Do you know what I mean? That's where I've been left, Matthew.
But anyway, in conclusion, Delta, quite good. 70 quid, quite a lot of money. So that's basically where I fell with it.
Yeah. And as I can't contribute on Delta, I'll suggest on the games to play while holding a baby. Not that I have a baby, but you should get into visual novels.
It's like they're one button games. You just sit there, they last like a hundred hours. It's just like reading a book, except it's probably easier to hold like one switch joycon than it is to hold a book and then hold a baby in the other arm.
That's what I'd do.
Yeah, I was going to say something like 80 days might be good, you know.
Yeah, just like a mobile game. Yeah, just what is the one hand element of it. That's what you really want.
Rhythm Tengoku. Yeah, like below that child's brains with like crazy, you know, hectic J-pop early on.
Yeah, that's the thing. It's like if you can set up a very elaborate one handed DS thing where it's on that ridiculous stand that Kid Icarus Uprising came with.
Yeah.
I just have that on a coffee table next to you while the baby's in the other arm. Perfect. Really.
That's a baby on that 3DS stand.
I'm sure it's very durable. Yes, I got to go and track one of those down at some point.
Nintendo, they make good products.
So, yes, thanks so much, Emily.
And congratulations.
Yeah, thank you for your support and congratulations. It's actually really nice to get an email like that. And I hope that Chris is happy with the shout out apart from the first half of it that we're horribly, horribly wrong and we'll never talk about it again.
And instead move on to the games this week, Matthew. So Silent Hill f, lowercase f, the first original game in this series for well over a decade. It is developed by NeoBards, who I'm not mega familiar with, a bit of an unknown quantity.
You know, they, I think they are best known for working on the Resident Evil Resistance multiplayer that came with Resident Evil 3 remake. So not really sure what else they're known for, Matthew. I didn't do tons of research on them, but a very interesting game in a few different ways.
So it's set in 1960s Japan and it is a self-contained story in the sense that, you know, it's not really, it's not set in the US, it's not set in the town Silent Hill. It's set in a secluded town called Episoo Gaoka. I've probably pronounced that terribly.
A secluded town, it is sort of like adjacent to a larger city, but they're basically stranded as part of the events of the story, actually. And so this hometown suddenly turns into a, with a strange fog, and all of these grotesque, kind of like plants and plant monsters. It's the story of this schoolgirl, Hinako, trying to survive in her warped hometown, along with a couple of her friends.
And then some terrible things start happening. And I'm about four hours into it, Matthew. And so I have not played as much as I imagine you have.
How far are you into it?
Oh, you're gonna really hate me for this. I've finished this game twice.
Well, that's exactly why you're on it. I mean, later in the episode, you'll understand why I've only played a couple of these games for like a small amount of time because I was playing one game for many, many hours.
But I was ill. I had time on my hands.
That's OK. So I would say so I'll talk first.
Yeah, I'll be interested. I'm not going to spoil it for you or for other people. But yeah, I have I have some observations, but I'm I am more interested to hear what you've got to say.
Yeah. So I'm at the there's a section set in a school.
OK.
This game I've reached. I've reached that bit basically. So there is still the sort of split between the quote, quote real world and a kind of otherworldly, more fantastical setting that you might be familiar with from past Silent Hill games.
The kind of otherworld as it was called then. There's like a version of that in this game for sure. This game is written by Ryu Kishi 07, who I believe is a pseudonym for someone I believe is not, has not been identified publicly Matthew, is that right?
But a visual novel writer of some renown, I think that's right, isn't it?
Yes, that's yeah, he wrote two very famous visual novels called Uminiko and Higurashi, is it? I think, which are like considered seminal works of the genre.
So, the setting of 1960s Japan is the thing that really makes the game quite exciting to play. I feel like it's a world I've not really stepped into before, it has themes from the off. There are immediately some things happening in the, in Hineco's family that ask questions about, where you only know some of the information and it feels like there are some key details missing.
But what's hinted at is, it's fairly dark, I would say. And so, I would say it immediately feels like an adult game in that sense, in a way that so few games do. I mean, I feel like Silent Hill has somehow managed to smuggle in themes that other games would never really touch, or most of the blockbuster games would never really touch.
And yeah, that's definitely still true here. And so, I think it feels authentic to the Silent Hill series in that way. And then, yes, it's a lot of fighting plant monsters in this combat system that has been compared to Souls-like games because it has a stamina bar, it has like a Z-lock system, and it has dodging, and it has these different weapons you can pick up that are breakable, but they are, it's a melee focused combat game as you might expect from the setting and the characters.
And yes, and I would say the interesting thing about that is that, you know, two things can be true at once. This game can have bad combat, and this game can also be good. And I think that's where I'm kind of currently falling with it, Matthew, so do you want to pick up from there?
What was really interesting about this one and like Silent Hill in general, I think Silent Hill has this reputation for quite deep stories, quite psychologically sophisticated stories and stories that maybe have big twists in them. And I felt like what was interesting playing this new one, as opposed to say playing Silent Hill 2 remake, where you were already aware of like what beats were coming towards you. It creates this quite interesting possibility space where you're constantly trying to figure out what it is the game is trying to communicate to you, like what the themes are going to be, particularly like what what things are going to symbolize.
Like maybe this is a generalization, but when I think of Silent Hill, I think of, you know, you're going to be fighting manifestations of something that is plaguing the character in real life. And part of the puzzle of these games is working that out. And I think one of the things Silent Hill f does really successfully is play its cards quite close to its chest and deals with so many different topics.
I don't think you're ever truly kind of on top of like what it is trying to communicate. And maybe unsatisfyingly for some, but I found that it created a tense environment. I don't know, I maybe imagined a darker game than it actually was.
I mean, you'll be able to make that kind of cool for yourself when you get to the end. But there was stuff in it where I was like, I really don't know what that's getting at. But like, it could be this, it could be that, like without spoiling anything.
And I won't say whether this is true either way. I was talking to someone at work about how I thought there was quite a big sort of paedophilia thing going on in this game.
Yeah. I could see why you might think that.
Yeah. Well, that's it. You can see why you might think that.
And I said that to someone at work and they were like, Oh, no. And also having not finished it, their take was completely different about what they thought it was trying to. And that's what I thought was really interesting about it.
It just, that it leans into your expectations of Silent Hill, that it is going to deal with some pretty gnarly stuff. And it lets you kind of, I don't know, soak in all the potential gnarly things it could be, which is why I think the narrative is so successful. I mean, the other thing with this game is that a second playthrough, I would say, is when you get to it at the end of the game, it's going to probably feel kind of mandatory.
And the game structurally does introduce a lot more information and a lot more answers on that second playthrough. And that's where I think you really feel the influence of Ryo Koshi, the writer and his visual novels have a very big looping structure to them, where you tend to get a scenario and then you do that scenario again and again and again and only once you've played all the loops do you fully understand what's going on. And there's sort of a version of that in this.
The downside for me and what maybe stops it being like one of the best games of the year. I don't think the combat like ever evolves or blooms. Like it's just on your second play through it is that combat again.
And if you are kind of a bit bored of it by the end of your first play through, it feels like the price you have to pay to kind of understand the story, which I still don't really know where I sit on that, you know, like I think the story is interesting enough that I wanted to get to the end. And having just finished it a second time, I feel like I actually understand it in a way. Now, I simply didn't at the end of the first play through.
I think the first play through is actually pretty obscured at the end. But I was also like, oh man, this fucking combat. Like, I don't know if I've got a third loop in me because I just can't hit any more booby flower ladies with a lead pipe.
It's just not interesting enough. And when you do replay it, you get to bring all your leveled up character and all your unlocks. So it's generally easier and it has some interesting things because the puzzle the puzzles have their own difficulty tier.
If you actually play through it on like normal difficulty the first time, if you're on the second playthrough, you can ramp the puzzles up and it kind of does refresh them to an extent. So that that definitely helps make it feel like a bit of a newer game that second time round. But yeah, it's an interesting one.
But in terms of like delivering a really sort of fucked up gnarly Silent Hill story, I do think it is like pretty like successful. I mean, the series had been struggling with that before it went away. And I think it sort of found its feet again.
And it's one of those things where Silent Hill's never been good at combat.
Right.
I think you're right that the looping structure draws attention to just how rough that combat is. And I will say, I do think it's slightly worse combat than Silent Hill 2 Remake had as well. And that was pretty repetitive.
Yeah.
But I would say that that had slightly better dodge and counter mechanics than this does. This has a slightly, slightly kind of loose interpretation of when an attack should connect versus when it actually does. It's got a very, very tight counter window on certain attacks, but not all attacks from enemies.
And it's just generally not very fun to swing pipes or knives or whatever you might pick up along the way. It's just not that interesting. And there are some enemies that actually come back from the dead after you've killed them, which is quite annoying.
And I mean, I'm not surprised by the loop thing, obviously, I kind of know about it now. People have been talking about that. But it is interesting seeing this critical split based on how much people can tolerate that combat versus the story.
You know, it really does seem to be that is where the slide from like sixes and sevens to nines comes from, you know? And yeah, I don't sort of, I don't mind it too much. I think I will see it through for that reason.
But I think you're right. Like it's such a confidently realized setting. It's such a great looking game.
It feels like Silent Hill doing something you've never seen before. And it's a big budget horror game, which there still aren't that many of them really. And the idea of Konami making these things again on the regular, that's two Silent Hill games in two years.
There's probably a third one coming out next year from the studio, formerly known as No Code. That's the suggestion, I think. And that's really cool.
The fact that they've nailed, they definitely nailed Silent Hill 2 Remake, even with the repetitive combat. And here, the setting is so refreshing, like you say. There's a lot to unpick in the story.
It's subverting expectations. You don't know where it's going. I think it is a sign that they're succeeding, even if they've not totally landed the plane on every element of the game.
Yeah, interesting. But we'll see how I feel after 10 more hours of it.
I was curious if you felt that effect of... Because it is a Silent Hill game, you do think about it a bit harder than you might other games, like when you're playing it. I don't know if you sort of experienced that.
Yes. I'm like, why is the... When you look at the drawing of the sister in the journal, why is her face scratched out?
And what happened to her when she got shipped off to this husband or whatever? That's a mystery I've been thinking about constantly while I've been playing it. I've been thinking what's really going on with Hineco's parents and what's going on with some of these other girls that you meet in the game, who seem to be a bit jealous of a friendship that you have with another character.
Yeah, lots that I'm like, I'm definitely on high alert for what it, they're basically turnkey unlocking what the story of this game is. So I'm not too surprised to hear that's the experience. I will ask this, and I don't think this is a spoilery question, but the combat encounters in the first playthrough, are they basically the same in the second playthrough?
They reposition some enemies, they jump out of different places. Not that I remembered any of it enough to be like, oh my god, that enemy came up on the left last time, and this time it's the right. Not really.
I'd say there are some sections where they kind of add a few different scares, but it's kind of like fighting the same stuff. I wouldn't say it's like visually transformed or anything.
Right, because when you play Nier Automata again, for example, those are very pronounced kind of differences in those playthroughs, and yeah, I was curious to see how they do it here, basically, like how they layer in the new story versus not really changing the game content or if they do, you know.
Yeah, it's interesting. I tell you what, this game has... I don't think any game has ever made its collectible documents work harder for it, and it really made me laugh how sophisticated some of them are in this game compared to Resident Evil, which in my head, for a long time, I always put Resi and Silent Hill, they're both sort of Japanese survival horrors from a similar period.
But then you see some of the sort of depravity and strangeness that the documents in this are suggesting, because I think a lot of it is around the edges. I think that's where Ryokoshi is doing like his most interesting work, is he's using documents to plant seeds and make you think, oh yeah, what if, you know, if I follow that thread, then maybe this is a story about X. And you know, you get to Resi and it's like, day one, I wonder where Brian went.
Day two, met Brian, he bit my arm. Day three, I love eating meat. And you're like, oh, fucking rubbish.
That's rubbish compared to this.
Yeah, but that was always the difference. But Resi's just had to carry this genre for fucking a decade basically. Like, because, you know, because Silent Hill opted out, Konami opted out.
So that's the thing, they were always the kind of like slightly goofy slasher kind of like tone horror game. It's just that I think that the first person ones, seven onwards, kind of confuse it and make you think it's kind of prestige horror. We talked about this when Village came out.
Village has no narrative themes in it. There's nothing, nothing symbolizes anything. The big woman, her daughters, you know, anything that Ethan's doing.
There's no symbolism at all.
It literally happens. What you see literally happens. There is a wolf man.
There is a puppet baby.
And that will be exactly the same in the new one as well. And that's OK. That's what Rezzy's always done.
But you're right. It's when you're confronted with it here. And you are right.
Like, I did wonder if a fair criticism of this game is that maybe too much information is communicated by text that you have to pick up. Just versus the very elegant storytelling that Silent Hill 2 does. You know, that's got a lot more in the way of cut scenes that suggest things that pay off later, you know.
That's true. On your second playthrough, it does quite a good thing where if you try and skip a cut scene, it will tell you like, oh, no, this cut scene is different this time, so don't skip it. And some of them, because some of them are quite subtle.
Some of them are quite major, as you'll see. But I really, it really does feel like like someone made an action game and then this writer kind of snuck through the game, hiding like all the subtext around the environment in documents. Like it's quite unusual how very contained to that side of the game it is.
And it's a way of doing it. Like he's sort of hidden, like I don't want to say he's hidden a visual novel in the survival horror game, but you know, there is a density to the ideas, which is very familiar if you have played his other games. So yeah, it's, I don't know, interesting to like bring a bit of a superstar writer, albeit in this niche, and to like, just let them sort of strut their stuff and do what they do best.
Yeah, and the writing is good as well. You know, it's written from Hineco's perspective and, you know, the things that she talks around the edges of her, because she might not have all the information herself, for example, but you'll get the perspective on, you know, her friendship with, you know, this boy that you meet in the game and, you know, the kind of the law behind their friendship as well. A thing called space wars they invented together and why they always call each other partner and that kind of thing.
And it feels very rightily in a way that I do like. So I don't hold that against it too much, but that is definitely a marked difference from too, where, you know, I think once you find the VHS and the hotel in two, you have a pretty strong idea of what's going on. And, you know, I just, also, and even before that, really, it's kind of like, there's not loads of ambiguity there.
And it's very light-touch storytelling. And that's why I think, that's part of why I think too is so effective. But yeah, I don't hold that against this.
It's a different style and it's largely successful. And I guess I'll see how successful I find it after that second playthrough, Matthew. But I've seen some people say they've played it four times.
I'm not sure I could.
I just can't.
I could. And that's interesting, isn't it?
Not while I'm sick, man. I just can't do it.
I think the combat needs like, the thing is I'm playing it on easy combat and hard puzzles at the moment. So which I like because I would say the absolute, some people I've said in headlines is the highlight of the game, Matthew. But there is a scarecrow puzzle in this that is genuinely a cool bit of like, you know, scare design, I would say, where you have to make your way through this kind of like misty marsh, basically.
And how you do so depends on how you interpret these clues that you find attached to these scarecrows in these fields. And yeah, so that's the kind of moment that I've seen people talk about. It's like, oh yeah, this is like the best bit of the game.
And I don't know if that's true or not, Matthew, but it certainly is capable of creating moments like that, where you're like, that was really cool, you know?
Yeah, there's a really good other world bit that you'll get to in a bit, which is like, where it really went into like, what the fuck is going on territory for me? So yeah, it's a cool game for sure.
Yeah, it is. I'm glad it happened. That's kind of how I feel about it.
OK, well, that's cool.
The Konami Renaissance continues.
Indeed. I will talk about that game again at some point when I've played more of it too. So yeah, we'll see.
I've got a load of NES games to play this weekend, Matthew. But after that, I'll come back to it. OK, so next game is Ghost of Yotei.
And Matthew's played loads more of this than I have. I've only played a tiny little bit of this so far. But long awaited sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, a Covid core classic from 2020.
Lots of people played it then. I played it in 2021 when I had the old PS5 frame rate upgrade and I thought it looked absolutely wonderful. And it was an amazing escape from lockdown at the time.
Just these wide open fields, lots of leaves and stuff blowing around, petals blowing around and colors of grass that you'd never seen in the United Kingdom where everything is some kind of shade of brown. And just generally was a perfect game for the moment.
There's no hosepipe ban here.
And so this game comes along years later. And interesting to again see as most people love this game, but there's a slight split in people who feel like they've played this before in the sense that the story is a very familiar revenge story. It is very similar to the Assassin's Creed Shadows revenge story from early this year, where a bunch of themed masked individuals have wronged your main character in some way, and you must go and track them down one by one.
It's basically the same plot. And in a setting that is superficially similar. And yes, it's...
Yeah, but interesting to just see people kind of like figure out what do you say about the Sony highly-polished, narrative-driven open-world formula when you've been confronted with it many times. Confronted is the wrong word. You know, you've played a game that uses that format many times.
But you're playing a very, very good version of it. And I think from the couple of hours I've played so far, that's what it feels like, Matthew. It feels like a very similar kind of experience with some niceties on top, a better main character, and a very beautiful world that, you know, I assume in theory is making the most of the PS5's capabilities this time.
But you've played a lot more of it than me. So how have you found it?
Yeah, I've been enjoying it. So I think I was on the kind of cooler end of the spectrum for Tsushima, which a game I never finished. I burnt out on the second island.
I just felt like there was just too much stuff and like not enough ideas to sort of stretch to all that stuff. And I just kind of got bored of doing the same things over and over again. This one, I think it's immediately a bit stronger for having not a great story, but a story with like a bit more of an immediate drive to it that you say, you've got to get these six people and each of those people that you're after.
Well, some of them, at least in what I've played of it so far, they basically have like a little region of the map to themselves. And when you go there, the story is very much about bringing down that member of the Yotei Six. And those through lines, I find, are much improved over like the individual island storylines of the first game.
Where, you know, I always had this general idea of like, well, I've got to bring down whatever his name was, Kotei Kahn, or at the end of it, you know, that's the big baddie we're working towards. But, you know, I would often lose sight of that, and not really know why I was doing stuff. But here, if we're in this bit of a map, we're after this particular fucker.
And if not amazing storytelling, it's much clearer storytelling, which I think kind of helps carry it. Different regions have like, slightly different flavors of enemies, and slightly different like gimmicks going on. So I like did a region where it was always a fiery base to sort of sort of not a fire cult as such.
But you know, there was a lot of enemies using flames. And now I'm in an area where the enemies are a bit more stealthy. So they kind of ambush you and jump out.
And that also helps to kind of mix things up. So as a general like playing through the main story, I think it has a bit more pull to it. I think the game I'd liken it most to in terms of like evolution as a sequel, it's probably like Marvel's Spider-Man 2.
In terms of like taking just the model, which was pretty confident first time around and doing it slightly prettier, you know, throwing in a few more villains along the way to kind of keep you engaged, like I said. Also toning down some of the side quest excess in places like instead of 10 army bases to take back per region, there might be three and that's enough to kind of get your fill of that. And I think it understands that people burn out on this stuff quite quickly.
You know, I think the combat is ever so slightly sort of massaged around the edges in the way it's Spider-Man added, you know, the parry, which we both loved.
Well, that's the thing is this has made this has made good improvements to the combat. I don't think Spider-Man 2 did. That's the one thing I think we probably differ on, you know.
I think I mean, maybe this happened in Tsushima and I just don't remember it. But I think part of what reminds me of Spider-Man 2 is that this partners you up with quite a few people at points, like there's quite a few missions where you're with someone. And, you know, it does cool things like when you do the standoffs, it's you and another person attacking in tandem.
And sometimes they'll come in and save you when you're about to die. And it's a bit like when Miles Morales swings in and like kicks a guy in the head in Spider-Man 2. It just feels a bit lively or a bit more energetic.
I think that that's probably the incredibly basic bitch reason I'm constantly reminded of that game is that, you know, there are a few more good hangs that you're partnered up with in this. I wouldn't really lump it in with a lot of the Sony storytelling things. Like, I don't think it's of a sort of tier of like quality and sophistication is like what Naughty Dog do or even what Santa Monica do with God of War.
I still think you can see the slightly 7 out of 10, 8 out of 10 bones in this one, which sort of stop it from being the really sort of higher tier, just in terms of like, it is an open world map clearing game. You know, while there are fewer activities to get bored doing, it's very like a map covered in blinking icons for you to collect. I've never really thought Sucker Punch have managed to kind of step beyond that.
I can always sort of see the sort of through line of like old open world game thinking in their games. They never quite made that leap. I never thought Infamous quite did it.
Didn't think this quite did it either. Which you know, it's still perfectly fine and you know, I think it gets away with a lot because it's like such a beautiful world, a lot more abstracted compared to the more like realism of Assassin's Creed Shadows, for example, you know, it's quite sort of impressionistic, these floating planes and the bizarre colours that kind of pop and everything. But there is something like a little bit kind of repetitive about it.
I kind of already feel it's sort of setting in the same way that I felt about Tsushima, where I feel like I've seen all its new combat tricks now. And whatever happens in the game, I'm kind of having the same fights over and over again. Occasionally it throws in like a curveball, like a particularly interesting boss fight or, you know, the one-on-one duels which were brilliant in the first game, I think is still brilliant here.
But every side story, every side quest, every activity on the map, kind of fundamentally boils down to like loads of people coming at me, and me thinking I feel like I've done this like 20 times already. So I'm not quite feeling like the over, you know, the extreme love for this. I don't think it is completely transformative.
I think it's I do think it's better than Tsushima, but not to the extent where I'm like chomping at the bit to get back to it. Like I feel like I've almost already had my fill with like three of the six down, which is kind of what happened in Tsushima, like halfway through the second island. And I was like, yeah.
But I don't know what the remedy to that is. Stupidly, I played three times more Assassin's Creed Shadows.
You did.
I don't think that's a better game than this, really. But I can't really put my finger on why, you know, whether that was just a bit more manipulative in terms of how it pulled me through or like, yeah, it's a bit of a mystery. Maybe once this cold's cleared, you know, I've got a bit more clarity, but I kind of end up feeling quite the same way about both of them, which doesn't seem to be consensus.
I think the consensus is this is better than Shadows, but I don't know. They're just so similar in so many ways.
I think that what it comes down to is that this is true of Tsushima as well, but that combat is just a bit better than Assassin's Creed's combat. It's just faster, more responsive, great to look at. And you're right that it is, the combat encounters are largely similar.
It's a bit of parrying and a light attack and a heavy attack. They've added a bunch of new weapons, which you can speak to how, whether they feel particularly different or not, it doesn't sound like it from what you said so far. And there are weapons you can pick up and throw as well, which I don't believe they did in the first game.
That's brilliant. That's a great touch.
Yeah, a really great touch. And I think that combined with the fact that they have, there is a better protagonist in this story that is otherwise quite familiar. It's enough to get it over the line of feeling different enough and it being a different place for you to tick off all those boxes.
I don't think anything you said is unfair, but I do think that that combat is the thing that makes it some people's preferred flavor of a 10 open world game over Assassin's Creed Shadows or other similar games. That's how I feel about it. It's like that Sekiro-like combat.
You can break enemies, they can break you and you are rewarded for parrying at the right time, but it's not super, super strict. I actually thought the enemies weren't hitting me enough in this, so I've increased the combat to hard because there are some dudes who run out and are just like, oh, and they're like, this is the fight of my life, and then stand there not hitting you, waiting politely for other people to hit you, and I'm like, come on, I want you to hit me. So now it's a bit more like, I think three hits and she goes down.
I quite like the stakes of that because the combat is just stimulating enough to make that enjoyable as an experience. So I think that is the thing, man. I think it's just that combat is a little bit more responsive, a little bit more exciting, and that's what it comes down to.
That determines whether it's your flavor of game or not. Satus Creed also has more of a focus on stealth and I know your Homestead building. There was a bit of that in that game, wasn't there?
Yasuke, a bit different. He was heavier kind of like character in terms of his attacks. But I don't know, you're the one who had Stockholm Syndrome with that game.
So yeah, it was just Stockholm Syndrome, I think, with that. I should say there are a couple of things I do really like about it. It has like bounties, you know, like each area has like five or so people that you want you to go and hunt down.
And they make sure those encounters actually feel like a specific moment. It's not just there are five stronger enemies at certain points in the maps. You know, they they've all got like weird quirks and, you know, some of them you end up working like alongside or, you know, some of them you have to hunt down.
Some of them have like a weird platforming challenge to get to. And, you know, I feel like they are working quite hard to make sure like every individual thing has like something of note to it which is kind of like that's the way open world games are, have improved massively in like the last five years is that like side content that doesn't feel too different to main content which I've always loved. So that stuff, that really works for me and I would absolutely encourage people to dig into the bounty stuff.
It also has, which is like crucial for like the gold standard of open world RPGs, an absolutely killer mini game. It's got this coin game, I don't know if you've come across this yet, in the bars.
Hmm, not yet.
It almost like a game of like bowls, but on the tabletop with coins where you flick coins and when you flick a coin, it has to touch another coin to claim it. But if it knocks a coin off the table, that coin goes in the other character's pocket. And if you knock two coins, you lose your turn.
So it's all about knocking coins so that they're positioned where they can neatly hit one more coin without fucking other coins. You also want to fuck over the other person. It's genuinely brilliant.
It's like, it's just a great game. It's got really nice PlayStation 5 DualSense controls, like really tactile flicking with the triggers. Really, I mean, all around this game uses the controller brilliantly, like interesting sound effects and touchpad stuff and motion stuff.
It's a proper showcase for the console, which, you know, there probably hasn't been since Astro Bot. So it does a lot right. It does a lot right.
I am enjoying it. I will go back to it. I just, yeah, I got to a point where I was like, am I burning out on this already?
But then I've seen people in our Discord who are like, I've played 50 hours of it in one weekend. And I was like, fuck me. All right.
Well, you know, knock yourselves out. That's a lot of the coin game.
It's very much one of those sort of like gourmet cheeseburger games where it's a very good version of something, you know, that I think like a lot of people love or a lot of people will buy and play. And so I don't think it's, for the likes of you and me, I don't think this is ever going to be destined to be one of our favorite games, you know, but, you know, and the first game wasn't like one of my very favorite games. But if you do buy a PS5, then I think it's a fairly easy recommendation, especially if you've not played Tsushima, just because, like you say, it's a great showcase.
And, you know, I do think that, I will say the opening hours have a lot more momentum than Assassin's Creed Shadows does, which is really crucial to my enjoyment of it. You kind of know that whole character's deal in the space of about 30 minutes, really, and then it just cracks on with it. And that is about four hours of your life in Assassin's Creed Shadows.
So, you know, significant difference there. Yeah, and I suppose the other thing is, how much do we hold it against a game when it is doing similar things again, but in a different setting? Because I think like the kind of gold standard for a game that takes a very similar, you know, uses a similar world slash template and then layers loads of stuff on top of it would probably be Tears of the Kingdom, a game that I don't like that much, but that you really like.
But I would not deny it's a bold sequel in terms of what it, you know, sticks on top of Breath of the Wild. And none of the Sony sequels this generation have quite done that. They've all been iterative in some way.
Some people like, you know, some of those games more than others. So Horizon, I see a bit of a split on how people feel about that second game, for example, whereas the first one people seem to like a lot. God of War Ragnarok, I definitely like less than the first one.
And I think you did as well. And then Spider-Man 2, there was just, what Spider-Man had on its side was he waited so long for a game like that to come along to the quality standard that it was. And then the second game could never quite match it in terms of like the sheer magic of it.
But it also did loads of cool stuff with, like you say, the different villains in the game and also the different characters. And it really looked nice. And even though it wasn't perfect, it was a pretty decent sequel.
So all of the Sony sequels this generation have been a bit like this, I think, where they're not necessarily like, oh man, they have revolutionized what came before. They've kind of gently iterated on what came before. And then you either agree with the creative choices they've made there or you don't.
And that they all seem to have had that, a version of that trajectory, you know?
Yeah, no, that is absolutely true. I think my feeling towards this game would make perfect sense if it wasn't for that weird Assassin's Creed Shadow thing that happened earlier in the year of playing so much of it. Like that I really can't explain away, but, you know, one of the things I did like about Spider-Man 2, you know, I pretty much 100%-ed that game, you know, maybe sub 30 hours.
And actually it felt really good. It just felt really well judged. There was the right amount of stuff and I think here like maybe a little too much early on.
Just a little, there's just too many opportunities for combat, you know, where combat hasn't had an opportunity like to change much between, because it does change as it adds new weapons or whatever. But yeah, maybe that will change. Maybe it's got some like tricks hidden away.
Like there's definitely, you know, I've barely made a dent on the skill trees in Yotei. And, you know, I'm sure there's some stuff hidden up its sleeve. But yeah, I don't know.
I kind of, I just, I would, a lot, I'm up for a 30 hour, you know. You can do one of these games in 30 hours and it's all right to do that.
Well, well, so according to How Long to Beat, which, you know, is the people on there are, you know, most of the time deducting five hours from their actual total, to try and make it sound like they're, you know, the best gamers in the universe. But Main Story, 24 hours for Ghost of Yotei, Main Plus Extra, 39 hours, Completionist, 47 hours. Now Ghost of Tsushima was 62 and a half hours Completionist.
So they have actually, like, but, you know, seemingly slimmed down the amount of other stuff. And the Main Story is identical in length. And it definitely did feel, I would say to Tsushima's credit, yes, the side content was not totally stimulating.
You know, for the most part, it was pretty repetitive and paint by numbers as open world content goes. But it was one of those games where you didn't have to engage with it. You could pretty much just go through the Main Story and see it and then do all the main character side quests, which were pretty clearly demarcated in that game.
I think it was like one per island basically, one human NPC he paled up with, including that bloke from Lost, remember him? He was there. And yeah, and then that was kind of it.
So, yeah, it was early. It was just early in, yeah, with a samurai sword. It was an unexpected and subversive choice.
I won a few in that game, Matthew. Yeah, so they seem to have put less stuff in it, but it doesn't stop it from feeling like something you've played before, but which is, them's the breaks, I suppose, you know? So, yeah.
Yeah, I'll stick with it. I'll see. Let's see how it goes.
I'd love to see the universe where you played this first and then played Assassin's Creed Shadows. That's the... I want to see that timeline, you know?
But alas. Yeah, because I don't...
That is such a blip, Assassin's Creed Shadows. That is one where I'm like, why did I play this so long? I generally don't remember what happened.
That's so weird.
I just figure this is what you're like, you know? This is how you engage with media, is that you just do the thing. No matter how long it takes, you're like, I've started it now, I've got to just keep going, even if it lasts forever.
I feel like you're like that with most things. Am I wrong there?
Yeah, I do kind of get a move on and charge two things. Yeah, we watched a lot of Justified in like the last month.
You sure did.
I mean, a lot of Justified on top of all these video games. And I'm back in, I'm playing the 100 line. I've picked that up again.
I've put another 20 hours into that.
Amazing. Yeah, you know, I sort of, I don't question how you spend your spare time, but I do wonder if like allowing that to occupy so much of your spare time this year means that this was never ever going to like, you know, feel completely fresh, combined with the fact that you never loved Tsushima in the first place. However, I'm not saying anything that you've pointed out is actually wrong.
So I don't think it is. I think it's just more that I don't play that many of these games and even few of them to completion. So I kind of save the ones I think I'm going to like the most.
And in this case, I saved the one that I know has got the best combat system, you know? So that's sort of what it came down to for me. But I'll let you know how I feel about it in about 15 hours time, Matthew, and we'll come back to it.
Okay. Next game then. So I guess, shall I tackle No, I am not a human first, Matthew?
Yeah, I saw this. I don't know what this is at all.
So people who spend as much time looking at Steam as I do, there's always one or two things that cost between five and 15 quid where you're like, oh, I wonder why that's like fifth in the top sellers chart. And it's some kind of like viral thing that's broken out and people have been like, oh man, you won't believe this. You got to check this out and see what the deal is.
And this was one of those where I thought the idea sounded genuinely interesting. And so I took the plunge. So it's from the publisher Critical Reflex who published Mouthwashing.
And that game that I don't know the name of because Tickets has replaced the name of it in my head because of Matthew Castle.
Threshold.
Yes. So Threshold, aka Tickets, they also made Arctic Eggs. And they've kind of become, people might remember a few years ago on the podcast, I talked about Puppet Combo and how they're kind of like low, sort of like low, not low res, but like sort of kind of like very old school kind of poly style horror games were, you know, scratching an itch that I thought just made them really distinctive in that kind of genre.
They just made things that looked a little bit PS1 or a little bit Windows 95 and it was very, very effective. And Critical Reflex, I feel like have come along and turned this basically into their business. So they have published a few different things now that are all in this price range, are all quite strange and are all kind of horror adjacent.
And this is another one of those. Now, this is basically a game where you play someone who is a recluse staying in their house and something bad is happening outside that you are hearing about on the TV each day. You wake up, you turn on the TV, something bad is happening and you cannot go outside during the day.
Sounds familiar.
And so there is, and so amongst this there are people who are coming to your door and seeking sanctuary in your empty house. And so you wake up each day and when it's night time, people knock on your door and you speak to them at the door and you have to decide whether to let them in or not. And you can, yeah, you can turn them away or yeah, you can let them in.
They'll stay in a room in your house. You can interact with them. Now, the thing is, you are also warned by the TV that there are, there are these basically aliens out there impersonating humans.
And so each person who comes to your door might be a person, but also might be one of these, these aliens as well. And as time goes on, you get more and more ways in which to identify whether someone is a, is a human or an alien who's in, who's in your house. It'll be things like the color of their eyeballs or the, the state of their fingernails.
So do they shit acid?
More and more of these kinds of kind of like, you know, sort of telltale signs really that you might be dealing with an alien or a human. And if you identify an alien or you think you've identified an alien, you can kill them on the spot in your house. And, and you might be right and you might be wrong.
And I've been both right and wrong in this game.
So does it explicitly tells you yes and no?
No, it doesn't. Oh. It's, but the first time you get it wrong or right, it does tell you because it says, it pops a steam achievement saying, oh, you, you, you incorrectly guessed that a human was actually an alien and you killed a human.
Sorry about that basically. And then the reverse successfully identified an alien. And the, so it takes place over something, I think something like two or three in-game days, the same loop each day.
And I think there's a random aspect to which strangers come to the door seeking sanctuary. And there are some bits that are like scripted story bits, but yeah, there are, there are NPCs I've seen in screen shots who I've never actually encountered. But each time someone knocks on your door and you go in and you look through the peephole and you talk to them, it's like, it's a pretty scary experience.
There's a bit of like papers pleased to it. But it's kind of like, it's got a visual novelty aspects as well, because the people you invite in aren't just like, you know, props basically. They are, they are people with lives and memories or, you know, or they might be aliens hiding in plain sight, you know.
So interact with, interacting with them is quite interesting. There are, and there are other, there are things you can do to learn more information that gives you an advantage. There's a, there's an in-game phone where you can call for supplies of a certain kind, and these supplies can basically help you have more attempts at identifying whether someone's a human or an alien each, each day if you, you know, by using these items.
And so there's like a kind of micro sort of, sort of like an economy aspect to it as well. But it's mostly about that thrill of who's that knocking at my door, and then seeing like it's a creepy motherfucker, and it becomes a game about your first impression and your prejudices really, you know? You look at, look at someone who's a bit slovenly, who's, and it is a little bit awkward in the way they talk, and you might make a value judgment based on that and be completely wrong.
And you don't give them a sanctuary and they're basically fucked. And it's, you know, but it's just really interesting in that respect. It's sort of like, it's all about what kind of person are you and what is your outlook on the people that you meet.
And so I thought it was a really effective game for that reason.
Have you had any absolute howlers? Have you made any real bad mistakes?
Yeah, I killed one guy because I just thought he was a bit, he was just a bit too dirty and smelly and I thought, it's sort of like, he had like one of the symptoms but not another one and I thought, that's close enough, I'll just take his head off. And then I got that wrong. But there are some people as well who are like.
That is rich coming from a games journalist. Too dirty and too smelly, I mean, man alive.
I'll have you know, I've always been hygienic. Yeah. And then, and then someone, but there are some characters that are strange conditions to them.
Like a guy will say, I'm leaving these three nuns in your care and I'll be back in a few days. Just make sure nothing bad happens to them because the aliens will start killing the other people in your house. So you'll wake up and there'll be like a mystery, like body bag and like one of your guys has just gone.
And there's no explanation of what happened to them. But at that point you're like, right, someone in here is not actually human.
You're like, right, I'm killing me three nuns.
I think that's a fundamentally great tension to build a game around. It takes about three hours to play through. It's about 10 quid, I think.
How much is it? It's 12 pounds 79. And it has multiple endings as well, which are based on how well you did or different choices that you've made.
How many nuns you butchered.
And I think this is the best of, no, Mouthwashing is still the best, but I think this is the best of the other critical reflex games that I've played. And I think there might be, is there maybe a discount they give you if you've got Mouthwashing or maybe one of the other games, something like that. I think I got it for a bit less anyway.
But yeah, I think it's just really cool. And it was like a hot minute that people gave a shit about it on Steam. And then that other game came out, Clover Pits, where you're playing like slot machines in hell.
And so that became the de facto game that everyone was obsessed with for like a week. And that's basically how Steam works now. And there's always something new and exciting to talk about.
And so that's kind of where things are at. But No, I'm Not a Human, I think it's actually coming to consoles as well. And yeah, this is this is slightly better than a game called Trolley or Trolley or something like that, where you maintain a trolley from lots of like weird people.
And it's like based on actually like a real public transport in Moldova. They released that on the same day. But No, I'm Not a Human is a much more interesting game.
So this is where I tell you that I think actually I have played this, but I thought it was called The Weird People at the Door.
Have you played this?
No, I haven't.
No, I haven't. No, I've played through this four times. I've actually seen every ending at this point and six seasons are justified.
I will always take you up on these on these oddities that you you bring to the pod. So yeah, I'm into them. I'm into these sort of narratively rich, experimental couple of hours kind of experiences.
It's name one more time.
No, I am not a human.
No, I am not a human.
Is that because that person said in the Discord, you don't say the names of the games you're talking about enough, Matthew? Is that where that came from by any chance? That's going to be Ghost of Yotei.
Yes.
I think we didn't need to say that one again, because it's one of the biggest PlayStation games of the year. But the name of No, I am not a human, which we've just been talking about, and does need to be said.
So that name again is Paranormous Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. So hopefully that helps. I bought another of their games I've not played yet, actually, which are quite a clip, and again, they've all got some commonality in art style called Eclipseum, which is about basically a sunless world begins devouring itself.
Every step shifts the landscape beneath you as you search for what remains of, well basically just lots of weird spooky shit happens on this strange planet where there's a load of weird sun stuff going on. So they've definitely got a type of game that they like, Ultra Cursed.
Sounds a bit three-body problem.
Yeah, I guess it does. But yeah, so I think, yeah, from what I've played of their games so far, I would say Mouthwashing Steel King, then this, then Threshold. Threshold has a great ending, you're kind of playing it for that really.
And this game is like really tense and really exciting the first time through. So there is high praise from your boy.
Yeah.
Next game, Matthew, is Baby Steps, which I couldn't decide whether, is this a meme game or not? And it seemed like it was marketed that way a little bit. So I haven't really engaged with it, but intrigued to hear your thoughts.
I don't think it's a meme game. I've only played a couple of hours of this and I haven't looked too deep into it because it's got quite a few surprises and weird happenings in it, which I didn't want to spoil. But something I have gleaned from reading some tweets and things about Baby Steps is that I think it goes to some weirdly profound places, or actually there is a bigger point to it.
This is the game where you start off in, you're basically in your parents' basement. You have this guy called Nate. He's in this, I don't know what you'd describe it as, it's like a onesie, I guess?
A big body vest, whatever those things are called.
Baby Grow?
Yeah. And he's sitting in this typically grungy gamer basement. There's pizzas on the thing, in a quite knowing touch.
There's an episode of One Piece on Netflix paused on his TV. He's clearly mid-marathon. And then he suddenly gets sucked into this fancy landscape.
Not One Piece. This isn't a man getting pulled into One Piece. But you are in, yeah, you're in this, hard to say where it's meant to be.
Like, I don't think the land has been named yet. You turn up there, you sort of plunged into a pool of water. It's a little bit like the start of another world in that you kind of, the first thing that happens is you're like drowning in this water and you have to sort of pull yourself out.
Then you meet this strange Australian man who keeps popping up. Oh God, what the hell is his name? I can't remember.
But there's this guy who keeps popping up as you go along the adventure and you have these very weird kind of encounters with him where the dialogue feels like sort of semi-improvised. I can't quite put my finger on what they're doing but you have this quite funny sort of discussion with him and then you're just left to wonder off. It's a game where you manually control both of Nate's legs.
Kind of an adjacent to I guess what Bennett Foddy, who's one of the developers on this, was doing in Getting Over It, which was about navigating a landscape by propelling yourself with a sledgehammer, so quite an unusual control scheme. He also made a QWOP, the one where you're sort of controlling each bit of the leg to try and make a man run. Someone who has made games that are very much about movement and control schemes, and can we find a more sort of elegant or deeper way to kind of merge the two to capture the sensation of movement and struggle in controls.
Here, you basically hold a trigger to move a leg, then you kind of move the leg with the analog stick, and then place your foot, then you move the other leg and place your foot. So you literally step by step moving through an environment that is full of obstacles. It's very hilly.
There's lots of stuff for you to slip on like mud and sand. And it's basically about finding a path to hard-to-reach checkpoints by mastering this climbing like getting over it. There's a lot of frustration built into that.
Like it's a game where if you trip and fall over, which being very physics-based, you will very easily. You can fall down slopes. You can basically fall all the way back to the start of the level.
Some catastrophic things can happen in this game where he just keeps rolling and bouncing and sliding all the while his baby grow is like picking up all this like mud and shit and grass stains and the guy's like, he's quite pathetic. He's like constantly like, Oh my god, help me, help me. Well this is happening.
So it's very, very funny. I can understand watching that why you might think it is just a meme game. But really what it is, is even more of a hiking simulator than Death Stranding.
Because in Death Stranding, you had to control the balance of Norman Reedus by adjusting your backpack as you walked over knobbly terrain. And it asks you to, do you want to risk taking these unsteady rocks or do you want to take this longer path? And here those decisions are just absolutely magnified.
You're like, give me a straightforward staircase, one step at a time, one foot per step. That I can just about manage and make quite well behave. But then you might just see like a slope, a grassy slope going off, which would get you there in half the time.
But, you know, it's going to be a lot more unpredictable trying to get the guy up there. And so it's constantly asking you, I guess, like whether you want to like risk a shortcut or ploddingly take the safe route. I mean, as it goes on, the safe routes begin to crumble away.
And actually, you're just in quite a free-formed open world environment, kind of left to explore at your own pace. But I think it does succeed even more so in Death Stranding, in really making you think about the routes you're going to take and looking at an environment and really weighing it up. And it being a game about, it's not about what's at the B of A to B.
It is about the journey and it is about the sense of satisfaction and the sense of achievement when you really master something. And, you know, I would imagine, based on what people have said, that that will tie into the character development of the Nate character. You know, this sort of schlub who basically can't even sort of stand up without lots of wrestling with the controller at the beginning, you know, will learn some kind of self-sufficiency, though I'm also expecting it to go to much weirder places because like there's so much fucking bonkers stuff in this.
Like there's that weird Australian guy who keeps popping up who seems to becoming more and more antagonistic every time you meet him and putting down obstacles and deliberately like fucking with you. There are also like a race of horse headed people who are climbing the same mountain you're climbing and at the checkpoints you often meet them. They are, though this is optional if you want, they wear t-shirts, but they're all naked from the waist down and they've all got these like sort of obnoxious horse penises that like swing when they're talking to you and like really get in your face.
It's a really odd game for like, You can see why I might have thought it was a meme game from some of this stuff. You know, it's sort of got that highly shareable, you know, look weirdness about it. I'm not saying that like, I'm not saying that means it's like, it's discounted as a sort of, you know, a thing to talk about or play or enjoy, but it's sort of like, that's a bit of attention grabbing, right?
It's, there's no real reason to have like horse sticks in your game.
No, you can turn them off. You know, that is an option. It is a choice.
And I feel like the game is trying to make you think it's quite silly and throw away. Where I, that's what I, I can just feel like a gut punch in there somewhere. Like it's actually going to be Silent Hill style, like a horrible metaphor for something.
And, you know, wow, that's what the horse penis represented. Oh my god, I feel terrible for making light of it.
Well, these games have done a number on you. I love the idea that now every time you play any game, you're looking for the Silent Hill style twist of-
Symbolism, I just see symbolism everywhere. But putting aside all that, those scenes, any scene where you talk to someone, they are really funny. This strange tone they have of semi-improvise, like the dialogue is so haunting.
You can almost hear one guy spewing all this scripted shit, and then the Nate character having to react to it in real time. Like he's very surprised and taken aback by what he hears. I've had five solid belly laughs from this game in a couple of hours.
And at the moment, that's sort of the motivation for climbing, because I just want to see the weird cut scene that happens next. I did stop playing it once I got Covid though, because I thought, I don't think I can really deal with this game like this. Like Bayonetta and Friendship.
I think it just has to be taken in a slightly different state of mind.
What a subcategory of media that is. Friendship with Tim Robinson, Bayonetta 2 and Baby Steps. What a weekend that is.
It's stuff you don't want your perception of reality to be like anyway blurred about. Like you want there to be like a real clean cut between you and these slightly weird worlds. Like most things are so vanilla that if I play them sick, it's like, well, that can't do me any harm.
But like friendship and Baby Steps can.
Yeah, I can see that. There's just something slightly off about, yeah, they can intrude on your own personal reality when your state of mind is fragile.
Yeah, if Slow Horses does that, not a problem. There's not enough substance to that to like truly upset me. But these other things, I could lose myself in that world.
Justify then you don't have any of any of that. You don't have like, oh, Catherine, why is Walton Goggins on our living room? You don't have any of that kind of.
No, and if it did, I'd be fine with that. I've got a full grasp of what a character is up to. But the sort of slightly villainous Australian man popping up every 10 minutes, that I couldn't deal with.
Can I ask you a kind of general question about, because the first thing I was going to ask you about with this game was, you know, how adjacent is it to Death Stranding? And it's at least close enough that you've talked about it many times. Also, by the way, really funny that you always call the main character in Death Stranding Norman Reedus, like that always amuses me.
Never Sam Porter Bridges, always Norman Reedus. But like, why is there this fascination with magnifying on these elements of games that we always take for granted? I'm talking about like walking, the idea of like, just simple movement, something you've done in a game forever.
But now I feel like there's a bit of an obsession with, how do we make a granular thing that's just about that one thing, and like the ways that can go wrong. Because Death Stranding is a game about walking and balance at the end of the day. Like you say, this is magnifying that idea.
But where do you think that comes from, that fascination?
I must admit, I don't know like a vast amount about Bennett Foddy. I know he's incredibly prolific and there are loads of interviews with him out there, but he's a bit of a mystery to me. I would guess it's someone who is sick of games having a bit of tunnel vision about the experiences they drew try to simulate.
90% of games have a combat system in and try and simulate a fight, which is a thing most of us haven't had, where we've all walked and walking does have its perils and its challenges. I just wonder if it's a guy who thinks that is a complex enough mechanical arrangement and world that I think there is something to explore there.
Hmm, extremely well articulated there.
I went on holiday to Scotland earlier in the year and I had very bad feet at the time. I've had quite bad foot problems this year and as a result was very particular about where I did and didn't want to walk and being up at the top of these sort of hills and weighing things up. I was actually kind of like, you know, put back in that place by some of the stuff in Baby Steps where you think, well, actually you do, you know, maybe subconsciously make hundreds of different calls every minute about where you're going to put your foot.
Most of those calls are, I don't want to put my foot in dog shit.
Yeah.
But yeah. And I don't know. I just think Bennett Foddy's gone.
Yeah, I think that's, I think that's a game. What is it like walking up sand and how do you walk up sand and can you get your head around that? That's more interesting to me now, at least, then can we make a good spear in a game?
Like I've played so many fucking spears. I don't know what a spear feels like. I'm sure that I'm sure the spears and games are fine.
But yeah, this is a good walking game. That's my guess.
Yeah. Well, I just wanted to kind of interrogate that because it does seem like, you know, it feels like that this game probably wouldn't have happened with, I might be wrong, but this game probably wouldn't have happened without Death Stranding. But I think that, you know, the kind of the idea of what you were doing in Death Stranding, you know, being this quite being quite pared down compared to what you would, what Solid Snake can do in a Metal Gear Solid game just became like a big part of the fascination with that game.
And so, I don't know, it just seems like it's a further extension of that idea. So, you know, just that's what it's just an interesting game to hear.
Yeah, I would be interested to know, you know, behind the scenes, the leap from, you know, something of the scale of getting over it to this, which, you know, it's a pretty big 3D open world. It looks pretty nice. You know, it's got, you know, nice physics and feel to it.
You know, they've obviously spent a whole chunk of time making it. But obviously someone's put like a huge load of money into this compared to the stuff he was doing beforehand. And, yeah, I'll be interested to know, like, who took the punt on it?
You know, is it like Devolver going, hey, you know that thing you do, we'd like to play a more kind of traditional looking kind of 3D video game version of that? Or is it them going, hey, this stuff we've been doing, you know, we'd like to interrogate that in, you know, a slightly more polished or bigger, expensive way. I'm sure this has all been answered.
Wasn't he on Simon's podcast recently, I think, Bennett Foddy?
I think he may be right, actually, yeah.
Yeah, I haven't listened to that episode, but yeah, I imagine he talks about it there, but just a guy with singular interests, but, you know, that's good. You know, there's a lot of it at the moment. You've got, there's a lot of reviews at the moment for the Consume Me, you know, which is all about like, dieting, whatever, and that's just a team who's gone, well, here's the thing we all do, let's dig into that.
I like it when people take like, complicated things in our lives, and then basically render it into like, WarioWare, that's, I'm very into that.
Damn, it's great critiquing all over the place here, of the place of Baby Steps in the tapestry of video games. I mean, it's gone straight on the wish list, Matthew. You have made me curious enough about it, to check it out.
I will admit that the trailers did not do that. They were, they just felt a little bit too meamy for my taste, and so, You see, I watch them, and I was a little bit wary of it.
Oh, that looks great, really funny and meamy.
But that's not really your vibe normally. I think you, you don't really like weird Twitter either. And that kind of thing, you know?
And so, that's what I thought it was going to be basically.
Yeah.
And it sounds like it is a little bit, but not totally. So, you know, curious to see how, how aggressive this Australian guy gets before the end of the game, Matthew. Keep me updated.
Apparently it's like 30 hours long.
It's like a 17 quid game.
Yeah. That's like, yeah, it goes places. That's what I'm super intrigued about.
I just want to know where do you end up climbing to and what do you learn when you get there?
That's longer than Ghost of Yotei, by the way.
That's longer than two playthroughs of Silent Hill f.
Okay. Well, that's all right. Interesting stuff.
Baby Steps then. Remember the game we just discussed was called Baby Steps. Baby Steps.
So, yes. Okay. So next up, Clair Obscur Expedition 33.
Samuel, why didn't you play more of Silent Hill f to talk about it with Matthew on this podcast? Because the first time we talked about this game was back when we did that Blueprints episode earlier this year, Matthew. We talked about Blueprints for one hour, and then we crammed in loads of other games into the second hour.
And so this is one of them, but this has obviously gotten to be one of the big games of the year, which I don't think was obvious when we were first playing it. We both got keys before it came out, right? Because I remember us both playing it and talking about it a little bit.
But we'd never really come back to it in any meaningful form. We did ask Matt Hadrohan about it when he came on the podcast, because obviously he worked on it. But yeah, us actually playing it and discussing it, not come up that much.
I thought it would be worth discussing again really, because it's sold five million copies apparently, and it has become one of the big games of the year. Really interesting because I think that I went through an arc with this of, wow, I can't believe how much of the Final Fantasy experience circa PS1, PS2, the feel of it and the structure of it and elements of the story, particularly Final Fantasy X, that they've taken inspiration from to build this game, which nonetheless feels original. Then I got to the, there's a very clear point where you get to the end of Act 2 in this game, and I thought the game was going to end at that point.
And I was saying to myself, ah, it's, you know, considering this is an indie game, it's pretty good they got this close to the Final Fantasy experience as I remember it. But it's a shame they don't have the third act Final Fantasy thing where a load of like lore nonsense happens and there's like a much, a much stranger thing emerges in the focus of like a third and final act. And lo and behold, that is what this game does.
So it really does, it really does deliver everything you want from a Japanese RPG in its totality. And that includes like the end game content in this. You know, this is a game, this is a game that has like a bunch of stuff for you to go and do, to sort of find and discover.
There's usually like a loose narrative thread to sort of send you in that direction. And every single turn it managed to remind me of why, those older Final Fantasy games were so, so good. And you know, I wanted to bring it up again, because it's sort of like, I think it turned out to be even better than I thought it was going to be after I first played it, you know, because I did say this, if you miss what the old Final Fantasy games gave you, this is probably a lot closer to it than, you know, Rebirth or FFXVI have been both perfectly great games.
But like, yeah, there's something about this that like, you know that the Final Fantasy games have poisoned the brains of the people who have made it. Like they just spent, like me, they spent too much time thinking about it and like living in it. But not to the detriment of the game's own originality.
But I'd like to hear a bit more about your experience with this, because I don't think you'd played it much when we first talked about it. And I know you played a bit of it after that. Where did you, how far did you get into this?
I only got a couple of hours into Act 2 of this. And then I stopped playing it. I don't know if just other things came along that I was a bit more interested in, or I was sort of, I'm in and owing about it a little bit.
I, it's weird that the end of Act 1 in this game is like, it's like really strong and exciting. And, you know, a big kind of like sort of crescendo to what's going on in the story. And, you know, quite dramatically kind of reconfigure some stuff and that's, that's all very cool.
And then I just, I don't know, I just sort of felt that what was going on afterwards didn't like immediately grip me. It let me kind of sort of slink away. And by the time I came back, I'd sort of forgotten how to play.
It's, you know, it's quite unique combat system, which I think you do develop like a bit of a feel for. Like I couldn't really remember what I was doing with any of my character builds, because each character basically has like their own combat system in this game. You know, it's quite, quite unique in, in how they behave.
And I couldn't really remember like what I was trying to achieve with each of them. And I was getting my ass kicked a lot. I was, I just, I'd lost all muscle memory I had.
And that was enough where I thought, well, I'll just come back to it another time. And then I, I just didn't. I don't, yeah, it just has, it doesn't have much pull for me.
I must admit. And I think it's, like I just, I never really cared for the world and the characters as much as other people seem to. And that is, that is like a bit of a deal breaker for me in RPG.
But then at the same time, you know, when I hear you say like what you just said, and, you know, I've read loads of stuff about this game, and, you know, people likening it to this, you know, particular era of, you know, JRPGs and like where it's pulling inspiration from. And I don't have the same relationship with those things that like you have and a lot of our peers have. No, and I do wonder if that's part of it, you know, like if some of the very specific stuff it's doing doesn't necessarily like speak to me.
It isn't a criticism of it at all. It's just like not quite my cup of tea.
I wonder how much the hype around it would have colored your feelings about it. It's like you say, if you're very aware that people have extremely strong feelings about this, this is a game that people really do adore and have talked about a lot. And I mentioned that at develop, I saw people dressed like the characters from this.
And you just realize it's had that next layer of cultural impact that is so rare for a game to have. And like to the point where someone who I know, who knows nothing about video games whatsoever, asked me, what is this game? Because it looks beautiful, but I know nothing about what it is.
And then asked me, is it like Sonic the Hedgehog? That's how far it's traveled. So people do know what this is.
Yes, I said it's identical to the game Sonic CD, 1993, or whenever that came out. Yeah, so I can see, I sort of almost wish you could experience it in a bit more of a vacuum, because it has taken over the year somewhat. But I try to work out how much the Final Fantasy, because it's not like the game is ripping off Final Fantasy.
It's just, there's just a feeling in your heart that they know what it is you loved about those games, in terms of how they sort of, the different levels of discovery to it, the way that the narrative would sort of pan out. It's like they just get it, but they don't plagiarize any of it. It's like an unbelievable magic trick to be able to do that, to just capture that feeling.
But for you to not totally be able to put your finger on what it is they've done other than just ingest playing these games and then blend it with loads of other cultural influences. So I find it kind of amazing on that level. It does have a lull at the start of Act II, I will say that.
And they introduce a new character, Verso, played by Ben Starr. Ben Starr. I've started doing that a lot Matthew, whenever I hear.
Another great impression.
Ben Starr. Do you find that though with this character? He's sort of like, they've got that voice like, Ben Starr.
They all sort of sound a bit like that.
He says, all right.
Oh, he says that a lot in Final Fantasy 16, doesn't he?
All right.
So, yeah, and so that character is a little bit of a kind of like, he takes a bit of getting used to, I would say. And so, you know, there is, there's like, there are other narrative reasons why I think that maybe there's a slight barrier to cross when you're getting through the first hours of that second act. I will say the second act is not as long as the first.
The first feels like it's the longest by far. I think it's worth, I think it's worth going back to, because I did think when I got to the end of act one, oh, that's going to be like the best moment of the game, and they'll never get better than this, but it does manage to keep delivering. And that is the thing, I think, that makes it, you know, transcend being just a great game.
It really just goes much further than you ever think it's going to, you know, it's, every stage, I was like, oh, well, this will be where I can see where the money ran out, basically, where like they couldn't make, you know, they couldn't do their version of like the Dark Aeons from Final Fantasy X or some other cool end game content, like the Deep Sea Research Facility in Final Fantasy VIII, where you find Bahama and Ultimate Weapon like this, you know, these things that are like odd little bits of Final Fantasy lore that diehard fans remember as like, you know, these iconic moments, or encountering that weapon in the submarine in Final Fantasy VII or whatever. Like it's these kind of asides, but they really manage to deliver that in the final act of the game. They really give you that in loads of different ways.
And I just found it very impressive. I will say as well, it's okay to abandon like two of the characters completely, because that's basically what I did throughout my playthrough. There's a lady you get called CL, he's got these dark powers and these light powers.
Oh yeah, I never understood the relationship between those playing cards.
Yeah, I've no shitting idea what any of that does. She only gets swapped in when all my other characters have been battered by a boss, but there's like 10 health left. I just need to do one of her attacks to basically end the battle.
That was basically CL's entire arc in my game. And then there's another character you get later on who is again a little bit of a quite does some quite interesting things, but is I think you get locked into your core, core three characters who's the one who has like the sort of Devil May Cry ranking system just for themselves. That's Verso.
That's Ben Starr. That's Ben Starr doing that one. So I've just I've been doing that far too much.
And I spoke to someone else who played this game and like had the same thing where like the very specific Ben Starr voice just got trapped inside their brain. And that's where I'm at with it basically. Just whispering Ben Starr to myself like a fucking maniac.
So yeah, he's very nice by the way. I met him briefly at Summer Game Fest. He's a nice man.
Yeah, I do need to get on with this one. You know, I feel like, especially when we come to the Game of the Year discussion at the end, you know, I've got to see it through. Yeah, I just, yeah, I don't know.
I don't think it's like a contrarian take to not be totally in love with the world and the characters. Like, I don't think they're a slam dunk.
No, that's absolutely fine. Like, there's some parts of the writing I don't adore. It's that the way that it'll be quite colloquial and modern and then be a little bit more sort of like, I'm watching fucking Ian McKellen doing Shakespeare, you know what I mean?
Like, it will sometimes flip between those two modes and that contrast, sometimes I like it, but sometimes I'm a little bit like, I think those two, those tones might be a little bit far apart. I'm not saying it's like the best written game ever, but I will say that the full picture of what the story is, I would say is worth, it's worth finding out what that is. That's what I would say.
Like, it's got more to offer you than you might think it's going to. It's not another Silent Hill thing where there's a, you know, it's a load of like embedded themes that you're trying to pick. Like, where's the child abuse in this bit of the game?
Like, it's nothing like that basically. But it's like, there is definitely more going on.
Yeah, I still say Gamarge a lot at the end because that was a no from me dog.
I would say that you've probably heard the most times they're going to say Gamarge in the first half of the game. Mostly said in that first area. Yeah, it also, it fulfills your God in Space brief, I think somewhat as well, which I know is important to you.
Like there's several different God in Space type enemies in this, I would say. And yeah, the optional areas deliver a few of those. But there's just like one optional area, for example, and I don't think this is really spoiling anything, where like it's called Isle of Eyes, and you get no other information about it other than you see these strange eyeballs popping out of these sort of like surfaces.
And you basically have to shoot the eyeballs out to make this bridge appear so you can go and fight this optional boss. And that's like the whole area. But I really like that sort of thing.
It's like, you know, it might be a 30 minute sort of side quest for you to go and do, but it's just a little bit visually distinctive. It's a little bit memorable for a particular reason. It might have a particular bit of music that sticks in your head.
And I think that that's what they're really, really good at as well as the sort of meat and potatoes, JRPG stuff. So, yes.
What about the beach minigames?
Those are bullshit. And I was, those never get good. And I gave up on them as soon as, there's one we have to, I mean, speaking of f***ing Baby Steps, you have to climb this like massive tower of random objects have been put together by all these little lads called Gesturals in the game.
And it's like a platforming nightmare. It's like that dungeon in Final Fantasy XV, Pityos Ruins, but even more infuriating than that, you know? And obviously not as spooky or interesting as that dungeon was.
So yes, no, it's a no from me dog on the Gesturals.
Bad Pityos Ruins is a really hard sell.
I bet you f***ing hated the Gesturals as well.
That's what I mean about the world and some of the character stuff. Like the sort of zany characters I didn't really like. I just found it quite like what I remember of it anyway, being quite teenagey and angsty in its tone, which I guess would make sense as they're, they're of an A.
There aren't any adults in this world, are there? Because everyone's getting off.
No, but they are adults, that's the thing. But they're millennial adults, Matthew. So they're perpetual teenagers.
This is what people in their 30s are like now.
Maybe I just don't like seeing myself so well represented in a game and that's what I'm reacting to.
I'd say you've entered more of an old man stage of your life if you're watching Six Seasons of Justified and not really going anywhere because you got-
And shrugging at friendship.
Not the concept of friendship, just the film. Yeah, I mean, anyway. So yeah, I mean, I wouldn't force you to play it, but I would say maybe give it a few more hours and just see how you find it.
Do you think this is going to be like an absolute shoo-in for like, when I say game of the year, I mean, the frickin poxy game awards, game of the year.
Well, now that Silksong's kind of been a bit divisive, which I don't think anyone saw coming, right? But there is Hades 2 as well, which people seem to love that one as well.
I feel like Hades 2 hasn't quite absolutely knocked out of the park in terms of like adulation.
Yeah, that's a game that I felt like I got out of my system with the first one a little bit, if I'm being honest.
I've only played about an hour of it and it's pretty good so far.
Yeah, the first one was an amazing version of what it is. Yeah, that's definitely not a value judgement on Hades 2. I'll try and get to it at some point as well.
But it's felt like for a long time, the narrative was like, this is the little game that could, but there's actually quite a few little games that could this year, it turns out.
It feels like this one has lasted longer in the memory than Blueprints has. Blueprints I think was always going to be a bit more of an acquired taste anyway because however you feel about the JRPG bits of Clair Obscur, from different angles it looks like a AAA game, which helps enormously I think with the kinds of people who are invested in Game of the Year discussions and the like. So that's always, whereas Blueprints is like, oh it's those three fucking draws again that have the different things written on them, like woohoo, like it's, you can only establish so much in a screenshot with that game.
That is incredibly reductive of Blueprints experience.
I should have like, I don't mind those, the dartboard instead. Fucking screenshot the dartboard isn't much compared to, you know, here's this woman with like, unreal engine woman with like, bare feet casting magic spells. Like guess what, there are dudes on the internet who enjoy that kind of thing.
So I think that, yes, I think this is kind of going to, this is going to sweep that. Also, it's just got that social media following. Like they, I think they tweeted about their golden joysticks thing, and they were just like tens of thousands of people, like going crazy for it.
It's just, it's just stuck around in the memory, you know? And if you get to the end of the game, Matthew, you'll see why, but you may never get that far. But that's okay.
It's okay for one of us to have played this.
I don't know if I can squeeze it in between three more playthroughs of Silent Hill f.
Fair enough, Matthew. So, let's come to the final game of this episode, which is yours.
Yeah. Only a very quick nod to Rise of the Golden Idol, the final DLC, which, being the professional that I am, I haven't even written down the name. There's been a season of content, there was like a DLC detective pass, I think they called it, where every couple of months this year, they've released a chunk of new cases.
Basically, that detective pass is a whole new Golden Idol game, like that's how many cases they've released, like 16 over the course of the year. The quality of them pretty much kind of continues on from where Rise of the Golden Idol left off. This isn't like a hugely deep analysis of that DLC pack or anything, other than to say I really liked it.
I thought each instalment had a little story to tell. I think they all had a specific flavour to them. There was quite a good one which was all about sort of interpreting hallucinations which got wilder and wilder over the cases and by the end you basically had to sort of work out what happened sort of under this hallucinatory layer which was really cool.
And this last set, which I thought was absolutely fantastic, felt maybe a little bit more like the first game. It had a mechanic where it kind of jumps between a kind of modern time frame and like 200 years before. So it had some of the sort of historical feeling of the original case of the Golden Idol, but also some of the kind of like modern oddness of Rise of the Golden Idol and a lot of the cases you're having to sort of like work out the relationship between a crime in the past and people investigating it in the present, which I really liked.
Probably the standout of it and I would say the best case of the whole season pass, one of the best Golden Idol cases they've done is there's a level which is like a, it's kind of like a riff on Obradin. You basically have to work out the fate of every single sailor on this historic ship by cutting between the ship when it's being attacked in the past and the people who are investigating the ruins of the ship in the present. That is very Obradin through and through in only a hand full of screens.
It's not a big 3D model of a ship or anything. It does the whole, here are 10 people, how did they die, who killed who. It just, it had to be a love letter to Obradin.
It was so similar to it. In tone, I just thought it was a really nice sort of tip of a hat to one of the detective game greats. And yeah, just a great full stop on this.
Like, I can't believe we've basically got another Golden Idol game this year. It's absolutely amazing.
Yeah, it seems like this has quietly been going on in the background as a, you know, this has actually been an awesome way to make and package DLC. Like, if you like this kind of thing, you almost treat it like it's your version of a Telltale episodic game, you know, where it's, you log in for the new puzzles and maybe you do one a night and it's that kind of thing, you know?
Yeah, absolutely. That's very much the flavor. I'm not going to say like, oh, this game is a low lift, because each case is a few sort of static art screens.
Like, there's more artistry to it than that. There's, you know, coming up with the mysteries, the music, the animation, the character designs and all that. But, like, they've clearly worked out a way to...
They're able to make this game at, you know, some speed or at least some efficiency. You know, the first game had a pretty chunky two episodes of DLC, you know, between that and the sequel. So, like, short of the Yakuza games, I can't think of like another modern series that's kept its fans this well-fed.
I love productivity. It's the quality I admire most in a game studio. And, yeah, to make that much game and it still be good.
They've cracked the formula. Make another ten of these. Just keep doing it.
Keep me well-fed to my dying days.
Nice. Well, it seems like they really, you know, it really was a success. And then I think everyone was upset when it all got removed from Netflix.
And does Netflix have crap games now? It's something like that has happened. It seems like it's been a pretty successful venture for them.
And yeah, I'm pleased to hear that it's been keeping you well-fed. Have you seen that? Because I was kind of hoping as well that from the amount of times on this podcast, you've talked about, I'd love to be rendered as a character in this game.
Like, has that happened? Have you spotted a Matthew Castle in there yet?
There's a lot of people in this game who are like fucking ugly as sin. And you're like, maybe. But I've got too high an opinion of myself to even consider it.
Yeah, I'm not sure. I mean, I already feel like I look like the Golden Idol version of myself somewhat.
That would be my dream. That's a Patreon stretch goal. Get these people to make a Back Page case.
I just want to see myself like one of these freaky bastards.
We haven't done the fucking 3K Patreon stretch goal yet of actually live streaming. We've got to do that yet. We said we'd do that for you.
We will. So you got to get better from Covid first. Well, thank you, Matthew.
You talked through almost two hours there, and I know it's probably hell on your throat. So thank you for persisting. It's fun to talk about these games with you.
This month, we could easily have done two of these episodes. I think it's rammed, it's chock-a-block, but that's exciting. I think the end of the year top tens are going to be in quite an interesting shape.
I've finished more games this year than I normally do for one of these. I think I've got 15 games that I've finished and could put in a top 10 now. It's good planning.
You're probably at 25 or something, aren't you? But hey-ho. That was the podcast.
Again, I've forgotten how to do the outro as well as the intro, so that's good. Coming up soon, we've actually been talking on e-mail, Matthew, about how it's good to get your take on this live. It's been mooted that we do a 16-bit draft with Ashley Day and Dave Scarborough next month, but you haven't weighed in on the thread yet.
I was curious where you stand on that one.
I'm into it. I think Mega Drive and SNES ticks a lot of boxes for a lot of our listeners. I know Ash wants to do it, to talk a lot about Amiga.
I mean, if you want to fill your draft full of Amiga games, like, good for you. That's your funeral. Yeah, I think it could be fun.
I saw Dave at a thing last night and said to him, Dave, when you come on for the draft next time, I need you to start fucking trying to win because you can't keep picking ghostbusters and letting Matthew run away with this thing. You've got to fucking, I want you to do like a full on assault and try and take this guy down. So we'll see.
But we'll bring back the kill and steal rules for that one. So that'll be fun. And we'll probably put some other twists in there to make it interesting.
But you can look forward to that in November. That's when the next big draft is coming.
A little life hack to avoid getting your games killed. You pick Amiga Games.
No one's going to steal your games then. OK. So Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
