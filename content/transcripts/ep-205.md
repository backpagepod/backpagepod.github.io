Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. It is Sunday. It is 4 p.m. We never record a podcast at this time, so it's quite novel for me.
There's a tiny bit of sun left out in the sky, and I just did all that dying bullshit in front of AC7 rebirth this weekend, so, you know, absolutely popping off. How you doing?
Do you say dying or dying?
Dying. Oh, sorry, was that a spoiler? You just secretly slid into the conversation there.
The dying bit of FF7.
Yeah, you played through a lot of that since I last saw you.
Does someone die in FF7? I'm not aware of this.
Well, you have to wait and see. We saw each other yesterday for a pizza.
That's fun. It was really good. Well, we have like four hours in the end, so it's quite a long time.
Yeah, I drank a lot of Coca-Cola.
Four pints of full fat Coca-Cola, I watched Matthew Castle drink. Ashu, do you want me to say that?
That's fine. Yeah, I didn't. It's not like I came home and told Katherine, I just drank four glasses of water or anything.
It's not that transgressive, really, considering the alternative could be, we went out for five pints or something. It's very us to be like, I went home having had three pints of Diet Coke, you had four pints of regular Coke. That's our version of living extreme, isn't it?
It is quite a lot when you put it up. We were shocked because it was like five quid for a Coke. I was quite upset with the People of Bath Pizza Company when I saw that bill.
Somehow, we had like a 37 quid pizza bill each, which is not what pizza is supposed to be. It's just some cheese on bread, isn't it? So I don't know what happened there.
What have you been up to? What's been in your pop culture diet this weekend?
We've been finishing Interview with a Vampire.
Oh yeah, the AMC show.
Yes. Part two of that, which was a good fun, like an incredibly sincere show about how difficult it is to be a vampire, which is quite an odd thing to dedicate 16 hours to. Obviously, you can take some wider learnings about the human condition from it, but a lot of it really is so vampire specific.
I like that about it. We're really going to take our time to interrogate what it is to be a vampire in the early 20th century.
Yeah. I mean, I always like the film. The film is one of those gay before it was okay to have gay films like Hollywood Beans, isn't it?
At least it's very gay.
I have heard that, yeah. I've heard it's very good. I know it's got a very passionate audience who have really been giving it the old, very online momentum, that sort of cult audience thing.
I assumed it was going to be shit because I thought most things about vampires tend to be. I thought it was going to be like NAF, like True Blood, or there's probably several CW shows about vampires, right?
Vampire Diaries, The Originals, I believe is another one.
Yeah.
Yeah. And I guess like Buffy long before that.
But this was quite a grown up take on it, I thought.
I just watched the Loaded Documentary on BBC iPlayer, which was recommended to me by former TechRadar colleague James Peckham, who listens to the podcast and was like, you should watch this because the contrast of it to the stuff you talk about in this podcast is extremely amazing because it was all of the original editors and writers for Loaded and some of the people who followed down the line, talking about the magazine they made and getting like all the drugs they were doing and all the parties they were going to. And I've got to say, the tenor is very different to the Pokemon Black and White trip that you went on to Japan, for example. It's like the Back Page, but the anecdotes are much more interesting, I guess, allegedly.
But it's also got that kind of like, but here's all the dark stuff underneath it sort of element, which was quite interesting. Yeah. So I don't recommend giving that a watch, Matthew.
I think that would be stimulating for you.
Oh yeah, no, absolutely. I actually got confused because I saw you tweeting a lot about boy bands.
Oh yeah, I watched both the boy band documentary this weekend, which is like a three-parter on iPlayer, and then I watched the loaded documentary as well.
For some reason, I thought it was one and the same. That's why I got confused.
Well, the thing is, they must be by, like I know the boy band one is done by Louis Theroux's documentary production company, and I assume that this loaded one must be connected in some way because it is, it crosses over a little bit in terms of that 90s, like cool Britannia climate that all this stuff was happening in. So I had the appetite for one after finishing the other basically. So I watched the very sad lives of all these boy bands and then went straight into the ups and downs of the magazine life.
The funny thing is though that the editors in it, to me, because I'm only really familiar with the later iterations of Loaded and the point they try and make in this show is that Loaded was much more of a kind of like interview based, kind of like everything that men want magazine at the start and then it gradually became this lads mag thing with a lot more sort of naked women on the front cover. And then you hear a couple of the editors getting snotty about this later editor who comes in and then takes over the mag and then goes off to launch either Nuts or Zoo. I was just there thinking, I don't know guys, I don't think any of your hands are clean really.
They're sort of like, I was just a bit a bit bewildered by them taking shots at each other. It's like, if you worked on Loaded, like you work in a horny magazine, like don't pretend there's sort of like any great valor in this. So well worth watching though, to kind of see like the, this was as successful as print media ever got.
And it still wasn't that glamour or so fun. And people still got burnt out and were quite sad. So yes, well worth a watch Matthew.
I bet Loaded never gave away a broken ice cube tray.
Not that I'm aware of, no. But yeah, it was really interesting watching. So yeah, that and the boy band thing.
I can't imagine the boy band thing would be your sort of thing Matthew, but the Loaded thing, it's definitely couldn't have happened.
Well I met those people from boy bands a couple of years ago for something I did as part of my day job for the Netflix channel, where we met some boy bands. We did like a short piece about a chord I used to be famous. And I met a guy from 911.
Oh yeah, was it the main guy from 911?
I attempted to say he was called Lee.
Yeah, that's the main guy from 911. That guy's 50 and he looks fucking amazing.
Yeah, right, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that from the time. And I want to say Simon from Blue as well.
Oh yeah, he seems like a pretty cool dude.
Yeah, yeah, it was all about life after fame and they're all sort of personal trainers and estate agents and things, but still kind of do the odd reunion gig at Butlins.
Yeah, the funny thing is the 911 guy, they are massive in Southeast Asia. So there's a bit in this documentary that must have been shot in the last few years where the 911 guys collaborate with a local artist and they are still enormous in that part of the globe. Wow.
I think if Lee, maybe where Lee lives, he's better known, but if Lee walked through a varsity center, no one would even recognize him, I doubt, you know? Because he kind of just looks like, if Ant and Deck were in a fighting game, right, and you held down B on Deck and selected his alternate skin, that's basically what that guy from 911 looks like. That is a niche joke, but I think you understood what I was going to say.
Do you agree? Is that a fair assessment?
Yeah, but he's just in boy band character creator. You don't have to press the randomize button any times before you get him.
Yeah, definitely, yeah. He's one of the Mass Effect Shepard presets of boy band.
Absolutely baby faced.
Yeah, he's the one who might be in the key art for the fighting game. Yeah, so that was honestly really interesting. The first episode is about Take That and E17, and that's probably the best one of the three.
That's probably the- they've got the most interesting stories to tell, and they have Robbie Williams there who is just so honest, and it's honestly just really interesting. Seeing the two managers who manage each of these boy bands were, I would say, very similar types of people.
I would say you pretty much get a feel for their whole deal and the murkiness they're in from that documentary. So, well worth a watch. That's Big Sammy's TV Corner.
Hope you enjoyed that.
It's good that we opened the show with TV Corner.
Yeah, I don't know why that's taken over this episode so far, but hopefully people enjoyed that anyway. I imagine a lot of people watch those things. That boy band documentary has got a lot of buzz, I think, on social media, and I feel like I was the last to watch it, so I'm sure people are familiar with it by this point.
So this episode, it's a Christmas-themed magazine-mailbag hybrid. Here's what we're doing. We're doing a quiz at the start.
It's themed around the Christmas issues of games magazines from the past, and then in part two, we're just doing your classic mailbag with a bunch of questions we've had since the last mailbag, which was back in August. I didn't realize the last mailbag was so long ago, Matthew. You had just played like an hour or two of Star Wars Outlaws, and we chucked that at the start to give it a little bit of meat on the boat.
So that's how long ago it was. It's a little while now, so we've got a lot of good questions to get through. Last mailbag of the year.
A bit easier for us to make this kind of episode as well. I say that, but this quiz was actually like fucking onerous. I always forget this, that doing the quiz and finding the scans and writing it out, it ends up being like a four-hour job, and I'm like, oh, this is meant to be the easy part, and I just fucked it.
How do you find prepare of this one, Matthew?
Yes, difficult. I struggled to actually find issues online which coincided with Christmas or like gaming earlier. Also, in my head, I thought this was a very common thing.
I thought there were loads of these issues. I had a very vivid memory of Christmas issues of N64 and NGC, and actually in reality, they're not at all what I remember. They're quite paired back and Christmas maybe gets a couple of pages, if that.
It made me wonder if maybe this is more of a phenomenon in the Super Play days or maybe the late 80s when those kinds of mags are around, because I feel like I agree. You open any of the N64 Christmas issues, and there's not much Christmas content in there. You get like snow on the top of the N64 logo, but then you get inside.
It's just a regular magazine, really. The same is true. I found one issue of Gamers Master that was a bit closer to that.
So the questions in here, which are a mix of what game is this stuff and a few other bits, are all taken from game of the year type features more than Christmas themed features.
Yeah, same for me.
Okay, good. Well, let's get into it then, Matthew, because I have 10 questions for you here. And very kindly, I was helped by some listeners.
For the last five questions I've got, they're all based on an NGamer Game of the Year article that Matthew worked on back in 2008. So 16 years, Matthew has got a famously great memory. So I'm excited to test that.
But yeah, thank you to Balladeer and Balladeer's parents who have a scanner and listener, Luke Summerhays, who also helped with this. It's like I asked for help and I got help. So I just want to give a big credit there.
That is a lot of effort. I mean, impressive.
Do you want to do the first question, Matthew?
Yeah. So mine are quotes. They're all quotes and you have to say what game they're talking about.
Most of mine are too, yeah.
Yeah, okay. So I'll give you, well, it's obvious where this one's from. This is from Edge.
I'm not going to give you the year because these are pulled from Game of the Year articles. I think it gives too much away if I give you the year.
Okay. Grand Theft Auto 3, that's my guess.
So here's a quote from Edge. There was no mistaking that this game was a labor of love, but for long-term Edge readers, that love went two ways. For those who remember its creator's column, encountering his obsessions in-game, particularly the detailed lectures on different whiskeys, was like meeting up with an old friend.
I guess that's got to be Negoshi. But then, what would the game be? A Yakuza game?
Yeah.
Yakuza 1. Okay. There you go.
As in the very original PS2 one?
Yeah. The original PS2 one, this was in Edge Christmas 2006.
Nice. Okay. Good.
Well, I got that. I did think, columnists, surely Negoshi and whiskey, that seems like two things that go together, doesn't it? So, okay.
Good. Well, one point then.
We're off to a good start. We have tested this format. It is working.
Yeah. Thumbs up from IT. Okay.
My first question. What is this passage describing? It's camper than Christmas, but it's also a joy to use.
The analog stick is perfect and set slightly askew to make it more comfortable to use. The A and B buttons are quite literally cute as buttons, and elegantly spaced for thumbs of all sizes. The true highlight and arguably a reason to buy a pad without the console are the shoulder triggers, which are as close as you can get to rudeness on a peripheral.
Can you guess what that is, Matthew?
What the fuck?
I have one other clue if you can't get it. I'll just give you this last bit, actually, because I think it will help. The only disappointment is the trigger button, which seems to have been stuck on at the last second without much thought.
Is it about the N64 controller?
Very close. It's a GameCube controller.
Oh, right.
Yeah, it's...
Wait, I'm trying to picture how a magazine, or why a magazine would need to tell you to get a GameCube controller, given that it's like an integral part of the GameCube experience.
It's quite weird. It's because it was from a Games Master Christmas issue, 2001, where they compared all the different consoles and said, which one should you buy, and they did a box out on the controllers.
I was looking through Games Masters and I saw that that seemed to be a format they did several times. Which console should you get at Christmas?
It's a good idea for a feature. I like it. It's perfect for the time.
It was quite comprehensive, but I saw the phrase camper than Christmas, which is such an early noughties, late nineties phrase. I thought I'll stick that in there. So you got close.
I'll give you half a point for that. I saw an early issue of Games Master refer to Lylat Wars as the queer titled Nintendo favorite. And I was just like, what?
What? How is that?
I don't know.
Are you using a different meaning of queer? I don't know. It's sort of like, there's nothing particularly.
Anyway, okay. Best not to interrogate it. We're not here to judge.
We're here to be amused. So let's move on. Okay.
I'll see you on your next one, Matthew.
Yes. So this is describing, this is a game that features in a Christmas issue of N64. How do you follow Shigeru Miyamoto's masterpiece without ruining those precious memories?
In Nintendo's case, like this, take the visuals, sounds, controls, and characters from the previous game, throw in a new map and storyline, and, frighteningly, ask Shik-Z to do little more than pop his head around the door from time to time to check that everything's okay.
That's too easy. That's Majora's Mask.
Yeah, that is Majora's Mask. I put it early because I thought it was easy. They get harder.
Fair enough. That's fair. Because mine are immediately quite hard, I think.
But there's a couple of...
Oh, shit.
Okay. The last five are all about things that you probably wrote, so that'll make it a bit easier, I think. Okay, well, that's good.
I'm glad I got it straight off. I ended up reading a lot of Majora's Mask content when I was researching for this as well. So it just happened to be the issues that are around.
So, yeah. It's like, oh, Zelda Gaiden, we can't wait to play this game or whatever. And you're like, okay, that's nice and quaint.
Okay, next one for you, Matthew. Question two. Which game is this?
Survival horror in your pocket just when you thought it was safe to go back into your trousers. Best bit, witnessing the amazingly rendered backgrounds on Ye Olde Handheld.
Is it Resident Evil DS?
Close. It's actually... Do you want to have another guess before I tell you?
Another survival horror. Not a silent hero on PSP?
No. You are firmly in the right territory. This is a little bit more of an early attempt to do something very similar, I would say.
Oh, there wasn't a Resident Evil on Game Boy Advance, was there?
No, there was on Game Boy Color, but it's not a Resident Evil game. I'll give you half a point, Matthew, because you're sniffing around the right area.
Thanks.
It's Alone in the Dark on Game Boy Color, which has isometric backgrounds and quasi-3D. It's visually impressive for the time. You have no reason to play it now, but kind of interesting.
Well, that weirdly you can, thanks to Nintendo Switch Online.
Oh, I think I have seen it, actually.
It's one of the very few third-party games in the Game Boy Collection is Alone in the Dark.
Incredible.
It's sitting there with like five different versions, you know, the French version, the German version, etc.
Nicely curated, then. Good stuff. Yeah.
Okay. Okay. So, yeah, what's the next one, Matthew?
What's my question?
So, this is another edge one.
You have to talk with the magazine, and you can let me guess if you want. That's up to you.
Huh? Oh, okay. Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, make it a bit harder.
I've ruined it now, but let's just... I won't tell you the next few. Few games have had to live up to the scrutiny that this has.
It had to satisfy lovers of its multiplayer. It had to atone for the perceived failings of the previous game's single player. Even beyond expectation, it has succeeded.
It's Halo 3!
Oh, fucking hell.
Yeah.
God damn it. I've misjudged these.
The Dead Giveaway was the single player of the previous one, and like, it was, you know, it had to be a sequel, and so, and it had to be like heavily multiplayer, so I immediately deduced that. It's, yeah, you know, it was good. I enjoyed that.
Good for three so far.
Yeah, this one's a bit easier for you, so you can pull it back. Thank you. Which game is this?
Amazing AI in a healthy dose of humour takes its genre to a new level. Best bit? Picking up your beast's crap and chucking it at peasants.
Oh, that's gotta be Black and White.
Correct! He's got one.
Where's that from? Is that from Games Master?
Yes, all three of these are from the same issue of Games Master. Oh, right. But I did try and like, pick some quite abstract little bits.
The last two are from a list feature about the best games of the year. So, yeah, so there's like two different Games Master issues I'm taking these from basically.
Games Master which reviewed about like four PC games a year.
Yeah, pretty much that was the vibe, yeah. Okay, cool.
Has the video game industry's generously haired innovator lost the plot? Of course not. Having played the revamped classic a fair bit now, we have to admit that we're starting to fall in love with it.
The simple fact that the ghosts are now controlled by human intelligence gives it a new lease of life.
That's not immediately obvious. Generously haired.
Yeah, that's a weird description of this person. I can sort of see it.
I mean, I just think of John Romero when, you know, but that's not what that doesn't describe any of his games.
No, this person's quite different to John Romero.
Ghosts are controlled by humans. Revamped Classic.
I can hone you in by telling you which magazine.
Yeah, go for it. Why not?
NGC.
Ghosts are controlled by humans. What fucking game has ghosts in it? Fucking Nintendo games with ghosts in it.
What is that? Is it a Wii game? No, it's not, because it says NGC.
It's fucking GameCube, of course. The only Revamped Classic I think of in GameCube is...
And the involvement of the video games industry generously haired innovator.
I mean, it's not Twin Snakes. That's the only revamp I can think of on. I'll just say I don't get this one.
What is it?
It's Pac-Man Versus.
Oh, right. Well, I never would have got that. That's fine.
That's a good one.
You control the ghosts.
That's a good one. Yeah. I was thinking of like Nintendo Land, but that's not right.
Well, that's why, you see, I put it in because I thought, oh, he'll think it's Nintendo Land. Tee hee hee.
Very good. You got me there, Matthew. That's good.
All right. This one's quite easy as well. Live life as the baddest mother on the streets.
It's so good to be bad. And this is so bad, it's good. It may be gratuitous, but it has to control system visuals and AI to match the violence.
Is it like Scarface?
No. Do you want another go?
Hmm.
I think it's really weird. They said that this is so bad, it's good. That's weird.
Do you think it's bad or do you think it's good?
I think it's good, yeah.
You think it's good? They think it's so bad, it's good. It's got good graphics, violence, bad-est mother.
Who could that be? It sounds like that's leaning into something. It feels like that's referencing the era or the character.
In my head, I'm like, Shaft? But I'm like, this is not a Shaft game.
No, this is not. This is a weird description of GTA 3.
Oh, right.
Yeah, that's it. But I'm going to give you half a point there, because I think so bad, it's good, it makes it quite hard to figure out. Because if I heard that, I would have thought of like State of Emergency or something, just sort of like...
Right, yeah, that's just good. That's so good, it's good.
I just don't think games journalists understood GTA 3, Matthew. I'm going to be honest with you. I think they just completely fucking dropped the ball on that one at the time, and then just didn't get why it mattered so much.
It's so bad, it's good.
Yeah, confusing. Anyway, yeah, that's also from... These are all from the same issue of Games Master, the same list feature.
So yeah, maybe I should have told you the magazine like you did for me. Okay. Alright, so what's question five, Matthew?
As we originally noted in our review, it's the game's filmic quality that gives it its ultimate capacity to deliver non-stop entertainment from start to finish. You know that you're only ever a few steps away from the next big thrill, and like the best page-turner of a novel you've ever read, you simply cannot wait to see what's lying around the corner.
Oh, that's so non-specific. That's just like any game with a good story. Read the first bit again, sorry.
As we- yeah, actually now I'm rereading it, I'm like it should have had a bit more color in it. I'll say this is Edge Christmas 2005.
Okay. It's not Fahrenheit, is it? No, it's too early for that.
No, no, it's the-
Maybe have another go because I got the date. I think Fahrenheit is one of those six games.
I'd say non- so this is a tough one. Non-stop entertainment, next big thrill around the corner.
Oh, is it just Resi 4?
Yes.
Oh, there we go. I'll take half a point for that one, Matthew. That would be good.
Okay, next one for you, question five. It's when everyone who is playing is familiar with their character that X reveals its true beauty, an unexpected tactical heart beating beneath its cutesy, arcadey exterior.
Everyone's playing, so that's a multiplayer game. This has got to be a Smash Brothers.
Correct. It's a Smash Bros. Melee.
I'll give you that one. Okay. It's like question 6, isn't it?
This one's a tough motherfucker also.
You push up to go forwards and turn left and turn left.
Go on.
I'm ready.
Why try to better every game in the series when you could just be every game in the series? This is an exhaustive compendium of all that is best loved in these best loved of games. This game is in many respects the oddest launch title ever.
Oddest launch title ever. Compilation previous games. I mean, I'm thinking like, is it a Nintendo game?
It is a Nintendo game. This is Edge.
Is it either a Kirby or Wario game?
No, it's not. I don't think too literal on collection of games. A game that pulls from many games before it.
Yeah. Okay.
It is a compendium of all that is best loved in these best loved of games.
It's not like, it's not Wii Sports, is it?
It isn't.
No. Okay. I don't know.
This is from Edge. Christmas 2006. That was them describing Twilight Princess.
Oh, okay. Interesting. Not exactly what I'd go with, but I can see why it was kind of evoking some past ones.
Yeah.
Okay. Then we come to the NGamer questions for Matthew. Oh, God.
This is going to be embarrassing for me.
What's interesting is we've kind of flipped it. I've started doing badly, you've started doing quite well.
I don't know if I've got any of them right.
I think a few of these are quite easy, so that will help. But this one's quite simple. An ultra lame collection of just six mini games designed, apparently, to hone your reflexes to Ninja Swift levels.
The remote responsiveness is sluggish, which kind of stamps all over any reflexes you might be displaying, and the lack of variety of things to do is likely to induce a Zen-like state, i.e. send you to sleep.
Oh, that's Ninja reflexes.
Correct. I didn't even have to include the next bit, which says the game even has the audacity to include a meditation mode, where you're instructed to sit still and close your eyes for up to 10 minutes. Bloody cheek.
You probably wrote that.
Terrible. I definitely played that game. I think it got like 12% or something.
12%? Amazing.
That was the EA's early minigame collection. That was EA's attempt at Let's Have a Wii Sports Alike.
That's funny. They all had a go, didn't they?
Absolutely rank. Yeah.
That's funny. Okay, what's my next one? What's your question 7 for me?
Oh, this one's...
Well, question 6 for me, sorry.
Yeah, this one's a motherfucker, I'm afraid.
Okay, good.
It's got some very, very specific colour, but it's so niche. I really hope you get it. I'd love for you to get it anyway.
Okay.
There's a palpable atmosphere, courtesy of the most ridiculous attention to detail. The cavernous reception of the first level's bank is modelled right down to visibly soft cushioning on the receptionist's chair, and it is the sheer scale of your surroundings, coupled with incidental details, such as boats streaming along the Thames, that make the sense of scampering around a real world location seem utterly convincing.
It's not the getaway Black Monday, is it?
It isn't. I'll say it's an N64 game.
Oh, right. So plush cushions.
The first level's in a bank, and it takes you to the Thames.
Oh, of course. The world is not enough.
Yes.
I think I can still have a full point for that one.
Yeah, I'll give you a point for that for sure.
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Yeah.
Okay. Good one. I like that.
I never played that game, but I can just picture the bank now looking blurry as fuck in that game.
I bought that game because of this N64 review, which gave it 88% and said it was not that far off GoldenEye. And I'm like, hmm.
How let down did you feel by that? Did you feel betrayed by that, Matthew?
I felt pretty cross, I won't lie. I mean, it's just so different in character to GoldenEye. There's so many instant fail missions.
It's not sandboxy or fun to mess around in at all. World of Snow and Off is a pretty dire game.
Yeah. I would be pretty annoyed if that happened. Although to be honest, I think when I bought the different Bond games, I'm pretty sure most of those got like eights in games magazines at the time.
Like the Night Fires and everything or nothings and the like. So yeah, we all got betrayed at some point. You know, trying to recapture our love of GoldenEye, Matthew.
To this day, whenever I see someone mention Twine games, in my head, I always think, oh, the world is not enough.
OK, then next one for Matthew. In the blink of a massively oversized rectangular eye, it turned from an immensely playable demo to bite your fist to avoid cutting the god's piece of frustrato design. What went wrong?
We doubt we'll ever know. Instead, we're left to mourn one of the nicest games of we. So colourful.
So full of content. So unplayable.
Oh, my word. I mean, that could be so many things.
This one, if it helps, this won the X-Files Award for Head Scratching Mystery of the Year.
X-Files?
Games magazines, man.
In the blink of a giant rectangular eye, so that means there's going to be like a big fucking robot or something in it. This sounds like me.
It does. Frustrato design sounds like me.
Frustrato is... that's got me written all over it. And what's extra frustrato is that I can't work out what the fuck it is.
A good game.
I did pick a hard one here. Yeah.
Yeah, so it's a game... what went wrong? Something that started strong in the demo and went to shit.
Can you tell me the year?
Yes, 2008.
2008. It's not Indiana Jones.
No.
The Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings or whatever it's called.
Yeah, it's not that.
Oh my... no, you're going to have to tell me.
It's Samba Di Amigo.
Oh, of course. He's got fucking rectangular eyes, hasn't he?
Yeah. Yeah. And that was hard because I picked the one that had the most non-specific language in it.
Oh man, that is hard. Oh yeah, that game was absolute shocker.
I had hoped the year would narrate down a bit, but I guess, you know, there's a lot going on.
Samba Di Amigo, the preview event for that, that's where I first met Christian Donlan. There you go.
Okay, well there you go. I first met Christian Donlan.
There's a trip here for you.
I first met Christian Donlan on a Killzone 2 press trip to Amsterdam. My first trip to Amsterdam. So there you go.
There's our first meeting. It's like in a comic book. This is the first time that Spider-Man met the Punisher.
It's Chris Donlan meets Matthew Castle.
Which of us is Spider-Man? Which is the Punisher?
Gosh, we're all like soft boys. We're really like more like B-list Spider-Man villains. Like Shocker and Vulture.
Not even that. We're like three Jimmy Olsons.
That is totally right. Soft Jimmy Olsons. That's us basically.
Okay, good. I think I've got a tiny bit of J Jonah Jameson energy, but I'm still a little bit too beta for that, I think. Anyway, Matthew.
What's question eight from me?
Again, motherfucker from Edge. The game's Japanese release was slightly underwhelming, mostly due to the lousy soundtrack it shipped with. News of the reworked pow track listing was like pennies from heaven.
Most astounding was the inclusion of Supergrass's mighty Richard the Third, which suited the big dumb ape better than anyone could have guessed.
Oh, is this, um, Stupid Bongos Game?
I must have a name.
Donkey Kong. Oh, fuck, what was it called? It's not Jungle Beat, that's the platformer.
This is the dumb rhythm action game on GameCube. Fuck, what was it called? Am I just gonna have a go?
You're very close to what it's called. I mean, it's both genius and very lazy, this name.
I feel like it's probably got beat in the title.
No.
No, it doesn't, okay. Jungle Rhythm, something like that? Oh, I don't know.
It's Donkey Konga.
Oh, fucking of course. Of course, I feel like I knew that at the very back of my brain. But, uh, well, I got close, you know?
I just thought it was funny. It just made me laugh. The reason this jumped out was that someone at Edge must have liked Donkey Konga enough to include this in their Edge awards.
Donkey Konga Track List. Let's look up what kind of horrors made it on there. Oh, that's so weird.
So it's got, like, some Nintendo music. And then, like, Jamiroquai and Christina Aguilera. That's so confusing.
End of the Gamecube era, man. That was, like, tough times. Okay, cool.
I got an easy one for Matthew here, after that really hard one last time. For a bit of singing a duet with an Easter Island head statue action, it's worth every one of your import dollars.
Is that Rhythm Heaven DS?
Rhythm Tengoku. Is that technically correct? Or is that the GBA one I can't remember?
Oh, I'm trying to think of that, from 2008.
Yeah, it must have been the DS one.
It must have been the DS one by then. Yeah, that's right.
Okay, you get a full point for that one, Matthew. So on we go. What's the next one for me?
Well, we're into PC Gamer territory now.
Oh, okay. Is this stuff that I worked on?
Yeah, I've got a couple of tutors to end it with.
Exciting, exciting.
This game fills in plot holes that did not need to be filled in. You don't need to know what Kurtz's morning was like before Willard arrived in Apocalypse Now. Maybe he had a shower?
In the dark, of course. And you really didn't need to know what the space-shocky in Alien was up to, did you? It was much more fun as a question, not an answer.
Clinically debunking the mythology around beloved fiction rarely serves the story.
Oh, that wouldn't be like Shadow of Mordor, would it?
No, you wrote this.
I wrote this. The Apocalypse Now reference is so me. I heard that and I was like, oh wow, that's like, I quite like that reference and then I realised it's because I wrote it and I think it's funny.
You were like, this guy's got it.
That's better than I remember my writing a PC Gamer game.
I like the cut of this guy's chip. It was quite an interesting one because this was your personal pick for a game but it started very negatively.
I was probably just trying to show off or not seem too cheerful about things. It's not like...
What was I supposed to say? DLC.
Oh, it's not Bioshock Infinite, Barry Let It See.
Yes, it is.
Okay, interesting. That must have been like...
Your personal honorable mention for PC Gamer's 2014 Game of the Year Awards.
Oh, yeah. Okay. Interesting.
Yeah. That was good. Why was I so down on it?
Barry Let It See is amazing.
I think you started off with the, yes, I hear all this about it, but I like being in this place again, and I like meeting these characters, and I like feeling it, you know. So I feel like you were stealing yourself for some kind of like forceful pushback.
Yeah. I probably just been looking at the comments on the website. I mean, yeah, Barry Let It See is fucking amazing.
That's, well, if you play Bershka in front of it, you have to end with that. That's the end of the game basically. So you kind of need it.
So, okay, good. That was a good one, Matthew. I like that.
You genuinely did not recognize my own writings. That's good. Okay.
This is a bit different. I've got a category for you here, and you've got to guess what the game is from the category. This game won the NGamer 2008 Crikey Gary Oldman's Doing a Lot of Games These Days award for Best Voice Acting.
Uh, surely it's too late for Spyro.
Yes, not Spyro.
Uh, because he was in that.
Gary Oldman's not in this game. I don't know where this reference comes from, but I guess he was in like True Crime Streets of LA. Oh, no, that was Walken, wasn't it?
I don't think Oldman was in that one.
Right. So it's named after Gary Oldman. It's got nothing to do with Gary Oldman.
Great. That's a good, good old NGamer.
But the amount of games that have like story in them on Wii is a little bit leaner than other consoles, right? Like enough for the voice acting to be a significant part.
Oh, was this Deadly Creatures?
No.
No?
Oh, Gary Oldman was in there. True Crime. There you go.
He was in True Crime Streets of LA. So that might have been what you were riffing on. I don't know.
What was it? Sorry?
I'm sorry. I was just saying that. Sorry.
It's completely an aside. Gary Oldman was in True Crime Streets of LA.
Oh, right. OK.
Yeah.
That doesn't help me in this quiz.
No, it doesn't.
I appreciate the tripper. But like if someone was trying to get a question right on University Challenge and Paxman just chipped in with a completely random fact about something else, I'd be like, you threw me there.
I will give you a hint here to help you out. This is a game I really love.
It's a game you really love.
And it's not the first time the game was released. It's a port.
It's a port.
Don't worry, I'll cut down all these thinking sons of you.
Is it a carmy?
I mean, the voice acting, that's fucking hideous, the voice acting and that me me me me me.
Yeah, I was just going to say that. And also it's like nonsense speak, isn't it?
No, it's a game with a lot of cutscenes and like good cutscenes and good characters.
It's got good cutscenes and characters and it came to we.
It's from a publisher that doesn't do many games, but the games they do are hugely significant. Will you hear it? Correct.
There you go. Oh, I think I can only give you half a point for that after all those games.
Yeah, what the fuck was the Gary Oldman connection?
I heard hope that like the timing and the voice acting thing had narrowed it down to like, there aren't many games on we that are hugely dependent on voice acting. What's your last one for me, Matthew?
Okay, it's another PC Gamer one.
Okay.
I loved how messed up the creature designs are now too. Walking through an abandoned supermarket is suddenly as jumpy and enjoyable as playing Left 4 Dead.
Abandoned supermarket? Did I write this as well?
Yes.
Abandoned supermarket. I mean, in my head, I'm like Fallout 3, but it can't be that, right? No.
No, okay. Messed up creatures. Can you give me the year?
2015.
Fuck, so many games came out that year.
You might have been along the right lines before.
Oh, is it just Fallout 4?
Yes.
There you go. That makes more sense, doesn't it?
Fallout 4, which I think got best world or something.
Oh, yeah. Some of those awards are a bit hazy. A little bit like, what does that mean?
I don't really know because there's a lot of pointless arguments about semantics going on around awards titles at that particular point in the cycle.
We may get to that in a moment.
I thought that was my last one. Is that not my last one?
Well, that is your last one, but I have a couple of extras treats.
Okay, cool. I've got a bonus round for Matthew, too.
Yeah, I've got a bonus round for you.
Somehow, we've been recording for nearly an hour for 10 questions. I don't know why. I'll cut down some of the silences.
So much of it is just going, uh...
I'll slice that down so it's nice and fast for the list, at least.
That's going to be like five minutes of pod.
Yeah, we've only been recording for 10 minutes if you take the errs out. Okay, this is another, can you guess the game from the award tile? I think that, this is again the same year, 2008, which character won the Heath Ledger's Joker Was Brilliant Award for Best Game Character?
2008?
And I think like, the Heath Ledger's Joker thing hints at like the kind of attitude of the character.
So it's a villain? Yeah! Okay, it's not, no?
More an anti-hero.
An anti-hero.
He's like one of our guys.
He's one of our guys? He was on We Are DS!
Correct.
Oh god.
There's actually only one guy it can be, if you really think about it. But our guys collectively.
He's one of our guys? We're into this character.
I mean, with a bit of like a caveat. He's that kind of character. He's like, we like him but kind of character.
Yeah, well, yeah, well, it's not Kratos because he's not in any Nintendo games.
But I'll give you a clue by humming a piece of music.
PC Gamer's Game of the Year 2014. I've got the different categories, and I'd like you to tell me what one.
Oh, okay. That sounds good.
So this is 10 years ago. Yeah.
Been through a lot since then.
Let's start with the biggie. What was PC Gamer's Game of the Year in 2014?
Alien Isolation.
Yes. That's the one I remember. What was the best single player game in 2014?
Dragon Age Inquisition.
Yes.
Nice.
What game was awarded Spirit of PC, which sounds a bit tenuous to me?
Spirit of PC. Was it like a Dweeby strategy thing?
It's not strategy. Very good PC game. Very PC as hell.
It's not like, no, Endless Legend is Dweeby and strategy. Spirit of the PC. Oh, it's not Wolfenstein, The New Order.
No. It was Divinity Original Sin.
Oh, right, yeah. That's a good call by us.
Yeah. Again, I'm not sure. I guess best design.
Commendation for design. Get over yourselves.
Fucking who knows? What are these awards, man? Why did I allow this?
You've already said it once, this game.
Endless Legend?
Yes.
Oh, okay. Cool.
Best multiplayer.
Fucking hell. This wasn't the Rainbow Six Siege here. What was that?
Oh, was it DayZ that year?
It wasn't. It was Towerfall Ascension.
Oh, right, yeah. I never would have got that.
Here's Most Original. I would say Most Tiresome and Not Particularly Funny.
Not South Park Stick of Truth.
No. The Other Funny Game.
Other Funny Game. Very pleased. Do I like this game?
Oh, I can't remember, if you do, to be honest.
Is it not Jazzpunk?
Jazzpunk.
Oh, you don't like Jazzpunk?
No, I find it terminally online, that game.
Oh, I quite like it. At the time, though, it was a little bit more quaint, you know. Like the internet was a slightly less hostile place.
Well, actually, no, Gamergate was that year, so that's just not true at all.
Finally, the final category, what was cultural phenomenon of 2014?
Was that Daisy?
It wasn't.
Oh, it should have been.
It was a big year for Daisy. It's still pretty big. Tim Clark talks about it a lot.
Oh, Hearthstone.
Yes.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
I suppose that, yeah, okay. That's enjoyable. I enjoyed that.
I've got a similar one for you, Matthew. So, I've got, I mean, you really struggled with the awards, remembering them as it was. So, we'll see how it goes.
But again, thank you to Jonathan slash Balladeer for this and Balladeer's parents with the scanner, as mentioned. Okay. These are fun category names, though.
So, it'll be a good blast through the past no matter what. So, the Kim, My Wee Friends Are All Cute Puppies B6 Multiplayer Game of the Year Award.
Fucking no idea.
We're on Mario, can't we?
Okay.
The Andy McGregor Award for Best Box Art Design, sponsored by Cider.
Call me.
No, this is one of the all-time duff attempts to do something new by Nintendo.
Wii Music?
Correct!
Oh.
Yeah. This is one of their shit game awards. So, the Charlotte Martin Award for most odious casual games sponsored by reviews round up.
That's funny. You won't get this. You won't get this.
I mean, it could be any, it's probably like some terrible match three puzzler.
Action Girls Racing, Girls for the Z.
Action Girls Racing.
The Martin I've Got a BSC Don't You Know Kits Award for best use of Nintendo technology. Puzzle game.
A good one. Puzzle game?
Yeah. A blockbuster puzzle game, aren't we? There aren't many of those.
God, I'm so stupid. Oh, Boom Blocks.
Yeah. There we go.
Yeah.
The Nick Nostradamus Communicates With Me Daily, Ellis, One to Watch for 2009. This is by one of our favorite developers who ultimately made quite a lot of bad games as well, but have also made some all-time classics. Japanese.
Mad World?
Correct.
Yeah.
Here's a fun one. The Matthew Writer of Champions Castle Award for Best Storyline.
Oh my God. It's got to be an Ace Attorney game.
It is. Can you guess which one?
Trials and Tribulations.
Correct. It's Trials and Trips. The Hitler Me Award for Most Offensive Game Character.
I read a lot of Hitler jokes in that bag.
Hey, it was the noughties, you know.
The noughties, and he was naughty.
You can make jokes about Hitler, Hitler sucks. It's a Kong character.
Oh, it's a Kong?
Yeah.
Why would we be picking on a random Kong?
Funky Kong, it's Funky Kong.
Oh, okay. I'm in tracks. I'm not sure why Funky Kong got a drive-by this year.
Yeah, he's got a whole section. There's like a, I would say quite a long paragraph there about Funky Kong and why he sucks.
Why has he been in that year to upset us?
I don't know. Bit of a... Oh, I think he's in Mario Kart.
Funky Kong doesn't come back for another couple of years.
He's in Mario Kart Wii as a secret character, that's why.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, there you go. The inaugural Ada Wong Award for Best Supporting Character. You'll never get this.
It's the collection of characters from one game. That happens to have beautiful graphics, Matthew.
Well, it's not the assassins from Killer 7. From No More Heroes.
No. Prettyer than that.
Weirder than that.
Prettyer than that.
Wii or DS?
Wii. You won't get this. It's the gods from Akami.
Oh, I was actually just about to say the gods from Akami.
Oh, well, okay. Fair enough.
I was trying to remember what they were, like the star sign things, the constellation guys that turn up.
Yeah, those are like the only good hangs. Otherwise, there are a lot of tough hangs in that cast. So, yeah.
Okay, the Shigzee's Bluegrass Band Award for Best Soundtrack. Really easy, this one.
Well, it's got to be Wii Music.
No, no, no. It's 2008.
Oh, Smash Brothers Brawl.
Correct.
Yeah.
Okay, the Who Needs 1080p Anyway Best Graphics Award.
Surely this is Akami.
You would think so, but it's not.
Metro Prime 3?
No, this is a 2D game, but on Wii.
Oh, not Boy and His Blob.
No, it's Wario Land The Shake Dimension.
Oh, fuck The Shake Dimension. It's pretty, but it sucks. Okay.
Ha ha. Virtual Console Game of the Year. That's a fun one.
Sin and Punishment?
No, this never released in the West. Wait, that's not true. This never released in the UK, in Europe.
It's one of the all time like, oh, they finally brought it here, kind of.
Yeah, there weren't many like that. Earthbound?
No, it's since been remade.
Oh, what the fuck?
Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars.
Oh, of course, of course.
The Worth Seven Pounds We Wear Game of the Year.
What the fuck can we wear there?
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a King.
Awesome.
The Bought on the Company Credit Card We Import Game of the Year. Did Future have a Company Credit Card? Don't think I ever.
Yeah, we bought loads of import games from PlayAsia. It was great.
Don't think I ever got access to that card, as I was staying in the shootiest AirBnBs in LA downtown.
Yeah, yeah.
You talked about this one on the pod before. You thought the console itself was trying to fuck you up.
Oh, Fatal Frame.
Yeah, Fatal Frame 4, Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. Best licensed game?
Scarface?
No, a bit late for that. It's Lego Batman.
Oh, okay. I just keep saying Scarface for all of them.
And then we've got just a few more. So, worst licensed game is The Incredible Hulk DS. You'll never get that.
Can you guess what the NGamer Forumites Wii Game of the Year was?
Probably something shit.
No, they actually picked well for both of these. They got a DS one as well.
A Kami?
No, Smash Bros. Brawl.
Oh, of course. DS.
This is really even better taste than Smash Bros.
Brawl.
This is well done as a pick.
Oh.
Quite a proper cult classic.
World Ends With You?
Correct!
Yeah.
Okay, and then the ultimate game of the year from NGamer. This surprised me, actually.
The ultimate game of the year.
Oh, wait, sorry. Ultimate DS game of the year.
Ultimate DS game of the year. 2008. It's not The World Ends With You.
It's not. That was highly commended, along with Civ Rev, Advanced War Start Conflict, Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, and Bango Spirits. But this game won.
It's a Matthew Castle favorite.
Is it Pokemon Heart Gold Soul Silver?
No. No. It's a Matthew Castle favorite.
Well, I didn't know if you were being ironic.
No, no, no. That would be much of a clue, wouldn't it? This is a game that took its time to come to the UK.
It had been out in the US for a little while. Professor Layen and the Curious Village.
Oh, of course.
NGamer's shoddiest game of the year, on DS, was Road to Vegas, by the way.
Okay.
Yes. Okay, can you guess the NGamer ultimate Wii game of the year? I was quite surprised by this.
I'll give you the highly commended list, Matthew, to help you out. Highly commended were Kami, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Boom Blocks, Zack and Wiki and No More Heroes, all of which are more deserving of game of the year than this pick.
Is this Metro Prone 3?
No, that was 07.
Was that 07? Oh, of course it was.
Yeah, this is really easy. Think of like the five games that come to mind. It's like the best selling Wii games.
It's one of those.
What the fuck?
Mario Kart Wii.
What?
Yeah. Mario Kart Wii.
No one on the team like Mario Kart Wii.
Yeah, but it won Ultimate Game of the Year in 08.
Really?
Yeah.
I must have been on holiday when that was picked.
It's a weird one. It's weird seeing all those other games. I would say Smash Bros.
Brawl feels like the pick for NGamer. It's like editorial and the team also likes it. But the true quality pick is surely No More Heroes.
But, you know, to each their own. Yeah, yeah.
That's mad.
There you go. And on that wet fart of a revelation, we come to the end of the quiz, Matthew. Shall we total up who scored what?
You've got one, two, three and a half, four and a half, five and a half, six, six and a half out of ten.
You've got? I've got you down at seven and a half.
Oh, so I technically win, but there are no winners really, only the listener, allegedly, square brackets. And on that note, Matthew, should we take a quick break and come back with the mailbag portion of this episode?
Let's do it.
Great stuff. That was really weird.
The last Mailbag of the year. We're gonna try and get through as many of these as possible. Hopefully, we'll get to the end.
And yeah, if you ever wanna send us a question, by the way, you can email us at backpagegames.gmail.com, and there's also a Pod Questions channel in the Discord where you can drop your questions in, too. You can also tweet at BackpagePod, or whatever the term is for Blue Sky. You can post to us in there if you wanna send us a question.
And we'll start compiling them for the inevitable early March Mailbag where we're both a bit tired and need to recharge after we do the best games of 2004, which takes fucking 3 hours as we tell one stop and home base anecdotes or whatever. So yeah. Okay, first question Matthew, I'll read this one out.
Question for Matthew from Ryan Plugs. Have you discovered any new music that you like through the shared office speaker? Matthew, what is the speaker again?
This is the speaker in the office that people play music through, so I am subjected to other people's music tastes.
But they never get to hear yours?
Well, I don't want to share mine, because my playlist is sort of a bit, you know, odd.
Fair enough, yeah.
Hope for the future! My Destiny Megamix. Not really, I mean, they play an eclectic lot of things.
One of my colleagues has got a playlist which is their, it's actually a playlist their mum made and it's the playlist she wants to play at her funeral. But it's like wall to wall bangers, so we listen to this funeral mix a lot.
Right.
That's quite cursed, but it's just like lots of obvious 80s stuff. In terms of things that have actually gone, oh, I must note that down and listen to it. Not really.
I listened to a few tracks by everything based on them being played in the office. Also, my brother's a big fan and played it in the car a couple of times, so I've investigated that. Again, a couple of tracks by The National, but nothing very exciting, I'm afraid.
Okay. I'm not a big office speaker guy. I used to always hate that in the future office when an unnamed senior designer would have their speaker on in the office, who was a really, really nice guy, but it was like, I just didn't want to hear, I never want to hear other people's music, even if I like it, you know?
Yeah, my whole time in the future, you know, my eight years, there was like a strange sort of passive, aggressive sort of music thing going on that never really got dealt with.
That's got such like unsupervised blokes in an office energy, you know what I mean?
Well, it's just who gets to decide, you know? Yeah. We shared the floor with some non-gaming mags.
I think they might have been some tech mags. And there was a guy in there who used to play a lot of Dylan. I cannot stand Bob Dylan, like fucking harmonica shit.
Just hearing that, and him doing, you know, just the pits. That was the lowest it ever got, was the, you know, a day of Dylan.
I was sort of, like, there's like five to ten Dylan songs that are so overplayed. You just never want to hear them again. Like, what's that one from the start of Watchmen?
Like, that, I feel like since that was in Watchmen, I've heard that like 5,000 times, and I never want to hear it again. The times they are changing.
The theme to Watchmen by Bob Dylan.
Yeah. Allen's theme by Bob Dylan. No, it's not like, it's like, yeah, it's, let's move on.
There's something here about chocolate orange anecdote, Matthew, as well. I don't really get what this was. Did you know what this was?
It feels like we put a question on cooldown and said we'd return to it in a year, but he hasn't put the question in.
Let's just move on. Okay, what's this next one, Matthew?
You've probably been asked this before, but any plans for some Back Page podcast merch? Tis the season, I'd love to buy some wholesome slash cursed pod-related goodies for friends in the know and myself. Less from Southport Grammar.
Well, as another year passes by, it's another year in which I haven't really had time to investigate this. The problem is that you'd have to pay someone upfront to make this stuff, like to have it designed. And while that's fine in theory, there are just two of us and like there is the Patreon money, but like it's not like commission artists to make loads of cool stuff kind of money.
It's a bit more like it's money that like comes out of the pot we pay ourselves to put the time into the podcast. So it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing with that. I like the idea.
I see a path where we end up 500 pounds out of pocket and I'm forever more polishing things in the house with t-shirts that say, people love it.
Yeah, that's it. I think we talked about like, I'm like more and more convinced that like little pin badges with bespoke designs like the nicest bits of merch you can get because they don't take up a lot of space. They are like, you know, they're very nicely made.
I've worked in PR, we've given a few away and they're like really nice. They look really nice on like pin badge form. You can see how maybe doing like some phrases or like something like that in pin badge form with some fun font or the fake Big Sammy holdings Matthew Castle Productions logos might be good.
But again, it's like we have to find the artist, have it made. I don't want anything with our name on it that's just going to be like landfill in a few years either. Like there's too much shit in the world already.
So I'm up for it. But it kind of requires someone who's not asked to be proactive about it, you know, which is not.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's tough. Any further thoughts, Matthew?
No, I agree. Let's not be landfill.
Okay, cool. Any game fan theories you're particularly fond of are some Betamax Bandit. I did a bit of deep diving on this one Matthew and found some of the laziest list features ever written.
Just regurgitating the six or seven of the same theories that felt very poorly researched to me. I was a bit like, oh, that's a bit duff. So that was a bit of background there before we get into it.
Have you got any that you like, Matthew?
Yeah, I went through exactly the same process. So it's like some guy said this once, but no link to where they said it or where it came from. So it could have been pulled out of their ass.
I mean, like, I read some fan theories around FF7 Remake and Rebirth sort of accidentally, just trying to work out why she went on at the endings, because I found them quite hard to pass. You know, they're just naturally confusing in terms of storytelling as well as just being about confusing things. So, you know, I read some theories about, you know, the obvious things when people think it's all like, you know, what is its relation to the original?
Is it a remake? Is it actually a sequel? You know, nothing shocking there.
In all these terrible list features, which I hated, one entry did jump out and made me, like, made me raise the slightest of eyebrows.
So, the Arkham Seat.
Which was someone saying that they thought Undead Nightmare was John Marston in the afterlife after Red Dead Redemption, which...
That's fun.
I kind of thought, yeah, that, I mean, that, you know, the timeline works.
Yeah, I think I agree. The most, I thought the interesting one that was a little bit, I guess, like, I'll just give a content warning here. There's a bit of like, it's, you know, it's upsetting subject matter.
But there's like a theory that Harley Quinn miscarries in Arkham City after your first fight with her. And like, it's like there's apparently some details in the game that hint at this being like being the case.
Really?
Yeah. I think it's like too dark for that.
That is so dark.
But it's worth, that's one that I would say I would categorize under dubious, but worth a read. And I would be curious to hear what the writers in the game thought if that was something they considered. But yeah, like it's again, I put a content warning there for a reason.
So I hope that wasn't too upsetting for anyone listening. So I just apologize in advance there. There was that side, I thought there were some quite lazy ones.
My personal favorite one of all time is like, I think I've discussed in the podcast before, is that Rinoa is Ultimecia from Final Fantasy 8. That's the good Final Fantasy 8 one. The bad Final Fantasy 8 one is that Squall dies at the end of Disc 1 when he's like pierced with ice by Sorceress Edia and falls down off that tower thing in fucking Paris, France in Final Fantasy 8 land, whatever that place is called.
I can't remember now. Galbadia City? Was that it?
Anyway, so that theory is bullshit. But I think the Renoir being the ultimate villain of the game is really good for a few reasons. One, the smoking gun is that you name your little lion ring at the start of the game and then whatever you name it is whatever Ultimecia's big summon is at the end of the game, like the big monster she brings in.
It's like, I think it's like a demon lion thing. So there's an obvious link between Ultimecia and…
Oh yeah, I mean that sounds like Rock Solid.
It does, but I think this has been… I think this was shot down by Katase and then he retracted shooting it down. I think this is the far better theory for the reason that it's a really cool idea that this sorceress from the future is literally going to compress all of time into this one moment which is what happens at the end of the game.
Is like this girl your main character has fell in love with in your party and is someone you have to destroy. That's just a great, I think that's a great like narrative conceit even if the storyline is a little bit wacky. So yeah, that's like the best one I think.
So the other FF8 one is the film that Laguna participates in during the flashback sequence of the game is something that Cypher, one of the villains in the game, is obsessed with and that's why he wants to become a knight for a sorceress because he watched that stupid film that Laguna makes and then like becomes fixated on the idea of becoming this knight and that's kind of what leads to him becoming this you know dark sort of antagonist in the game. So that's another, it's got quite a lot going on in it. It's pretty good.
So yeah, those are good ones. That was one I saw on Reddit, which I liked, which was you never find out what happens to Karl McLaughlin's character Donald Love in Grand Theft War 3. He just disappears and they think that because Caster City from Manhunt is quite close to Liberty City in GTA 3 that he got, he's one of Starkweather's Manhunts in that game, which I think is quite a nice idea, but it's not quite supported by the text, but it got a lot of upvotes, Matthew, so I thought I'd mention it.
But God, we really crossed the tonal kind of fucking wasteland there. That was quite the thing. Next question, Matthew.
Did Samuel play The Last Story yet? No, Samuel was not executed for buying this in 2020, despite not having played it yet. That was in a Gamescore episode, and that question is from Lexington.
I have played it, but only for an hour. I played it, I think, for the Weedraft we did. In 2021.
The biggest challenge of playing it is that it's got that classic, like, pre-HD thing of pretty detailed graphics, but then, like, the fucking jaggiest edges that look ass on a HDTV, you can imagine. So, it's unfortunate, because there are some quite interesting action-based kind of things that that game does, and the voice acting seemed pretty good in it as well. It was like, it seemed like quite a cool game, The Last Story, Matthew.
You're obviously a fan of it for a few different reasons, but yeah, I have actually, I have technically played it, so it wasn't a total dud purchase. So, nice thing to own The Last Story as well, as the last non-mobile game that Sakaguchi made. So, you know, there you go.
There's my answer to that one. Oh, God. Which swimsuit did Samuel pick for Tifa and Aerith on FF7 Rebirth?
Will he replay the game to see the other options? That's from WelshboyMick. Look, I just, it's incriminating no matter what, right?
Like, there's, you can pretend that, like, selecting those swimsuits is a non-horny endeavour, but we all know that deep down it is. All I'll say is I picked the one that Tifa liked and the one that Aerith didn't like, which I think just says everything, really. So, you know, that's all I've got.
That's my comment on the matter. I won't be revisiting it. Let's move on, Matthew.
Is Matthew actually excited for the new Layton game? That's from Reg McFly. This is Professor Layton and the New World of Steam.
There was a big trailer for it this week on the Nintendo Power trailer randomly, with lots of Japanese voiceover, which made me wonder if they were doing English voiceover, but I think they are. They just haven't localised it yet. Yeah, tentatively so.
The problem with Professor Layton is that the mainline series was getting worse as it went on. I think it peaks with 3, 4 is not bad, but the second trilogy, so 4 to 6, they were quite rough and they never really jumped to 3DS and worked out what to do there and how to continue it. It got a bit old feeling.
Then the one that they made afterwards, the seventh one, which was Professor Layton's niece or something, I thought was absolute dogshit. So, you know, the graph line is pointing down, unfortunately. But, you know, I'd love for level 5 to have a big comeback and prove us all wrong.
The fundamental idea of, you know, a bizarre, twisty mystery with heaps and heaps of logic puzzles. I mean, it is up my street. I don't really know what went wrong, but I did begin to call on them.
But, yeah, hopefully they've sort of reversed that downward trend.
It just went all in on fucking Yo-Kai Watch for like five years there, and then it just sort of like ended in tears. I think that's kind of what happened with that studio, Matthew. They got too fixated on launching franchises instead of like just making good games like they used to.
I think that's the level 5 story to me.
I think that's why they didn't quite become an all-timer. They were a huge success. They made incredibly polished things.
They made original games, even though a lot of them were designed to be spun out into merchandise and animes or whatever. I still think the games at the core were solid. You know, I don't think they were phoning them in, you know, just to kind of lay some quick foundations.
I just, I don't know, maybe it was just too much laden all at once. But the storyline of the second three definitely wasn't as strong as the first three and the mysteries weren't as good. But this one, yeah, this one looks okay.
It's like, you know, in some sort of steampunk world. And it looks like they're being chased by what looks like a ghost prospector type character who seems to be doing a bit of a scooby-doo, you know, scare everyone out of town. So there'll likely be a person behind that.
Yeah.
It's Luke. Luke is the ghost. No, it's not.
I mean, like that bit of it, I am interested in in terms of, you know, these games have always had the most spectacularly dumb twists at the end.
Yeah.
And even if it looks like The Mystery itself isn't that intriguing, there's always a mad twist. If they can continue that trend, you know, it will be worthwhile if only for that. Of course, I hope it's good, but we will see.
Okay. So how would each of you fair as contestants on Taskmaster? That's from Scott V.
I've never seen Taskmaster, Matthew, so you have to take this one. You were aware of it, though. Yeah, it's like Greg Davies in a chair shouting at people and people do tasks.
Is that the whole thing?
Yeah, I'd say the closest thing we've ever done on this podcast to a Taskmaster task was writing lyrics to the theme tune.
All right. Okay.
That's the kind of things they get asked to do, like make a song in 20 minutes or you've got to make a short film, or you pick five ingredients and you have to make the most delicious meal out of it, and then all these comedians just basically conjure up total horror shows. I would say based on that, based on the theme tunes we did, which if you want to remember, Sam just sang Video Games over and over again.
People loved it.
He really found it in, and there's always a contestant on Taskmaster who really phones it in, just doesn't give a shit. They tend to lose Taskmaster. I think I tried too hard with my theme tune to come up with complicated lyrics, and there is always a contestant who tries too hard and doesn't really have the audience on their side because they're a bit of a swat.
So I don't think either of us is winning Taskmaster or winning the hearts of the Taskmaster crowd.
Yeah, okay, interesting. Yeah, sorry, that's just a bit of pop culture I'm not familiar with. I won't watch anything that's had Russell Howard on it.
I'm not interested in that. Just no. No, I will not engage.
I will not engage with British TV from the noughties. That energy I'm not. No, thank you.
The thing I would say for Taskmaster is it's had a lot of people who I would usually just note straight out of watching them.
Yeah.
But I feel like unlike other panel shows where they're just their usual selves, I feel like they are encouraged to be their more natural selves. And sometimes people do surprise you. There are comedians you're like, well, I'll never go and see that person.
I don't find their comedy funny, but I quite like them as a person after Taskmaster. You just get to see where their creativity lies and how the tasks are so abstract that they can't possibly have prepped jokes for them. So it's like, who is naturally funny about these things?
And what's the dynamic between the old comedians and the young comedians? I think there's quite a lot going for it still.
Who surprised you as like, this person is genuinely funny and I had no real idea?
I know I've just said that. I should really have a single example.
I've made it too hard on the spot.
Who has natural funny bones? Nope.
Okay, we'll move on.
Absolute death. Hello big boys. It's interesting that you bought up The Athletic in a recent pod.
Despite having to pay for their access, their comment sections are constantly hostile and derisive about their content of the articles. What are the funniest hostile audience interaction that you have faced in your careers? Remember to keep the mood up.
That's from Johnny.
I managed to remember one in the deep recesses of my memory. Is that when Brexit result was announced in 2016? We posted games to play with your miserable list.
We didn't say it was about Brexit, but all the commenters were like, Brexit is going to happen. One of them was this guy who said, now that we're leaving the European Union, we can make our own British graphics cards. That was the funniest one where I was like, oh yeah, British Rival to NVIDIA is coming.
That's the one that comes to mind of like, this person is thick. Their internet posting permissions should be revoked based on how stupid this comment is. So that comes to mind as funny idiots, basically.
That's like the idea of a British graphics card that's got the fucking Union Jack on the end of it or something. How about you?
There was a guy when I was editing Official Nintendo, there was a guy in the forums who I fucking hated his guts and he hated my guts. And he was always moaning about that. Basically, the day I took over, he's just constantly complaining about the state of the magazine.
And the one that really sticks with me is he had a huge problem with the fact that there was a picture of me on the editor's page because he was like, your vanity knows no ends. You could use that space for more content. I'm like, the fucking first page of the magazine, what do you think you're going to open it up?
And then there's just going to be a column review of the next Mario Kart game on page one. Have you no idea how these things flow at work?
That's so funny.
Like, you fucking cretin.
It's like, we've replaced Matthew Castle with an op-ed about how good fucking Kirby Superstar Deluxe is or something like that. That's so good.
But the thing is, there was a big picture of the editor on there because when we redesigned the magazine, Chandra was in charge, and Chandra liked having his photo taken a lot. You know, he's into that kind of thing. That's the sort of part of his vibe.
So instead, you had a slightly sheepish, apologetic picture of me doing a comedy shrug. It wasn't like, hey, everyone, look at me. I'm so fucking cool.
But this guy just, yeah, he just had such an issue with that with that picture. And it was a wordy editor's page. It had a wordy intro column and it had like the meet the team.
Just really strange stuff. That was the guy when I found out they were closing the mag. Like the first thing I did when I got back to my desk was I went on the forum and deleted him from the O&M forums.
Knowing that he wouldn't, like who was he going to take it up with? There was literally not going to be an O&M anymore. Nah, it was good.
That's really funny. Next question then. This is me.
What point and click adventure trope would most apply if you were the star of one, i.e. the curse of Bath Island, a classic Japanese chicken in a bag with a pulley in the middle? SAFC.
Jack 91, that is. I don't know enough about this genre to really do this, Matthew. Have you got one for this?
I'd say the point and click trope that I do live already is the assortment of weird shit in my pockets. Right. It was when we went to London a few weeks ago.
We went to see a play and I pulled my wallet out of my pocket and an umbrella came out, loads of empty Rennie rappers, a big wad of just faded receipts. It's just crap everywhere, really chaotic. Why is this guy looking after so many empty Rennie rappers?
That's got slight Monkey Island inventory energy. I don't know. I think if you were to set a point and click game in Bath, it would probably be more down to earth like Broken Sword.
It would be like a historical conspiracy. You'd go to the Roman Bards and press a button and find out, Templars used to sauna there or something.
The Curse of Bog Island, it would be as well.
Yeah. So I think it would probably be quite well-behaved. I don't think it would be you have to make a fake beard out of cat hair and mayonnaise or whatever the fuck it is happens in some of those games.
But it would be like a grown-up, it would be grown-up, point-and-click fare.
Yeah. What's the... There's that quite wild twist at the end of Monkey Island, right?
So who would be the like, oh my god, I can't believe the villain turned out to be X reveal, Matthew? Would it be me? Well, like Catherine?
That would be good, I guess.
Who would the twist be? It would be Nicolas Cage, who once turned on our Christmas lights. Somehow he's involved.
Yeah, Anthony Stewart Head would be a great NPC in that game, I think. Just outside wait choice, you know, you keep walking past, he's still there.
It should be Anthony Stewart Head, but he serves the same information giver role as Giles from Buffy.
Yeah.
He's really aware that he isn't Giles from Buffy, but he is fulfilling a similar role. He's quite irked about being typecast in life by that.
Perfect. I love that. Okay, good stuff, Matthew.
This one really made me laugh. I just discovered Eugene Acker is really called Eugene Acker. I spelt it wrong, by the way.
What's been your biggest misconception about a legendary games figure? A secondary question here is also Metroidvania is an absolutely abysmal description, meaningless to anyone who doesn't already know what it means. What would be your picks for a replacement?
That's from Pete.
Right, oh, there's two biggies there. I guess my biggest misconception before doing this job was I think I signed a lot of games to people who didn't necessarily make them. Because either the information wasn't out there, or just the way certain people become spokesmen for certain games, you know?
Like, it's very easy to assume for a long time that Miyamoto was just like directing every single killer Mario game, or Anselder and any Nintendo game. And then actually once you kind of learn what a producer is or an executive producer, and you begin to sort of zoom out the view a bit and go, oh, okay, you know, not a very exciting example, I guess. But that is something that happened.
Similar with like, McCarmy. I thought McCarmy like made like everything that he was kind of a producer on. So, you know, before knowing the existence of like, Shootakumi, you'd be like, oh, McCarmy made Ace Attorney.
And you're like, no, he didn't. Like, that isn't, that isn't quite how it worked. So that, I mean, that's kind of all I could really think of this for this in terms of misconceptions.
Did you have anything juicier?
So I will note that one of the more interesting ones is that even though a lot of Kojima's games credit him as like a writer, his co-writer on pretty much most of the games is this Shuyo Murata, going all the way back to Metal Gear Solid 2. And so I think like because Kojima has very writerly sort of like tweets and interviews and stuff like that, I think you just assume that he is the sole writer on his games because obviously he's not going to be like the sole designer because games are very complex these days. But Murata worked on everything from MGS2 to Zone of the Enders, all the way up to MGS5 and even Death Stranding.
So like a really key collaborator, but someone who we know almost nothing about, right? I've never really seen Murata doing interviews, but that's like one thing. I also, I'm still like really, one of the most fascinating sort of stories in recent history of games to me, like is in the last decade or so, was the closure of Irrational Games.
And it was genuinely interesting this year to read Jeremy's Edge piece. And to also quiz him on this podcast about it in the last PC gaming draft about Ken Levine and his role in Irrational shutting down and where the responsibility lies between developer and publisher. And it seems a bit like he took the fall for it at the time.
And in retrospect, seems like more of a leadership decision. Still something that's like not super clear, but that's something where I felt like I knew what that story was. And then after this year, I'm not sure I do.
So that came to mind, Matthew. I think Metrovania is a good genre name. Like it's fine.
If you don't know what it means, you just go search out the thing that it is. And when you play those games, you understand what it means. Like it's, I don't know, it doesn't always have to be to tell you absolutely everything about it.
If you don't know what RPG stands for, it's a meaningless combination of letters. So I don't really get that. And also all of the other ones I've seen pop up, like Metroid Brainiere and Brainvania.
Brainvania.
Absolutely. No, no way am I having that. So the idea that people think they're cleverer, that Metroidvania is much more annoying than the term Metroidvania is my take.
Matthew, what do you think?
Yeah, I'm kind of with you on that. I think it's been around long enough now that it's valuable to enough people that I don't have a problem with it. I mean, yes, you can go into it and go, you know, Metroid and Castlevania are actually doing two different things.
And as a term, it's slightly inelegant because, you know, what you're actually often talking about is a Metroid-like or a Castlevania-like. But that's, I don't know, that's not very satisfying, is it? Just sticking a likes on the end of things.
In terms of a replacement term, like, you know, they often have like gear gating in them. As like a seems to be a quality that exists in a lot of these things. The idea that you need a certain piece of equipment or ability to get past a certain obstacle, and that's how they gate you in, you know, which takes you into the realms of like, are they are they gated adventures?
What the fuck is that? What does that mean? Is that it's not very sexy?
I'm just happy to stay with Metrovania is where I landed on this.
Yeah, I think some people have been trying to make search action happen, and I don't see it. I think that actually tells you even less than Metrovania does, personally, but you know, it's, yeah, so yeah.
Search action to me makes me think of like, hit and object games.
Yeah, it does a little bit. I think that's actually pretty vague, so yeah. There wasn't a term for the thing, so Metrovania kind of filled in the gap, really.
So yeah, I think that's like-
Backtrackers, that's what we should call them.
Backtrackers. Oh dear. Okay, then next up, Matthew, do you want to read this one?
In a Hallmark Christmas film, would you rather be the big wig from the big city trapped in a small town, or the love interest living in the small town mourning their dead partner? This is from Vegetable Tart, who I'm gonna guess has watched too many Hallmark Christmas films in the last few weeks.
At least like fucking 14 in the last two days, I think. That's like a whole deal. Yeah, I don't really, I'm not, I'm only familiar with these films via like thumbnails, and I would say the thumbnails are quite cursed.
Like although, even though I know they're real actors, they look like AI, kind of like generated actors. Like the blokes have like these incredibly shiny, fake fucking veneer teeth, and the women look like they've been sort of like, I don't know, you chucked a bunch of Instagram models in a blender and then just like 3D printed a woman basically. That's like, that's the vibe I get from those thumbnails.
I guess I'd rather be the big wig from the big scene. That's more my profile I think than, I think you've got a bit more small town energy, Matthew.
Yeah, but I don't want the grief. I just don't, I don't think I'd opt in for anyone who's like defined by grief for their dead partner.
It's not ideal, no. So.
Like big wig, the thing that appeals in both these scenarios is like the small festive town. I'm quite into like that small town America. Yeah.
But I would, if I was gonna be in this anywhere, I'd rather be like a person with lots of money. I'd rather be a big wig.
Yeah. I guess it's gonna be the right kind of small town as well. Like you don't want it to be the small town in like Hell or High Water, that Taylor Sheridan film, for example.
No, it's like cliched small town America. It's like the Richard Curtis small town America.
It's not real. Yeah, it's not real.
And it's not like so small that it's like horror territory, you know? You don't want to be in like Texas Chainsaw Massacre territory.
No, that's not ideal either. So, okay, good. I think we've both answered that.
You're mourning your dead partner because they were... This is what wasn't mentioned in the Netflix synopsis. They were killed by Leatherface.
That would be a great thing to do to disguise a horror film as like a fake Christmas romance film. That's like... It would horrify the audience for those films, but all the film bros would love it.
They'd all be calling it Good Keno. Good Keno is more annoying than Metroidvania. Okay, next up then Matthew, I'll read this one out.
If you could add a single generation of backwards compatibility to one console that lacks it, i.e. a SNES that plays NES or Dreamcast that plays Saturn, to make the definitive best console of all time, which would you add it to? I like that question.
Also, if you had to have one game console, kiosk or arcade cabinet in your house, which one would you have? Brackets to make it harder, the cabinet or kiosk only has one playable game. That's from Koig.
So we got both of these, Matthew.
So for the generation of backwards compatibility to add to a console, is it cheating to ask that the Switch can do what the 3DS does and play 3DS and DS games? Is that too many generations?
See, I had that as well, and I couldn't unpick it in my head. And I was like, ah, because I agree that's the one. That's like the most definitive fucking console of all time at that point.
Like what?
A Switch that I can pop my DS or 3DS games into is like my dream console.
And then you just turn it sideways and use like the stylus. That would be fucking, it would be a bit inelegant, but it would be spot on as a prospect to play all those games. Yeah, I like that one, Matthew.
I think that's probably the right answer. For this one, I did also, I still think in a lot of ways that a PS3 that plays PS2 games is like the Holy Grail. For the simple reason that the PS3 did play PS2 games, and they took it out as a function to make it cheaper to make.
But when I had that functionality, it was endlessly exciting to blow a PS2 game up on a HDTV, but have proper HDMI output. It looked, all those games look really fucking good on a HDTV, and then never again really unless you buy Retro Tink and all that stuff. But PS3 with PS2 functionality because it already has PS1 built in.
That's quite a large crop of stuff combined. So that was my other answer. How about the arcade one, Matthew?
What have you got for this?
Probably Ghost Squad if I had a cabinet.
I'd go squad as one of my picks for this one for sure.
So if not Ghost Squad, I don't know if we're allowed to have a... I'd probably rather have a pinball table than a game's arcade machine.
Do you know which pinball table? Star Trek Next Generation?
I had written that down as one of the two. Star Trek Next Generation for the nostalgic hit of standing by my father's side as a young boy in South World Pier watching him play. We had the Medieval Madness Table in our common room at University, and that's a great pinball table.
Voice effects by Tina Fey, no less.
Amazing. I remember you mentioned that. I think at some point pinball has come up before in the podcast.
I can't remember when, but yeah. Cool. Those are good picks.
Did we talk about the Dark Knight pinball table on this podcast, Matthew? That one's pretty good.
I don't think so.
That's got little bits of the Joker popping up in the display. It's like, as in like, that's what's unusual about it. It's not a generic Batman table.
It's literally the Dark Knight movie, and it's got Christian Bell on the little bike on it and stuff. That's a cool one. They had one in the Cardiff MQ64.
I don't know if they still got it, but yeah, that's a cool one. So I, for this, had Star Wars Trilogy Arcade, the Sega one from 98, I think it was one of my favorite machines. It's a very obvious answer for me though.
If not that, probably it would be either Ghost Squad or Time Crisis 2. Like the Time Crisis 2 cabinet is like such a, I'm always like, oh, that's a very obvious thing to pick, but then you see it again and you're like, oh, Time Crisis 2 is so fucking good, man. That's just a really fun.
Then the guns feel great and all that stuff, and the little feedback thing you get on the gun. It'd be a nice thing to own if I had an infinite amount of space, which obviously I don't. Yes.
Next one then, Matthew. Do you want to read this one out?
Was there any game you really wanted to review, but was given to someone else on the Mag? Could you ever offer to swap for, say, a month's worth of lunch sandwich runs? That's from Paul Monahan.
It's a very quaint image of people fetching other people's sandwiches in Games Mag's office, which basically never happened in my experience. I thought for this one, the one that jumped out was, this particularly happened on Play when there were a lot of staff, and so there's a lot of jostling for different reviews. Missing out on Mirror's Edge bummed me out.
I was like, that was a game I was locked in on, really wanted to play. Then when it came around, I didn't even get off of it. It was just freelanced out.
So that was tough to miss out on. In some ways, I wonder if that made me enjoy the game more because I got to just enjoy it in my spare time. But Mirror's Edge was like a thing where I watched the trailer over and over again.
I was just so up for that game. And then I think it lived up to the hype personally. So that jumps out to me, Matthew.
Well, how about you?
Yeah, I mostly had the run of things on a lot of the mags I was on in terms of like picks, because I was a bit of a Keno. People were just like, that's fine. Keno, not Keno, as in film bros, just to be clear.
The one that I didn't review on NGamer, which I would love to have reviewed, was Xenoblade Chronicles 1, which Kitzy did. I cannot for the life of me remember how that came about. I think I might have just been on holiday, and that's what stopped me from pouncing on it, because I was quite greedy for games.
If you look on NGamer's list of the highest scoring games, a lot of the biggies, I got to do the Zeldas and Mara Galaxy, and all the first party stuff, basically. So that was tough. I mean, post games magazines, the one which was killer was not being able to weigh in on Tears of the Kingdom.
I was going mad, desperately trying to find an outlet that would let me review it for them, and just like no one was having any of it. So, that was a bummer. Though, I do know that they had quite a harsh review period to do it.
They weren't getting very long with it, and just sat on the other, so maybe dodged a bullet.
If I had to review that game in like three days, I would have given it like six out of 10, I think. I've had such a bad time forcing myself to do that. It would have been tough.
Yeah, just jog to memory of another one actually, is that the original Uncharted was one, where I remember when we were on play, it so quickly emerged as like the one good PS3 game in a disappointing year. It was just given to a freelance. I think we did give it four pages.
It was like fairly prominent, but I think it was one of those games that gathered momentum. And so by Christmas, it was like, oh, this is the game that actually batted from this year. And then like none of us really ended up, yeah, well, none of us reviewed it.
It was just a freelancer. It was like, oh, this game is pretty cool. And gave it like 80 something percent or something.
Yeah, that one comes to mind. In recent years, I haven't, it's not really been a game I've been dying to to review from recent years so much. I sort of like, I don't miss that process necessarily, but like it might have been nice to do like Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor.
Those might have been nice to sort of like try and unpack as someone who loves Star Wars but doesn't really love Souls like. So yeah, this is a related question really, isn't it Matthew? Parnell Plays, have either of you missed out on a classic game or elected not to play it in full having worked on previews of the game?
I remember Joe Scribble's talking about a colleague who had never played The Witcher 3 after having played four hours of it for preview and didn't want to have to do it again.
Annoyingly, no, I can't think of any game where I did this and got sick of it beforehand. You know, I was just, again, Keno wanted to jump on everything and play everything, so that really wasn't a problem for me.
Keno, not Keno.
Keno, not Keno. That's the merch which we won't be able to sell.
That's the merch that will not be going in landfill in 2032.
So, yeah, I just don't have a very good answer for this. Did this ever happen to you?
I think I might have mentioned this before, but the closest I could think of was I played too much of Arkham Asylum at Preview, because I went to a hands-on event, I think it was a hands-on event, and then they sent out preview code to play at home, and I played through all of that, including the first, maybe it's the first two scarecrow sections. Then by the time the review came around, which I also did, I was quite burnt out on it, and I felt like I had just seen a bit too much of it, so I was less wowed. It was quite a, no one's going to have this to hand, but my X360 review of Arkham Asylum actually reads a little bit down, because I originally gave it seven, and Simon Miller convinced me to up it to eight, which is a story I've told on the podcast before, but that was one where I think I just played too much of it, it just soured me on it a little bit.
Obviously it's a great game, so I was in the wrong there, but that's the only one I could really think of, Matthew. So yeah. Okay, do you want to read this next one?
Which boss fight in Metal Gear Solid 1 or 3 would be most improved by them wearing rollerblades? Keeping in mind these are ordinary rollerblades and would be more of a hindrance in snow or jungle terrain. I'm assuming this is in reference to Fat Man being on roller skates.
I mean, the answer's the end, surely. The end of roller skates is pretty funny as an idea.
Yeah, I just thought you could quite undermine the last fight with the boss in that field of flowers.
Yeah, you're both on rollerblades so this is like fucking chaos. That would be good.
You're circling each other. Maybe he needs to add roller skate mode, a bit like big head mode or something.
Yeah, I love that. Glad you went with one or three and didn't go with skull face and five or something like that.
That fiery guy.
Oh yeah, yeah. The guy who is volguing on fire basically, that guy.
Volguing on fire.
Yeah. There's another part of this question right as well.
Also, more of a thought than a question. It might be interesting to hear about the process of getting the edge cover for Indiana Jones. From Samuel's perspective in PR, I really enjoyed the game magazine covers from the Heaven and Hell episodes.
Both your insights on the subject as editors, that's from Emily. Is that something you can talk about?
Well, I can talk more generally about covers. I suppose that might be moderately interesting. I don't talk about working PR much on the podcast, but I know a lot of journalists listen to it, so it might be interesting.
I mean, I think the biggest benefit you can have in PR is just to have been a journalist before, and that just gives you such a massive advantage to understand the needs of journalists and what they will like and what they won't like. That doesn't mean I've never upset a journalist. I've definitely done that at least a couple of times because you can't always get people exactly what they need and in the time they need it and all that stuff.
But in terms of pitching a cover, that's a bit of a process of finding. So it's got to be the right game for the outlet. So I've had instances where I've pitched games unsuccessfully to magazines, and I've had examples where I've pitched them successfully to magazines.
That's sometimes a little bit of a like, it's normally like a meeting or a team's call, and I'll just be like, this is the access I think we can get. This is like, can we get you, what cover art can we get you? Is it going to be existing artwork?
Is it going to be new artwork? Can we get a bespoke piece of artwork for you? When I worked on Frontier, we got a cover for PC Gamer where the artwork was made specifically for the cover.
It was a really beautiful looking cover. I really like that artwork for it. Yeah, so there's a bit of that involved.
Then what can we get you of the game? Is there like, is it going to be interviews? Are we going to get to see the game before other people?
Are we going to get to play the game for other people? There's all kinds of moving parts to go into that, of is the game ready to be played, that kind of stuff. And so those are the kinds of conversations you have.
And then the last part of it is the actual bits that you get inside the magazine and whether you can get anything exclusive for that, because that's the thing that obviously, back in the day, this was much more common, but cover features would have exclusive assets, screenshots you'd never seen before, right? And you got used to seeing scans of Game Informer going up on Imgur or whatever, and that would be how people found out about GTA 5 or whatever. That's like an old magazine thing that used to happen.
So there's a bit of that. I mean, without speaking about the indie things specifically, there's some really nice bits of art in that cover feature that are, I still don't think have been published anywhere else. That's like, they're really gorgeous bits of art that we got for them for that.
And I was there as Jeremy interviewed all the devs for it. I think it's like four dev interviews we did in a row in like a two-hour block. And it was like, but it was really interesting because no one had asked them about the game before.
So it was genuinely interesting to see. So yeah, I really like the process of doing it. You're also, the key thing is timing.
You have to ask quite early because chances are people are already, like now, for example, people are already going to be pitching their 2025 covers. So you can't be like, next month can we put this in the magazine? You have to ask about three to six months in advance, really, in order to make it happen.
But I really enjoy working on it. It's fun to be able to pull that together from the other side and then to, like, you know, get people what they need and stuff. So, I don't know, is that interesting, Matthew?
I don't know.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, it's all insight. No, not a world, you know, I've never worked on that side of things.
You know, I only know what it feels like to to deal with this stuff and, you know, the kind of hopes and dreams you have for every one of these interactions and, you know, to different degrees of success, whether the covers actually land in the end. But yeah, that Indiana Jones one was great. Yeah, it's a good feature, too.
Jeremy did a good job with that, I thought.
Yeah, it's a beautiful thing. Sometimes it's way more ad hoc as well, like the, so there was a, when Wireframe magazine, which is a really good magazine that closed, I think last year, we did a cover for indie game, I was working on Deliver Us Mars, and Aaron Potter, who I think listens to this, was like, I basically met him in a coffee shop in Bath, and put the build on my gaming laptop, and just had him play it, which is, that's very much like a small publisher way to work. You couldn't do that for massive publisher games.
I don't think you could take, let's say, the next Mass Effect and just have it in coffee number one in Bath, but that's the thing.
Coffee number one.
But if you're like an indie developer, you can be a little bit more agile with what you can provide, and so that agility is your advantage really. It's like you can get people more because you have, the layers of approval are going to be a lot leaner. So yeah, it is genuinely interesting.
It's like a real juggling act. So yeah, I'm not sure how editors feel about it. That's the PR perspective, Matthew.
So yeah. Okay. Next one then.
Hi lads, what do you enjoy most about games that you don't get from other forms of media, TV, films, books, et cetera? Some Kraft cheese.
Uh, I mean, it feels really basic bitch and obvious to say they just use parts of my brain that other media doesn't use. You know, my reactions, decision making, time management, logic, planning, just more like applied thinking rather than just being washed over and just absorbing. You're still thinking with books and TV and film, but I don't know, I like the extra level engagement.
It's a bit of a weird question, this. It feels like it's just like, why do you like games?
Yeah.
I was like, well, that, I guess, is what's going on in my head. I don't sit there going, yes, my brain is firing on all cylinders right now. You know, it's a bit more immersive than that.
I am aware of, compared to other mediums, like the sense of there being, you know, a live element to games where you kind of step in, you know, you are the final piece of the puzzle and you are making it happen. And that, you know, there is a sort of thrill in that. I mean, ideally, you're so immersed into it that you're not really thinking of it in those terms.
But I am often thinking like, wow, this thing that was built for me to be in, and that is something that always impresses me. But that maybe suggests I am like one step removed, but that's not necessarily something I get from TV, films and books.
I think I agree. I mean, I'm sort of like, I think it's the way games sound and like look, that is the stuff that really stimulates me in a way that film and TV don't. It's just because, like you say, because you are interacting within that space, that the visual stimulus of it is just so different.
Yeah, there is something powerful about putting you in the shoes of a character and like in this very direct way that you don't get from film and TV necessarily. My peak of sort of interest in, I guess that side of things was probably like with Rockstar Games about 10 to 15 years ago. Like the idea of like, you're not just watching John Masters' story, you are inhabiting his like quite compromised sad life and he is you and you are him.
It's like a, you know, it's part of the reason I think that that story lands is because you spend so much time controlling him and you feel like you're in his head in a way that I think you would be with a film character necessarily. People might disagree, but I think there's just something about that very, about inhabiting them. That said, I can't get that thing you said about, I just stood in a piece of shit, kind of like MPC, like a bark style.
God damn it, I got shit on my boot.
That kind of thing or like, yeah, what happens when you get run over by a horse? But yeah, I think that is it. I think it's just the way that you feel inside an interactive world is just, is the thing you don't get from other medium, other media.
It's just, yeah, it's a very basic answer, but it's what is specific to games. And yeah, it is that thing really. It's not necessarily even like the substance of the narrative type thing.
It's just literally the feeling of being a character inside a world where you can move around. That's just, you know, when is that not magic? Okay.
Next up then, Matthew.
Which cancelled game would you like to see return and be released? For me, it would be Agent. Also, what was your favorite toy or toys growing up?
That's from Angry Curt.
Can I count the Night of the Old Republic remake that's not happened? I mean, I think that is still being made, but it was when they announced the PS5, wasn't it? They were still doing that.
And it was like, wow, it's Darth Revan. It's coming back. And then almost immediately it just disappeared as a thing.
Like it was just like, anyway, that was like, I wouldn't mind seeing that come to fruition. Agent, I probably used to be more invested in. I don't know.
Did that ever exist? Did we ever see anything of that apart from a name?
I think there's some leaked environment art out there about it. It was being worked on at some point. And it was like an Eastern European apartment block that someone put in there like Art Station Profile or something like that.
It was DeviantArt or something like that. So there were bits and pieces, but I don't think it was ever seriously ready to break cover. I think that was a Sony, the PS3 is a bit fucked, Gambit in the moment to just be like, we've got a PS3 exclusive from Rockstar.
I think that's what that was. That was like a PR thing more than like, it was ready to be announced. But what do you think, Matthew?
Anything on the Nintendo side here?
Not really. I don't spend a lot of time looking into like, canceled games. I'm not particularly interested in like, canceled game coverage.
I always find this something a little... It's just very easy for people to say, oh, we were going to make this masterpiece and then we didn't and there's nothing to say that we weren't making a masterpiece. I'm always like, yeah, okay.
You know, I don't find a huge amount of value in that. In terms of things that like, did seem to exist at some point or were kind of coming along that I was interested in, Project Rag Tag, the Amy Hennig Star Wars game. More because I just want to see Amy Hennig make another game.
That's like Uncharted or I just make another game full stop.
You'll get your wish next year. Looks pretty good.
Yeah, well, hopefully. So that's part of that. Silent Hills, obviously.
That was a good one. Recently, actually, a thing that came out this week, I mean, it's not a... I don't think it's like a...
I don't know if it was just like a part of a pitch for a bigger game or something, but there was this Lego James Bond trailer doing the rounds. I think it was technically for a Lego Dimensions expansion, which is actually quite a bad hang that game. So I'm not massively cut up that Lego James Bond didn't come to be through Lego Dimensions.
Speaking of landfill.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to have to interact with it on those terms. But watching that trailer and seeing the iconic scenes from Live and Let Die, him running across the alligators and doing the barrel roll in the car, but it's all made of Lego, it did suddenly jump out. Oh, yeah, why isn't there a Lego James Bond?
That makes perfect sense. Like these films can be boiled down to like six set pieces each and that would be the game. So that was like a little bit of a what if, but I'm not going to be like, no, I didn't have to spend 200 quid on Lego Dimensions peripherals because that was rough, that whole thing.
But any game that would let me be Lego knickknack, I'm in.
Yeah, I'd be curious to see the minifigure for Lego knickknack and how they interpret it.
Christopher Lee in Man with a Golden Gun, but he's just got a stud for the third nipple.
That's perfect. The one I used to be quite fixated on was Dinosaur Planet on N64. That was the one where I played a bunch of Banjo and I played a bit of Donkey Kong 64 and I was like, oh, what's this lost rare platformer?
But now you can actually just play that. I think it's almost an almost complete N64 ROM that's just floating around. That's just out there.
For you to find and obviously they made Star Fox Adventures which was a massive chunk of that game as well. So yeah, I don't know. That was the one I was most curious about.
Silent Hills is the all-time winner, I think. That's the one where I was like, God damn, I would just love to have seen what that would end up as. Even though I think we never really learned that much about it.
So yeah. Okay. There's also a question here about what was your favorite toy or toys growing up, Matthew?
I was a big, when I was a really young kid, I was a big Power Rangers Zords guy. I loved those fucking robots that stick together to form larger robots. I love that shit.
And I only had a few of them, but a mate across the road had loads of them. And I thought that was the coolest thing in the world. How about you?
Yeah, mainly Lego. My mom was quite down on branded toys, like Power Rangers, things which seemed too American or kind of advertised on TV too aggressively, where Lego as a creative toy was fine. I just had a big red box of generic Lego.
It wasn't like pirate Lego or I didn't have themed sets. So I just built lots of multicolored bases. I was always building bases, various secret bases for people.
Me too. Things like bases that could go underground when under attack and fire missiles at other bases. That's what I was into building with that Lego, yeah.
Just like when you're a kid, I think bases are where it's at. I don't know what in pop culture, maybe it was early video games, I have no idea, kind of taught us to sort of seek comfort in bases.
I know what it was. It was fucking Jerry Anderson.
Oh, that's a good shout.
He loved bases. You got that flying one in Captain Scarlet. You got that one that goes underground in Stingray and like shoots a little submarine out when things are like dicey.
And you've got Tracy Ireland, like the massive base guy Jerry Anderson, you know.
Oh, Jerry Anderson, he was big into bases. Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, I had like a lot of Lego as well. I mean, we were both before the generation of Lego where it was branded. So there was like a Lego Star Wars came along when I was slightly too old for Lego, when I was about like 11 or 12.
But there was still like, it's the Lego pirate base.
Yeah, that's true.
Because I can remember, I remember my parents often saying like, well, that Lego makes one thing only. Like it makes that base. It's designed to make that base.
Yeah.
And so you are better off having this generic Lego, which can be anything you want it to be. But I don't know if that's true because I've seen what Lego build with branded Lego into other Lego, you know?
Yeah.
They build like a fucking Ferrari and then you look at it and it's got like a load of Hagrid heads in it or whatever.
Hagrid heads.
Whatever. It's kind of like the Hubcats are actually Hagrid's head. You're like, what the fuck?
That's amazing.
That's so funny. That's so funny.
That's how Lego works, isn't it? It's when you really look at it. It's a bit like the end of Sharp Objects.
It's like, you look at it and go, that's cool. If you look really closely, you realize how fucked up it is.
I'd love to know how many times the end of Sharp Objects has come up on this podcast. I love that just being used as a shorthand now. That's so funny.
The King Lego set I had, the one I was proudest of as a kid, one I broke down and made into many different kinds of models, much to my mother's horror, having built it for me a few times, it's called the Lego Ice Planet Deep Freeze Defender. It's like this giant fucking blue spaceship with these two little things at the front, these cockpits at the front that jump off and have little skis on them so they can ski around the ice planet or wherever. It's got a load of lasers on it and a big missile.
That thing fucking ruled. All the little lads in it have little translucent orange chainsaws, presumably to cut through ice, but no doubt I was using it as a kid to go all fucking Texas chainsaw massacre about it. Oh yeah.
Chopping off Hagrid heads left, right and center. That was really good. I was a big Lego kid as well.
I love Lego. As an adult, I did have a brief Lego phase about ten years ago. I bought loads and loads of superhero Lego, then I kind of burned out again.
Now I'm like, oh yeah, that's nice. Whenever people buy, adults are buying new Lego sets, I'm like, oh yeah, that's nice, but I'm not participating these days. However, no judgment, Matthew.
I think my stepdad got us some Meccano, hoping we'd be mechanically minded or go into a building technical trade, but that never happened.
So boring Meccano. I had Meccano as well. I think one time, I put an entire day to building a bookshelf with it or something that could store books on it, and then got to the end of it and I was like, oh, that was so unfulfilling.
But this is so much worse than Lego. That's my abiding Meccano memory. The best thing about it was the little electric drill you had to speed up the screwing in, putting the screws in.
That was the most exciting I ever got. But Meccano was a sad child's toy in my opinion. That's for proper clever clogs.
And make huge amounts of money.
Smart people, basically, probably enjoyed Meccano.
As opposed to dirt poor games journalists who don't know how to change a lightbulb.
And then I had a Kinects combine harvester thing that was the worst of both worlds, Kinects. You couldn't build anything creative with it, really. But it had all the boring bits of Meccano.
Kinects was cursed, I think. So, Lego is just the winner, let's face it. Shall we end on this one, Matthew?
Seems like a good one to end on. Okay, I'll read this one out. This is from Slayer Disco.
How hard do you try to monetize the podcast? Do you intentionally not push it too hard to be commercial in order to maintain it as a joyous hobby? If it was bringing in a hundred thousand a year, would it become just another job or would that be the dream come true?
What do you think, Matthew?
I mean, that scenario would be a dream come true, obviously. Any world where, if this could be the thing, obviously that would be rad. Not having to do a normal grown up job.
But that isn't to say I'm not incredibly thankful about where it is at at the moment and what it does for us. And how the money that we make through Patreon is more than enough to justify the time we put in to it and to make sure it is good. I certainly wouldn't want to go down it.
I'm not interested in any other monetising routes with it. We haven't switched adverts on for it. We don't do ad reads.
We've had a couple of people approach us in the past, sort of.
I just had one for a game that's out next year. Actually, they said, what would you do? We gave you some money to do X around this game.
It does happen occasionally. Not very often, but occasionally.
No, but I don't know how much of that is. It just lets me feel all self-righteous about it, and that's what I actually like.
Yeah, I don't judge anyone who monetizes. You've got to do what you do to make the thing viable. Absolutely.
And it's interesting, actually, because I follow a few streamers who have a gifting thing. I think it's basically like blokes buying them games or whatever. But that totally makes sense to me as a way to have interactions with your community, because they're literally buying games for you to stream or whatever, or they value the work that you make, so they want to reward you.
And it's a similar dynamic to what Patreon is, really. I would say that the commercial aspect of it comes from creating subject-driven episodes that bring in more listeners who might not have tried it before, because they like the sound of an episode. Like the PS PlayStation game episode we did last week was one of our most downloaded day-one episodes on the free feed ever.
And I think that's because PlayStation, you know, UK audience, like it was like a best PlayStation games type title. I think that is what drew a lot of people to try it. And that's the goal more than anything, is to like find new people, because there's a chance they might be invested enough to support us on Patreon.
And that kind of is like as commercial minded as we get, really, you know? I like having a separate career to the podcast side. I like having the podcast as a thing to turn my attention to when not doing that.
It's really nice to have had a career in PR while having this on the side, you know?
Yeah, the only thing is, I look at like, you know, Gav and Co, they're RKG and the fun that they have, you know, building out that project and turning it into like a little mini empire of content and podcasts and all kinds of things.
That is cool.
And it looks really rewarding, you know, like to create this really rich ecosystem, which you can, because it is, you know, it is your day job.
If we had a little office and bath where it's like us two and then like, I don't know, two or three other people and we could build a little, that would be cool, you know? It would be nice to do something like that.
Yeah, but like that, you know, that's... So far on. Short of like some maniac billionaire just wanting to pump loads of money into it because they just happen to like it.
That is our dream, isn't it? We just find...
Yeah, but unfortunately, most of the maniac billionaires are like fucking awful people.
They're fucking psychos, yeah. Like, just, yeah, it's not good.
So I'd be worried if we were appealing to that demographic.
Or they'd be like, we're going to replace you with some AI. We've decided, I've been, I've bought your podcast to like make AI versions of you. And they're going to talk about fucking, you know, like should be a scramble now or whatever.
Oh, I bet that would be the worst possible thing. If you put all these podcasts into some amazing AI machine to make an AI podcast host, my one year would only talk about should be a scramble and it would just say like over and over again. It would just be so fucking busted as a linguistic model.
It'd be so bleak because it would make references to Catherine, this bot, it would be awful. Like you don't, no one needs that. But yeah, but you know what an algorithm could never do?
It could never predict me not liking Tears of the Kingdom, Matthew.
No, that's true podcasting.
Yeah, you need like raw human experience that.
I also like the idea that if they try to train the algorithm on us, like the model for you and I would be pretty advanced, but because he's only been on like five or six time, Jeremy Peel would be just like more of a half human. He'd be quite far from the actual Jeremy Peel, but it's still worth him being there as a model as part of it.
I'm a fan of June 2000. It'd be like that sort of thing, just sort of like really vague kind of PC based opinions, you know?
Yeah, that's a nice cursed image to end on.
Yeah, so it would be definitely would be a dream to have that because obviously you'd also have the thing of like, oh, I don't have to fret about industry layoffs because the thing I make is supported by my community. And what we get is already a good like it's a thing of like, oh, if I have to become freelance like tomorrow or whatever, I have the podcast as a thing that's supporting me and I'm incredibly grateful for that. So I guess like the real dream scenario is like, yeah, that becomes like the whole thing.
And so it's like, well, we're incentivized to make more good stuff because we're supported by our community or whatever, but I'm happy with it. I don't think it's ever gonna grow much more than it's already at. Like the goal is just to keep it as good as it is, you know?
So yeah.
Yeah, I just hope people don't get bored of it really.
Yeah, I think we're in a good creative spell with it at the moment though. Like I feel like it's been a good year for us content-wise, Matthew, so.
And it ended with that incredibly strong magazine quote quiz.
Yeah, this was maybe like one of the shakier episodes of recent months. And on that note, that seems like a perfect place to end, Matthew. We have more questions here.
We'll have to come to them in the New Year, unfortunately. We're just we don't want to keep rambling for hours and hours because the answers will just get more tired and it will result in inferior podcasting, because obviously everything so far has been extraordinary. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I am at MrBazzillPesto on Blue Sky and at MrBazzill UnderscorePesto on Twitter.
Yep, I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both Blue Sky and Twitter, posting more on Blue Sky these days, trying to, but I'm on both. So if you want to follow me on either, please do.
Back PagePod on both as well. If you'd like to follow the podcast, keep up to date on what we're working on. And as mentioned, we're on Patreon.
patreon.com/backpagepod, £4.50 a month, the Excel tier to support. What we make can get two additional podcasts a month. There's also a £1 tip jar tier.
If you just like what we do, want to chuck us some pennies because you've enjoyed what we do. So that's all the stuff, Matthew. Let's get out of here.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
