Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew, we have a returning special guest. It's Jay Bayliss, one of our longest term guests. I always console him for his wisdom. A big I would like to subscribe to your newsletter. H Um your ideas are intriguing to me.

Jay
00:39
Energy from Jay.

Samuel
00:40
Always enjoy his thoughts on games and the games industry. How's it going, Jay? Good.

Jay
00:43
I I think you need like a big asterisk after the wisdom there But I'm glad that you enjoy uh casual prattling. Um things are good on my end, yeah. December already, you know.

Samuel
00:54
That did somehow happen. Actually, um I was you know, I I I used your prattling on stage at Develop this year for a panel. That felt like the apotheosis of all the conversations we've ever had on Discord about about video games was actually at a legitimate event. I'm having a discussion about it on stage while people attended and A couple of people wrote about it as well. That was quite fun. But uh yeah. Um nice to have you back. And I would love to ask, given the subject of this episode, I mean this is an episode all about the best Metroid games, yourself and Matthew, have each uh constructed a top five and I I think it's a genre we talked about several times before and you know the biggest game that's come along in the kind of Metroidvania vein this year. is Silksong and I had a little bit of your behind the scenes journey with that game and because we haven't talked about Silksong much in this podcast at all, I would love to hear how you uh how you found that game this year.

Jay
01:47
Hollow Knight is I think probably one of the best games I've ever played in my life. I don't know if it's it's something to do with when I played it or just the kind of space that indie games were at. But when I when I played Hollow Knight I was I was came away firmly like this is one of the all-time greats. And I think I still feel that way. Silksong is an incredible artistic endeavor that I struggled through like a lot of the game. I did not finish it. I got essentially to the end and was I was kind of like, I've had my fill now. I've had sixty hours of of suffering. Beautiful game, sounds amazing. Incredible score. really intricate world. There's nothing that looks like it or feels like it. But I didn't like love it. In fact it was quite a stressful experience in the way that kind of people describe playing games like Elden Ring are, but in a way that I didn't feel with you know, even playing like, you know, the Souls games. I wanted to love it. I'm sure people out there I mean I can tell people love it. A real difficult game. Um, you know, it's one of these ones where I'm like I can't I can't just come on the podcast and say that I'm bad at it. Because I got far enough into it that I think I'm like decent at it but I couldn't finish it. So I don't know if that that says about me or the game.

Samuel
03:01
Well I felt like when I first discussed it with you, you were like, I'm finding secret areas that are just so rich and like have so much going on in and of themselves that you'd never see this level of detail in a secret area in any other game. And I thought, okay, this game's like broken its brain wide open. But then I I spoke to you like a month later and you're like Oh no, this has really fucked me off actually. And that seemed to be the journey you went through with it, you know.

Jay
03:26
Yeah, I I think that's the thing that got me about the original Hollow Knight. You know, uh we'll we'll go into Metroid. Metroid's a game where you shoot every wall for some reason, and then occasionally there's a missile compartment behind a wall. And Hollow Knight is a game where you shoot every uh you slash every wall for some reason and occasionally there's a whole hidden area that would have cost You half a million of development time and a whole secret boss. It's at a unique kind of point in terms of any game more expensive it of more expensive to develop than that would not have been able to afford to put something like that. behind a fake wall. You know what I mean? It's at the right level of like fidelity and fluidity and, you know, visual artistry where they could pull that off even with such a small team of like, you know, four mainline developers. And but then again, yeah, you you get a whole boss. Metroid games don't have like five bosses in them. Uh none of them are hidden behind secret walls. Um It's just that sense of like, well, if this can be behind this secret wall, then who knows what can be at any point in this game. Siltsong to its credit does take that to like the logical conclusion. There's an absolute boatload of hidden stuff, you know, hidden uh whole sections of the map that are hidden it's just really hard and everything hits you for twice as much damage as you want it to and it really pisses you off. But no, it's it's a really good game. I don't think it's the game for me It's kind of an interesting game to have gone viral in that sense, you know? It kind of became a meme like version of itself over time and over social media, like silksong as a concept became this idea that kind of grew beyond the fact that it was actually a niche Metroidvania game.

Matthew
05:04
I wonder if people enjoyed the meme more than the final game. If they enjoyed being part of the anticipatory LARCs.

Jay
05:12
Oh, a hundred percent. I mean I'm sh uh any d any indie developer would die to have your game become like a shorthand for wanting to purchase something without looking up how difficult it is, you know? Yeah. It's the ideal position to be in.

Samuel
05:26
The funny thing is, w with the amount of wish lists it had and how much hype it had I actually thought it would be like about ten times bigger than it was. Like I thought it'd be day one, like four million people playing it on Steam or something, and it just It was actually it just sort of came and went ultimately. I guess that's true of any game.

Matthew
05:43
I do wonder if a lot of people's journey with it was they either recounted their whole journey to completion and it was quite a celebratory thing for them. Or you had all the people who were very loud about it on day one. and then stopped tweeting about it after maybe day ten when they realized they just weren't gonna be able to do it and they just sort of quietly backed away and stopped talking about it.

Jay
06:05
I think people played it and then got to like the first boss and then they stopped Talking about it.

Matthew
06:10
That was me. I don't think I even got to a proper boss. I got to that for the fucking what's that thing that i there's like loads of bells? It's about an hour in, not even that.

Jay
06:21
dog thing that's in a big pool of bells.

Matthew
06:23
Yeah, loads of bells come out and I could see what I was meant to do, but I thought, you know what, I got better things to be doing like switch welcome to I got to a point where I was fighting against a late game boss and it took me about three

Jay
06:36
three actual days and several like stress headaches. And then I read online that the following boss was at least three times harder than that boss. And then I had to stop playing. And it kind of left me in a funk. I had to play some I had to like I think it wasn't until like dispatched that I was enjoying playing video games again after that. It took a little time. Damn.

Matthew
06:56
That's harder than things that you could do outside of games that would make a considerable change in your life. That sounds harder than doing like a degree. you know, which can change the course of your existence.

Jay
07:06
I could have gone to the gym like a few times in that time, but instead I got upset at the bugs on my screen.

Samuel
07:13
I would love To ask about uh your professional life, Jay. Because, you know, you're one of the developers of Cassette Beast and you're presumably working on something else. I I just want to ask a bit about that side of things really because Cet beast released a a couple of years ago now. And uh yeah, how's it going?

Jay
07:30
No, yeah, things gone well. I mean we recently announced uh recently discovered that we'd hit one point one million units sold, which was absolutely nuts because I remember when we were first, you know, developing Cazette Beasts, we were like, right, let's try and get to sixty thousand sales and that would kind of sort us out. So it was kind of like a dizzying figure. And no, it's been it's been a really cool year for Cassette Beast. We had some updates earlier this year and yeah, people like the game. It's kind of an interesting thing to kind of see people still discover this game. You know, in a world where it feels like every piece of media is so kind of ephemeral and disappears and people are talking about it and then it goes the next week 'cause there's something new. It's humbling to see people play this game that we released two years ago and still enjoy it and still discover it and then you know have members of our community follow up and be like, hey, that's that's cool, right? And you know, discuss it with them and it's it's uh it's it's super cool to see

Samuel
08:25
Yeah, for sure. I like that anytime I see, you know, your social accounts posting, you get the kind of engagement I think that I can sort of imagine that you had that in your mind's eye when you were creating the game of like, it would be great to get this kind of audience and then you know, you are rewarded with that kind of response from people. That's awesome to see. And uh I look forward to hearing about if you are working on anything else, what that that next thing would be. I did want to ask a bit more about your year playing games. Um so you mentioned dispatch there. I know that was a Big deal for you this year. But uh while while we have you on the podcast and I think we do have you b basically on once a year now, I'd love to hear about what else you you played this year, what else you've been enjoying.

Jay
09:03
Really enjoyed Expedition 33. I'm sure if you're in if you're listening to games podcasts, you've heard people talk about this game. So there's not much I can add to it. It's really cool that we're getting that we've kind of looped back in such a way that Now people are aspiring to make the last remnant likes. People are trying to make games that resemble things that flopped on the Xbox 360. I think that's one of the we talked about that previously, you know, that whole HD era like f era of flop Japanese games that kind of came out in a time when no one wanted games like that. Maybe it's time for the last remnant remake, uh Blue Dragoon, is that a game? That's the name of a game, right?

Samuel
09:41
I think you're confusing legend Legend of Dragoon and Blue Dragon there.

Jay
09:48
No, yeah, it was awesome game There really is this sense and you can kind of feel it everywhere that people want these kind of, you know, narrative-driven experiences that just tell your story and You can sit in front of your TV for eight to twenty hours and you're you're done and it's presented great and it has great music. That's kind of how dispatch felt. It's a weird through line of expedition thirty-three to dispatch, you know Here's a game that is effectively a light management sim wedged between an animated n series that feels like it was pitched to Amazon Prime or something. And it somehow really worked and was really enjoyable. Really enjoyed blueprints. Kind of a Nepo pick because we share a publisher. But um no, it's a That was a real treat of a game that really felt haunted. I like games that feel like haunted nineties CD-ROM games. Um that had that feeling of it. And then Samuel, of course. Uh we've been playing this a bit um as of late. Uh Elden Ring Night Rain. I don't know if you've talked about this on your podcast.

Samuel
10:51
Ugh Only a little bit. Thing is, Matthew doesn't really dabble with multiplayer games, so I feel it feels like a microaggression every time I bring one up.

Matthew
10:57
I'm still I'm interested.

Samuel
10:59
I'm interested. I've got curiosity. I th like rematch, I talked about loads on the podcast, but I always feel like so with Arcraders Ashley when we had Phil on last week and we talked about Arcraders a bit. I felt a bit I feel like those guys who I play Arcraders with lead me lead me around the entire game. And so I'm a slight fraud even talking about it with any kind of authority, because I'm just sort of along for the ride and they're like, yep, we go to this place now, we scan this, and we look for this. And we go here, and while we're here in the dam area, we go here, and I'm like I feel like I'm just sort of a a bit of a sidekick in this kind of ongoing adventure. And I felt that way playing Elden Ring Night Rain too, where you basically see the game as like matrix code because the first thing you do when you land in the map is you sprint and you're like it's not the pace of what I think of or Matthew probably thinks of as the pace of a From Software game at all. It's like fucking go. No, we don't kill any of these regular enemies. We're all go we're going to kill this one enemy in this underground tunnel because he can give us this one thing. And then we'll sprint to another highly specific enemy at this point. We run to this church, we steal this thing. Don't bother fighting the guys in the church though, because we don't need to do that. And it's all about like optimization. And per precision time management. And so a big part of playing that with you for me was like adjusting to your precise way of playing it as a veteran of it. It's been really fun though. Like um when you took me to that optional dungeon deep down in the like the like the fiery part of the map. Yeah. That was really cool. Like it was like a they're kind of like these these bite-sized bits of from software games. But the whole game has the feel of like a like a ROM hack. I don't know if you want to pick up from there.

Jay
12:37
I almost feel like I've done you dirty with this game because So I played this with a friend of mine and then my wife and the three of us just I put 61 hours into this game this year according to Steam. And I'm not someone who plays multiplayer games at all But we really hammered hard. I think it's almost like the game is about learning what is going on in the game. So you missed the first fifteen hours of me and my friends flailing around not knowing what to do. And it's only after you kind of get really into it, maybe read a couple of Reddit posts, that you start to get that like you know, the optimization of it. It it's this like edge of tomorrow, optimize the one day you have thing going on. It has the yeah the frantic nature of being like a fry chef with a sword. It's really chaotic. It does have that Romhack feel in a way that's slightly endearing. It's got that Gary's mod feel of like These you're f at some point you're finding bosses that are ripped out of Dark Souls 2, which doesn't really fit with the lore in any coherent way, but it's kind of like, oh, it's that guy from that game. You're fighting this guy from the DLC of Dark Souls Three. But it's cool because you and your friends are running around with swords and it's got that kind of loop of getting loot, you know, get the rare drops, you know, it activates your neurons in your brain, that Bellatro thing. of like these things chaining. Inexplicably really good fun. I didn't expect much of this when I bought it. It struck me as a play three times then then ditch it. And I'm hooked. There's a DLC coming out for it in a few days. Absolutely gonna get on that. It's probably this is probably one of the most fun times I've had playing a cooperative game, maybe ever.

Samuel
14:14
Yeah, I'd like to play more more of it with you before the end of the year because we kill That first boss and by we I mean I think I just was a vague distraction and then I healed in the background and then you just did all the work killing the big Cerberus thing. Yeah, I was I was enjoying it. When I did eventually understand why you were playing it the way you were. I did get into it and I think it is actually the most playful from software game I've played for sure. It's them having fun and the the law ramifications of it, like you say, they haven't really thought about in loads of detail because I've just prioritised the experience of having a fun uh co- playing a fun co-op game. And it's it's great. Like the the fact there's like no no real kind of like fall damage and that kind of stuff. It just means that Every journey across the map feels like you're playing it's like this weird fortnight prism through which to experience a From Software game and it's um and it works surprisingly well, so Yeah, I can see why it's appealing. It will not be in my top ten game of the year list. I just haven't played enough of it to to really say. Yeah, it has has certainly been enjoyable.

Jay
15:15
You could say like The way it takes the assets of like a prestige high fantasy game and then turns it into something kind of like completely way off base makes it somewhat of like a spiritual brother to Lynx crossbow training. It's like the is that the only thing where you take something ca kind of prestige and you turn it into some nuts arcade experience. Thanks for putting it in language I understand.

Samuel
15:38
We've had Lynx Crossbow Trading and The Last Remnant come up already on this podcast. So it's uh it's it's good to have you back, Jay, really. That's what we depend on you for, really. Okay, so yes, this this uh this episode is all about the Metroid series. So Matthew's been building up to this for Uh basically the entire year, right Matthew? You you've been building up to play every single game in the background.

Matthew
16:00
Yeah, I I well I played some of them so long ago that when I was making my notes for this episode I realized that I'd forgotten most of them, so it was actually completely redundant. Like I may as well not have played some of these games because I was like, uh what happened in Zero Mission? So uh yeah, let's see how that goes.

Samuel
16:16
Yeah, and Jay, you are someone who has thought about this genre a lot. I feel like I've talked about Metroidvania's on the indie side with you a few times and um the the kind of what it takes to to stand out and that sort of thing. So the Metroid series in general, like a one of the first things I saw you create and put on the internet actually was basically like a concept for a Metroid turn-based tactics game, which I think we actually just I think we actually discussed that GIF before on this set on one of these episodes. But um Metroid I assume is a series that's near and dear to your heart.

Jay
16:46
I've always been a big Nintendo head at heart And Metroid for me is kind of like the underdog series that I kind of pride myself in like fighting for, if that makes sense. Like you don't need to go to bat for Zelda. Zelda's always gonna be doing fine. But um I'm like, oh I have to buy the steel case for the 3DS Metroid 2 remake, because they might not make another one of these if I don't. I've no I I've always had a real soft spot for Metroid. My first Metroid game was Metroid Prime That was one of the first games I remember being like, this is like a grown-up game that I was getting excited for coming out and then playing it and then just the kind of experience of that is like very near and dear to my heart. And yeah, I've always enjoyed what Metroid represents. I think it's a fun one to talk about because You know, going back to the talking about Silksong, I would go as far as to say they don't know what to do with Metroid. But then at the same time the genre is clearly popular enough that like like Hollow Knight is a more successful Metroid game than Nintendo have ever made, which is kind of wacky to think about. But at the same time if you look at what Metroid is and what it isn't, and then you look at what Nintendo does well and what Nintendo have kind of become known for doing well and kind of perfected, especially in recent years from like a marketing point of view. It's in a weird position. It's almost like it's too successful to kind of get put in the doshin the giant custom RoboBox and just never appear again. But i I don't think it n Nintendo is in a position to f figure out how exactly to make it as big as a success as I think like its fans want it to be, if that makes sense. I think it's It's kind of too westernized for the Japanese audience, but then you can't push it too far, you know, if you try and go fully halo with it, then you kind of have issues. I think it's kind of a fascinating brand to discuss, as cynical as it is to say. But at the same time the games are really, really good.

Samuel
18:38
Yeah, and there there just aren't that many of them. I think there's eleven mainline entries.

Jay
18:43
I yeah, I d I've got written down as well. I think this is the only Nintendo franchise you can effectively complete using broadly modern hardware. I'm pretty sure if you just have a Switch A 3DS if you want to go for the one 3DS remake and then like a Wii slash Wii U, you basically can play the entire series.

Samuel
19:02
Well that last one's a big ask these days. So that's uh it's uh it was it was very, very slick until you said the word we you and then I thought, okay, well, it's relatively accessible. There are none that are like truly lost to time, which is um Which is fortunate. Matthew, I suppose it's probably worth establishing your relationship with Metro before we get into this because You know, w like we talked about, you have been playing these games through again, but I'd love to hear about how you started with with this series in general. Did you encounter it on the snares or was this something that happened for you with Metro Prime as well?

Matthew
19:33
Yeah. Mm Metroid Prime definitely and I think actually my first encounter with the the Metroid universe is Smash Brothers. Mm-hmm. Same. And Samus being unbelievably cool in those games. Like I I always loved that character and a sort of had to reverse engineer what I thought the Metroid games were from the strange like levels and power-ups and moves in Smash Bros. and Smash Brothers and you know N sixty four and GameCube. kinda happens in the time when Metroid to traditional two D Metroid is isn't happening as much, I guess. it fills in the gaps and I will say it's not in my top five Metroid experiences, but I did ponder it. I thought, uh, c i it could be in there 'cause it's a great representation of that character, arguably m like more playable and fun than than some of the versions in standalone Metroid games. But yeah, m Metroid Prime was the one and yeah I came to the 2D games a fair bit later. But ha you know, have gone back and and yeah, played some of them for the first time and replayed some of them and kinda wish I had been there along the way. You know, I think some of these things I think Super Metroid would have been unbelievably good to have discovered back in the day. Based on how strong I think it is now, you know, I think it it to be able to experience some of those kind of cutting-edge ideas would have been absolutely wild, but Oh we were idiot children and we just had the games we had.

Samuel
21:02
The funny thing is, I I uh this is like a completely ups unsubstantiated belief, but I'm convinced that the Metroid series, the 2D ones, are some of the most emulated games ever. Right. I can believe that. Because it's a modest selling series, generally speaking, definitely in the UK. I think there were some numbers recently about how in the UK it's only ever sold X amount and the the number was surprisingly low um to people. I think that was like a Chris Dring thing that was doing the rounds about a year ago. And yeah, these get are games that if you put them on a little screen on a on an emulation handheld or even blow them up on your monitor. They are handsome games, whether it's Super Metroid or the two GBA ones. They're just they look absolutely amazing. So I think a lot of people have discovered these. in retrospect, using save states, which transforms the experience to some degree, that kind of thing, or playing them on virtual console. I do honestly think it's a it's a big after the fact series for a lot of people, and I imagine that Super Smash Bros probably did. Trojan horse Samus into like a whole uh new generation of players.

Matthew
22:09
So similar to Earthbound, I guess.

Samuel
22:11
Yeah, for sure. I think that did help for sure. And then Yes, I mean, you know, Metro Prime, hugely successful when it launched as well. I mean in terms of like critical reception and as well as a GameCube game could sell, it it did very, very well. You know, that definitely kind of reestablished it maybe for more kind of like millennial players. I suppose like a little bit of background on the series then. Matthew linked me to two Nintendo interviews that were official interviews that were conducted around the NES Classic and the SNES Classic um on Metroid and Super Metroid um respectively. They weren't actually massively comprehensive. Well that's okay. They are they were useful starting points, but They just didn't they didn't shed loads of light on the creation of the games, but like um I mean uh basically the creation of Metro started out was What can't Mario do and therefore what should we make a game around Mario doing? Yeah. And then kind of like came together it sounded like a A lot of it sort of ha has to be happened in the final three months of development.

Matthew
23:08
I think what's interesting about the original Metroid is that for quite a long time it was maybe hard to pin down who actually had made it. Or you know i it doesn't have a clean creator. It's a series we associate with a Nintendo producer um called Yoshio Sakamoto who directed Super Metroid and has basically produced the series since then. He was definitely involved, but in that like final stretch, it seems to be the idea that it's a couple of brand new directors in Nintendo RD1 Which is kind of like the weirdo Nintendo department under Gun Pai Yoko. So it's not the Mario team, it's not Miyamoto and that lot. This is like the Wario team. Think of them as the Wario team. And uh y yeah, he sets these guys to yeah, make a new game, make a a a science fiction game. I've seen Sakamoto say in interviews They just wanted to make something set on a gloopy planet, which is a pretty broad remit for a game. It sounds like they don't get particularly far, they just design this incredibly complicated action mascot. So you have to start pairing it back. But I do th I I do think it's interesting in Metroid on the NES is this idea that it starts off as something that is like actively complicated and is sort of in love with the idea of a vast moveset and an evolving power set and it isn't about stripping something back to its sort of elegant core, which it seems to be the defining design principle of like everything you hear about in it like any Miyamoto interview. It's always this sort of like You know, uh form follows function. We're here they're just like, make something fucking cool and make sure it does loads of weird shit and I think that's the R<unk>D one difference. And I think that strand does run through all Metroid. I th you know I think it is still distinctly un Nintendo in how, say, complicated the controls are. and just how much they cram onto the pad. You think if Miyamoto made this game, that just wouldn't be allowed to happen?

Samuel
25:22
Yeah that is definitely the interesting thing about it. Like uh I I was actually quite surprised to read the interview and learn the idea that Sakamoto only got involved in those last three months and be like, oh, you know, it's widely held that you are the creator of this, yet this existed in some other form for like What sounded like about nine ten months before that. Yeah. And that itself is interesting. But then there's also after this is a you know, it's what Metroid 2 is a Game Boy game. The critical reception is slightly cooler. There's a lot of like weird, interesting attempts to do Nintendo games on Game Boy like Super Mario Land where Link's Awakening is obviously like the best example of doing that, but transferring the mechanics of a NES game basically onto the Game Boy and trying to make it work visually. I think Metroid 2 does that like pretty well, but it's it's not necessarily like a a beloved game, Metroid 2. And then um Super Metroid is beloved and the sort of like creative intent behind that is to make a much more cinematic experience and development takes a lot longer, it's a two and a half year Project, there's a lot more they can do with sound and and that kind of thing, but yet there were still lessons they were learning as they went, like basically because of how complex the art was, they were and and the programming was. they couldn't keep implementing features up until the last minute, like which which is what it sounded like they were doing with the original Metroid because, you know, the scale of development was changing as they went. And then there's like a hiatus where there's no N64 game and basically Sakamoto, I th I think like ponders an N64 game but decides that he's not the person to make it. And then, you know, through reasons that are discussed in the um the Metroid Prime XL episode we did early this year, but at the behest of Miyamoto ends up in the hands of Retro Studios in Texas. Metroid sort of gets put on them basically. And then it feels like Metroid has never really had uh it it's been owned by Sakamoto as a producer, but not really owned by a studio in the way that different Nintendo series are owned by those those studios, Matthew? Is that the rough arc of it?

Matthew
27:18
I'd say Sakamoto always seems to hold Metroid Prime at an arm's length. Like he he doesn't seem as involved in it. Like o often the pr the producer on that isn't him, it's a guy called Tanabe who's like the the sort of Nintendo's guy for external third party studios. Uh he turns up in a lot of the interviews anyway and Sakamoto it It it feels like if you ever see him ask the question about Metroid Prime like lore or story, he says, that's nothing to do with me. I didn't I didn't really come up with that. I think he's working on this core storyline, which is his chronology, which has Metroid 2, Metroid Super Metroid. fusion and dread uh and that's like his bit of it. So I think it really does split at that point into kind of like two sort of subseries.

Samuel
28:09
It's just uh a very interesting history because it's its trajectory has been very unpredictable in the last fifteen years, I'd I would say. Like it's that you know they're or even longer than that really more like twenty-five years. It just like I couldn't tell you what w what will happen with Metroid next, but I could probably hazard a guess at what form Mario or Zelda will take next. Like will there be a dread sequel? I don't know. Metroid Prime 4 is releasing this week. That's you know why we're recording this episode. Will there be another one of those? I don't know. You know, it's had it's had spin-offs, uh like the odd spin-off that's slightly confusing. It's actually like quite a hard series to pin down. You know, will there be another one or not? It's not completely certain. It's just interesting in that respect that it you know it's it's had like a a really up and down history and yeah like you say sort of bisex into these two different interpretations of the same thing. Jay, I wondered if there's anything you want to observe from what's happened to Metroid over its history.

Jay
29:09
M Metroid's a fun one to talk about, especially when you go back to the origins of like where it came from and 'Cause obviously there was so much lightning fast exploration of what can be done in the console space in that like, you know, mid to late 80s like uh Famicom development period I'd I'd argue to an extent that like Zelda, Metroid, and Kidikarus kind of all represent different strands of the same kind of game design logic. Metroid is in many ways like a side-scrolling take on Zelda before Zelda then goes back and does a side-scrolling version of itself in Zelda 2. When you look at these development histories, I think Nintendo liked to discuss the games in an abstract as if they were the only ones developing g those games in that space and they will reference things like Mario and things or like, you know, you'll hear me and Moto talk about like, oh I got inspired by like going caving and you know, exploring fields. And never like, oh, we these are like Zelda is based on Tower of Druaga and Hydlide, which came out like a year before. And it like and are extremely similar. But then they took some, you know, visual influence from Legend by Ridley Scott. But even then games like that were all kind of pulling from games like Wizardry. You know, it's almost like these like these early experiences kind of came into the kind of Japanese development space and were so influential there was attempts to kind of see how you emulate just various aspects of them on like a console space in the arcade space. And Metroid is fun because Metroid I think is thematically and I'm saying this as someone who is a big fan of, you know, all these all these games and all these franchises, but Metroid I think is uniquely like unoriginal. Um so um there's a great article by Kate Willard on a critical hit. com talking about the various kind of influences. 'Cause when you talk about the influences on Metroid, people will go, Okay, it's like Alien, you know, it's kind of Ridley's named after Ridley Scott, you know, the female heroine And then there's m more kind of direct parallels like the game Baraduke, which came out a year before, which features a woman in a power suit with a laser cannon fighting gloopy aliens in caves, who then reveals she's a woman at the end by taking off her helmet. There's a lot of these kind of unr these kind of ideas pulled from stuff that was being made in that space. And I think that's like fun. And I think it's fun to see how these games kind of came from such okay, we'll copy these tropes and put them in our own spin, but then 20, 30 years down the line they've kind of evolved into their own identities. Regarding like what the identity of Metroid is today, I do have this feeling that Metroids stuck in a way where I think of a great example of a g like a game that managed to break out of what it was break out of that Doshin the Giant Peril. Uh it was like when Fire Emblem put out Fire Emblem Awakening and was like, right. It's kind of a reimagining and a rethinking of what th this franchise could be and give it a new visual identity and a new focus and character. And then Nintendo is so good at character stuff now Almost feels like Nintendo is broadly now like a character IP multimedia company with games at the forefront, but you know they're you know, exploring T V and film, you know, an increasing rate now. And they managed to do pull that off successfully with, you know, Fire Emblem I think is a great example. Um but I don't think they've had that Fire Emblem Awakening moment with Metroid. Metroid Dread, I think I'm pretty confident is the most successful in terms of sales numbers, uh Metroid game. I think that succeeded because I think there is so much goodwill floating around Just the general Switch platform at the time and you know metr you know, a whole new generation of players would have seen Samus for the first time and Smash Bros. Ultimate. That there was just like, hey, this is like a very classic style Metroid experience. It was like the selling point was, hey, this is not unique. This is a reinvention of something that's like come before. And you kind of see that again, I feel like that's what Metroid Prime 4 is going for. It's hey, the selling point for this is it's just like those ones 20 years ago. But you haven't seen anything like that for a while. Here's a new one. Rather than an attempt to kind of like reimagine from the core what this could be. And I can see the hesitancy because they tried that with other M to an extent. and you can see why they would try that, but you can also see where it maybe didn't work. And also I guess like the identity of Metroid is about like, hey, go in a cave and don't talk to anyone for three hours and fight like glo the gloopiest aliens you've ever seen. Um, it doesn't lend itself well. It's almost like hostile to the idea of expanding the characterization of it.

Matthew
33:39
It is interesting though that you put it in those terms and you frame it in terms of Nintendo becoming like masters of IP over the last ten years. Because arguably before that, Sakamoto has has been one of the very rare Nintendo developers who I think is willing to talk about outside inspirations and aspirations to be a cinematic storyteller and to think about games in terms of story. I know i in my head I always sort of file him away as like As like the anti-Myamoto who is just like, you know, don't even think about Zelda having his story, who gives a fuck? We make it up at the end. Don't even bother. where he's doing GC GDC talks on how he was inspired by like Dario Argento films. Um the problem is, is it like manifests in these quite weird games which are not successful storytelling exercises, mainly other M, that GDC thing was was in the build-up to that where you had one year him saying you know, I'm working on this new Metroid and everything I know about tension I learned from Susperia and and then like a year later it's this incredibly monotone, unpleasant version of Samus sort of droning on about her strange motherly feelings for this alien that got blasted to pieces and You're like, oh, this isn't how I thought this story was gonna end. You know, I was quite excited about a a Nintendo developer who actually admitted to having a life outside of Nintendo, but then it seems other people don't talk about their games in that way. but are maybe quietly become better at doing character and story and and and developing those things.

Jay
35:21
So you can you can see why they would go for the other M approach. It's like the it makes complete sense. I it almost just feels like the problem was that it wasn't very good, but it was like super sound in like theory. I think it's interesting actually as well. I'd Uh as a you know, Nintendo lore sicko. Um Metroid is the only I'd say it is the only franchise that has a continuity and a s like a single continuity that is actually kind of paid attention to. Like there is a strict chronology that explains who Ridley is at every point and why like how he's come back to life at every point. They make there's like a there's like they go out their way to explain why Ridley is not dead at this point in the timeline. Um at various points, since the only Nintendo franchise that even remotely cares about things like that. Zelda is like it's almost like Zelda's reinvention was about completely doing away with the concept of continuity even between games like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. Kind of part of the appeal to me for Metroid Dread was like it was almost like a here's an epilogue for the story that didn't really exist but that kind of retroactively fit across like thirty five years of games.

Samuel
36:35
The execution is bad in other rem. It's also very of its time, I think. And so that is a kind of like low point. I you know, the the reason I actually wanted you on, Jay, is I remember you telling me about the Baraduke thing on like a uh may maybe like a year or two ago when you were playing games and you were like Did you know there's this thing that really resembles Metroid that comes out one year before Metroid? And no one ever talks about it, which is it's interesting because like Matthew says, like he'll talk about Dario Argento Sakamoto, but he won't, you know, he doesn't mention as far as I know, he doesn't talk about Baraduke as an influence. And so you know, it is interesting to kind of note that side of things. In terms of where it's ended up I actually do think it's got like the two strands of Metroid still have a lot of creative potential in them, but it's all about what can you do with those two established um formulas. And based on the critical reception to Metro Prime 4 today that we've seen, like the embargo just lifted as we're recording this, people seem mixed on how it's ended up. Um but I personally feel like the the Metroid dread approach has a a lot of life left in it because the one thing that game does that other you know, the indie Metroidvania's cannot do is they spend they can spend mega bucks on the graphics and do the thing where the camera pulls in on Samus and makes it look uh you know kind of like highlights the fact that it is 3D for cinematic effect in certain moments and and that that has like a that can have a really strong impact on it even if the underlying formula of how the map is designed is you know, is is traditional Metroid really. Like that mix of old and new uh works really well together, not to mention her moveset. Feeling kind of like a more like a contemporary action game than something like Super Metroid does. It's interesting though, 'cause if you if you go back and read this th

Matthew
38:19
I'd say of all the Metroid games, and I know I put a huge amount of weight on old developer interviews, which I probably shouldn't do, but Super Metroid, there is quite a lot of material out there about it, and you do hear them talk about it in terms of like, this is the cutting edge. You know, like we are making something here which no one else has made the time we've put into it, how complex the map is, how complex this character is the way the game looks, the way it sounds, it's storytelling, this is like an almost like a next gen Nintendo game in the way we're thinking about it. And to me, Dread sort of was that on Switch as well. Like it's you know, arguably one of the most like luxurious Nintendo productions ever, and today the main positive I've taken from the few Metroid Prime 4 reviews is that it looks like a million bucks. It's really, really nice looking. And you know, they've they've really kind of punched up that. And I'm not saying that's enough of an identity for a game. Like obviously there's a lot of other stuff going on in it, but it did interest me to ha to feel an echo of that s that super Metroid sort of tech obsession in what I, you know, liked about Dread.

Samuel
39:29
Yeah, and I I guess that also rings true for Metroid Prime as well, right? Like how good the Samus suit that looks like the reflections on it. Like it it does look you know like a a million bucks. Not all of the animations on the enemies do necessarily, but some of the environments and yeah, Samus herself Just uh there are just like uh flashes of wow, this looks better than anything you can do on Xbox or PS2 at the time. So yeah, I mean I don't necessarily disagree, Matthew. I suppose that's like the weird thing about Metro Prime 4 coming along and being a Switch game that is also a Switch 2 game is that you can see the Switch bones underneath it and you almost wonder what would happen if you just went Weapons 3 on making this a Switch 2 only game, but that's what happens when you announce a game eight years ago and then kinda have to release it eight years hence, I guess. Okay, so I I would like to talk about if there is an argument long term that this has ended up being ended up being the most influential Nintendo series. because many games it's directly inspired have gone on to be enormously successful. Exceeding Metroid many times over in terms of sales success. Um I think that's true in blockbuster games as well as indies. You know, there are whether it's Hollow Knight or Dark Souls. The the sort of DNA of what Metroid is is seped into so many different games, or even like the Batman Arkham games. Whether you think some of those comparisons are like tenuous or not, you know the the the genre is called Metroidvania And uh it's you know, obviously it's it's its DNA is really kinda carried down. But Jay, I was wondering what you made of that.

Jay
41:02
I I as I said before, I think there's kind of a nebulous blob of design direction that comes from the Zelda Metroid kind of amorphous sphere. I think there's so much cross-influence across Nintendo's own games. It's almost like there's a quintessential Nintendo game archetype and Metroid is like one incarnation of that. But I see as much Metroid in, you know, games like Hollow Knight and stuff as I see like Mario and Zelda in those games. It it feels like yeah, everything kinda pulls from the primordial soup. that Metroid is a part of. I don't know if that's a boring hack answer there, but um I can see what you mean.

Samuel
41:43
Well, I w I wonder if maybe that once Super Metroid comes along that like codifies that, you know, the genre belongs to it in some way. In in like a more pronounced way than maybe it seems on the NES where like you say there are similar games in that vein.

Jay
41:58
Yeah, and I can think I think Matthew's point about it being this lush production. I think that kind of focus on atmosphere I think goes beyond anything certainly that like you know games like Zelda were doing at the time as well. And even Zelda games like Zelda do now, I think you can draw strands okay, look at like Elden Ring and draw the strands of like, you know, strong atmospheric presence and like light on character and story. Then you can also draw certain elements through from Zelda. Obviously the Metroidvania kind of indie genre is huge I'm curious to see long-term witch games in that kind of canon of indie Metroidvania stick around beyond Hollow Knight. I know Axion Verge was popular for a minute, but it's not one that I see people talk about now. I think there's an uh there's an understanding that this is like a popular indie genre. But I I can't it's hard to tell in the moment as we are right now, like how influential those will go. Which things people will draw around. We're already seeing games that are kind of like Hollow Knight likes at this point now. Just because I I mean I feel like the identity of Hollow Knight y when I was talking before about it's h it's a challenge to kind of ascribe character and identity to Metroid Hollow Knight was, I feel, successful in part because it managed to do that. It kind of kept that atmosphere, but then had this game rich full of these kind of enigmatic and strange and interesting NPCs while still making you feel very lost in this world. Um and I think that's something that Met Metroid's tried to do at various points and never really pulled off. So I feel like that's the challenge that, you know, the successful games have move beyond the successful Metroidvania's have managed to take and kind of move on. The Prince of Persia lost crown was it? The Metroidvania one? Yep. Yeah, that was a good example again of like, hey We've got that Metroid formula, but then we've got like the sense of characterization and a strong sense of character design, but also that kind of fluidity of combat and stuff that was maybe even a step beyond Dread. Yeah, I love that game. You can s you can definitely see those kind of strands of influence across stuff. If it's the most influential of them, I think it's I think they're all kind of bleeding into one another and I think people are taking You know, elements across all of them.

Matthew
44:03
I would definitely agree with that. I you know, when you talk about Metroid's influence, I think the fact that there is quite a lot of turmoil internally within Metroid. Like, you know, not not just you know, you've got Metroid Prime which stands for something, and then you've got the the 2D Metroids, but even in the 2D Metroids you have Sakamoto flip-flopping between I think people need uh uh their hands held and I'm gonna have a computer that tells you where to go every step of the way. A la fusion. But then three years later, you know, he does Metroid uh Zero Mission, a remake of Metroid, because he also acknowledges that Metroid Fusion didn't really do it for our, you know, original Metroid and Super Metroid fans and that exploration is a key thing and I I tend to map all the Metroids on a s a spectrum of like freedom at one end and sort of cinematic control at the other. And just because they can fall in so many different places on that line, when you then think about like, well, what what do you take as inspiration here? You know the Metroid you play could inspire, you know, a very different game based uh you know, if you if you played Super or Fusion or even Dreadnow and You know, I you know, I see dread certainly in its difficulty in like the boss fights. I think that's much closer to Hollow Knight uh in terms of difficulty. and the idea of these fights that really have to be mastered and this incredibly n nimble character who very fairly like behaves in your hands like you always know exactly what she's gonna do and but it really expects you to sort of take that character and and sort of, you know, weave it like a needle through these like insane attacks coming at her and You know, I don't think I'm the only one who was like, crike it. I mean I think Metroid is like the hardest Nintendo series by far. And that in itself is weird. You know that at a time where it feels like underpinning every Nintendo game is a sense that you have to be able to get to the end and you're gonna get to the end one way or another, and I just don't think that's true true of Metroid. So it itself is now absorbing from the next generation. It makes me really excited for the next one because God knows what it's gonna be.

Jay
46:18
I'm gonna make the first Indie Metroid Other M like.

Samuel
46:28
Well the f the funny thing is I think that You know, like the I I wonder if like the peak of the sort of like indie Metro Vanius happened somewhere between the PS Vita's lifespan and the first couple of years of the Nintendo Switch, because You did have things like Hollow Knight and Axiom Verge, Blasphemous, Dead Cells, quite a lot of games in that vein. And you know, Jay, you're right. Like if you argue that something like Nine Souls that came out last year is a Metroidvania, it's also like a Souls like. And, you know, it's also all these other things in terms of its visual influences. And so actually being able to like track its DNA back to Metroid, it becomes a lot more, yeah, amorphous maybe than it. than it once was, whereas the early attempts to make indie Metroidvanious felt a bit closer to the things that directly inspired them. So yeah, that has definitely changed over the years.

Jay
47:22
I think if the if the bosses are quite easy then it's a Metroid-like and if they're really hard and you have to run for thirty seconds to get back to them, it's the Souls like The final boss of Metroid Dread is the most insane thing I think Nintendo have ever released in their commercial product. It's great, it's great, don't get me wrong. I didn't find Metroid Dread that hard apart from trying to counter the counter the Emmy.

Samuel
47:49
Countering the Emmys is like the hardest the hardest that game ever got for me. Like uh I didn't struggle too much with the bosses, but I did love that game. And uh yeah, I'm sure we'll talk about it. Well, that's if it makes it it's made either of your top five, and sure it has, but we'll see. Yeah, so Matthew, I I did want to ask if you have any like broader thoughts on Metroid to discuss here. I feel like you thought about this a lot and before we move on to the actual top fives, and if there's an anything broader You wanted to sort of like throw in here that from either from your research or in thinking about this. I like your whole line from cinematic Yeah, sort of like yeah, to the to the freedom side of things.

Matthew
48:24
Yeah, I I I the only place that falls down is in Super Metroid, which is arguably the m the most freedom you ever get in a Metroid game and probably has the most powerful cinematic moments in it. It's it's that's a that's a real oddity. I mean it's a it's an absolute masterpiece for that reason. One thing that jumped out to me from playing these quite a lot of them in quick succession was given that they're all built from the same building blocks in terms of powers I do quite like how the order the powers unlock and the order they give them to you can change the flavour of the game. Like that's that's almost like the the the one major lever they have. to kinda control the tone of the game. If they give you the morph ball super early, you might have a lot more kind of exploration and weird kind of little cracks that you're going into. Whereas in Dread, like, they hold off on the morph ball for quite a while and as a result it feels like that game introduces Samus as this character who goes at great speed and is sort of flinging herself around and it wants you to like learn this slide under gaps and I i ev every time I I booted one of these up, the first five or so powers, I was just like, even though the m the Samus at the end of these games is kind of always the same, and basically at the end of these games you're just screw attacking everywhere. That's all I ha that is like the final act of these games is you can just jump anywhere and you will basically never see her standing ever again. It's quite a quite a a weird sort of quirk of them. But The first hours of them, in my head, were all the sort of same sort of thing, but they they really aren't. And that extends to Metroid Prime as well and But at the same time I I had a real sort of love for those powers. And there is something in the familiarity of like, oh good, I've got that power again, I know how this behaves. And I I love the morph ball. I think the morph ball is is just such a winning idea. And the idea that it has like its own small upgrade path and it can let you do these uh the kind of puzzles for that are uh, you know, a a lot more kind of precision based and sort of weird, sort of trying to sort of bomb yourself up into strange holes and they can kinda take you into the walls and that that's uh that like always tickles me. Even in like the worst Metroid, just the existence of those things was enough to make me feel like quite comfortable and happy. Cause I th I think the thing you definitely detect when you play them close together and the thing which seems to upset the sort of hardcore fans the most is when they let you off on a leash to just just go wherever. And when they are very clearly guiding you to places, you know, sometimes that's literally a computer room going Go to this sector, I've locked off all the other sectors, so you just can't go anywhere. Metroid Fusion is is very much that game, but like Metroid Dread. Even that, like, I'd say for the first couple of hours, it's it's like sneakily limited in that you get these powers and you're like, oh yeah, I'll go back to that place to test this out. Like oh I I remember there was a thing that needed the triple laser there, but you go back and you realise because you don't have the morph ball, they've like closed you in with like a little gap here and there and y you y you look on the map and you go, Well actually there are five routes here but they are all very clearly dead ends right now, so I am being forced down here and I I think that's what people don't like is you know, the illusion of freedom is isn't strong enough. Metroid Zero mission doesn't really have any guidance compared to to Metroid Fusion. Even though, you know, what you're doing is kinda the same and the first few powers are kinda the same. Yeah, they're superficially similar. Yeah, and it's uh but i it it's amazing how what a difference not having an objective navigator person uh popping up does. And and that you know, that seems true as well with what people have said about MetroPrime four, like everyone's so upset about this character who allegedly gives you a lot of guidance throughout the game and is constantly like radioing in has a bit of the Atreus or Ellie kind of PlayStation thing of saying, hey, don't you want to use your power bomb on that door over there? That kind of stuff. And you know, old m old Metroid definitely wouldn't have done that. So and the thing is, and as you see from my top five, I I quite like Both flavours. Like I actually don't mind Sakamoto doing his weird I've got like a little sci-fi story that I want to tell you.

Jay
52:49
And you know No, totally.

Matthew
52:51
It it has some strengths, you know, like there there are some interesting things that can happen when you take away freedom to explore. So yeah, and and it's why I'm interested to see what What Jay's picked for his top five as well.

Samuel
53:03
Okay. Well so the last thing to discuss before we get into the um into the top five cent is Metroid Prime 4 is finally here after such a long wait. Not mixed response like positive with a little bit of a mixed response I guess is probably the best way to put it and you know the run up to launch was very much colored by discussion around a particular NPC character and the way in which information was relayed to the player as Matthew discussed there. Jay, I know you followed this quite closely. We were hoping to play Metro Prime 4 in time for this episode. It didn't work out for various um reasons, so we won't go into Um but, you know, you have followed this closely as someone invested in Metroid. What have you made of the whole thing?

Jay
53:41
You can see how it's come about, and you can see how it's come about in that this is a game that was I'm uh we are to believe that it was completely rebooted, right? Um it was originally developed with a Japanese studio with Namco Bamtai. Yeah. Then got rebooted, handed over to Retro Studios who presumably had to s to you know salvage some ideas from that. We don't know what made the original version go so drastically wrong that it had to be rebooted, but it is kind of interesting to think about. You know, I think it's quite rare for a Nintendo game to kind of publicly fail and get rebooted like that. Normally they're quite, you know, very behind closed doors on these things. But at the same time you have, you know, Sakamoto's influence My favorite r long running Nintendo aside thing has been Sakamoto's interested in the character Silux. We've gotta talk about Silux. No other Nintendo franchise has had like a long running build-up to a B-plot character like this with Metroid, with Silux this recurring NPC first appeared in 2006 and has now been appeared across several games, building up to something, which I have no doubt the next game will have to kind of glued together with whatever the plan is. So I'm expecting Silux to appear for like ten minutes and then whatever that aspect of the original plan is got sidelined. I can imagine this being a nature like a game that's as chaotic as its development is, you know? Mm. I'm excited for I I think again it will also be like a dread, like a hey, here's this thing that you've seen people rave about online for years. This is a new iteration of that and doesn't, you know Go nuts with it. I expect it to be a real throwback that maybe is again straddling the line between how much of that kind of halo epic sci-fi stuff can we throw in there versus the, you know, players' desire and the all the classic audience desire to kind of immerse themselves in this soundscape with this, you know, atmospheric environment. It's probably really hard to make a Metroid game. Or like make something that like hits that you know, this is probably really expensive to have developed, you know, especially jumping across different studios. So we can imagine that there's you know, this commercial pressure on okay, we need to have something that feels that hits that mainstream audience. What is the mainstream audience? Also doesn't have any of the original developers as far as I'm aware. So this is Retro Studios in name only to an extent. So it's essentially a fresh studio. taking on the legacy of this project that has now changed hands. But then it also has things that Sakamoto has been building up across other games that you have to kind of feed into this one project. It wouldn't surprise me if that is kind of felt in the game.

Samuel
56:20
Yeah, I mean I've only played ten minutes of it at DreamHack this past weekend in Sweden. But I will say that at the very least the core mechanics feel like the original Metro Prime does. And so maybe doing that The remaster did help them get in that headspace.

Jay
56:35
It looks like the most technically impressive Nintendo game ever made. It looks gorgeous.

Samuel
56:39
Yeah, very nice looking game. I I think that it's um it is Unusual to see Metroid trying to bend itself around things like scripted narrative. bits happening in the environment around you. Like this maybe it's quite hard to square what Metroid is with that, but I understand that the game switches tack from that quite quickly. So Maybe I what I was playing was um that game's version of Metro Prime's amazing opening when you go on a ship and then an explosion gets set off and then you have to escape very quickly and it doesn't really represent what the rest of Metro Prime is. So it's possible that that was the you know the the the bit of the game that I was up against there. But yeah, I do agree that I played met when we played Metro Prime, we talked about it. We discussed the idea that Where did its influences actually go? Like what uh do you know, with with two and three they do slightly different things with the uh with the formula, but it is almost like an evolutionary dead end of a first person adventure. And so we came to the conclusion that Batman Arkham Asylum Is that really? Oh, 100%. And then and then a developer and then a game developer, an unnamed game developer message me on LinkedIn to say literally the game developer, the creative director of Batman Archum Asylum said, let's make Metro Prime with Batman. I don't know how true that is, but that was something we heard on the grapevine and I could see that being the case. But even that You know, like the the core of uh you sort of see that influence in the next to your Arkham games, but the m but Arkham Asylum in particular. feels very much built with with that in mind.

Jay
58:16
Yeah well the first time I played the first Archemus I think it's the best one and I remember feeling like this feels like what any other studio would have done with Metroid. If they had to jump to three D. I mean to an extent, Other M also feels like it came from an alternate universe where you're making the first three D Metroid game as well. Um they feel like kind of weird alt-universe tangents of where do you take this formula? No, I can definitely see that for sure.

Samuel
58:41
Matthew, I really want to hear what you've made of these Metroid Prime 4 reviews. How's it been going for you over there?

Matthew
58:46
Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm obviously looking forward to playing it for myself and my and uh making my mind up. A lot of the criticisms sound like well they remind me of a lot of what is said about Metro Prime 3 nowadays in terms of like a uh people are quite dismissive of that for its characters and maybe like the bittiness of it and uh Interesting though that I'd I'd say of all the things that I replayed, that was the one which I I probably had the I was surprised by how much fun I had replaying Metro Prime 3. I came away thinking like, you know what, this is this has still got the stuff. Like, you know, when you're i in each of those areas, kind of like peeling them back like an onion with your new powers and you know, whirring up ancient machinery with power bombs. That is just good shit that I enjoy. And it sounds like all of that is in here too. And that the irritating people sound like they're gonna be the similar level to the rival bounty hunters in Metro Prime 3, so Uh yeah, I I don't know, I'm holding out hope. Maybe that's just me trying to cope with, you know, the idea of a three-star Metroid Prime, but You know, a as I was sort of hinting at earlier, even like in its worst moments, I I like that world, I like the aesthetic, I like the music, I like those powers enough. Like if I can power bomb some machines and like a room flips over or powers up and then unfolds into a slightly bigger kind of um morph ball maze. Th you know, I that's like a ten out of ten game for me, so that's all it needs to do to keep me happy this Christmas.

Samuel
01:00:26
Nice. Well there are two possible episodes where Metro Prime 4 can pop up before the end of the year. If it pops up in the what we've been playing and alternate game of the year award episodes. It's not made Matthews top ten. If it pops up in Game of the Year, obviously it has. So uh the stakes are high. Um you'll find out in three weeks, one way or another, um how that's gone. But in the meantime, let's take a quick break and we'll come back with Jay and Matthew's top five Metroid games. Welcome back to the podcast. So top five time, Matthew and Jay have both played enough Metro games to make top fives. I have Played more than five Metroid games, but not to completion. If you want a highly relatable Metroid experience, I will say that playing Metroid Zero Mission for about two or three hours, saving it, coming back to it two months later and trying to remember where the fuck to go and what you last did is like so hard that it does d validate Matthew's point about How um it is a game that is more dependent on the players figuring it out for themselves than giving you a guided hand. But that's happened to me, I would say I think three times now. Yes, I've played more than five Metroid games, but um I'm with two experts here, so I'm excited to hear their top fives. Jay, do you wanna kick off with your number five?

Jay
01:02:12
I was gonna say just as an aside, the real Metroid GBA game experience is to play it as originally intended, which is with no backlight and in the dark on a family car journey. Um to really kind of sell that kind of impenetrable atmosphere. My top five My top five pick, I've gone for Metroid Dread. Um my list is kind of a hot pick list, and I've also tried to not go with the obvious But I feel like Metroid Dread uh top five is is pretty respectable. To me, this is a great example of like what Nintendo's gotten really good at is like the reinvention title that is like, hey, this exists. You've seen this guy in Smash Bros. And you've seen them in the avatars of people on Twitter. Um this is what that game plays like. It's a deceitfully linear game. I think they've done a really clever job of making you feel like you're in a big maze, but actually at every point. They kind of lock you into certain segments of this map. Yeah. And it's makes you feel like you're lost, but actually you're never lost at any point. But again, you know, thinking about this being like how well will a y a modern Gen Alpha child negotiate with these big mazes. That's probably a smart thinking. You know, it looks great, we've already covered that. It kind of reinvents Samus's moveset as you know, this quasi-action fighter character s moveset. It's it's the most where you feel like Samus is also this kind of ninja figure as well as like a you know space marine. It's also kind of a fun attempt to, as I mentioned before again, retroactively create a narrative arc across all the games that didn't exist and then Make a conclusion to it. I feel like if this was the last Metroid game they ever made, and it could have been at that point, it wouldn't be so bad. It really has that final like this is the last Metroid game feel. They did a great job with it. I I they really nailed the marketing with the sense of like this is the horror one. You get chased by these Emmy robots that are big scary things to chase after you. To an extent I feel like that's really good smoke and mirrors. I feel when you're playing it, you know, Samus has a linear move speed You run at the speed that you run. You can't really get outran by these if you make these jumps in these segments. But you know, when it kind of builds up the tension and the animation of these things chasing after you maybe sells the idea that you're gonna get got. Um it makes it feel like it's closer than it is when you're getting chased by these big robots. Probably would have been lower down, uh higher up I guess on the list if it didn't have that, you know, lock into a linear space structure, but I can appreciate why it's there. Cool that this came out and did what it did when it did and I'm glad that they managed to put out a Metroid game that you know, was a side scroller and put it out for a full retail price and it's sold really well. It's this is the best selling Metroid game to date, I believe.

Samuel
01:05:08
I realised Matthew that I didn't get Jade to do the higher on my list thing that we do on every single list uh that's I you know I think that's okay.

Matthew
01:05:15
I c I can uh it is higher on my list, but I I can I can offer some some follow-up thoughts when we get to it.

Samuel
01:05:21
I will say as uh you know, the uh the sort of like as we were talking about the the kind of where the guided hand comes in and how linear these games are, this has almost the the most egregious kind of like go in this direction prompt um that it gives you really as a player where it's like uh some mysterious signal coming from over here. And it's fucking miles away, but the game's clearly direct directing you to your next objective. I do think that that is a kind of a you know, an expected modern touch and there are still ways in which you can get You know, there are there are still secret enough secrets to uncover in the map for it to feel like an authentic Metroid game, but um you know that it's a it's a quality of life thing and I can see why they did it.

Jay
01:06:01
Yeah, children are stupider than ever, you know.

Samuel
01:06:04
Well You know, this is a great Metroid game to discover if you are new to the series. It's uh I think it'll successfully make you curious about the past games to go back and see what they did well. you know, like uh I guess they trained Mercury Steam to do this with Metroid uh Samus Returns and then kind of like took a big swing at it and I really hope they get to make another one. I mean I I've read so read some dicey stuff about that studio in the last year. I think like sad Spanish people made this game, unfortunately, which is a shame. Could Nintendo not acquire the studio and just put Tanabe in charge? I mean that's really like um uh management simulation level thinking by me there, but I would love to see them just like build on what they did here because It seems like the appetite would be would be high for another Metro game in this vein. Yeah, I certainly loved it and just really respected the animation and action sort of chops of it. It just really stands up to any other game in that vein, really. Really, really impressive. Great seeing Sarah slide around in this game. Matthew, what's your number five? My number five is Metroid Fusion. Is that on your list, Jay? I have this higher on my list.

Matthew
01:07:11
Let's come back to it uh when we we get to Jay's li get to it on Jay's list.

Samuel
01:07:16
Jay, what's your number four

Jay
01:07:17
Cool. Uh I have zero mission at fall.

Matthew
01:07:20
Ah, so do I. K kind of what I was saying earlier how about how Sakamoto sort of described this not as the antidote to fusion, but you know, acknowledging that Fusion was uh yeah, limited and guided and he he just wanted to give people a chance to go wild and discover old school Metroid. I mean this is basically a remake of Metroid 1 using the Samus from Fusion, so all the good work that they did in streamlining the control scheme and keeping everything that's good about that character, you know, not jeopardizing it in any way. So getting to play a classic adventure reimagined in this way. There's a case that it's like one of the great great remakes of all time, I'd say, in terms of the original Metroid. It has some cute, interesting things, but I think is quite a tough hang these days. So getting to go there and hearing like the reworks of the classic music, seeing bosses which were quite crudely rendered on NES, given like these amazing Game Boy Advanced Sprite work. Just getting to sort of enjoy that adventure in a way which felt more palatable to the modern gamer, all that worked really well for me. I was thinking it was quite interesting that they added this epilogue to it where where you kind of explore this uh space pirate ship and it's kind of a proto dread that when the space pirates find you you have to like run away from them and hide. I don't think it's as like thought out or as fully realized as the Emmy stuff in in Dread. But I I do think it's interesting that Sakura clearly has in his head the idea of Samus being scared and having to run away from something is a is an idea he wants to explore. Like there is a bit of that infusion and I'm sure we'll get to that when when we talk about it um higher up Jay's list. But I thought it was more successfully navigated in Zero Mission. Like I quite like that that weird little kind of you know, forty minute adventure at the end of this or however long it was. This felt to me more like a modern sort of Super Metroid, you know, like it's almost a shame they haven't done Super Metroid in this style 'Cause I think that would probably be like one of the most amazing games ever. I thought it was a really great way of of making relevant, you know, a game which is part of this this like narrative continuation as as Jay said earlier. So, you know, it's quite smart to make sure the series exists in its entirety for that. like modern appetite.

Samuel
01:09:49
Yeah, um for sure. I mean a an extremely handsome game on that note as well. Um just one of the nicest looking sort of Pixlar games ever I think. And Excited to discover in that respect. Jay I'd I suppose like pick it up from there really. Like uh what is it that really clicks for you um about this one?

Jay
01:10:06
Yeah, I mean to an extent This is kind of a game that's had to be made at some point. The original is too kind of obtuse and difficult, but it's also kind of the Because this is the uniquely story driven franchise. It's kind of if you want a context for everything else, you need to be able to play this in some form. So it kind of made sense for them to do this at this time. Interesting, it's also one of the examples of Sakamoto, you know, wanting to inject more of that narrative through line across the games because it's a um Zero Mission adds something they kind of started doing a bit more with uh fusion which came out beforehand these kind of like storyboard cutscenes. So you have, you know, the to kind of flesh out the kind of world of the original Metroid, you have these kind of cutscenes w using kind of artwork of like Ridley and Craig and Ridley flying past just to kind of build up anticipation, just to kind of contextualize like, okay, this is why there's a dragon underground or whatever. And then down to using the kind of epilogue zero suit sequenced uh there's a seg segment here where you kind of stumble across like old ruins from when Samuz was a child and she lived on this planet and there's like flashback sequences to Sammaz being raised by birds as a child to kind of create this narrative arc that didn't really exist in the Nez one but now has to be kind of fit into the kind of new more narrative driven arc. And you know, interestingly that's something that Dread then kind of picks up on and closes a loop with years and years later. One of the most beautiful Pixel art games ever. Absolute masterwork. And then yeah, this is also where Smash Bros m mined that last fifteen minutes of extra game. for all the kind of Zero Suit Sammers stuff. All gets drawn from this one segment in this one game. So it's clearly had an impact. I think if you're a fan of modern Metroidvanies and went back and played this, you'd probably be surprised at how short this is. This is a game with essentially like four bosses. But you know, and this is a game one that you can play this on the Nintendo Switch online service, right? Um it's pretty accessible and probably still holds up really well. I think they kind of nailed to an extent this adding backstory and characterization for Samu's, but you know, you're not at a point where she's being voiced yet. There's a there's a nice balance they hit if they kinda hit here that I think they still kind of tap into in games, you know, like Dread down the line. Good stuff.

Samuel
01:12:44
So I think is it Matthew your number three? My number three is Metroid Dread

Matthew
01:12:49
So um a little bit higher than it was on Jay's list for quite a a basic bitch reason because I do I do accept s some of the uh negatives around this game in terms of like how uh deceptively Linear it actually is, or is it deceptively open? Whichever one. It's not open, but it looks like it is. But for me, I just love the Samus in it. I love the the feel of the character. I think it is the best realization of like the character you see. like in the box art, like striking an epic pose and all this shit flying at her. And you know, I I felt like one of the journeys you go through from like fusion forwards is them working out how to both simplify but also sex up some of her moves and like what extra things can she do and she starts like hanging from ledges and firing off at you know in in in Samus Returns you get like the three hundred and sixty degree arm cannon aiming and that opens up all kinds of potential in the boss fights and I I just thought this was like an even faster, even slicker version of that, you know, going back and replaying it over the last couple of days. I haven't played it all the way to the end, I'm sort of halfway through a playthrough. I'm just struck at like just how fast and graceful she is. Like she really feels like a futuristic bounty hunter and that is something I've, you know, enjoyed. Probably from like discovering that character first in Smash Brothers. and then constantly kind of like having, you know, versions of her which were a little bit more awkward in some ways and, you know, there are some very, very cumbersome control schemes in in her past. But uh This is the one where I was like, I completely bought it, you know, like I think they really got the melee counter that they had in Samus Returns. They really perfected it here. They just made the enemy behavior fit it better. It just she just looks amazing. They the uh like the varia suit in this the sort of white body with the the the orange kind of arm uh shoulder pads you know it's just a a fucking brilliant look I just love being her in this game to the point where I don't really mind that other stuff's going on. Because I think you eventually get to a point where you're clearing out the map and it it is pretty open. It feels pretty open. Like there's some crazy stuff it does with the speed booster, which is the power-up where you have to run a certain amount of time and then you sort of go into this ultra-fast mode which lets you punch through walls and then start launching yourself around and you begin to realize that in you know not just individual rooms but entire portions of the map are actually very convoluted run-ups for her to do these special jumps to get to power-ups and that stuff is it's in loads of the Metroids, but I I still love that trick. I think it's it's just so awesome to behold in this when she sort of flies up and the camera angle changes a little bit. Yeah, I love it.

Samuel
01:15:42
Yeah I I I there are definitely you know, sort of like secrets I left because I could see that the combination of things I had to do was just I I just exceeded my grasp. I was like, nah, actually that's actually I ha I have to walk away from this one. Some that I did have been somewhere I was like I just don't think I've got it in me to to 100% this game. Which, you know, that's kind of like a measure of uh you know, in some way I think that that says that they did get the difficulty of it right because I mean yes like navigating the map is linear, but once you do understand that map, it doesn't mean that it's a cakewalk to do all the things within that map, you know.

Matthew
01:16:23
Uh like one is all of these de games do quite a good job of hiding stuff to the degree where I think I've done like a really great completionist run. And then I get to the end and then it's like, you got 61%. I'm like, what the fuck? There was like another 39% of these. Uh you know, I c I I just had no idea what was going on. The other thing was, I do wonder what the purpose of those incredibly well-hidden power-ups are, because if you are at an ability level that you are able to get them. You don't need those pat you don't need what they actually give you. Where something I do like in the Metroid games in terms of their general difficulty balance is that especially when you get like an energy tank. In some of those boss fights you think, oh I actually you know, this is gonna make a big difference. Like I I feel suitably rewarded. The game is difficult enough that those rewards mean something to me as a character, where by the end it is just like It's like pure vanity in showing off to get a hundred percent. Like you do not need those extra 20 missiles where like a shit person in the final boss would need those 20 missiles, but They will never ever get them because they can't pull off those moons. So I I mean that's just I guess that's just like a bit of perverse logic at the heart of every Metroidvania. Like the worse you are, the more stuff you need and the w the less stuff you're gonna get.

Samuel
01:17:46
Yeah, in some ways I do like the idea of uh rewarding mastery with you being able to like turn the game into a cakewalk. Like there's just something there's something bold about about the intent behind that, I think.

Jay
01:17:57
I do wonder if like someone who's never played one of these games before

Matthew
01:18:01
Does just come into it, never finds anything. And it's just like, well, I've got five missiles and one health tank. You know, this sucks. I'm having a horrible time.

Samuel
01:18:10
That's definitely something I I felt the kind of pressure of more in Zero mission than the other Metro games I've played, but we had a terrible time in Zero Mission itself. Well no, I really liked it. I'm uh now that we're talk now that I know there's four bosses in it and I killed two of them. I must have made some pretty significant progress. It's not a very long game, so that explains it. Um that's kind of gutting. So Jay, your five was uh dread, your four was zero mission. So we haven't done your three, is that right? That's correct. Um Okay, what's the number three? Mine is Metroid Fusion.

Jay
01:18:45
And I think this is this is kind of a heartpick, and it's also a shit, I need to justify this retroactively for picking this at this point. Cool. Um to m I mean this such a different game to uh here's a spoiler. Um I have not got Super Metroid on this list. As much as I acknowledge Super Metroids is a great game, to me, it never like I never loved it in the same way I've loved most of the Metroids. And it probably comes from the time I played it. I played it after playing games like Fusion, which I played when it came out. I think something about the kind of obtuseness about it and the kind of Samuzis plays very clunkily in it compared to the later games. But to me, like Fusion is Metroid as like action horror thriller in a way that I still really love. Obviously it's it's much more of a linear game, it's a lot more of a driven game. This is the one where you have an AI robot kind of giving you instructions on which sector to go to. It feels the closest to that, you know, Ridley Scott Alien homage. This is a game where it kind of opens with Samu's having her armor like surgically removed after getting a parasite and that kind of thematic parasite infection theme runs through the whole game. You're kind of in this like neon nightmare space station where all these mon all the aliens and creatures that have been kind of kept on this research vessel are kind of being possessed by the uh X parasite which kind of body horrors everything and you're fighting just a horde of bizarre Cronenberg body horror monsters in a way that kind of I I don't think they really touched on. Obviously dread goes in that kind of you know, you're being chased by a robot, scary horror, but this is the one where everything like, you know, you'll be killing a little monster and it then it morphs into a bigger monster and it's Everything is unpredictable in this world and it's there's something about it I've always just like it's always really clicked with me. Again, it has some of the best pixel art ever You have these sequences that I think the Emmy sequences and dread pulls from a lot with the SAX, which is the remnants of Samuz's usual armor kind of possessed and now following her through the ship. It just all really clicks with me really well. I've always re-liked this game. There's just some nuts monster fights in this. There's just some There's a boss c called Nightmare kind of manipulates gravity and looks like a giant evil robot like nightmare doll. Yeah, everything like there's lots of the boss fights where you're just fighting like horrible amalgamations of existing kind of alien life forms. All rendered in just this amazing pixel as I said. Yeah, I just kind of love this game as a kind of action-y set PC game in this series. But on the GBA and coming out as early as it did as well.

Samuel
01:21:29
So Matthew, slightly lower on your list, but you know, I I assume that you're a big fan of this one also.

Matthew
01:21:34
I do really like it and I with that sort of linear pacing. Like there's only a really a couple of moments in this where it feels like you can backtrack across the whole map because it's it's constantly like locking down sectors and the flip side of that is that every stretch of the game has something interesting going for it because they sort of no always know where you're gonna be and they can kind of control your your route through the ship a great game for you know set pieces whether that is the clone chasing after you or there's loads of boss fights in this like it feels absolutely stacked and It does a really nice thing where you go to each area, max it out, or what you feel like you've maxed it out, and then you'll find like a new route back. there and and discover like evil plants have now taken over the area or like something crazy's happened and it's like clawed up their whole area and it's all kind of chewed up and you're like, well, you know, whatever this thing's gonna be, like there's this uh great motif throughout it where a um in one of the areas this like big shadow zooms across the screen of like a a boss that you're gonna fight two hours later, but it's constantly threatening you like something is coming, something's gonna happen and I think you can only really do that stuff when you do limit, you know, where people are and you know where everyone's gonna be and it really works as a more linear action game. Um I I think the only thing with this coming back to it and in hindsight I think the SAX clone often gets talked about as this like legendary thing, but I I did think it was a bit of a bust second time around. Because I think you're led to believe it's like quite an active organic thing that can appear. And actually it appears at very fixed moments. There's like three moments that are very scripted. I think on your first playthrough you're like, oh shit, I hope that thing doesn't turn up. Because I think the game even says like if this thing turns up Like you've just gotta run away from it. So you're you're you're c you know, the h the the the sort of headspace you're in is oh god, it's like Mr X from Resident Evil Two, you know, this Samus clone's gonna bust in at any time and make this game much harder. And I'd love to play that game. That is something they should do. But in truth, like it doesn't happen. And so when you replay it, you are a little bit like.

Jay
01:23:51
Do you think to an extent it's a victim of its own kind of fandom success? Yeah. It's it's uh it's almost like Mercury Stream Mercury Steam saw how much people go on about this incredibly small part of this one game and then were like, there's something to develop there.

Matthew
01:24:07
It it's it's got like powerful this was like one of the games I owned on GBA when I was like twelve years old. And it's like absolutely just like buried deep into my brain. Like there are so many video essays. about this fucking clone that's in this game for like five minutes and you are like get over it you know like that is just not a thing it just isn't I'm sorry I'm sorry twelve year old you but um that aside Absolutely brilliant. Nightmare, that boss, like you blow away its face and it's like all fucking gooey underneath. But like that is way more interesting than The Samus clone.

Jay
01:24:45
Yep, I'd agree with that.

Matthew
01:24:46
Like video essays about that guy. And he turns up in other M as well. He does, yeah. Quite good boss fight in that.

Samuel
01:24:52
Well, I uh I should play this at some point. Feels like a trite thing to mention, but just looks unbelievably good. Like the pixel art is incredible, these two GBA games, like absolute all timers in that respect. And a and again widely available on Switch online.

Matthew
01:25:06
One funny thing in this that I'd never realised is that talking about like the speed booster power and some of the you know, the game's most like hidden power-ups are always hidden behind very advanced use of this technique called shine sparking, which is when you you end a speed boast boost and then you sort of fire off like a missile, but you can sort of hold that charge and maintain it with various sort of hidden arcane techniques that I don't really understand. And uh there's I f of I saw a video on YouTube of there's an Easter egg in fusion where you have to carry this shine spark charge. I mean it what feels like basically across like an entire sector of this shit, which watching the video I just thought I were never gonna do that, but it lets you destroy this one piece of wall. And your only reward for it is that it it lets you get back into a section of the map that should otherwise be locked down at that moment. And if you go to a navigation room where you talk to the AI, you get like a little message from the developers where they're like What the hell are you doing here? Wow, you must be great at shine sparking! And I I love that idea where they were like, well W We know that someone might get back here because of this, so let's just have a little let's just have a little welcome message for them.

Samuel
01:26:22
We need to get back to games having like a hidden room where either the developers are there to tell you something or they leave a message behind that say you shouldn't be here or something like that.

Matthew
01:26:32
Like that was I feel like that used to be much more of a thing than it is now, but uh You should get to that room, Sakamoto pops up and it plays a really like grainy sixteen bit gif of like susperia but silux is there

Samuel
01:26:48
Okay, um number two then, Matthew. Should we actually should we start Jay's number two? That probably makes sense. I've definitely done this in uh slightly irrational order, but I think that makes sense in terms of order of speakers. What's your number two, Jay?

Jay
01:26:59
I mean this is kind of a chi okay, I've so I've gone with Metroid Prime two. But I kind of also count three here, just because I think I me To an extent in my head they blend into one. I think two is the better game, so I think canonically that's what I'm going with here, but I think this is my opportunity to talk about three 'Cause I suspect it's not higher on Matthew's list.

Matthew
01:27:19
Uh uh two and three are not on my list, but I'm uh really interested to hear your two take for sure.

Jay
01:27:26
So as uh in the way that I think Metroid Fusion is kind of like the most action horror that the that kind of Pixlock 2D era gets. Uh Prime 2 is like the most survival horror mechanically this game this series gets It's incredibly hard. It's so the central mechanic of this one is that you're hopping between the kind of dark world and the light world. And every time you're in the dark world you're kind of taking corrosive damage as you jump between these like safe bubbles. There's this constant sense of fear of like, oh shit, at any point the game's gonna need me to jump into Dark World and it's gonna be harrowing. Um, this is maybe outside of Dread the most difficult Metroid the franchise gets by far. If it's also the only one that has like ammo. It introduces like dark and light ammo for uh for these later gun upgrades. And again, another beautiful game, some incredibly cool boss fights kind of epic set pieces, just in terms of that harrowing sense of like, you're in the shit now as soon as you get into the dark world and kind of navigating your way through that. And then just some zany kind of late game environments. Yeah, I I've always thought this one was really good. Um three uh prime three, again I've I've kind of sort of slotted it here, is An interesting one because again, I think you're right, Matthew, in that now it has the reputation of like this is the one where characters talk to you and we hate that. But again, it's kind of relegated to the start of the game and people go on on about these like these hunter characters. But then in actuality I think they have like four lines of dialogue each that's really kind of a light touch of the game. Uh you do sense that 3 is the point where you know the developers are feeling the impact of Halo and there's a sense of like how do we kind of wrap this trilogy with kind of an epic finale? And I don't hate that as a last game indulgence. Just because I just feel like the like it almost feels like it earns it, you know. There's there's this kind of through line across the prime games of this escalating kind of cosmic conflict. with Faezon and Dark Sammers and three is the point of like where it goes like this is the Star Wars one, you know, you're planet hopping and going between on a spaceship and you're teaming up with other bounty hunters. Does it all function as well as they want it to? Probably not. But also, I think three is also maybe the best controlling Wii game that was ever made, despite not being a Wii Motion Plus game. It just feels great. It feel playing Metroid with a Wii Remote feels like shockingly like this is how it was always meant to be played. I never picked up the trilogy that added that into the first two games. And that was a that was a regretful never grabbed it one for me.

Samuel
01:29:59
Works very well for sure. It's like it's just it's that thing of it's not a Twitch shooter enough for the controls to to need that instant kind of snap. Um so i I think it just uh like uh the Wiimote and the the very particular rhythm of shooting in the Metro Prime games, it it's just like a perfect fit for each other, right?

Jay
01:30:21
Yeah. And I mean I I think that the formula of Metroid Prime I mean for me Metroid Prime is like the pin pinnacle of Metroid, as much as I'm a big two D Metroidvania fan, there's just something about this formula that works so well and even the lesser games in this are gonna be some of the best stuff. you know, ever in this in the kind of space it is existing. I don't think the finale to three hugely kind of pays off on the kind of climax that's build up. I think the first game has the best climax of the three of them. But in terms of like, you know, this being a light touch story franchise, it wraps well enough across these across the latter two games in this, you know, pseudo trilogy. You're such a huge Metroid story guy Joey. I don't know what it is. Because I I think I opened the first hour talking about how I don't think this really functions as a story franchise but for something there's something in this that is just endeared to me.

Samuel
01:31:20
I couldn't tell you anything about the story, but every single one of these you're like, Wow, and even though the story was light touch or even though the story was trying to do this, like you r that really uh more than any other game series I've heard you talk about, you are fascinated by the narrative. a Coutrement of Metroid.

Jay
01:31:35
I think I think for me maybe it's that sense that this is the only one where there is even this is the o maybe okay outside of maybe like Xenoblade This is the only long runner Nintendo franchise where there's a sense of there's a story and there's like a there's something in the works here and I don't know. There's some the way it the way it you know, the early hours of four where you're got you've kind of stumbling across the live troopers, you're stumbling across these guys and they're dead and that's again it's just like building out this sci fi world but still kind of keeping you on your lonesome in this weird survival situation. You know three uh has a a secret ending if you get every single one of those useless m missile power-ups where uh Silux appears so another uh Silux drop for us there. Yeah, I think these games are great and I don't know why I like the story so much, because it's not really there.

Samuel
01:32:39
Well, it it's interesting so we we talked a bit about Prime Two when we did our Metro Prime Pod early this year and I think the conclusion was that the the dark, kind of like nar and depressing narrative elements of the game and the vibe of it more generally was tied to basically the studio having the shittest time making the original Prime and then getting and getting screwed on bonuses and like r d resenting upper management and that that whole situation did change at a certain point. But You know, it's a an example of the game content being influenced by real-world factors, and uh yeah, it didn't sound very fun to work at retro in the first half of the noughties, to be honest. Matthew, what d uh what would you like to say about Prime Two or three as as games that do not appear in your list?

Matthew
01:33:25
I'm not crazy about Prime Two, which actually looking at online rankings and fan rankings, I was surprised by how many people are like Prime 2's the one. Like I love this game. Sort of the reasons you outlined. I you know, I just think they maybe gelled with you or clicked with you better, but the idea of like quite a harrowing Metroid Prime, like isn't necessarily my idea of a good time. You know, like I like the the sense of exploration and just sort of gradually getting my head around the world, but You know, I associate Metro Prime 2 with with a sense of dread of like, well, I'm soon gonna be doing this really stressful Dark World stuff, and the boss fights were so hard. That said Uh after I finished playing Metro Prime 3 in the Wii trilogy, I did start playing Metro Prime 2 and was having a having a pretty good time with it. That is one I haven't replayed for this episode. But as I was playing it I was like, uh actually this is this is just like Metroid Prime, like it is it is good. So I think I maybe just need to shake off like my my trauma of having quite a rough time of it back on GameCube and play it. There's that fucking boss where you have to like spider ball up its legs.

Jay
01:34:37
There's a there's a boss there's a boss you get the boost ball from Morph Ball Boost or whatever the hell they call it. I think it's called like the Boost Guardian, and I think it's notorious for being like one of the most difficult Nintendo bosses. Where it would kind of rocket around a small arena and if it hits you you basically die instantly. Yeah. I think that's one that got nerfed for the trilogy release. Yeah, that's such a pain in the arse on the original.

Matthew
01:34:58
Everyone says the nasty spikes aren't in the the Wii version, so Yeah, and that that that is I am quite tempted by that. Maybe post MetroPrime four I'll give that a proper go and properly enjoy the story. But uh Yes, I did uh I I really like Metro Prime 3 on a replay. Yeah, I like I like the variety of the worlds. I think it has uh they've all got like a late game kind of like

Jay
01:35:20
Go and hunt for some bullshit element to them, the trip the Prime games.

Matthew
01:35:24
Uh and Metro Primes 3 is narratively the neatest in that you're collecting these power cells to then go to this like derelict spaceship and power it up. And you only need like four or something if you put them in the right slots you can get to the piece of information you need, but I I quite liked As a device, the idea of going to this like weird ship and gradually kind of uncovering bits of it with these power cells and uh yeah, I just I thought that was that was more neatly done than the other ones, so I'm intrigued what the Bullshit quest will be in Metroid Prime for. Um apparently there is one, so

Jay
01:36:01
I'm sure it'll they'll signpost it for you quite easily though. Yeah. A bloke pointing to it.

Samuel
01:36:06
Yeah. Stephen Merchant will give you a call and be like, go here, go do that. Um so Matthew, we haven't done your number two, is that right?

Matthew
01:36:13
My number two is Metroid Prime remastered. Which I'm assuming is well Metroid Prime I'm assuming is Jay's number one.

Jay
01:36:21
That's correct, yeah.

Matthew
01:36:22
I kind of more interested to hear your take on this, just because we did a whole episode on Metroid Prime and Uh you know, I feel like I'd be doing a speed run of what I what I said in that episode, so I'm kinda kinda keen to hear your take first.

Jay
01:36:35
I think my note my first note said this might be the best game ever made. I think if I had to think of like the best games ever made, this is probably one that I would go to. Historically I've always would have gone to. Um this is still maybe a top Three for me. I again I think I mentioned earlier my history with this was this being like one of the first like quote unquote like adult games I ever played And I remember reading uh like the Nintendo official magazine at the time bigging up like, you know, you can look into the rain and the rain will drip down the screen and I remember thinking like that sounds Wild video games can't do that. And then playing it and then I remember I got rented it from Blockbuster, which is a thing that used to exist. And Being like this is the most impressive thing, like nothing could look better than this. This is as good as things look. It looked great for its time, still looks great. The remaster looks fantastic. I think there's just something away the way this game feels. It really sells that like archaeol like archaeology in this alien world that I don't think anything else has really felt as good as this in that. You know, you play you know play its contemporaries, stuff, you know, like you know, Star Wars Jedi Survivor and stuff, and it's got that Metroidvania you know, ancient space ruins feel but it doesn't feel like this. It doesn't sell you on that sense of this isn't real a real ass a ancient alien world and you're just in the ruins of it. It's brilliant. I think it was just a Testament of art design and real Texan blood sweat and tears. I think it's gre I think the soundtrack still sounds like something from the future. I don't know why nothing else sounds like this. I don't think anyone else can make something that sounds like this.

Matthew
01:38:16
Would you ever listen to the soundtrack outside the game? I've listened to the soundtrack.

Jay
01:38:20
Yeah, it's it still sounds great. I mean like there's like the Fendrana drift track is like one of the most like off-cited like it's oh shit this is amazing atmosphere in a game kind of moments. It's just kind of a masterpiece isn't it? I really I remember this is um again, I rented this several times at Blockbuster when I was younger, got Prime 2, then got Prime 3, and then found this at CEX Liverpool for £6 in like 2008, and then managed to kind of wrap my p like prime saga playing this at the very end or finishing it at the very end after beating the previous two. And I still think this is the best one and I has the best Final weird squid monster alien at the end and I yeah, it's just great.

Samuel
01:39:03
Yeah, I mean we we yeah, we did do a whole episode on it. That is on Patreon if you'd like to. Oh, is it a Patreon one? Was it a pay was it a Patreon one? I think it was. I can't actually remember now, but uh yeah. Well, that's alright. I mean we could talk about it a bit here. But yeah, I mean I hadn't played it played through it uh fully until this year, Jay. And it was really interesting to encounter to like this some things I sort of assumed from playing it. Like I I'm almost certain the most time went into making the Chozo ruins above all other areas in the game. Yeah, because it's just because like it just 'cause it just feels like complete as a space in a way that I don't think all uh some of the other uh a couple of the other areas do feel like pretty fleshed out, but whatever the fiery zones called. Magmore caverns. Yeah, that's like the weakest part of the game by miles. Like it's so obvious that that is like a That feels like quite slapped together as an area. Whereas Chozo Ruins just feels like it has that sort of, well how do I get up there? Like observing something you know you need to get to but not understanding how how like one entrance interacts with another. I think that it's just perfectly built in that respect. Probably because you know whenever you saw the early footage of Metro Prime, it was always from the Chozo ruins. So it it that was probably like their their test area and they thought about it the most. Um but I think it it just works in so many ways. The the idea of like uh at this moment in the lifespan of games being like, how do we translate this very particular 2D thing to 3D? And then nailing it out of the gate like they did. And it being a a developer who'd never made a Metroid game before. And it emerging out of some pretty hairy circumstances for the studio in that they had three games cancelled um in the run up to making this and layoffs and it was very hard to to finish. But they did such a good job with it. I mean playing the remaster, the one thing I I sort of felt was You could probably afford to go and do a bit of surgery on the respawning enemies, so make the game move a bit faster, have a fewer Chozo ghost encounters maybe than the final game gives you. Yeah, it is a incredibly beautiful, uh sort of like you know, uh way to experience the game now. And it does it holds up well precisely 'cause of the thing we talked about earlier, that is a bit of an evolutionary dead end. There aren't many games that are there are many games inspired by Super Metroid and the 2D Metroid games, but there are fewer games that can sort of get their arms around what Metroid Prime was trying to achieve and uh yeah, the very specific three D version of that experience. Matthew, what do you want to add?

Matthew
01:41:44
Yeah, I I I agree with all of it. I had a very similar relationship with it that that Jay had in terms of seeing it in magazines and being like, well that's the the best looking game of all time. and being so excited to play it and then yeah, just absolutely delivering on that great first person platforming, you know, just a real sense of like who you are and how you behave in that world. I love the morphos stuff in this as well. Like when you've discover that huge chunks of the map are like giant half pipes for you to sort of boost up and Yeah and and there's that there's that bit in uh I I won't take this this Magmore s slander. There's that great room where you set off some bombs and then like the whole room grows in size, like these pistons push the roof up and there's like a massive spider ball track on the wall and you're like, oh this is crazy. This cave I've been through like three times is now like a huge morph bomb labyrinth and uh the that is tr that is cool. I'll I'll definitely concede that. Yeah, there's loads of moments like that in this. It's great game for like big transforming rooms and just giant mechanisms whirring up where you're like, oh shit, what am I dealing with now? Yeah, it's absolutely absolutely brilliant and the remaster is great.

Samuel
01:42:57
It just looks it looks so good. Can we at least agree that no one's ever excited to go back to Magmore cabinets? Like that's like the that's uh can we at least agree on that? Like just hopping over the lava, the things popping out of the lava, like that's It's a it's a tough hang on a minute.

Matthew
01:43:21
They've all got different ammo's to destroy them by the time you've worked out what's going on like another three have grown and oh just

Samuel
01:43:29
Hell. That was tough. Absolute hell. When I told you I got through that on my second attempt and didn't engage with any of the enemies, I think you were like slightly angry.

Matthew
01:43:37
I screamed some terrible things at the TV during that. Um I think I I think I really, really disturbed Catherine.

Jay
01:43:54
But art that pulls up is like still impressive. I it's I it's just mind-boggling. I don't know how they pulled it off in a way that like w works so well then and in a way that n I don't think anything's really replicated that in a way that I've been impressed by, you know? It's yeah it's like, oh cool, you can just look at everything and it has lore and stuff it's cool.

Samuel
01:44:14
That is what the Arkham Detective Vision is, right? It's just using it's just what is in this game. It's it's expanding on that. And adapting it to a universe perfect for it. Yeah, I agree. That's um I think just the the different ways in which it thinks about the first person experience and what you can do with that. Like a touch I love, Jay, is just when a flash goes off and you just see Samus' reflection in in the HUD. Uh that's just like really A great touch just to remind you of who you're playing as. Kind of like similar to the rain in that respect where it just adds that extra layer of atmosphere.

Jay
01:44:47
Blessedly Silux free as well. Although this does have the first the first appearance of Dark Sammers. Smash Bros favourite there.

Samuel
01:44:56
In which we've Matthew becomes your number one.

Matthew
01:44:59
Incredibly cliched fashion. It's Super Metroid on the SNES. I normally roll my eyes when list get to number one and it's like the SNES version. You know, it's a little bit like, really? You wanna play Super Mario World over all right, fair enough. But playing this again Over the summer and listen, I I will admit I used all the bells and whistles, safe states, rewinds, you name it, to get through it. So I had a very skewed version of this. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. I thought this had so many great moments and ideas that they've either been chasing since or just for some reason just decided not to not to ever try again. I mean, the the general lack of guidance, it really does feel like, oh, I'm dumped in a proper alien world and I just have to work all this out for myself. You know, there isn't much story admittedly in that in in that exploration, but I think when you get a moment which feels like story or something very scripted happens in that structure, I think it's even more potent because of it. And really my argument for this game is It's just a list of things that happened that I really like in this game. So you can skip ahead three minutes if you're not gonna play Supermetric. If you haven't played it yet and you wanna play it very early on. I I don't think I necessarily clocked that this was set in the same place as Metroid. And there's a bit where you basically return to the final boss chamber from Metroid where you fight Mother Brain. except you approach it coming down the the the the kind of escape tunnel on the right. So you approach it from a different angle. And you you begin to get a sense of like, oh, I feel this feels sort of familiar to me. And then you're suddenly in. It's such like an iconic screen, you know, that image with like the shattered glass tank and

Jay
01:46:53
Mm-hmm.

Matthew
01:46:53
I mean that's the sh returning to Shadow Moses like twenty, thirty years before that happened, you know? That's such a great idea to have like a sense of history. in a SNES sequel to a NES game, like to know that that would be cool. I thought that was rad as hell. There's a a bit in this game where you can wall jump in Super Metroid and it isn't a power that's earned. Like you have it. from the beginning but the game never tells you and the technique is quite hard but it's communicated to you organically by you find a secret area and there are these little like rabbit creatures doing a wall jump And the only way out is to then l work out how to do the thing that they're doing. And that's when you realize, oh shit, I could have been doing this whole time. And I've don't think I've ever seen that in a game. Maybe there's a bit of that in like an animal well, maybe, or like one of those sort of weird puzzles where it's it's all there if you can only you know if you can only pay attention, but I thought that was that was a really awesome moment. I think the boss fights in this are great. Just the giant sprites of like Cray. It's this huge thing. That looks amazing. There's a boss called Crocomaia, who's like this big kind of red crocodile thing, and you it's it's like a sort of uh reverse tug of war where you have to sort of fire missiles into him to push him back so he falls into some lava. But then like a few seconds uh like the fight finishes and then you start walking down this corridor and then this horrible melted version of Krokomaya comes back. for like a uh you know just sort of pops out the ground and gives you a scare and you're like, that's fucking cool. There's a haunted ghost ship where you fight Fantoon, which is this like ghost squid. You're in the ship and you can kind of go into the save rooms, but the save room's not working 'cause there's not power and that's quite an old trick now, the sort of you know the thing that isn't behaving quite as it should but I can only imagine like that's a thing back then you'd be like, oh this area looks like the other areas but it isn't quite behaving like the other areas. What's going on with that? And then you fight this weird ghost and that releases all this sort of psychic energy that powers up the ship that you can then explore it with all this whirring machinery. It's just, you know, for a game which is, you know, quote unquote, not really about anything and just about exploring, it's amazing how many like weird, memorable things happen on that journey. the case for them either remaking this in the zero mission style, which I think would be absolutely amazing, or just having another go at this, just just trusting that there is an appetite, you know, as proven by you know, the Hollow Knight games being bigger than the entire Metroid franchise at this point, that people are open to getting lost and like magic happens when people overcome that and find their way around it and feel their way through it and just because every other Nintendo game is incredibly friendly and welcoming to players, I think there's a way of of balancing those those values and still making it work and I really hope they try this again one day. You know, like this kind of world with like the looks of a of a Metroid Dread. I mean that would be just one of the greatest games of all time. Oh god. But it is still so good. The only thing I will say the controls are like The kind of ass for a game that I'm calling the best Metroid game. There's some horrible stuff in this. You have to press the select button, or what stands in is the select button on an emulator to change to missiles. That's rank as hell. Imagine pressing that on a SNIS controller. Like that is not a fun button to press at speed. You have to go into the menu and like deactivate certain beams if you want to use a certain beam. That sucks. Coming to this after like Fusion Zero Mission, especially Dread, it's like, oh my god, it feels a billion years old. But um if Samus feels a billion years old, I think the actual journey you go on is just like It's just it's absolutely top-notch. Of all those the SNES games I've gone back to, this is one where I was like, that is still absolutely magic.

Samuel
01:51:00
Sakamoto nailed it. We talked recently about how if you go from playing Zelda to the Link to the Past, the leap is just like That would just knock your socks off back in the day. And the leap from Metroid to Super Metroid in presentation is similar in terms of just holy shit, like the way this sounds, like the atmosphere of it is a it it still absolutely cooks and holds holds up for sure. Yeah, the control thing is interesting. I think maybe try to reverse engineer Like that to s to start at in the modern day and work your way backwards might be where you come unstuck there. And maybe your best bet if you haven't played the Metroid games before is to go is to start with Super Metroid Matthew. And work your way forwards.

Matthew
01:51:46
Yeah, or do them in do them in story order. Just enjoy the tale, you know.

Samuel
01:51:51
Yeah, Jay, I will ask then what what your relationship with Super Metroid is. As someone who started with Metroid Prime and it's like a a bit younger than myself and Matthew. Did you what was your experience going back to this? Was this a virtual console game for you?

Jay
01:52:05
Uh this was this was uh I think this was a virtual console and then maybe uh gave it another crack a few years down the line an emulator. Um it w yeah, I think I I think just not having that personal relationship with it, but knowing, you know, the internet's reputation. Um, you know, it became very much one of these like sacred games on online discussions, one of the, you know, uncontested greatest games of all time. Um I mean I do think it's great. To be honest, not having it on my list was more of a it'll be high on Matthews list. Let's see what else I can throw in there and just that I have stronger personal feelings for. It's a great game. Yeah, I would definitely love just like a plays better version of this. I'd almost love to see something. you know, like a 2D art style take on this. Not necessarily Hollow Knight style, but maybe just something leaning that way a little, just a little bit of a visual reimagining of it with some tidier, you know, controls. It definitely has that SNES game look. There's a kind of like a dithery, kind of muted pixel style to it that kind of makes you think of, you know, other Nintendo titles of the time. Um it's got kind of a mega drivey game look to me. But um you know undeniably great game.

Samuel
01:53:21
Nothing more offensive you can say to Matthew than comparing it to a Mega Drive game. Um I sort of do see what you mean actually, like visually it is sort of What the fuck? I could sort I can sort of see that.

Jay
01:53:37
It takes the declining in quality at this late hour.

Samuel
01:53:39
I mean yeah, we are recording at twenty past midnight. In which case I will s I will just ask you chaps to read out your top fives for all the information sickles who are not content to just listen to the podcast in real time and like things being recapped. um after the fact.

Matthew
01:53:54
See, I I think we should do this podcast super Metroid style and not repeat it. So you just have to sort of like go and find it at your own pace. But if you're more of a Metroid Fusion guy Let's have out these lists.

Samuel
01:54:06
Yeah, I will I will hide the realed li realist behind a wall that you can only reach by spark shining.

Matthew
01:54:12
And in there that's where it says Federation Force is number one, followed by uh other M. Matthew, you do your top five. I had a five Metroid Fusion, four, Metroid Zero Mission, three, Metroid Dread, two Metroid Prime remastered, and one Super Metroid. How about yours, Jay?

Jay
01:54:29
I had five Metroid Dread, uh four Metroid Zero Mission, three Metroid Fusion, two Metroid Prime two, but kind of three. And one Metroid Prime.

Samuel
01:54:41
I like that you smuggled in um both the the other two Metro Prime games. It was good to discuss those on this episode for sure. Is there anything else we want to name check here? Any honorable mentions? Other M didn't make the list, Matthew. How was your replay?

Matthew
01:54:53
I I I really enjoyed it. The core sense move which is jump out the way and then your beam basically powers all the way up and then you can blast someone. That little loop, I think that's good. It's got some good boss fights. All the shit really shitty cutscenes are mostly in the first couple of hours. Uh the rest of it's fine. It's honestly fine that game. Got a terrible online reputation. It's it's It's really not earned, I don't think.

Jay
01:55:20
It's a victim of um video essay culture for sure.

Samuel
01:55:23
Oh for sure. Yeah, it seems like Metroid is just uh like a moth to the flame for for takes um on YouTube. So taken down by big video essay.

Jay
01:55:32
Big video essay colluded with Silent Hill 2 to uh take it down.

Samuel
01:55:38
So I guess we haven't talked about I mean there's a quite there's a few games we've not talked about. So Samus Returns didn't make either the top five lists. But are there anything anything that either of you are are particularly passionate about that you want to shout out?

Jay
01:55:51
Has anyone played Metroid Prime Pinball?

Matthew
01:55:53
Back in the day I didn't revisit that for this. I remember it being fine.

Jay
01:55:57
I wonder how much that sold.

Matthew
01:55:58
It had the rumble pack.

Jay
01:55:59
That's one where I just wonder the sales numbers. Like, is that what was the Venn diagram that cause that to get produced, you know.

Samuel
01:56:05
Well that's so that's the other thing that is that you know there are there's like a handful of there's not there are not many Metroid games full stop, but there are a handful of games we haven't really discussed, like uh Federation Force and yes, um Metro Prime um pinball but also Hunters as well on DS, which was a an amazing technical feat, but um is not Beloved.

Matthew
01:56:26
If Nintendo wanted to do the raddest thing ever, they'd give Metroid Prime Pimble 2 to the Xeno tilt guy. That is the most

Samuel
01:56:33
Matthew Castle at half midnight take I've ever heard. Xeno Tilt. I mean which uh that was in last year's game list, right? Xenotilt.

Matthew
01:56:43
Or Demon's Tilt if you're that way inclined.

Samuel
01:56:46
Yep, that game is um is better than Asteroid Bot Matthews on the record.

Jay
01:56:52
Did you know that s uh Metroid Prime Pinball is technically the only British Metroid game?

Samuel
01:56:59
Oh no, I did not know that. That's a good bit of trivia. Who uh do you know who made that? Was it the WYSI brothers?

Jay
01:57:05
Uh Silverball Studios, who specialized in pinball games. and was merged into another company in 2009 and doesn't seem to exist anymore. Based in Burford, Oxfordshire.

Samuel
01:57:17
Oh okay. Well that's uh a place I've never been to and uh yes, I mean the WYSI Brothers reference just killed me there, Matthew, so thank you for throwing me out the WYSI Brothers That was a an homage to uh one of my favourite tweets. That's a great Jay uh Th a great Jay Bayliss uh Blue Skypost at, like an all timer, uh we did enjoy the WYSI We enjoy the work of the WYSI brothers here at the backpage. Yeah, that was fun. Um thank you um so much, Jay, for joining us and going through your top five and for sharing your knowledge. Obviously, after the music rolls here, Jay will do a one hour um Silex-based um audio essay for you to enjoy. um on the uh the the law of silux and uh it's only on the patreon free free if i am like great uh well Jay, where can people get you on social media and where can they find uh more about your your works?

Jay
01:58:05
I am Jay Bayless on Blue Sky. Uh no one posts on Twitter anymore. So that's where I I am mostly posting stuff. I've got a w yeah, our studio Bitten Studio also has a blue sky and you can find us uh on various social media platforms.
