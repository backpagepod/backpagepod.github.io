Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts. I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew, we have another special guest. So our guest this week is comedian, journalist and streamer Ellie Gibson. Ellie, how are you? It's a delight to have you.

Ellie Gibson
00:35
First of all, I'm slightly offended to be introduced as you said another special guest. That's a contradiction, is it? Oh, we've got another special guest. If you'd said a very special guest or even just a special guest, I'd been a little bit more honoured, but we've got another special guest, Ellie Gibson. Pi.

Samuel
00:54
Uh oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I think I just I treat you all equally so none of you think you're any more special than the other one. I don't want anyone to think they're at the bottom of the ladder, but then they're not the top of the ladder either. So there's a bit of tenuous management going on of egos there, but we are happy to have you, Ellie. Just to be clear about that. So uh not just another person to us.

Ellie Gibson
01:14
Yeah, well I I've I've edited over a hundred and two hundred and fifty episodes of my own podcast, and I I let's not mess about it, let's be honest. some guests not all guests are equal. Some guests are more equal than others. Let's be a hundred percent. It's like when I asked a midwife once, like, is it true that all babies are like special and beautiful? Do you just have to say that about all babies? And she went, Oh yeah, no, some of them are like actually really ugly. It's that's the truth, isn't it?

Samuel
01:37
Yeah, we've definitely got a few of our own ugly babies here. If they don't get mentioned on the podcast again that basically people know that they're the ones who were who are sort of like persona non grata on the podcast. So that's sort of how we operate here. So if you never come up again on the back page Ellie, you'll know it's gone wrong basically.

Ellie Gibson
01:52
Then I then that's how I know I'm an ugly baby. That's great. Sorry, it's going to.

Samuel
01:57
We're delight to have you on here. You recently did some stand-up comedy on Mount Everest. Is is that true? That's a bit of a a weird icebreaker to have on a podcast, but I feel like it's the most notable thing that's happened to you in recent history, so we should ask about it. How was how was Everest?

Ellie Gibson
02:10
Uh it was it was you're not gonna believe this, it was really cold. It was unbelievable like it was so cold. It was it was um the night because so to be fair we didn't we didn't go up Everest because um I don't um want to die. So we didn't actually climb up. Uh obviously I could have done it if I wanted to, I just didn't want to. We went to the base of Everest, which in itself is ten days of walking. Um and that's quite a lot of effort to be honest. That was enough. Pepper. We spent a night intense at Mount Everest at the base and it was minus twenty five degrees Celsius. So yeah, it's it's Pe Yeah, my Kindle stopped working. That's how cold it was. That's real hardship. You never see that on begrails. You never see him going, Oh now I can't read the last chapter of Murder on the Orient Express. My week's ruined

Samuel
02:56
Amazing. Are you not worried about someone going up there and then going like ten meters higher and then like beating your record?

Ellie Gibson
03:07
Well I wish them luck, or like that's what I can say. So we There was a record existing. There was uh a Napoli guy who who had the record for the highest stand-up comedy gig, but he flew in it was a different mountain, and he flew in and out on a helicopter, which frankly is pathetic. I think we can all agree. Um so we actually walked there and and actually we and we looked at the numbers and we were like, okay, so Everest Base Camp is I think it was like a hundred meters or so higher than this guy had done his record, right? So we were like, Oh that's fine, that's that's plenty of leeway, you know. So so we walked ten days and got there, only to find that the glacier has melted. 'Cause I don't know if you've you've heard this boys, but the planet's on fire uh and everything's melting. So Everest Base Camp is not actually as high as it as it was even a few years ago. So uh sort of three in the four in the afternoon, we literally had to scramble round base camp trying to find the highest point at base camp, literally scrambling over rocks and scree and and eventually we managed to get, I think, something pathetic in itself like ten metres higher or something than this guy had done it. And so by the skin of our teeth we we got the record. So I I I as I say I wish good luck to anyone um who wants to break the record. You you would have to go up you'd have to actually go up Mount Everest.

Matthew
04:34
On uh Simon's podcast which she recorded just before you went to Everest you were debating about whether to joke about it being the last joke some of the people would ever hear because lots of people die when they climb Everest. Where did you land on that in the end?

Ellie Gibson
04:50
Well, in the end that was another sort of um uh disastrous thing that went wrong. So that was the plan when I went on Simon's podcast, as I said the plan was to um do the show for like um climbers and people who are going up Everest. As it turned out, they there weren't that many there weren't any climbers there. We were a bit early. And also I didn't realize this, but my my trek leader Tanya told us this that now as well. It used to be that you would go to Base Camp Wright and you would live there for a month and or uh longer and sort of go because you have to acclimatize, right? So stop me if I'm being extremely dull, but you have to go up a bit and then come back down, then go up a bit higher and then come back down so your body gets used to the altitude. And lots of people still do that, but also quite a lot of people like millionaires who are the the the big market for climbing a risk now they just fly in and like they'll do like a trek and then they'll come back and then they'll helicopter out again to a five-star hotel in Kathmandu. So it's all a bit different now. Um so anyway, so uh the point is when we came to do our show, we had to break the world record, we had to have a minimum of thirty uh people in the audience. Which again we thought was fine. We've performed to a lot less in our career. We've got that. That'll be fine. Um but in the end we had to get um all like the Sherpers and the the there were loads of people there setting up um camps. for the hikers to come in for the climbers to come in. So we had loads of cooks and porters and the ice doctors who were the guys who put the ropes across the kumbu and uh thing. So um a lot of them didn't speak English and or didn't find our jokes funny. So it was quite a tough gig to be honest with you. We had some great yak based material that we'd worked on on the way up that didn't st we didn't storm it. But they liked it when we took our jackets off to reveal our gold cat suits in minus fifteen. Uh whether they liked it when we sang and yeah and and they liked the me so so and when we sort of set we were setting up, we were like, how are we gonna tell these people that we're here? How are we gonna get the audience to come and watch the show? And we had this PA system, right, that we had to have 'cause to make it a proper comedy gig. So I thought, what is the one tune I can think of? that would make me sit up and take notice and come and see what's going on. So I put the Venga Boys We Like to Party on and blasted that. To let the Sherpers of Everest know that the Renger Boss not only was coming, it had arrived and it was gonna do some comedy. And sure enough, they all came out of the tents like mere cats going, What is that? And uh that's that's how we did it. So it was it was an adventure.

Samuel
07:20
Amazing. Matthew, I think when we finally do our live show it's gonna go very similarly, so it's uh nice to hear that. how that went down. Right right down to the the gold suits we'll have underneath our regular clothes that will uh rip off halfway through. So that'll be good.

Ellie Gibson
07:32
I highly recommend it. And if if you know if you or or you could borrow our vagina custom

Samuel
07:47
Oh yeah, they love it in Bristol.

Ellie Gibson
07:49
We've done some good shows in Bristol. They're well up to the first time. for it.

Samuel
07:52
Okay, well that's uh great, amazing to hear about. So uh I'm pleased that we've um we've resolved that for listeners of Simon Parkinson's My Perfect Console podcast. You have the follow-up there to what happened on Everest. So that's um Super handy. So uh Ellie, you recently appeared on that podcast and it was fantastic to hear about your life and career and how games have formed a key part of both. And On this episode, we wanted to dial more in on your journalism career, which you already talked about a little bit on that episode, and I'm I'm sure you got a lot of stories because you were, you know, you were doing it for around a decade, so Um we all wanted to make sure that we were avoiding retreading the same territory because you you covered it so well there, but I know there's a lot more to talk about. How do you feel about revisiting this this period of your life?

Ellie Gibson
08:30
Oh, very jolly, honestly. Um I've listened to your podcast and I think it's great and I love hearing like sort of war stories and funny stories and the terrible press trips. and stuff from other journalists and it always makes me go, oh yeah, I've got a story about that. So I'm very uh very happy. And it was a really happy time of my life, so I'm very happy to to revisit it.

Samuel
08:50
Alright, so um ticking off then a little bit, so growing up, what excited you about games media? Which magazines did you read? Because I know you mentioned that that was something that was on your radar. when you were young. What sort of like did that mean to you in your life at that time?

Ellie Gibson
09:03
Yeah, yeah. So when I've been into games ever since I was a little girl and I used to um I had a second hand Amstrad CPC four six four. That was my first sort proper machine that I own. So my I used to read Amstrad Action which came with a cover tape. Can you imagine? Very exciting. So it had a a cover tape. And I loved it. I used to read it like cover to cover and yeah and obviously boot up the tape and play everything on the tape and thought it was brilliant. And then I read official PlayStation for a bit, I think when when I got into Playstation and stuff like that. So I was of s of that sort of era really. Um of the era when, you know, games magazines were it was all like, you know, Amstrad Towers, do you know what I mean? It was all of that sort of and everyone everyone was a burk. Or it was all It was a happier, simpler time.

Samuel
09:52
Yeah. Yeah, so it's it is interesting to uh to hear because I think I feel like your own sort of angle on games and how you talk about games is may is quite in line with that that sort of energy. Was that therefore quite a big influence on you when you eventually got into games media?

Ellie Gibson
10:07
Oh definitely. I think that's sort of irreverent kind of especially I think in those days because, you know, games obviously were in their in see as a medium and you know it was a huge suspension of disbelief then wasn't it to go okay yeah I I'm this I'm this little plumber made out of eight pixels and and I'm identifying or is it like Chucky Egg? Oh cool, I'm in this hen factory where none of the eggs are even like curved. Like it's it's just I think all that that kind of thing of like um you really had to suspend disbelief and that and that meant you couldn't take it too seriously because what you were doing was silly, wasn't it? So I I've always found games quite silly, but that's what I li I like silly stuff, I like funny stuff And it's not, you know, it wasn't about how realistic the graphics uh were it was, but it was like they were realistic if like, you know, the hen had like actual sort of little toes and not just sticks for legs. It was like that. So I think growing up reading those there were there there was a lot of humour in those magazines and and I think that definitely um influenced

Samuel
11:10
Uh you mentioned in Simon's podcast that Tomb Raider was an important game for you. Obviously you mentioned there the uh OPM and the PlayStation become quite a big deal to you. Um on the game side. So what did you make of that series as it developed? What were were some areas a bit more successful to you than others? Were you kind of like always paying close attention to to how Tomb Raider was going?

Ellie Gibson
11:27
Oh yeah, I think I've played pretty much all of them. Uh even like the the Chronicles, was it? And the yeah. I like the Egyptian one actually. Anyway, I'm babbing. No, I'm a forty six year old female gamer, so I like all of us. Lara Croft is our she's our Mario, do you know what I mean? Like that's that's all we had. in those days. I mean let's be honest, nothing quite will ever capture the magic, I think, sadly I've realised now, of that that first game and playing that game for the first time because there was nothing else like it and that wasn't just because it was a female's character, it was the the atmosphere that game generated and the and the sort of peacefulness of it and the isolation, that sense of being on your own exploring the world. That was the first time I'd ever experienced that in a video game. And it's one of those magic things that I don't think you can bottle it. I don't think you can just keep churning it out. And I think elements of the of the games have sort of sort of come and gone with varying degrees of success with the instalments over the years and she is a great character. So I think there's definitely I will I will definitely play the next one. I'm very excited about it. But I've I at the ripe old age of forty six I've accepted that some things were off their time, you know, and some magic moments are magic because you can't recreate them.

Samuel
12:37
Yeah, that's fair enough. So your first job in games was working as a copywriter for Sony. That um it was amazing to hear some of the s you know the the kind of irreverent stuff you tried to put in like a time crisis manual during that um episode you did with Simon. But I suppose like i in general, what was that career move like and how come you didn't um ultimately end up sticking with it long term? Because I imagine you had a lot of opportunities to sort of move up in a company like that.

Ellie Gibson
13:01
Well oh well this is very um this is I mean this is not the most feminist thing I've ever said, but I've got a boyfriend. So I joined Sony and a few months after I I joined Playstation I met um I met a lovely man called Richard who was an Australian man who worked in IT there. Um and yeah and we we went out of each other and it was really fun and lovely and I was still very young at this point. I think I was like twenty-three, twenty-four, and I hadn't done the gap year thing or the backpacking thing and I had always wanted to do that. So then he said, Oh look, I'm going back to Australia, I'm gonna go back home. Um, why don't you come with me? And um in some ways, in retrospect, stupidly, I went, Yeah, all right, fine. Um So I'd only been at Sony a year and a bit, I think, and I was having a great time, but I was like, okay, no, let's let's do that. Um I think I had half a mind that I would come back and and and carry on with it, but obviously that's not how that works. Anyway, so I bought my Round the World ticket and then uh he chucked me a few months after that and then I went anyway because it was done then. Uh and then so then I had this big adventure away for a year. and I ended up working at the Viet Vietnam News, which is where I got a say journalism experience. Um I wrote a lot of government propaganda and then I uh and then I came home and then and then got into sort of games magazines that way. So it's funny, isn't it? I d you know, I'm I'm I I'm glad I did that because I think I I enjoyed writing the manuals for a bit and like my lovely friend Russell is my boss and he's still there and he's still doing it and uh he absolutely loves it but I think I couldn't be as irreverent as I wanted to be. I couldn't be silly and I couldn't show off my stupid personality in the same way that you can with journalism. So I think it was a good thing um that that I left really.

Matthew
14:52
I can't remember specifically Sony manuals, but there used to be a bit of a jokey manual culture, you know? Like definitely as a Nintendo guy, like the rare manuals were always pretty goofy. I remember getting a letter. printed in Gamesmaster celebrating the art of good manual writing because that's the kind of fifteen year old I was.

Ellie Gibson
15:13
Well thank you because it is a bloody art and it's about time it was recognised. You are my I tell you what, my Sky Odyssey, that's my opus, that could stand up there with the bloody book of prizes. Whatever they whatever it is. Where's my book of prize?

Samuel
15:30
I I was shocked to learn you named Jack from Jack and Daxter Alley, which I think is an incredible claim to fame. I love that first Jack and Daxter game. I think it It was fantastic. Matthew doesn't like the jumps of um Sony platforming um icons. Um so that's um it's a no from him. But um I thought that was um that was a really n a cool game and an amazing thing to have had a hand in. So um I suppose like which other games did you end up working on? Were there any you had a particular affinity for aside from Jack and Dexter?

Ellie Gibson
15:55
I did like Sky Odyssey actually 'cause that was the first one I ever did and wrote the manual for and I just I liked playing games anyway, so that was a good one. Um, I'm trying to think. Ah, they a lot of them just stick in my memory because I played do you remember Extermination? I did that one. Uh that was sort of pretty mediocre. I did I worked on Airblade briefly.

Samuel
16:16
Oh, that's an underrated game. That's a pretty cool game. It's like basically hoverboard Tony Hawk, right?

Ellie Gibson
16:22
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I do remember there being a thing about the logo and the the poor designer had to redo the logo about eight hundred times. Um I think they might have spent more time on the logo than the actual game to be honest with you. Which might might have cost them in the end.

Matthew
16:36
I just can't believe that Jack from Jack and Daxter didn't have a name until the game got to the the manual.

Ellie Gibson
16:43
Until the game got to Ellie Gibson, thank you very much. Let's You know, let's come on. Right, but that is what were they calling him? He was just introduced to me. They had a beautiful big sort of art book. I remember I remember it. They had this ring binder. That was the first time I'd ever seen seen it. They had this the product manager had this glossy ring binder and they had this gorgeous artwork in and they were like this is Daxter we know his name and this is we have this blonde character and we just don't know what to call him. So I came up with this list of like fifty names, one of which was Jack, because my flatmate at the time we used to call him Jack Jack. Um And they said, Yeah, we like that, we're gonna shorten it to Jack.

Matthew
17:19
That's just that's so wild to me. Like that they create him and were like, uh we don't know either what this guy's deal is. He's got this mate called Daxter but him, no idea.

Ellie Gibson
17:29
I mean, aren't they lucky that my flatmate's nickname wasn't Cockface or something like that? How different hype history might have been, really.

Samuel
17:36
Yeah Colin Colin and Daxter doesn't quite have the same um same vibe. I also like the idea that Naughty Dog were like, well, Daxter, we've nailed. We know that that is like bulletproof, but that but this guy Yeah, that's um amazing. That absolut genuinely like blew my mind as a fact. I couldn't I couldn't believe that when I heard it because I'm pretty sure they refer to him as Jack in the dialogue in the game. So they had to I guess go away and record it off the back of that real cause and effect stuff there. But uh yeah. Well, you are welcome.

Ellie Gibson
18:04
That's what I'm saying.

Samuel
18:06
No, I appreciate that. So uh I suppose we've covered a little bit there why you wanted to step away from that work, but I did want to talk about how your your first foray into games media. So you mentioned you went to work for a games magazine in Macclesfield. and it shut down. What was that whole period like? And what was that magazine? Because I I don't think that detail came up on that episode you did.

Ellie Gibson
18:25
Oh that I mean that was hilarious. So basically what happened was I went travelling, I left Sony, I went travelling, um and I came home and I had no job obviously and I I ended up being offered two jobs. I was I was offered this job on in Macclesfield. on this magazine or I was offered this job in London where I live, where I'm from, where all my friends are and my family are, um, doing PR um for an agency that was doing PR for like I think driver three or four or something. And uh There must have been three, I can't remember anyway. Um and I took the PR job because it was literally a third more money and it was in London and I didn't have to move. And I think I lasted about four days. And then I rang the Macclesfield people and went, uh, is that job still going, please? Because I think I've made a horrible mistake. So I can't remember if I told this story on the other podcast. I'm not sure, but um anyway I went up to Maclesfield and um I the magazine we w I worked on two magazines, Station Gamer uh which was a very cool actually little A five magazine. That was its main differentiating point. It was small. And um and then I worked on this magazine called it was originally called PSG 247. And I think even before that, before I joined, it might have been called at one point PSG 247365. And then I

Matthew
19:51
What does PSG stand for?

Ellie Gibson
19:52
PlayStation Gaming. Yes. Uh Paris Saint-Germain, that's right. It was a it was a football, football fagazine slash games magazine. And then it was in this warehouse, um, outside it wasn't even in Macclesfield, right? So I I moved to Maclesfield thinking, okay, it's a little northern town, that's fine. I went to Union Sheffield. I like the north, that's fine. Uh only to discover that the actual magazine was honestly on a motorway outside Macclesfield. Um and I couldn't drive and didn't have a car So to get to work, either I got a lift if I was lucky, or very often I would have to get the train a couple of stops and then walk like a mile along a motorway. And then the um the the office was next to a little chef. Um so We had a lot of Olympic breakfasts. And there wasn't even like there wasn't like apart from the little chef, there was there wasn't like a shop. Do you know what I mean? A little sandwich van used to come round at lunchtime and that's what you had for lunch 'cause that was that was that. And then on Fridays we would all get into Martin's car and drive to the Vernon Arms and drink as much lager as possible and then go back to the office. So it was um yeah, it was a funny place to work and not very well run, I don't think. And and basically people would leave and and the the staff got smaller and smaller until there was two of us left. producing this one games magazine and then that folded and they yeah it w it was all it was all messy but but it was an amazing time because the people I worked with were so brilliant. And I'm still friends with a lot of them. I went on to work with a lot of them. That's how I know like Dan Whitehead, who um writes for Eurogamer and he also wrote a lot of Go 8-bit stuff. Um Matt Martin, who was on BG2. 24-7 and yeah, and my mates Paul and Martin and it was it was a very jolly time. It was that thing which I'm sure you must have had in your careers where there comes a point sometimes where it's a bit like you're in a shipwreck, do you know what I mean? There's like there's like five or six of you and you're just stranded on this fucking island and you're just trying to build a shelter and keep the fire going and like, you know Eat some fish and just hoping you don't end up having to drink your own piss and eat each other. That's what you're hoping for. But um It usually does reach that point. Have you I don't know, does does that resonate with you or have I taken the metaphor too far?

Samuel
22:21
Definitely. No, it it it does. Like I think all all my strongest connections in games are from people I work with in my first Star Friday job. I'm still uh friends with those people years later. And it it's partly because of the time of your life that you're in, but it's also because of the circumstances, like you say. So yeah, that definitely um definitely brings truth. me. Um yeah, yeah. Um so it came to an unceremonious end then, Ellie. What happened to you after that?

Ellie Gibson
22:46
So yeah, the magazine folded and then they offered me a job on Simply Cards and Papercraft. And again, how different history might have been if I'd accepted that. Then I think I came home. Oh that's right. No, I went on a press trip. I went on a press trip to Paris. The magazine had folded, but Kat Shannon um was like just come on the press trip anyway. So I met her and then I met Tom Bramwell, who was um on Eurogamer. I don't think he was the editor back then, but he was working on Eurogamer. Um and I met him at a dinner there and we had a a good laugh. and became friendly and then and then it turned out Eurogamer were looking for a staff writer. So I had an interview with them and then got the job. Newswriter it was news, yeah. So So that's that was that.

Samuel
23:28
Oh okay. Well that's uh exciting. So I have an absolute ton of questions to ask you about Eurogamer, but we're going to take a very quick break and we'll uh we'll come back with that. So uh uh thanks for uh taking us through your uh early part of your career, Ellie. So it was a weird end to that section. Uh yeah, well we'll keep this bit in Matthew so the listeners know that I'm self aware about how weird that um that outro was. Alright, I'll jump back in. I love this breaking the fourth wall.

Ellie Gibson
23:56
This is very strong. Very good.

Samuel
23:59
It's it's all we have in lieu of like a professional podcast, so it's um it is what we have. Welcome back to the podcast. So we're gonna ask Ellie all about her career at Eurogamer here. So I suppose to go a bit more in detail with your Eurogamer hiring in 2005. I I think it was 2005 early according to a uh gamesed. biz story I read about your your hiring. Maybe it's MCV actually. Um so how did you um you talked a bit about the press trip there. Did you have to do anything else to get the job? Was there like a more intensive interview process? What was the setup like at Eurogamer at the time?

Ellie Gibson
24:48
Well, there wasn't really much of a setup at all, really. So when I joined Eurogamer, yeah, I think it would have been about two thousand five, there wasn't really an office. There was like Rupert's parents' garage, which was attached to their house in Brighton, and then there were some sort of desks and computers and men in there, and they were that was Eurogamer. um really. Um like you you'd be hearing Barbara putting the casserole on for the dinner while you were trying to write your news stories. So um it was very nice. Um so there was that and then so I met my interview was with uh Rupert who Rupert Lohman, who was the founder um with his brother of Eurogamer, and Pat Garrett, who has come on. Um so Pat was a famous a sort of legendary rock and roll journalist, possibly the ultimate like, you know, rock and roll journalist who I think once went missing off the coast of Alcatraz or something, but turned up just to his drunk. Anyway, uh he could tell his own stories. So I they I met them in a hotel and and and they interviewed me and uh I think I might have had to do some practice news stories or show them some writing or something. But then that was it. And then and at the time I had no money. I was living with my parents. So I was just in my little bedroom and I think I had to do eight to ten news stories a day. So I was in my childhood bedroom typing up stories about video games, which was sort of a dream come true in a funny way. Um So because uh a at that time, like I remember Pat quite clear, I remember him saying, I don't care where you work, you know, as long as you get the work done. The hours I kind of had to have set hours because video games news then it was always about being first and getting it done within sort of working hours. But but it was quite radical at the time. Most of us work from home and that was quite radical at the time. Now it's like it's bloody normal, isn't it? But um Mm. I remembered being quite like, oh the freedom of that to just go, yeah, you can you can work in Jamaica for all you care, I don't care. Um, that was quite fun. But then I had I learned after about a friend of mine who also worked from home said to me, you have to put shoes on every day. You have to find a reason to put shoes on. Otherwise you s you do descend into like not washing and like especially if you're working in the room when you're living where you're living that can be quite depressing. So I had to work out oh no, you have to get up, you have to get washed, you have to, you know, put mascara on. Uh obviously you don't you don't. Uh um but um I it took me about a year to sort of get my head round the the discipline of that yeah.

Matthew
27:23
Hmm.

Samuel
27:24
Did you uh sort of see Eurogamer as sort of disruptors a little bit at the time just because coming from print media background and going straight into something that's quite quite different, you know, walking a past the little chef every day and to work with a bunch of, you know, blokes making magazines to being in your room typing up, you know, for this basically new media platform was Uh was there that kind of like feeling that you were on the cutting edge or did it feel a bit more sort of hobbyist than that?

Well, it was funny because I hadn't because I hadn't come from future publishing. Or what was the other one? Imagine. Imagine. Yeah, I I did get offered a job on Imagine, I think. And then they or maybe it was an interview. And then they rang me and said, um, I'll just let you know it's £8,000 a year. And I was like, I can't I can't live on that. I can't that's that's hilarious. So it's like no. But anyway, uh so yeah, so I didn't I wasn't coming from that background and and the the magazine I worked on in Macclesville was a bit of a cowboy outfit. and it was all a bit of spit and saw dust. So it definitely felt like we were well literally people from Future would say things like that to reprint into us at parties that we were just little boys in our bedroom. And we sort of were, you know. Um that wasn't totally unfair, but there was definitely this slightly sneery, it's a bit of a joke, you know, magazines like people would say things like our magazines would be around forever. People just like physical media, though there's, you know, like Um, there was a bit of that. And we just kind of we weren't sitting in our bedrooms going, we're gonna show them who's boss. We were like, we're just gonna get our heads down and like do the work and and it'll sort of work out and it and it did.

Samuel
29:03
It changed so fast as well, because you joined in two thousand five, but I feel like I I joined Games Media in two thousand seven and by then Eurogamers already Quite a big deal it felt like. So did it feel like things were were changing quickly while you were there? Like that were you seeing like the audience grow? Was it becoming a more professional outfit or was it you know, at what point does it stop being like some blokes in a garage and the casserole et cetera? etc.

Ellie Gibson
29:25
Oh, have golden days. Yes, it did. It did um like the numbers the numbers would would would go up basically Basically, as Pat would say, the numbers are going up. Uh that was sort of his catchphrase. As long as Pat was saying that, everything seemed to be alright. Pat was Pat was basically just our dad. Do you know what I mean? And as long as Dad said everything was fine, it was fine. Um there was quite a long period of time where like I remember we used to have monthly editorial meetings where we would meet up once a month and we u used to just have them in people's houses. Like we had one in my house once, I think it made a spaghetti bolognese. It was so it was like that. But then I do and we got the office in Brighton, um, and then I think they're in a bigger office. a bigger office after that and but even then it was still optional. You know, you didn't kind of have to go in. At least if you're on the editorial team, I don't know if it changed. But a lot of them did. A lot of them did like living in Brighton and liked being together. So it became like a serious a serious thing. There was a sense of that. There was always a sense of we are building something. We are it wasn't really about beating anyone else or you know getting rid of magazines. But there was this idea, we're gonna build this thing, and we're all in it together, and we're all working really hard, and somehow it all just sort of sort of come good. It'll be fine.

Samuel
30:43
Yeah, so you start as news editor at this this point where the three sixty era is kicking off and that the PS3 would launch in um 2007 over here and the Wii would launch in uh 2006. Was it exciting to come into that that sort of generation? What did you make of the industry at that time?

Ellie Gibson
30:59
Oh, it was amazing. It was a brilliant time to be uh joining and and doing all doing news especially because just something mental happened every day. So there was something to write about. And that you had all these characters in games, you know, you had all these people bitching each other out and you had like you had like big executives like David Reeves. You'd go and interview him and you knew at some point he'd just say something nutty and you'd be like, Brilliant. It was it was just really re I remember him getting up and like singing Wing Winds of Change at Gamescom or something. Like it was just mad. So I loved that and I loved you know, news is really about conflict, isn't it? Even video games news. So to so to to have this sort of these console wars and and then you had these new emergency emerging technologies. You had like the Connect and the Wii and all this stuff and It felt like a really exciting time definitely to be in games and to be writing about games for sure.

Samuel
31:55
What sort of games from around that period were important to you? Do you remember?

Ellie Gibson
31:59
Oh no, you've put me remind me what games were around that period.

Samuel
32:04
Uh uh uh Dead Space, um I don't know apologize for Video games two thousand seven For context for the listeners I did not put this in our episode plan. Quite a lot of my questions I've not put in the episode plan actually and I've just been ambushing Ellie with those questions. So I do apologise Ellie to for springing this on you, but um

Ellie Gibson
32:26
No, I'm just looking up. Uncharted, that was quite good. Uh, but really it's just a shit Lara Croft, isn't it? Um yeah. Uh Super Mario Galaxy, that was shit. Uh Bioshock is sort of alright, I suppose. Mass Effect very dull. Um Assassin's Creed, yeah, quite good. Uh B movie game, I'm sure that was an absolute classic. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games! Oh I mean it was a fun game, but more importantly, I got to go to Vancouver and um Watch uh people in Mario and Sonic costumes uh try to get round an ice rink, which was hilarious. So Yeah, golden golden dimes.

Matthew
33:16
I went to a Marion Sonic at the London Olympic Games reveal event inside the Tower of London. where they made Jonathan Edwards, the Olympian, compete against a look-alike of the Queen at Marion Sonic.

Ellie Gibson
33:33
It was this is what I'm saying. You wouldn't have that now. That was a happier, simpler time and video games didn't take themselves too seriously. I went to some Tomb Raider thing and they had Chris Barry being the butler. It was brilliant. He's gone over now, isn't he? He's gone absolutely batshit. Uh if only if only he's been frozen in time, like a hologram, ironically.

Samuel
33:57
Amazing. Um I feel like there was a moment in the late noughties where it felt like Eurogamer just became the centre of conversation in games, which I was super jealous of being on a magazine that no one read at the time. Um in fact I think I can even like isolate it down to a specific event. It was Ollie Welsh, I was on the same Metal Gear Solid 4 review event as him. And I just got the impression that maybe it was the way PRs are chatting to him and just like the way he was talking about the website that year ago would become this Huge deal. What was it like to be caught in that maelstrom where, you know, giving out a controversial score could become a massive event? Like, do you remember the moment you felt like, oh, this has blown up now and it's actually like Everything's kind of like popping off.

Ellie Gibson
34:35
Well, nobody ever treated me with that degree of respect and reverence. I mean you've met Ollie Welsh. It's impossible. Partly because he is he's half Swiss, but also he's just got this sort of air of continental sophistication the rest of us could only hope to emulate. You just sort of naturally respect him. I don't really command that in people. I often command sort of just general distaste. uh because of my vulgarity. So it's a different I'm sure I've I've what w what it was like to be him, it must have been fucking amazing. Uh I used to get things like, I had Nintendo complain that I had been tasked with reviewing Wii Fit 2. Like Because because why was it? I can't even remember now. It was obviously sexist, but they dressed it up as some other bullshit. Um Uh they uh I think they said I wasn't a target market and I was like, I'm a 35-year-old woman. Who is your target market if it's not me? Um and I think they might have said I was too much of a hardcore gamer, but again I was like, I can't even get through the door in Gears of War. What are you talking about? So yeah, it was it was different. Um so yeah, but no, I definitely the the publication commanded that level of of respect. And I think deservedly, because the serious proper reviewers did take it really seriously, and Ollie and Tom and and all the others did a did amazing words. I mean I can't write like Tom Bramwell and Ollie Welsh and it was sort of the day I realised that it was it was pointless trying. was the day that I found my voice and my sort of stuff took off a little bit really. So yeah, it's not to say I can't review a game or tell a good game from a shit one, but um I th I'm not articulate in that particular way in that style. So I have just as much respect for them as a as the people who were licking their balls at that Metal Gear Solid event, I expect. Although I wouldn't ever do that to them or say that even to their face.

Samuel
36:44
Yeah, that's not entirely how I remember that event, but uh yeah. Uh it hey. So how how did you figure out your voice on the site? Uh were you really any games media around that time that informed how you felt you were supposed to write, or was it just about you tapping into something within yourself that other people didn't have? Basically.

Ellie Gibson
37:03
I yeah, I think that the latter I mean I started off but I was reading a lot of other stuff. I mean I had cause I was writing news, especially you reading stuff all day. And I would read reviews and stuff and obviously I'd read the read the reviews on Eurogamer because they were brilliant. Bas It was it was Pat Garrett who said to me, you know, stop stop trying to write like everybody else. You know, when you're talking to me you're you're really funny. um and just just write like you're talking to me. And that was a proper, you know, Oprah style light bulb moment. I thought, oh right, yeah, no, that's That's all right. And I think I think I was trying to, yeah, like write like the the proper grown up reviewers. And I think I was trying to write like a boy. And I think I was trying to, you know, keep my stupid jokes to myself a bit and many people wish I had done that and continued in that vein. However, the the beast could not be tamed So here we are. Yeah, so that really was a huge uh life changing moment for me and then I just sort of go, Oh, it's all right. It's all right to take this. And then sometimes I think that clashed a bit right. So when I wrote the Adam Wake review, I think I I'd made people didn't like that There were so many j I described one of the vehicles as being like um sounding like a bear having a wank. And some people really like that and thought it was funny and some people found it slightly offensive what I don't know. And I think it ended up being edited out of the review and then by popular demand it was put back in. Cause you could do that online, right? You could do you could just take shit out. I think it went back in. So it Yeah, I don't know how I feel about that now. I stand by that the score I gave that game though and what I said about that game. Uh I think it was I gave it seven, which is a good score, right?

Samuel
38:45
Yeah, I I think i if anything that review was a great tonic to you know, other people's reception of Alan Wake being like, oh, a game that taps into Lynch and all this stuff. And I think that that is the has been the prevailing consensus of that game. But your review was very wary of the the very obvious pop culture references in it. And I just thought that was really at the time it really stood out to me as like a you know a great take on a game I didn't necessarily agree with, you know. So yeah, I think it stood the test of time that that

Ellie Gibson
39:15
Oh well thank you. What you're saying is history's proved me right. I'll take that. I'll go with that. Yeah. That's what that's what I've heard from what you've just said.

Samuel
39:22
Um I' Well despite your best efforts they have made another one, Ellie. Are you gonna play Allen Wake too?

Ellie Gibson
39:26
I am, I've just downloaded it today. I'm very excited because obvious I think Kit's moved on a lot and I think Epic knows what they're doing, you know. So Uh I haven't played it yet, but I'm quite I'm quite excited. Have you played it?

Samuel
39:38
No, I haven't. Um Matthew, have you played it yet?

Matthew
39:40
I've I've played an hour of it and I I walked around a forest looking at some Uh pretty amazing mist.

Ellie Gibson
39:48
Well that sounds like a trip to Centre Park, so that sounds ideal.

Matthew
39:53
Yeah, the cars sound the cars sound good. No sort of bare wank sound patch, so

Samuel
39:58
That's what all the people wanted to know about Alan Wake too, so that's uh that's good. Um yeah, so I did want to ask a bit more about your writing at um Eurogamer Ellie, because um uh as mentioned the Alan Wake review really stood with me. It's you know stayed with me, but I think in general the fact that a site was so big at the time and that I think you, Ollie and Tom and, you know, your other writers, you did ac you were able to establish personalities in a way that I don't think is always that easy to do on a website. It's actually like very easy to be this just one voice a amid this amorphous blob of like, let's face it, blokes most of the time. But you know, it's sort of um I think that you just you really did stand out. Uh no doubt you got a lot of shit for it, um, for, you know, your writing style, but It was super confident. I I was curious if there are any other pieces from your time when Euro Gamer that you're particularly proud of.

Ellie Gibson
40:45
Um I really I'm really proud of the uh long form pieces that I did. So I did one about Games Master, the history of Games Master. I did one about um the PlayStation 2 I think coming out and what it was like to be at PlayStation. at that time and I did one about Gizmondo and they were great because they took me um long time to do but I had total freedom to do them and enough time to do them and that's one of I think one of the great editorial sort of clever moves at Eurogamer that that they just said, Yeah, no, go and interview who you want. They trust me to go and talk to these people and then smush it all together into these long form pieces and I think they stand up. I I do I do like them and I think they've got good jokes in them. So uh I'm I'm happy with them. But the Gizmonde one especially took me years to write because I did all the interviews and stuff and then I was writing it up. And I I um it was four days before my due date with my first baby and I actually went into Labour and I rang Ollie saying Oh uh I I don't know if I'm gonna finish this gizmondo peace in time. And he's like, what? And I was like, well I know, I said I would get it done before the baby comes, but I think it's a bit late. And he went, Are you asking me to for permission to have a deadline extension because you're having a baby? And I was like, Yep, I am And he went that that's that's fine, you can go to the hospital now. So I wrote that when I came back from maternity leave. Um but yes, it was it was really fun.

Samuel
42:18
Okay, so This is uh this is the big question I suppose, Ellie. What kind of press trip or interview stories can you share f share with us from the time?

Ellie Gibson
42:26
Oh man. So it was the it was the good old days, it really was. There was and I went on so many, because Kristen, who was the editor for for a long time, he had a little kid as well, so he couldn't get away. I used to used to go away all the bloody time. The most extravagant one was, I don't know, do I remember this? It was when um it was for the Scarface game.

Matthew
42:48
Right.

Ellie Gibson
42:48
And they hired, and Vivendi was in the the death rows, right? So they were going under. They knew they were going under. And it was just like, let's just spend the money. We've still got it. So they hired they flew, I think, ninety percent of European media to Spain and they hired a whole hotel on the Costa del Sol. And they they even paid for like all the guests in the hotel to be moved to another hotel. But there was this one Scottish family that refused to leave. And And then they they had all this mad shit like in all the corners of the hotel, like the lobby and the corridors and stuff, they put motion-activated speakers. So when you walked past you'd have a line from the movie, like you'd have Tony Montana going, I'm gonna fucking fuck you up you f I mean, I can't remember, I don't know if I've even seen Scotty But I came down like I walked through a reception one morning and this Scottish bloke was at reception going My eight-year-old's just been told to fuck off by a speaker! And I was just saying Um My hotel room had three floors and a couple of bedrooms and it overlooked the pool which was really nice. And then they had like there was like a seafood buffet. It's where I met Ollie Welsh actually, uh, 'cause he was obviously fitting right in being so European. And I had like this this I interviewed like all these people on the beach and stuff next to the champagne and seafood buffet and then like a helicopter flew over and dropped Tony Montana's body into the sea. And then that night there was a pool party and there were naked women painted to look like tigers. in the cages around the pool. But in those days in those days you were just like, Oh, that was a naked bird, you know what I mean? It just wasn't I'm not saying it was okay, I'm saying it sort of seemed okay at the time.

Matthew
44:40
Right, right.

Ellie Gibson
44:42
And I said to the PR, like, fuck it hell, like you've got you've got naked birds in cages and she went, Yeah, we weren't allowed um tigers 'cause of animal cruelty laws. Even in Spain you can't do it apparently. And the other plan was that they were gonna have these um big silver platters everywhere of what looked like cocaine, but they they decided not to do that. because um they were worried some pissed journalists might think it was cocaine and start snorting the flour or whatever the fuck it was to die So that was amazing. That was a good one. But then see I didn't go on this press trip, but um the best headline I ever wrote was Sony to conduct inquiry into dead goat incident. Right. They had a thing for God of War II, I think it was, in Greece, and they had like a big Greek banquet, um, which included on on the display a goat with its throat slit draining bloods. And like some people there were uh animal rights people were upset, I think, not completely unreasonably. So I had to like ring like lovely Hugo at Sony and like with a straight face he had to tell me that they would be conducting an inquiry.

Samuel
46:06
Yeah. We heard the um the other side of that story from um Tim Clark, who was running OPM at the time, because he had to have it pulled from their magazine. He ran it in the mag and then they had to like basically get it off shelves. And he almost lost his job over it. Oh no. Yeah, yeah, it was really intense. I thought the goat was the one that suffered.

Ellie Gibson
46:26
Jesus.

Samuel
46:28
No. Oh Tim. Yeah, yeah. But you're right, like that was uh like that's the story that that's a perfect summary of that age, right? So uh yeah. Um any others come to mind, Ellie?

Ellie Gibson
46:39
Oh, there well there was lo I mean, so I went on one to um Romania for black. Do you remember the gun game that the the burnout that the Criterion people made? Um I liked it actually, I thought it was a good game Yeah, so I went to Romania and on the first night I was there with um I ended up in a Romanian strip club which again at the time was pretty just standard. Um and I remember there were two PRs there and the lady one suddenly went, Oh, Ellie, I'm I'm the the the male one disappeared behind a curtain, right? And we all know what goes on behind the curtain in the strip. And uh the lady PR said, Ellie, I'm going to bed. Um you you will have to you will have to deal with this. Uh here's the money. And she gave me an envelope of cash. Because this was like Romania in like 2006, right? Like there there was no fucking bloody paper, whatever, Wi-Fi. Anyway. So she gave me this rod of money. And I was like, oh shit, okay. And I was absolutely smashed. But I was like, all right, fine. Um, and then I went to the ladies, and then there was this knock on the door, and it was the male PR going, Ellie, have you got the money? And I was like, Yeah, she's given me the money. And he's like, Ca can I have I need I need some money and I was like, How much do you need? And he was like All all all of the money. So she'd given me the whole money for the whole press trip And I had to give it to him so he could pay off the strippers and their boss so that we could get out of the strip club and not get stabbed. So that was a bit stressful. And then like they had to borrow money off us and stuff to pay for the rest of the rest.

Samuel
48:25
Oh my word. Wow. It was These are more like GTA missions, you know, like that's that's the vibe here that you know.

Ellie Gibson
48:32
That's uh Um That was that, but then the next day and then the next day we had to do all this stuff. The next day was like the adventure bit. Um so they were like, oh okay, we've hired so they took us to this sort of Romanian warehouse and they were like um oh oh in that corner there's a load of guns. So you can just go and fire some guns into the wall and in in that corner, um, there's like a stunt course and these men worked the stunt men for James Bond. Um so you have to and I was like, Oh fucking hell and you had to like jump through a ring of fire and um you had to like land I can't remember land on a i in a foam thing. Um and I and I did it, you know, because I wanted to be part of the team and then I I violently threw up because I was incredibly hungover. Um so yeah, it was it was a glorious time.

Samuel
49:20
Did you get any sort of like big interviews at the time? Like did you do you have like levels of access being on Eurogamer to, you know, like notable devs, uh that sort of thing?

Ellie Gibson
49:30
Yes, I'm trying to think now. Who did I do? I used I did Peter Molyneux a few times, um, which was quite funny. Um, but like Hideo Kojima, that would always be like Tom and stuff. Trying to think, but I I worked on I was the editor of gamesindustry. biz as well, so I used to get quite a lot of exec interviews and I used to talk to people like Phil Harrison. Um, Phil Harrison, I can't remember what I asked him but I once asked him a very weird question. He gave me the death stare and there was a moment when I thought he was gonna frame me out, which uh know he'd done to other people, but then we're we got over it. So there was him and like Peter Moore I did a few times and I quite like the exec interviews. Um Because and I hope they find they found me refreshing because I couldn't take them very seriously either. Uh couldn't sit there and ask them about their fucking share price. So um it was good. It was good fun. Yeah.

Samuel
50:19
So I I did want to ask about your Gizmondo piece. So twenty twelve you you sort of told the whole s the complete story of this weirdo Ye thing. Can you talk about about that story and un unraveling that that whole tale?

Ellie Gibson
50:31
Yeah, well I was always fascinated by um the Gizmondo and I'd been quite into it. Like I thought I'd sort of fell for it a bit. I thought, oh yeah, this because to be fair to it as well, you've got to remember this was like pre-iPhone, right? And it was novel this idea of having this device. which you could use to send messages and look at maps and do games. We obviously think that's totally normal now, but it was quite a new idea. So I was sort of into it but then I sort of became aware that it didn't work. And then I sort of when I started writing news about it, I was like, oh no, it's quite possibly a massive money laundering scheme allegedly for the Swedish mafia. So I find that quite fascinating. It was just such a great story because it had all these mad characters in it and these nutty subplots and these characters who didn't e you know, fictional characters didn't even exist in real life getting blamed for crashing Ferraris in America. Like it would just went I mean I won't recap it all now 'cause it's too bonkers. So it was great to to be able to write about it and to track down some of the people involved. One of them wasn't really happy when the article came out. He he messaged me and was like I thought you were gonna tell the real story of Gizmondo and, you know, you just fallen for the idea like all the journalists do and you're saying it's rubbish and my kids are gonna read this one day and what are they gonna think and And I felt bad for about a minute and then I thought, you know, you know when you have to have a word with yourself and go, oh, I'm feeling this criticism a little bit. Is it fair? And then I was like No, because I didn't I really didn't go into it going, I'm gonna smash this thing to bits. I was genuinely like, this is a fascinating story and I wanna unpick it a bit and try and get to the truth. And I'm not sure that I I even did or that that's possible, but I still think it's a great story. And it's I think it's one of those things where I think that bloke probably did believe his own hype, maybe, you know. So I don't think he's necessarily a bad man. I think he I think he per perhaps was doing his best, but I'm I don't know. And I feel bad for him if he if he's you know but he can just tell his kids I'm a stupid bitch and that's fine. I don't mind what he says.

Matthew
52:45
That's very very tactfully but I don't think I've even ever seen a gismondo in the first I've got one, I've still got mine. What's the best gos gizmondo game?

Samuel
52:53
Sticky balls We were just passing the name. Sorry, that was the pause. Sorry, Ellie.

Ellie Gibson
53:00
Sticky balls. Um yeah, I think it was like a was it a snooker game? I don't know, it had balls in it obviously. There was only about six games ever produced for it. There was a gang one called Colours, I think it was called. Uh yeah, sticky balls was was

Samuel
53:18
Well it's it's funny as well because that's in some ways like the ultimate sort of like naughty you know gaming thing to unpick, right? Loads of money and a hype. kind of you know, a massive bust at the center of it, preposterous hardware. Like the whole thing is kind of like a a perfect sort of narrative of that time, you know? So um Yeah, I really recommend it. It's a horse named Gizmondo is the name of the piece. It's uh still up on Eurogamer. So uh yeah. Um so why did you ultimately move on from Eurogamer, Ally, and did you ever miss it afterwards?

Ellie Gibson
53:49
Well again this is a very feminist thing to say, but I had some babies and that fucked everything. Couldn't be bothered to go work no more. No, not really. I uh I had my first baby and then I went back uh like a couple of days a week and obviously in that it was impossible to be like I think I uh the plan was I was gonna go back and be the editor, but I didn't want to go back full time and it just yeah, it didn't work out. So I ended up like I did my Gismondo thing and then I wrote I started doing some videos for YouTube and it just turned out I wasn't very good at those. I a low point was So I used to do these sort of let's plays where I would play a game with um, you know, a comedian or a developer or something. And I invited Peter Molyneux to come to my house and play Dungeon Keeper with me. Because it was one of my favourite games. And amazingly he agreed. And I was like, really? And they were like, yeah, no, he's definitely going to I was like, okay, great. And like for weeks I was like, is this really happening? And they're like, yep, yep, yep, it's in the diary. Yep, yep, yep. Even the day before, the morning of, it was like, yep, no, he's he's definitely coming.

Samuel
54:55
Uh and then two hours before it was like, Yeah, no he's not gonna Another broken moly promise.

Ellie Gibson
55:02
And uh I had all the stuff set up and I you know and it's a funny thing, after you've you've had a baby and you're only working two days a week and you're trying to find your feet and trying to work out what your job is and where you are, you know, time is really precious and and you're really I couldn't just afford to go, Oh well, I'll just work on something else or, you know, I had to produce a video that week. So I was like, what am I gonna do? And there was a coconut in my fruit bowl. So I just drew a face on it and just said that was Peter Molyneux. And I think me and the coconut played Dungeon Keeper or something. I can't remember what we did exactly. But um yeah, and that and that was, you know, kind of kind of it I d I just didn't know what else to do and it was kind of funny and silly. But it was a low point and I thought, I don't what am I doing? I don't know what this is anymore.

Matthew
55:51
And then I got pregnant. It's when you're looking deep into the eyes of a pen uh pen drawn on eyes of a coconut.

Ellie Gibson
55:58
Yeah, when you're looking at coconut Peter Molyneux and you're pregnant with your second child and you just sort of think, What have I become? Um What's this for? I'm no good at this. So uh and again I think it's one of those timing things. I think it's funny, I think if Twitch had been around then I wonder if I might have found my feet. Because it was the editing that was killing me really. And yeah. Anyway. So I left Eurogamer and I had my baby and it was around uh it was before that actually while I was still at Eurogamer that I started doing comedy and I met this woman called Helen Thorne and we ended up forming this double act and it started to get a bit more successful and the podcast started to get a bit more successful and even make a little bit of money and it just reached a point where I thought, well, if I'm gonna give this comedy, this scummy mummies thing a proper go, I need that time to do this. And She was very happy uh when I when I left. So yeah, that's that's what happened basically.

Matthew
56:54
Had you ever done uh this isn't really about games, but ha had you ever done sort of stand-up comedy by yourself.

Ellie Gibson
57:01
So yeah, so I did a comedy, a stand-up course when Charlie would have been about nine months old. I think I did this comedy course. Um basically because it was like I wanted to see if I could do it right and I thought it'd be a laugh but it really wasn't like and that would be my new job. That was not the plan. I was like, I'll go and see if I can do it, because I've always wondered if I can do it. And it's in a pub on a Monday night. So I've got an excuse to go to the pub once a week. Which again, when you've been at home with a baby for nine months and sober for nine months prior to that, that's really exciting. Like has As an opportunity, that's the dream. So I went and did um this course and really loved it and had a great time.

Matthew
57:38
What is a stand-up comedy course like?

Ellie Gibson
57:40
What they do is they get a load of custard pies. And you stand up and then I they I did my course with a guy called Chris Head who still does them and he's great and I highly recommend his his course. I think he does them online as well now. But yeah, so you go And what I loved about it as well is it's a real mixed bag of people. So I was nervous. I thought, oh, it's gonna be like all these people who are really funny and they're all, you know, they'll all be doing their first Edinburgh show and then all be professional professional comedians and it was a completely mixed bag. There was a couple of those people, but there was also like a bloke called Tim who was sixty five who, you know, just worked in IT and just wanted to do it for a laugh. And, you know, there was a girl who was doing it for a bet. and there was a girl who'd been doing it because it was a birthday present because someone said, You're funny, here's your present. And and one night I was doing a bit and I said, Hey, any fundamentalist Christians in the room? Because I was about to do some very funny stuff about dinosaurs. And uh these two men put their hands up and went, yeah. It's like what are the fucking chances? What are the chances But they were lovely men and we, you know, we disagree on religion, but we're still friends, we still chat now. So um and I love that it was all different backgrounds and walks of life and And that was really uh Yeah. But how they teach you, so you go and and Chris will be like, Right, okay, um your first week's homework is to write sixty seconds. of material. And I remember that seeming like the hardest thing in the world to write sixty seconds of jokes. And actually it is hard. And actually some people stood up and said things for sixty seconds, none of which were funny. But it didn't matter because in that environment everybody's rooting for each other and you're all in the same boat and it just it didn't feel ever like a competition. It felt like a funny little club, you know. And and that sort of gives you confidence. And then when you did get up and say something funny and people laughed, it was like, oh right, hang on. you know. So you just build up from there. So the next week you have to do two minutes and then the next week you might look at that and go, Well what's the funniest bit in what you've just done? What can we pull out of there? And and then you learn basic stuff like mic technique and tips and tricks and how to come up with ideas and stuff like that. So it's really good it's a really great course, yeah.

Matthew
59:58
You have to be very brave to do something like that, I think. Uh you know, I really enjoy watching comedy and but I could never, I could never do it. I just think, oh Just how you get over that initial hump of like the risk of just eating it in front of people, I just c oh I couldn't deal with it.

Ellie Gibson
01:00:13
Well You you do it enough and it just doesn't hurt anymore. You know, I think I think that's that's part of it and and to this day w Helen and I have been doing it over ten years and we'll write a joke that we think is fucking hilarious and we'll be sitting in my kitchen Slapping our thighs, sewing each other's sides up, rolling round on the floor. Amazing. We'll go out and we'll do it on stage and no one will laugh. Like, we'll be like, what the fuck? But the rule is we do it three times. And if I've if we really think it's funny we'll we'll try it in three shows and if people don't like it. Whereas on the other hand, we'll be like on stage one night and like one of us will do the usual punch line and the other one will say four words off the cuff on top of it and people will be rolling in the aisles and we're like, oh, all right. And then that goes in the show. So I've learned it's it's not It's not an art. It's not a science, rather. You know, it's not an art either really. But it's it's it's not something you can pred it's not alchemy. It's Yeah. And I think video games actually was good training for that. You know, how'd how I've been told I wasn't funny for many years. So to stand in front of people not laughing was just like, well, at least they're not calling me a lesbian bitch.

Matthew
01:01:33
That's fine. I think 'cause I think games it's full of really funny people. Like it's it's one of my favourite things about having done this job all these years as ever you know

Ellie Gibson
01:01:56
I think so. That's why I used to love press trips as well, because You'd be hanging out with these people you had this shared common interest with, you knew all the same people, but also they were just really funny. And I just loved it.

Matthew
01:02:06
Yeah. I think I've met like twenty people I'd be like, oh yeah, that person should be on stage, but no one. We all just hide in magazine and Box out box out instead. That's what you do.

Ellie Gibson
01:02:18
But the brave thing as well, like people say that to me and Helen a lot. Oh you're so especially because we wear skin tight gold cat suits. You know, oh you're so brave, it's so brave. And and we always say, I don't think because d bravery means you have something, right? You have courage, you have bravery. It's an absence of something. thing and that absence is shame. Like it's just right. It's just sort of reaching a point where you go I don't even if I go up there and I do this and it goes badly, I'm alright with that. I'm going to be okay. And and that's not to say it doesn't hurt. That's not to say it doesn't hurt. Um it it it can hurt But it's about going, yeah, it's gonna hurt for a little bit, but then it's gonna be okay again and it doesn't define me as a person, it doesn't shatter my entire self-image or my whole, you know, um sort of view of myself. myself if I if I fuck this. So yeah.

Samuel
01:03:17
So Matthew, something happened to us which has never happened in the history of this podcast. We've had bad guest microphones, we've had bad guests. I'm only joking, we haven't had bad guests. We have. We don't talk about that. Um no, it's um it's uh unfortunate basically Ellie's uh audacity recording crashed when we got to the end of this episode. And so the last 12 minutes of audio were essentially cut off. They are like the lost tapes now of the back page. So um you can talk like they're like the deleted scenes from Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me. I was disappointed, Matthew, because the one good joke I made, I think I made in this episode was in that bit, which is um Ellie was telling this story about uh this woman in a sh community she streams on twitch Ellie um and she was talking about how uh on her Discord this woman was talking about these candles that she makes that basically someone sends some jizz um to her and then they they get mixed into the candles basically and that's part of what they sell.

Matthew
01:04:15
It's kind of spicy.

Samuel
01:04:16
It was and I said Matthew a new pod merch idea just dropped and it was the best joke in that I'd made in the episode. And it's lost to time now, so not as good with me recapping it.

Matthew
01:04:26
But let the record let the record note that uh Samuel was very funny.

Samuel
01:04:32
Just that one time. Um so I I did want to recap what was discussed at the end because I don't want this to be a completely unsatisfying finale. Essentially, um Ellie is on tour at the moment. Um with a scummy mummies uh stand-up uh uh partnership essentially. God I sound like such a dinosaur describing it as a s I I love that I love that this is our approach to fixing this.

Matthew
01:04:53
This is like If you went to the cinema and like the fifth reel on the film broke and then so about two hours into Oppenheimer, a man from Odeon comes out and goes, Right guys I can't show you the end of Oppenheimer, but I am gonna tell you about it. So, and then he just has to remember it.

Samuel
01:05:11
It does have that energy, yeah.

Matthew
01:05:13
There's a lake and I think Einstein's there.

Samuel
01:05:17
Yeah, he doesn't build another bomb, he's done after that. You know, he's sort of like it's yeah, he's fine, he walks away. So I'm gonna recap what we discussed at the end. So as we as we nicely tied a bow on everything that we discussed in Eddie's career, um she talked about how she's moved into Twitch streaming essentially. and in doing so has built up this uh uh built rebuilt her interest in games after qu like a a lapsed period essentially of Building a comedy career and uh yeah, it was um It was i it was a it was a nice thing to talk about because you know, I think a lot of people

Matthew
01:05:51
who are in the industry eventually hit a kind of fatigue or they burn out on games a bit or they end up having a sort of weirdly kind of combative relationship with games but are still kind of covering them or working with them and Actually the idea of like stepping away for a bit as she did to become, you know, a standard comedian um means that you know that that that you can then come back to them and have that renewed. I I'm not I'm not saying I'm at that that negative point with games necessarily, but it does kind of give you hope that your relationship with games can kind of flow a bit more.

Samuel
01:06:25
I think so. I think that is a real thing, you know, because I I know someone who is caught up in the industry uh sort of layoff uh sort of nightmare that's happening at the moment. And she was telling me that she thinks if she leaves games and builds a career elsewhere, she'll be able to enjoy games again. And I thought that was quite interesting, the idea that like, you know. uh by being too close to it you're essentially overexposed to it. Like the um right the analogy that uh Ellie used was that when she couldn't she did an English literature degree and then after uh reading books constantly for I don't know three years or whatever it was basically just couldn't read a book for about a year after that. I just couldn't like bear the thought of it because it wasn't you know it wasn't like a leisurely activity anymore. was essentially what felt like work. So yeah, that was quite an interesting uh analogy. And uh that led into a discussion about Assassin's Creed Valhalla. And also her takes on Assassin's Creed Mirage, which she's enjoying. I brought up that Matthew didn't enjoy, wasn't enjoying Mirage as much. Was there any other details we should recap there, Matthew?

Matthew
01:07:23
Um she told a funny story about a line of NPC dialogue from Assassin's Creed Mirage where she was running away and someone said Oi, come back here, you shit bird. Yeah. Um which was much funnier when she told it.

Samuel
01:07:38
That's the thing, the difference between a professional comedian and uh two guys talking on a b podcast so yeah that was um there was that then there was quite a long discussion about Jerome Flynn who people probably know uh this podcast listen to this podcast know from Game of Thrones He is um what was his name in Game of Thrones? I don't remember now. I've kind of erased that show for a moment. But yeah, Bronn. So you know, very fan favourite character. Uh Matthew talked about the idea that he'd shrunk. since the nineties when he was famous with Robson and Jerome. And there was a point where I think like it was it did this come about because Ellie said that one of her friends told a a joke about Robinson and Jerome to some 19 year olds and they just didn't know who the fuck that was.

Matthew
01:08:17
Yeah, and then yes, then I told a half remembered story about how I thought Robson Jerome had been through some kind of process by which he had physically changed. Um I told this in oh four full disclosure as it's deleted. I I half attempted this in the episode and then and then we got to the bottom of it in the post-episode wrap-up banter, which I probably would have added to of the original episode. What I thought was that Jerome Flynn had joined a cult which had shrunk him.

Samuel
01:08:47
Yeah, Matthew seemed to think he was smaller now, which was confusing.

Matthew
01:08:51
He had I just remember him being very he had a very square head and now he's got a very bony head. Yeah. Um and uh I feel like I have definitely watched shows with Jerome Flynn as he is now, where I've said to the person I'm watching it with one time as Catherine You won't believe who that is, that's Jerome Flynn from Soldier Soldier, who used to have a big square head, now look at him. And uh I looked it up a a while back because I was genuinely curious about this in the past, and there was this thing about He'd undergone quite a change in his life 'cause he'd been part of this religious sect for eight years and which is why he kind of vanished from TV for so long and then returned as this s oh I mean what actually happened was A man went away for eight years and aged eight years. Um which is exactly what's meant to happen. Yeah, he aged a real time. But in my mind, I was like, what the fuck happened to that guy?

Samuel
01:09:45
Yeah, and hadn't shrunk. And another cracking gag that was lost is that Matthew asserted that being part of a cult somehow lost, shrunk him, made him smaller. And I I disputed this detail because I couldn't find it. But there was a Daily Mail headline that said, uh, Jerome Flynn, I lost eight years of my life to a cult. And I said to Matthew, it doesn't say eight inches of his height. And uh we all laughed and again another great joke like not recorded and now you have to hear about it in retrospect.

Matthew
01:10:13
I feel it's important that we've recorded this little bit where we've explained how like witty and charming we were. and some of the jokes that really landed. I'm glad that we did get into the drone flynn of it all, because that had been troubling me for some time. This was the time to talk about it, sadly. Yeah. Um I'm also glad that uh Ellie really liked Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which I am also a fan of, but I feel like we we have to kind of enjoy it in secret because uh, you know, it's agreed upon by the gaming community that it's not as good as Origins or Odyssey where there are some of us sickos who love it.

Samuel
01:10:50
Oh well okay fair enough and uh you taught you said that there's uh a thing you can do where some blokes will wreck a cathedral if you press a button. That was a thing that came out.

Matthew
01:10:58
No, you blow a horn and all your Viking mates go on a rampage and and smash up a a monastery. That's like a thing that happens in that game a lot. Which is good. It was a good 15 minutes that we lost. Um now recapped in uh half arts form. I mean this is truly like This is a a truly disastrous end to this episode. It's not great. It's not it's it's it's runaground, I'll be honest. But um Sam, should we record another second ending? To put after this ending where we apologize for it.

Samuel
01:11:28
Yeah, okay, that might be good. I was gonna like give do the Ellie plug so because she talked to it. Oh yeah, that's important. Yeah, okay, so she's uh half of scummy mummies, she's at Ellie Gibson on Twitter. Um we agreed it's Twitter, not X. We had that whole discussion. Um Matthew read out his fucking he's got Matthew's got a different Twitter handle to his blue sky handle, and so now he has to read that out awkwardly every episode. Where where can people find you back? And then um Ellie is uh at twitch. tv slash Ellie Gibson um gaming. Is that right? Or games? It's games, yes. God, we're doing this so badly. At Ellie Gibson Games She made a joke about how um put she put games in there in case but there was some mistake of what she would be doing on Twitch. It was a joke about S Like there's a joke about it's like a nan on Twitch essentially. God I'm explaining this so badly.

Matthew
01:12:16
I really hope she doesn't listen back to this and us explaining jokes she told us. just die of embarrassment. Haven't talked about about not having shame in the episode, I think it's been put that to the test.

Samuel
01:12:29
Just just go and find Ellie Gibson on uh on Twitter and you'll find links to what of her stuff. It was lovely to be joined by her. Um thankfully we're back in our um our safe zone next week Matthew. Isn't next week two giant men play Final Fantasy 7 Disc 1? Is that what's coming up? Or do we have to move that back while you because you've been doing other stuff? What's the the deal with that?

Matthew
01:12:48
No, I've I've still got some of Disc One to play for sure. What what is Disc One?

Samuel
01:12:53
Disc one is basically takes you I think it takes you to the end of to when Aerith dies, that's basically what happens. Spoiler alert What?

Matthew
01:12:59
I I've made that joke before. Yeah.

Samuel
01:13:01
Uh yeah. Yeah, okay. So that is basically what it i you have to fit in.

Matthew
01:13:06
Do you know where you are now?

Samuel
01:13:07
Is there a big cannon where you are now?

Matthew
01:13:09
That's that's two weeks away. Isn't it?

Samuel
01:13:11
Yeah, it is. Yeah, we're recording this a little bit ahead of time, so it should be.

Matthew
01:13:14
It's lucky that that 2023 isn't full of amazing games I'd rather be playing.

Samuel
01:13:18
Okay, good. Well there you go. So um we uh this wet fart of an ending to the episode is over. However, I hope you enjoyed Ellie's um uh discussion of uh of her career because it was genuinely uh a delight to to hear from her.

Matthew
01:13:30
Great Scarface story. Fantastic, yeah.

Samuel
01:13:32
So that's that's that's top five press strip story. Definitely yeah. So um Matthew let's get out of here. We'll be back next week. Goodbye. Goodbye.
