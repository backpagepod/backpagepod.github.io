Hello and welcome to the back page X. XXL, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew, how's your weekend been? And uh what have you been up to? Because um I tried not to message you as much this weekend because I sent you about five months worth of podcast planning on Friday night and thought I'll give them a little break from the psychological damage.

Matthew
00:43
So how's it been? Yeah, I've been digesting the plans, uh excited for the plans, so that's all good. I've been playing a redacted video game that we'll be talking about um in the coming month. And I went to see Hamlet and had a a little weep as is uh the way in Hamlet.

Samuel
01:03
That is how you're supposed to experience that film for sure. Um and if you don't you hate it. Um it's an interesting film that that's really got a big divide I found between people. Um I saw the most disingenuous thing I saw was people saying it was the Amelia Perez of this year's Oscar season. Oh that's that's horseshit. Well they should fuck off those people. But um I did like it. Um I like Clo Zhao. And uh yeah, I mean I'm not I I don't really seek out kid content in stuff. I'm not really interested in people's kids, but um it was really, really well done and her style is very um I'm starting to feel like I start to identify what her style is now after seeing three of her films. I should really go back and watch her her other two films. But um yeah, it's good, isn't it? Um you you give a half a style estimate, so uh what didn't quite work about it for you.

Matthew
01:47
It has, without spoiling the specifics of it, it has quite a notable ending that everyone really likes that's really powerful. And maybe it was just because I knew the the rough shape of like what we were working towards and and how it was gonna conclude that I couldn't quite shake That everything felt like it was building up to that ending to make that ending work. But it was almost plodding, it's not the right word, but Th there was something about the inevitability of it. Like I d I just I don't know, I d I th I felt like I was ticking moments off and sort of counting down towards certain things that I knew had to happen. Um and that yeah, that was that was a weird thing. I don't know if I just read a little bit too much about it before I went in, which is sometimes the peril with these things. You know, there isn't a lot of plot to it. Um and yeah, that sort of I don't know. Being able to see the skeleton of it that way a little bit too clearly uh it sort of took me out at moments, but the ending is the funny thing about the ending, everyone's like Oh, it's like this huge like tearjerker of an ending and it got to that sort of final scene. And I was like, yeah, this is pretty sad, but I'm not really feeling it. And then I think you get to the bit which actually does get everyone, and you could hear everyone in the cinema go, you know, like it's as close a thing as I've seen to like Here's the exact moment this film will get you. Right. Which uh which I found you know quite powerful.

Samuel
03:24
Yeah. I d does sound like you knew a bit too much about it, because I didn't I don't really know anything about the structure of it when I went into it, so I didn't really know what happened when and about any kind of payoff or whatever. I just went and saw it the first weekend it came out. I just went and saw it because it was a close jaw basically and I heard the the Jesse Buckley performance was good. But um yeah, I think if I did have maybe if I went in with expectations I'd be there going countdown to character in my head.

Matthew
03:50
Uh much like watching a Liam Neeson film where you're waiting for his wife to get offed so he goes mentor with a gun. Oh, these people have to meet, then they have to have a kid, and then this will happen, then this will happen, and then we'll all have a big cry. Which is kind of what that film is

Samuel
04:08
It is, but then I don't know, what uh what do you want from it to like to massively subvert your expectations? Yeah, it's probably unfair. does risk generating like a polarized reception because it really is that thing of like if it doesn't get you then you are just you're probably quite angry about it. And I have had films where they they don't quite work. Or you have films like This is a really not that relevant an example, but it is like a tearjerker film. It's like Patch Adams, where every critic fucking hated it because it was really like pouring it on. It's like he's there with his like little clown nose and then that woman just gets killed by that patient and you're like, yep. I mean that's it's just and then everyone's like Fuck this film basically and fuck Robin Williams. That was basically how people reacted to that.

Matthew
04:56
Yeah, what what where is you're saying Hamlet and Patch Adams double bill win? Yeah, that's coming soon to Little Theatre. I'll be doing a little intro to both films. You know you get those DVD double packs where they've got a similar theme. That would be that. Yeah.

Samuel
05:12
And then one other film that's completely like unrelated, like minority report or something. And uh yeah, we'll just go for that. Although that does have uh a dead character in it, doesn't it? So maybe that is um that is related. Anyway, uh this podcast, Matthew, is a Sunday evening, the old XXL pop culture podcast, first one of the year. So to commemorate the event, that's me opening a monster energy drink there into the microphone. So Uh probably got some some kind of fluid on the microphone there and will regret that immensely when I sh shell out another hundred and twenty quid for this for a new microphone. But um nonetheless I had my um ceremonial J two O spritz with dinner. That is so you with your like you're like non alcoholic but you still want something a little bit classier than like Diet Pepsi and you're like J two O that's That's the one for me, dog. That's the I can see you're thinking there, Matthew. So we did this, I think for the first time last year, where we did like a preview of things we were Excited about. Um, I'm sure the listeners will correct me if I'm wrong, but um sort of got this like rough structure of the year now where in July or June we do the things we've been enjoying in the year so far. End of the year we do obviously the TV shows and films we like um so far, but this is very much in the vein of the You see many websites doing the check these things out this year. I'll be honest with you, for TV and film, I thought that w most websites did quite a bad job this year of rounding some of this stuff up and I had to rely on Reddit a little bit more than I would have wanted to, but nonetheless. Um thought it'd be good, Matthew, just to illuminate people with the pop culture bits and pieces we're excited about this year. Whether it's a TV show. film or Japanese crime novel where there's a an inside out cathedral and a man gets killed by some kind of Japanese pope and you're like this is the best book I've read in ten years or whatever it might be basically.

Matthew
06:52
Cathedral. What even is that?

Samuel
06:56
I don't know. It sounds it's got a bit of Dark Souls energy in inside out cathedral. I think I was really just going for

Matthew
07:01
Upside down castle from um Symphony of the Night, but um the inverted cathedral.

Samuel
07:07
Exactly. Uh so we have twenty things here. There's no order to your to your list, is there, Matthew

Matthew
07:13
And uh No, well I don't I didn't really know what the order would be. I mean I guess from least to most anticipated.

Samuel
07:19
Yeah, I guess maybe that's a little bit false. I mean I did struggle to put it into an order where I was like These are the things I'm really the most excited about because um you know you have no idea how these things are gonna pan out and so I'm I'm not really betting on them as such, you know.

Matthew
07:32
I tried to mix mine up so I wasn't just going film, film, film, film That's that's the only ordering I did is I've I've moved some stuff around so that, you know, we'd uh we'd cover a range of mediums.

Samuel
07:45
Yeah, that makes sense. Um so I'm sure we'll have some crossover here, but Inevitably there'll be a few bits on my list that aren't on yours and vice versa. So why don't you kick us off with your number one or number twenty? Whatever.

Matthew
07:56
My number twenty. Well I decided to go with just like the most basic bitch obvious first pick and take uh take. This isn't a draft. And pick um the Odyssey.

Samuel
08:06
Yep, that was my number seven, but again, doesn't really matter. So but I don't have to talk about it now, so I'll take it off my list. Yeah

Matthew
08:13
Christopher Nolan, always interesting, you know, one of the f few directors who you can give two hundred plus million to and he'll actually put it on the screen and show you what that's meant to look like, which is exciting. Um I'm not a big like mythology guy, really? So like 'cause I know a lot of people like whenever there's anything sort of mythology adjacent, certainly on social media, you get all the mythology dweebs. they feel very empowered by it because they get to do their thing and be like, interesting. Tom Tom Hollander really is thit like this character his name I can't even remember. But I I haven't really got that any any of that going on. Like I think I've probably consumed most mythology through films that I watched as a kid Um and I guess there haven't been lots of these sort of you know Greek mythology epics in our lifetime. Like whenever they happen, they're always a bit underpowered and rubbish. So you know, we're kind of going back to things like Clash of the Titans and silly stuff like that.

Samuel
09:14
So that was such dog shit. The Sam w the Sam Worthington Clash of the Titans was so bad. That guy was

Matthew
09:21
But I like I rem I loved the original Clash of the Titans as a kid, the one with all the plus scene animation Medusa and all that c all that kind of stuff. So but I can't imagine this being like that because Christopher Lone's like too smart just to make something that's really silly, which is what I associate with mythology. Where where do you sit on the the mythology of it all?

Samuel
09:42
Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I I uh I'm not that interested in it because um I just sort of feel like It's just a man going home and then some stuff happens on the way and then he eventually gets there, right? Isn't that basically the story? Yeah, I mean I like that because that's basically a classic sort of adventure that video games riff on endlessly basically. I'm I can't say I'm that big on the old like sword and sandals kind of thing. It's not like anywhere near the the forefront of my sort of interest in terms of a film's theme, but the Nolan aspect is really what matters. And to be honest, the trailers for this. I don't really feel anything watching the trailers for this, but I realize that I felt this way about Every Nolan film going back to the Dark Knight Risers now, like I don't the trailers don't really do anything for me. I'm just a bit like, I'll just wait till it gets here. Like let's just let's just have it because I know I'll enjoy it. But The kind of like way in which he sort of gives you bits of information in the marketing and like invites speculation or w or hype or whatever. I'm not really interested anymore. I feel like I've I've had my fill of that, um, from Nolan. So I'm just like I just respect the work and I wanna see the work, you know.

Matthew
10:55
Yeah, I can see that. I th I think the one bit of it I am super intrigued to see is how he deals with the more fantastical elements because You know, when he took Batman, he took things which are completely ridiculous, but sort of found like how would you know th this thing act in the real life, you know, what would the scarecrow be like in real life and what would the Joker be like in real life? But obviously in this story you've got things like, you know, a giant monstrous Cyclops and you can't really do a a straight laced take on that, I don't think. And that's what that's what I wanna see, you know, like what is Has he kind of met it halfway? What is what is a fantasy Nolan world like? Because we I don't think we've ever really seen it.

Samuel
11:39
No, that's true actually. Like it's it sort of inevitably has to s show you some visually mad shit. So you try and think what is the sort of stormy Nolan take on that weird thing. You're right actually that I can't quite scare in my head what that is. Um Is it just a dude who once had two eyes and has one eye taken out but he's large? I can't really imagine it, you know.

Matthew
11:59
Well that's it.

Samuel
11:59
Is it a bloke with one eye? Yeah, that's is it Robert Pattinson with one eye or something? Like is it that kind of thing? Um Yeah, it's uh I g yeah that is true actually. I hadn't really thought of that. Um yeah, I I I'm pretty positive about about this generally. Like the cast list is sort of a big part of why it's exciting as well, because He gets back some of his regulars. And you uh he's also doing that thing. Nolan started doing that thing more and more now that he sort of did for the first time when he had Matt Damon in um Interstellar where he puts really big actors in quite small roles. So they'll pop up, just do like steal a couple of scenes and then go. And this is kind of like a perfect um film for that really. It's got an absolutely ridiculously stacked. uh castless um charlies eron zendaya journthal um beddy safde umle guzzano um Himish Patel who was in um uh Tenet I remember um Mia Goth's in this as well. Mia Goth is like the most the Odyssey ass um pick you could have. Um just sort of perfect for the Odyssey. Um I hope it's um I hope playing a character that attempts to drive Um Odysseus insane, uh which I think is what Mia Gotha's perfect for in any movie. Um but yeah, and then loads of actors besides, including um James Remar, um Logan, Marshall Green, aka um Aldi Tom Hardy. So you know Really quite stacked. Elliot Page is in this as well. First Elliot Page um performance in an olden film for 16 years. So yeah, it's I mean it's I just wanna ha want it to get here, you know, but I'm really excited about it, you know? Yeah Okay. Well good stuff Matthew. Um that's obviously out in the summer, um July 17th, um, this year. So My first pick will not be as good as the um the Odyssey by Christopher Nolan. Um but it will be Oh man, this is why I should have done it by order of quality. Now we're gonna have some quite jarring shifts Well, okay, this is out on Valentine's Day or around then. Um this is Emerald Fennel's Wuthering Heights, Matthew. Um I know absolutely fucking nothing about the Bronte uh sisters. Um But I do know Eral Fennel's deal now, and um she's a f she's a provocateur. Um she just makes things to annoy people and get a rise out of people and entertain people. And I I really like that someone's out there doing that and doing it with a load of money and good actors. This has um Margot Robius Catherine Earnshaw, I'm sure the Bronte heads in the backpage Patreon listenership I like, oh yeah, fucking love a bit of Catherine Earnshaw right now. Um Jacob Allodius, Heathcliff, who um I mean w coming to Smash Bros. when, Heathcliff, Matthew. I mean, I think we all want to see that at this point. Um yeah, I I sort of like the Uh the sort of flavoring of it um that they present in the trailers has Charlie XX doing the music. I know more about Charlie XX than um the Brontes, you but you'll be shocked to hear. Um and it just looks like it's going to be Like moody and stylish and annoy lots of people who are like annoy lots of people performatively on social media. Um much as um her last two films did. So I really want to see this and it's almost here, and I'm sort of bang up for it really. I don't realise Martin Cloom is in it either. I feel like Martin Clun shouldn't be in films. I feel like he should only be on TV, but nonetheless. Um how you feeling about this one, Matthew?

Matthew
15:12
Yeah, yeah, no, I I'm up for this. I think the trailer looks really stylish. Just visually it looks like It's not that it looks like a Tim Burton film, but it has the similar like everything looks like it's set in this slightly alternative universe art direction, which you tend to only really get from someone like Tim Burton, maybe Gilma del Toro as well. Just looks like she's really upped upped that element of it. Um maybe she's just got so much money to play with. that she's been able to build this, yeah, crazy, you know, it all looks very sort of artificial deliberately so. Um And all the early rumblings are that it's like, you know, incredibly sort of full-on and sexy and unashamedly so and Uh that's always a good time in the cinema if you're a perv like me.

Samuel
16:01
Um but yes, I think there is a bit of that to it. Like Saltburn Definitely had a little bit of that as well. Um and it's funny just um 'cause this she spent eighty million on this and so it's really like uh quite a big test of of like what she can get made and whether people go and see it. I'm not a huge Margot Robbie guy to be honest. Um I'm not sure I've ever really been blown away by Margot Robbie since The Wolf of Wall Street. Um, and she sort of seems to be the default sort of female lead in in things, but I don't know. Let's just see how it pans out. Um I I believe this'll be like a a three and a half stars on letterbox but i have a great time that's what i think is gonna happen with this that's all i want so exactly what's the number 19 it's california avenue Oh I don't know what this is.

Matthew
16:46
Yeah, so this is the next TV show from Hugo Blick, who's the guy who made the Shadowline, The Honourable Woman and The English, which I really liked a couple of years ago, which was the Western starring Emily Blunt. He's a TV mega brain who basically makes these self-contained. They're always about six episodes along, sort of mini-series for the BBC. But he's a a writer director. Um he always has big ideas, big visual ideas, really weird characters. Uh he just uh consistently interesting sort of hire by the BBC and all we really know about this one is that it stars um Erin Is it Erin Darty who is in adolescence? She was the child psychiatrist and she was in the crown as well. And she is a a mum who is on the run for some reason with her kid and hides out in a caravan park. That's all that they've given in terms of a synopsis. But I just know from all his previous work it'll have really great character actors. r just a really sort of strong sense of place. It'll be totally really distinct. Um it's just like an incredibly exciting director who doesn't feel like gets much credit outside of you know, the weirdos who watches stuff on iPlayer. Like I never hear them talking about him on, you know, like US TV podcasts, for example, but I feel like he is you know, kind of uh one of our most sort of filmically minded TV makers.

Samuel
18:21
I think the watch did give the English its due, um, because I think that Oh okay. Well maybe I wasn't listening back then. Yeah, I mean I um I I you're right though, that it it sort of it didn't win any Emmys or anything, did it? It just got sort of like overlooked. Um but I agree it was one of the best I would say one of the best, five best TV shows I've seen This set this decade, you know.

Matthew
18:40
It's been um Yeah.

Samuel
18:42
Yeah, it was really well made, great actors, and this has Bill Nye and Helena Bonham cartoon it as well, Matthew. So and Tom Burke. the guy who we said could be um can Solid Snake. Yeah, anywhere between Mark from Pete Show and Solid Snake, that guy can just do those roles. Um really just good for him, really.

Matthew
18:58
What a chameleon.

Samuel
19:00
Well exactly, yeah. He could work on he could be a staff writer on Edge magazine, he could be Solid Snake. Like I really believe in that guy's yeah, what he can pull off. But um yeah, definitely curious about this. Like the low-key nature of it is It's quite intriguing. But then I think about how the English, if you boil it down, is also quite low-key. It's just that the the scope of it sort of expands as the show goes on, but the actual premise was pretty straightforward. So Yeah. Can't wait. Um really glad that you guess to keep making stuff. Um it's been like about it's been like almost four years since English as well, so you really like Takes his time. But you can tell in the material, you know, he's not interested. Crank it out. It has to be like perfect.

Matthew
19:39
He th I think of him, he's like um who is the guy who directed zone of interest? Oh, um Jonathan Glazer. Glazer. Hugo Blick's like the Jonathan Glazer of TV. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, yeah. He just does it when he's got an idea that's worth doing.

Samuel
19:54
Yeah, yeah, like a true that's just what a true artist does really, isn't it? It's sort of like yeah. It's not just sort of out there making I don't know, w Wonderman for for Disney Plus or whatever. Season two of Hawkeye. Okay, Matthew, my next pick, my number nineteen is the adventures of Cliff Booth The next film. Oh, that's also on my list. Nice. Directed by David Fincher, written by um the increasingly contentious uh these days, Quentin Tarantino. Um and a spin-off slash uh follow-up to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. starring the also increasingly contentious these days, Brad Pitt. Um so slightly cursed depending on um which parts of Reddit or social media you read. and um how you feel about those people. Um mixed is where I sort of stand on it, but also kind of like, I don't know, I will s I will still watch a Brad Pitt film, but I'm well aware that There's quite a lot of negativity about his personal history these days and I'm you know I'm not blind to that basically when I'm thinking about this stuff but um definitely curious to see how this pans out more for the fincher of it than anything because There's not really any commonality between David Fincher's work and Quentin Tarantino's work. So you wonder where they'll sort of like meet each other halfway. But Um if this is like the David Fincher version of like a paycheck gig, um then good for him, frankly, um because I'm curious to see sort of what shape this takes. Also stars um uh Timothy Oliphant, Elizabeth DeBicke, Matthew. Not much else is known about it really. Um, but yeah, sort of also odd really that Quentin Tarantino's got there's a sequel to to something he's done, which is also a bit uncommon. Um I like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood a lot. I don't think it's really it's probably like the middle of the pack on my sort of ranking of Tarantino films. But how do you feel about this one?

Matthew
21:44
Well I mean in my head this this looks a bit like Mank maybe, which was David Fincher directing quite a talky script that was more about performance. Yeah. You know, like you associate Tarantino with lots of words, you know, and a bit of action, where David Finchard like tends to be a bit more sort of lean and um you know, sort of lets the style do the talking. So that's That's interesting to see. I think also the kind of period piece of it, maybe that's kind of an indicator of of of where this might land. Um

Samuel
22:19
Hope it's more fun than Mank though.

Matthew
22:23
Yeah, definitely. Uh I don't know, the whole expanded universe around uh once upon a time in Hollywood, because he wrote that book, which was like the sequel to it, and I don't know if this script is based on that, but I I don't know, I I'm I'm not as into this sort of supplementary material. Um that wasn't enticing enough for him to make it himself. And I've put it I've still put it on my list, just 'cause, you know, I th I'm Just curious like what the hell is this thing gonna be? But um yeah, I you know, of all his things I can't say it's like you know, a film I got to the end of and was like, wow, I'd like another two and a half hours of that, you know?

Samuel
23:06
I like it as a smug film though, that film, isn't it? Just sort of the rewriting bits of Hollywood history and stuff, you know.

Matthew
23:13
You know that there's a right amount of the Brad Pitt character in it. Like Yeah. You know, he's he's one of a few flavours in that film. The idea of just that I'm I'm not entirely sure.

Samuel
23:24
Well he's got so much star power as an actor, that's the thing. I'm I I think he could he could carry it fine So basically he's like a studio fixer in it. So I guess like a basically a heavy going around beating dudes up or whatever. Whereas obviously once the Putin in Hollywood he's he's like a a stunt actor and a little bit um of a down and out and a bit um On the fringes of society. Maybe I'll be a bit like that um that Ed Brewbaker graphite novel I got you to read Matthew. I can't remember what the name but it wasn't. The fade out, that's it. Maybe it's got a bit of that flavour to it, but it's just gonna be there on Netflix in the summer probably. Hope it gets like a slightly longer The theatrical release um than other Netflix films have in recent years, though I did get to see the killer on the big screen, so that was good. But um yeah we'll see. Nice to see Fincher being like I feel like two films in Five years is actually pretty prolific for him. So um hopefully he keeps making cool stuff. Obviously, we're never gonna get that third season of Mindhunter, so yeah. It's what it is. What's your next pick?

Matthew
24:20
I've picked this year's season another season of Blue Lights, the uh cop show I really liked on the BBC last year. Blue Lights season four is meant to be coming out in 2026. I think the BBC commissioned season three and four together cause they were so confident on in it off the back of season two. Uh this is just a huge success story for the BBC if you didn't listen to our, you know, end of year episode where we discussed all the media we liked. This is a I I'd say it almost like the sort of spiritual successor to Line of Duty in that it's a big prime time cop show on the BBC, but it follows uh sort of trainee cops in Belfast uh and it just has a a very different energy to it. I'd say a lot more humanity to it than line of duty. It's uh very interested in their personal lives and their home lives and how that impacts their policing. Um the end of season three without giving it away sort of set up quite a good set of villains for season four where it kind of brought together some threads from uh the previous seasons and uh you know ended on quite a sort of tantalizing, Oh yeah, I'd quite like to see all these characters go to head to head with these bastards, so Uh yeah, I'm just hoping they can keep the quality up. Um you know, line of duty but had a very similar arc where it just kept getting bigger and bigger and then eventually sort of lost the plot. So Um I hope that doesn't happen here.

Samuel
25:49
Yeah, this is like the the rare show that um my parents watch and recommend to me. So I'll get around to watching these earlier seasons at some point, Matthew. Um they're all there on iPlayer. I could probably smash to them in a couple of weeks if I really just put my mind to it. So uh

Matthew
26:03
If you watch just a couple of episodes, if you're into it, you're like, well they're all kinda like that, you know? So you can just whip through eighteen episodes of that no problem. rather than, you know, it's not like a oh it gets better around episode eight, you know, that's that's already like two seasons in, so Yeah.

Samuel
26:19
Oh, I feel like such a fucking dunderhead following that up with Supergirl. Um then The next film with a DC uh DC Universe.

Matthew
26:27
Um people I I th people want to hear more about stuff like that, 'cause that's the kind of thing I think the listeners will go and see rather than some of the absolute wank I've got on my list.

Samuel
26:39
Well I don't think that's necessarily true. So to be honest, I was more excited about this before I saw the first trailer And then the C the first trailer was a had a little bit of the old CG slop feel to it, like a bit of the old, I don't know, recent Marvel films, Guardians of Galaxy Volume 3 or Ant-Man The wasp quantum mania. Just a little bit of that, like, oh, I don't feel like I'm looking at anything. I feel like I'm just looking at a bunch of the vague green screen sci-fi stuff. But um I've picked it because it is a follow-up to Last year's Superman, which is the superhero film I really liked from last year. The rest left me slightly cold variously, especially that Fantastic Four film. That was just a real dud. Didn't like that film at all, unfortunately. So stars Millie Alcock from the first season of House of the Dragon as Supergirl and is basically like the DC version of True Grit. Like she's guarding this, she meets this like young uh young woman basically and then just has to um sort of like look after her, guard her through lots of cosmic bullshit. And it's based on this comic book by um uh Tom King and an artist whose name I cannot fucking pronounce. Um it's like Bilquis Evely, I think that's how you pronounce it. Her art is absolutely incredible. Um it's really really good. It was like a very acclaimed miniseries when it came out. I think it came out during COVID, that book. And um i I don't think that this film will capture the absolutely amazing scope of the the DC universe as depicted by that book. Like the it's just full of like amazing looking kind of spaceship and like cross universe cool imagery that I just don't think they can do on the probably slightly leaner budget than Superman that they have here. Right. Um but nonetheless I do think that the the sort of like ripping off true grit uh sort of plot is quite a good idea. for a superhero film, um the idea of like um someone who's young and a little bit wayward as supergirl is supposed to be and then being forced to have some kind of um responsibility But also not doing it on planet Earth and making the most of the fact that you do have an alien character, you can kinda go anywhere and do anything. Kind of curious. Um also features your guy Matthias Schoenartz, Matthew. I know you love that guy.

Matthew
28:48
Umart's head.

Samuel
28:52
Yeah, exactly. Uh I know he's not quite the um that bloke who looks a bit like Jeff Keeley from um Borgan, but uh you know, he's he's he's on the same he's in the same subgenre of man, I feel Um and then uh Jason Mamur is also in this. I don't really like Jason Mamur, but um that is also happening, so wanted to note it. Thoughts Matthew. He's not in it as Aquaman. No, he's playing a character called Lobo, who I think people who are a bit older than me probably like and appreciate more. Lobo was very over by the time I got into comic. But um like a lot of nineties things in comics, it's kind of come back around in style, and I'm still like, well, this wasn't around when I got into comics, so uh whatever really. But um yeah, so he's in it as well. But I'll go and see.

Matthew
29:32
I I like Superman and you know I'm I'm intrigued to see, you know, where they they go with this series. Like more how they treat it in terms of, you know, will it all feel like one big unified thing, a la Marvel, or will they allow different directors to sort of stamp their their mark on things? That's that's kind of intriguing in this early stretch. Um, I thought the little bit of of Supergirl that was in Superman, like she turned up and seemed quite spunky and fun. So yeah, I'm I'm into it.

Samuel
30:04
Nice. The wh the thing that I'm weirdly the most excited about with it is that the guy doing the cinematography did Alex Garland's Civil War. And Annihilation and Ex Machina. So he knows how to make a film look good and um Mission Impossible Fallout as well, Matthew. So yeah, curious to see how this pans out. What's the next pick?

Matthew
30:23
My next pick is a uh cheaty double bill of uh t well, two favourites from last year again there's a theme here. Um Netflix career has just confirmed that there's going to be a new season of The Devil's Plan, which is like the Squid Game for Brainiacs and uh Culinary Class Wars, which was my favourite TV show of last year, um an absolutely mad, just off the charts, crazy, mega budget cooking show. um with some really big personalities and some really really colourful uh round concepts um to to keep it spicy. They did a great can I sp I knew you're not gonna watch Culinary Classwoods. Can I spoil one of the good rounds from season two?

Samuel
31:09
I might watch it at some point, but you can spoil it and I'll just turn the volume down.

Matthew
31:15
team up in pairs to try and get through this round and because of that, you know, they all bonded uh quite hard and uh you know, th in these little pairings they were all really proud of what they achieved. And then at the end of that round all of their their workstations sort of broke in half and rotated so that all the pairs were then facing against each other in like a one to one deat match. It was just a great twist of like you've just spent all this time getting to know each other and now like you've got to kill the other player with your amazing cooking. And it was just ah it's just great TV. Um s so I I just really want to see them uh one up it for season three. I really hope the monk from season two doesn't come back. uh 'cause I was actually sick of people pretending that a raw carrot is a masterpiece. So uh you know all all this and more uh to come. Uh that'll probably be very late in the year though I imagine. But uh Yeah, it's just I never thought I'd become a person who enjoys and anticipates a reality cooking show.

Samuel
32:21
I just didn't think that was like on the cards for me, but here we are. Do you think when I heard you talk about Culinary Class Wars, I was like, well, I'll never watch that in my head. Like I I'm definitely open to watching these things and just waiting for the for the moment really. There's always so much TV all the time, Matthew, but um There is. Yeah. Um there is. I think I've already watched like ten T V shows this year. That's ridiculous. It is January twenty-fifth. How have you done that? I've watched half ten on the go. I've watched half a season of the lowdown. That's all I've watched in a month. Half a season of the lowdown. That's it, Matthew. I have three ongoing subscription services at the moment, and I I cannot justify that at all. Um, but uh yes. Um Netflix has really invested big in Korean content, hasn't it? I feel like this is like a sort of rolling down the hill effect from um from Squid Game being such a hit. And so it's quite interesting to see like they've got like a a full it's uh you know an absolute fleet of stuff coming out every year, which is it's kind of the way it should be really. It's like if something resonates and you think that culturally culturally is something you can tap into that has worldwide appeal, you might as well spend money on it, you know?

Matthew
33:28
The bit of the model I quite like is I think they let their their regional people kind of pick pick what they're gonna make and it's like be it on your own head, you know? And So yeah, they've obviously just got a really good team there, like you know, loads of drama, loads of reality TV shows, and they're all kind of hitting in quite a big way. So Yeah, let 'em let 'em continue. That isn't the same everywhere. Like look there are other regions that used to be strong. Like it kills me that Spain, which made money heist, that was so good. and uh there's never been anything close to as good as that and likewise the the Netflix Germany when they made Dark, which is just, you know, probably one of the greatest TV shows of all time in my opinion, and that there's no Nothing close to a sequel to that is is absolutely bonkers, but Yeah.

Samuel
34:20
And that's like perplexity. And the occasional adolescence. Yeah, and the occasional uh department queue as well. But like um most of them are like uh it's got that um Oh, what's his name? That bloke in it from uh all of those like Harlan Coben ones have that one have either James Nesbit or that other bloke in which an armatage. Yes, and I'm just like just like this This is just Midsummer Murders or m or like Morse under any under a different name, basically. Like it's just I don't know. I feel like the audience for that kind of TV is is must be in the like eighties or nineties or like dying out or whatever. Like I don't I don't totally get that but um in any case um Okay, so uh again very different. Um I've picked Malcolm in the Middle, um Colon Life Still Unfair, Matthew, a four-part sequel series to Uh Nauties uh bit might start in the late nineties actually, sitcom, uh Malcolm the Middle. Um this was um shown back in the day in a In a block with um The Simpsons and Futurama. Um, I mean that's pretty much the greatest night of TV of all time, really. It's still on the tail end of when The Simpsons was good, but still that's pretty solid, isn't it? Um and uh yeah, it's uh been a long time since the show was on the air. I think it ended uh more than fifteen years ago. And they have all of the cast back except the um the boy who played Jewey who um uh all reports suggest had quite a tough Tough young life, and so I absolutely don't begrudge him for skipping out on it. Um the boy who plays Reese looks completely different, like totally different. Um the guy who plays Francis. Yeah, same guy, but he looks like It's not he's not had like work done or anything, he just looks like a a totally different man. Like it's just not even the same person. I can't quite describe it, but like he looks so different. It might just be because he doesn't have like the frosted tips anymore. Um It's funny because I always thought that Frankie Muniz had a bit of a mixed experience with this. I think thought from here all of his racing dri race driving, he'd been like he'd lost his memory and making the show or something, but The sounds bang up for this. Um so I'm kind of curious about this because even though the later seasons of Malcolm Middle weren't quite as strong as the first few, at its best, it was really up there with like the greatest TV of that era. Like it was so funny. Even though it was about all these little kids. The kid actors were genuinely good. Did you watch this at the time?

Matthew
36:33
I did. I don't know if I watched it religiously. I r I remember uh a bit where someone swore and then Brian Cranston made him read out swear words to him.

Samuel
36:44
Right, yeah, yeah.

Matthew
36:45
T to his face as almost like a version therapy, and he was like weeping having to call his dad all these terrible names from this sheet of paper. I think that's a thing that happened. That's a thing. Um if that didn't happen, I don't remember anything in Malcolm in the Middle.

Samuel
36:58
The bit I always remember from the original series is like the bit that made me think oh Brian Cranston's one of the greatest actors of all time. This is an episode where I think Reese steals an oxygen tank from someone and Brian Crownston just goes, you stole air? And it's the way he says it's the way he says that. I was just like, this guy's the man, like good for him. Um Tell you another weird thing about this show. I had a dream about this show like two years ago when they announced it. I had a dream. I was Malcolm and I was at this event and I was interact because like it's a sorry, by event I mean the show is about the 40th anniversary w wedding party of his parents. Um and I just had this dream, first person dream that I was interacting with like both of his parents and I was at this wedding party. That was a really weird dream, but it was incredibly vivid. Because I just remember Like Brian Cranston telling me how to behave when I was at the party. That's a really strange thing that happened.

Matthew
37:54
So this has been in the works of how were the how was how were the how was the writing?

Samuel
37:58
I think I think my brain met the show halfway with how my parents talk. So it was a bit like interacting with my parents, but they sounded like um Jane Kat Samarik, don't I say her name, or and Brian Cranston. So I don't know. It was a bit like I don't know, a bit of like cosplay, weird dream cosplay basically. That's a a completely pointless detail I've thrown in there, but It's only four episodes which seem short for a revival like this, but I assume if it's popular they'll make um some more Matthew. But I was a big fan of the original show, so here it is. What's the next pick?

Matthew
38:29
I've picked a play, because it's only one play this year. Um mainly because a lot of stuff hasn't been announced. Uh the National Theatre is doing a production of Dangerous Liaisons or The F the French play that the the film Dangerous Liaisons was based on.

Samuel
38:47
Liaison's danger. Is that something like that?

Matthew
38:49
Yeah, yeah, that's it. Thank you for thank you for bailing me out on that one. No worries. It's got Leslie Manville in the kind of Glenn Coase sort of older manipulator role and Aidan Turner in the John Malkovich role. And The actress from A Complete Unknown. The the other the who played the folk singer. Oh, um the one who's dating Andrew Garfield. Yeah, Monica. Monica Barbaro.

Samuel
39:16
Barbaro.

Matthew
39:17
Yes, she's I th she's I d I can't really work out who she is, whether she I don't know if they've specifically announced the cast the characters yet, but I don't know if she's the Uma Thurman or like the Michelle Pfeiffer role? It feels like it'd be Michelle Pfeiffer. Yeah, I I would I would have thought so. Yeah, it's I mean it's interesting for a few reasons. Leslie Manville, I think, did uh Dangerously at the national years ago when she was younger and in a different role. So that's always kind of interesting when someone returns to a play in you know, gets to tackle it in a slightly different role. I've seen Aidan Turner in a play before and he was pretty good. Like you know, he's one of those people it's quite easy to dismiss as like that guy from Polark. But actually I th I think he does have the stuff Uh and of course I'm excited to see Monica thingy from a complete unknown yes on stage. I think that'll that'll You know, that's exciting. I'm into that. I have a ticket to see this, so I am yeah, very happy. Um yeah, it's it's uh you know, classic tale for people haven't seen Dangerous Liaisons, it's like uh uh you may know it better as Cruel Intentions, which it was sort of free made as, but it's kind of uh an evil game of seduction um set up by uh these sort of two mm sort of manipulative cads as they kind of toy with the heart of this whether they can corrupt this younger this younger lady. Um and it's just a classic bit of uh yeah, sort of sexual power play, um, but I've never seen the the stage production of it, so I am pumped for that.

Samuel
40:52
Yeah, I mean I feel like I get my stage recommendations from you on this podcast. Um this is why how I ended up seeing um Stereophonic last year. So And I didn't steer you wrong there. I'm very f I'm very fond of the um the film. I think it's sort of like a five-star film, the Stephen Freyz one. It's really, really good. And uh it's sort of like I feel like I've still never really seen John Malkovich in that mode anywhere else, you know? Um I feel like I've seen him play so many eccentrics over the years or like weird weird dudes. And in that film it's just like he is like the he is the guy. He's like the sexiest man in the film. Um and he makes it work. And uh Leslie Manville feels perfect for that that Glenn Close role and um or a Sarah Michelle Geller role, depending on which uh which version you're talking about Uh good stuff back here. Um is that on like imminently then? If that sounds like it's sued if you've got a ticket.

Matthew
41:42
That's uh yeah, that I think that starts in a couple of months. And I'll say I'm pretty sure it's one of the plays they're doing which will be broadcast the cinemas as National Theatre Live. So i if if you've never you know if the idea of like an expensive London tick ticket and uh travelling to London feels a bit scary. I really recommend make it a a New Year's resolution to see a National Theatre Live production at the cinema this year 'cause I think you'll be not you, I mean you the listeners and you um but you'll be very m like impressed at like how sort of technically sharp it is. It really looks like a film but it has this charge of it being a live production, so it's quite exciting. Uh there it's a great way to see it. I mean honestly like It's probably a better way to see it than going to see it live to be honest.

Samuel
42:31
But um Oh no, I think there's something I I really would like to see the live version from you talking about it, but I'm guessing it's gonna cost me a

Matthew
42:42
National theatre because it's you know subsidized a a fair amount and it's meant to be a sort of theatre for everyone. It doesn't go like crazy, crazy expensive, you know Like you can get decent tickets for like forty, fifty quid.

Samuel
42:55
Oh shit, I'm gonna go see that. Um uh that's definitely happening. Um Did I tell you about the time I met Aidan Turner on the set of being human? Did we talk about that on the podcast? Can't remember. Well he was on he was very nice, but he was there was what I remember about it was there was a moment where He came out of his um his trailer wearing a white vest and in my head I just went that is the most beautiful looking man I've ever seen. It's just like Unbelievably good looking guy and like effortlessly good looking as well. Just sort of like looked amazing, just climbing getting out of a caravan. Wearing a white vest, you have to hand it to him, I mean really.

Matthew
43:30
You're like you deserve to be that makes sense.

Samuel
43:32
I understand this why you're on screen and I'm not sure. Yeah, exactly. I look like Toby Jones relative to you. Like it makes sense that you are like leading man and I am like a you know, a starfire on sci-fi now. Um anyway, um okay, um my next one, just to bring the tone down again, uh, is um the TV show lanterns. um coming to HBO Max when that launches in the UK. This too is also in the DC universe. Um I've got a bit more DC on my list than um than Marvel this year. I've none of the Marvel films in this year 'cause I'm not actually convinced the Marvel films are going to be good. But um On the TV side, I'm curious about this one because it has like some amazing talent involved. It's one of those things where because it's IP, i. e. it's Green Lantern, the DC comic superhero, basically space cops. Um but it has um in its the people working on it has uh Chris Mundy, who I think is the guy who did Ozark, um which I never watched on Netflix. But More intriguingly, I think, has Damon Lindelof, um, co-creative of Lost and Creator of Watchman, um, the TV show Watchman, not the comic book. And again, Tom King, the comic book writer I mentioned earlier, who is my favourite comic book writer. Um, and it's about Basically they're these like space cops is they're like de-powered on planet Earth and they're solving some kind of mystery. So they're not flying around manifesting shit with their green rings like in that Ryan Reynolds movie, which is fundamentally what the Green Lantern comics are. But it looks like it's trying to cultivate a kind of like true detective y sort of thing. They've cited true detective and slow horses as points of inspiration. You've got Kyle Chandler as the older Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, and then you have um Aaron Pierre from the amazing Netflix film Rebel Ridge as uh John Stewart, who is the younger Green Lantern. Also features um Kelly McDonald, who um always enjoying things, Matthew, and also um Nathan Fillion, who played the Green Lantern in the Superman film from last year. Um but I get the impression it's more about Aaron Pierre and Carl Chandler um from the bits of footage they've released so far. Curious to see what how it pans out really. It's out in the middle of the this year and it's I guess this is like your first look at what the James Gunn DC project as a TV show looks like, but he's got all the right the right people on paper to do it. Has this crossed your radar at all?

Matthew
45:50
I knew that Th these people were in a show called Lanterns and that it was about Green Lanterns. Um oh it's interesting that they're like deep powered or that they won't necessarily be flying all over making like giant green hammers or whatever. Because that was Nathan Fillion's deal in Superman. Like he he was what I consider quite a traditional Green Lantern style character. Um I don't really know where he fits into a more like down-to-earth sort of true detective version.

Samuel
46:20
Yeah, it's sort of weird to think of those things combining. I My theory on this is that he'll only be in like one episode or two episodes or something. I don't think he'll be in like the whole show. So um yeah, I I I think that the I could see what the tone they're going for in the footage is so far. Like the bits of footage they showed were like It was Carl Chander sort of teaching Aaron Pierre, you know, being like a Green Lantern is more than just this ring and then he sort of like jumps out of a moving car and then leaves Aaron Pierre in there to fend for himself basically. So might be a bit of a toxic mentor thing going on. Um, it is an interesting way to try and tackle Green Lantern though. Like this is th this looks like on paper the good version of doing an IP TV show, so We'll see how it pans out. Uh my guy Tom King. Yeah, I mean I think it it will still probably be quite goofy and silly, but I don't because it is like a firmly a HBO drama. I'm hoping it just sort of goes through it on being a little bit adult, but we'll see. So what's your next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
47:22
Uh I've picked uh Channel 4 has a show coming called Maud Which stars Glenn Close as a uh you know an older lady, a pensioner I guess, who also happens to be a murderer or has killed people in her past. I c I can't really work out the tone of this. It's based on some Swedish novels which look a little bit cozy crime, but the pitch of it and the stuff this character gets up to makes it sound a bit like sort of an old lady version of Dexter where someone has just a sort of m tends to turn to murder to solve their problems. Like she offs people in her life who annoy her or irritate her, so it's kind of a grumpy old lady who also murders people. Uh I mean this might be total ass. I you know, I I really don't know. This is one of the ones I was like you know, a b a bit of a shot in the dark, but I do like the idea of a nice big juicy showcase for Glen Close who is always so excellent in things, you know, watching Wake Up Dead Man, you're like, oh yeah, Glenn Close is pretty good in this. Uh I really like Damages, the TV show that she did uh about fifteen years ago. Uh yeah, I you know, I'd let's see. Maybe maybe it'll be good. Maybe uh if it's really Twee, if it's like Oh no, I've accidentally murdered someone. I'm not particularly interested in that. Um but if it's like quite an a sour, sort of acidic old lady, I could see that working quite well.

Samuel
48:55
Yeah, cu that's curious. A Channel 4. So it's a UK drama with Glenn Glose as the lead. That's the that's what they've made.

Matthew
49:02
Yeah, I mean it's being made with Like it's like an international c uh sort of co-production with some like European TV stations. So I think it'll probably have a bit of money behind it. I think like uh you know, Studio Canal over in France uh are you know, chucking in a load of money for it. But I'm I'm assuming they're not setting it in Sweden. I don't I don't think it's gonna be like you know, Kenneth Brown as Wallander, you know, uh with English people. I I well but I don't really know.

Samuel
49:30
They haven't they they honestly haven't said, but I mean I like Glenn Close. I I I love damages. I thought that was amazing. And I thought it was quite rude that Glenn Close got roped into that terrible Kardashian legal project last year. I was like bummed out to see that she was in that, like genuinely. Glad she got to you know, maybe that paid off like the mortgage on her second house or something, but either way, it was just quite bleak to see because she was in one of the great legal dramas and it was a little bit ignored at the time damages. Um Also gave us Roseburner. That's a good show. They had a great theme tune as well, Matthew. And um probably an all-time best like Ted Danson performance outside of Kirby enthusiasm. It was um it was really good. Anyway, yes. Um oh yeah, well okay, sorry yes, your beloved cheers.

Matthew
50:11
But come on, throw the guy a bone.

Samuel
50:15
Well it's just you know uh anyway, um mod, okay, that's the name of the show. I will um I will look out for it for sure. Um this is gonna be a brief one for this next pick because we don't think about it yet, but um the director of uh weapons and um barbarian, Zach Kregger, is making a Resident Evil film that is out this year. Um not much is known about it, but um well I I think it's really just the the director and uh IP combined that Creates a lot of intrigue. Um it stars the actor Austin Abrams, who I don't really know much about to be honest. Um was he in weapons, maybe? In any case, um he is he is in this.

Matthew
50:50
Yeah, he was the I think he was like the drug addict.

Samuel
50:53
Yeah, I I think that is right. Um but um I think like what they've said that this is not a direct adaptation of anything um as such. It's really just a kind of like the spirit of Resident Evil, like the idea of survival horror. And what he perceived as the experience of the games like boiled down into a film. You know, I heard I'm sure you heard the same interview with Craig or that I did last year, Matthew, where he talked about this and it sounded like he had a really steady idea of like what he thought this film should be and he was convinced that like even if you're a bit GBS that it's a res it's a You know, there's been a lot of shit Resident Evil films that, you know, this might not be good. It does definitely sound like it's got the the stuff. Um also features Paul Walterhauser, but sadly not paying Barry Burton. Um No offense my guy, but you were put on this planet to play Barry Burton. You should have been Barry Burton in this film. But um how are you feeling about this one, Matthew?

Matthew
51:44
Yeah, and this was on my list also. Um There was a thing came out this weekend where I think one of the actors spoke about it, maybe they shouldn't have, and said it was like an origin story for Resident Evil. Oh right, interesting. About a about organ don't uh s like someone transporting an organ to be transplanted. Oh, okay. Apparently. It's like the th the thrust of what they said, but Yeah, I I I I'm interested for the same reason you are. Like it's more you know, this guy makes interesting films that take you by surprise. I think his slightly loopy deranged tone is actually a a good a good fit for the very cheesy Resident Evil. Like I actually thought there was quite a bit of um Resident Evil 7 DNA in His first one, whatever that was. Barbarian, yeah. Yeah. In terms of like the m the kind of the nature of the threat and the monsters, like the domesticity of it. I hope it's good. I'm sure it will be. That guy's on quite a run, and I don't see him doing something shitty and dumb at this point.

Samuel
52:48
It's just kind of what happens, I think, when millennial filmmakers start to get the power to make decisions is that they're like, I'm gonna make the good Resident Evil movie. And um I do respect that. I like I I think that's a good use of um of of uh yeah of cache in Hollywood What's your next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
53:06
My next pick is a uh a very quick one, uh a bit of stand-up comedy that I'm looking forward to. Um John Kearns, uh the comedian, he was on Taskmaster a few seasons ago. Uh he's touring a new show, and I saw him Maybe a couple of years ago and it was in the in a i his show is called The Varnishing Years and I think it was probably the best hour of stand-up I've ever seen Um I was just absolutely pissing myself uh in the rondo in Bath, which has got incredibly uncomfortable seats. So to get past the uncomfortable seats and into the the laughing zone is quite an accomplishment. Uh well we saw a comedian there, didn't we? Um Oh yeah. Yeah. That guy who's pretending to be Scottish or whatever the thing was. What was classic?

Samuel
54:01
When was I don't remember this actually. When was Oh wait, was this was this the other side of town?

Matthew
54:05
He did a whole thing about how he'd H how it moved to Scotland and was pretending to be Scottish. Oh yeah, that was a fun evening actually. Is that is that the theory? The the seats were rough. But uh I I really like John John Kearns. He's uh doesn't feel like he's like massively out there. I don't think he does like all the the sort of trad panel shows or anything, but uh Good for the He was good on Taskmaster, his stand-up, which I think you can actually watch the varnishing years on now TV. I think they recorded it for that. Um and He's had a couple of all-timer appearances on the uh off menu podcast where he's just like he's just the best guest on that, I think, by the mile. He's he's just so he's so strange and dry. Oh, he's great. Oh nice.

Samuel
54:51
That's a good that's a good recommendation. I might go watch some clips after this of uh of that. Um I'm getting recommended things by you now, Matthew. That's uh That's a good service you're providing. Um okay, cool. And so so he's not on so he's he is touring.

Matthew
55:07
He's coming to Bath I think in like March or something.

Samuel
55:10
Yeah, alright.

Matthew
55:11
Is that I'll be maybe. I want to see more comedy this year. I saw James Akas last year and I I really liked it and yeah, so this year we've got tickets to see John Kearns, um and uh we've seen some other stuff as well. Yeah, okay, interesting. Not a great anecdote that.

Samuel
55:30
No, I um you seem pretty discerning about the comedy you do like, so um you know I'm sure it's uh I'm sure it's Oh wait uh

Matthew
55:38
We're seeing uh Glenn Moore of Button Boys Fame is coming to Bath in February, I think. Nice.

Samuel
55:44
Very cool. Um okay, so uh yeah, that's uh that's so again some nice recommendations there, Matthew. We I'm more familiar with Glenn Moore's work. I know a bit about James DeCastor, but I feel like Anytime I I thought that the special you recommended that I go and check out was on uh Vimeo or something and or some sh service I just you just cannot get on like your PlayStation or your TV. It was like trapped on there and you said that was like his best stand-up and I was like, oh fuck, that's just I don't want to have to pay for it on my iPad my iPad and watch it.

Matthew
56:14
He does this whole thing about how his girlfriend left him for Ron Atkinson and it's just absolutely brutal.

Samuel
56:19
Yeah, I sounded really good. I feel like I should listen to that at some point. Okay. Um my next pick, Matthew, I imagine this is on your list is the uh Steven Spielberg film Disclosure Day. Is this on your list? It is. Yeah, it's a bit of a sort of like cautiously interested pick, I guess. I didn't think the trailer was actually that good. Um Personally a little bit sick of a of British people playing Americans and films, I think there's a bit too much of that gun around and you burnt out on Josh O'Connor. No, I'm not burnt out Josh O'Connor. I like Josh O'Connor. Um I don't mind anybody blunt either, but it's just like they're both playing. You could definitely get an American actress who's not. Emily Blunt to do that role. And so I don't quite get the absolute fixation. It's not like she's a once-in-a-generation talent that just America cannot produce. But like I feel like that's the message you send. every time you cast a British actor in an American role. So this seems like it's a kind of maybe a spirit spiritually connected to Summer Spielberg's earlier work, the um the tagline is if you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you without frighten you, this summer the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to disclosure day. Um so some maybe close encounters sort of vibes to it. Um but actually quite hard to judge exactly what shape the film takes from the trailer they've put out so far as a teaser released at the end of last year. Um but I really like West Side's story. I really like the Fablements. I love that Spielberg's still out there making films. So, you know, want him to make films for the for the rest of his life. Um I think he's yeah made some really great stuff in the last ten years. Uh has actually got to the point where he feels a little bit like not forgotten, but not held like not held in the same esteem as uh some of like like the the next generation of filmmakers, but I don't know, like he's made films that are really up there. So how are you feeling about this?

Matthew
58:09
I feel like I was thinking about this earlier. Like I don't feel like there's the same Buzz around a new Spielberg film that there would be for like Scorsese, maybe. Yeah, that's true, for sure. Which is still and maybe it's just because he m he's making more like broader stuff and less for less for us, you know, a a strictly adult audience, um like Amarty.

Samuel
58:32
But um Hmm. But you know, it's sort of like it's not like people are seeing every Spielber uh sorry, every Scorsese film. They basically see the ones that look vaguely like Um Wolf of Wall Street or Goodfellas and then if it's silence they don't give a shit basically So yeah this is a sad one about Native Americans, no thanks. But it's not treated with the same, you know, like regard that a new Denny Villeneuve or like Nolan film is. But I think it's pretty significant he's out there doing something like this. He also hasn't made anything In this specific vein, arguably since ready player one. So, you know, just like that big summer blockbuster thing. It's out in June, so um Yeah, curious, Matthew.

Matthew
59:13
Yeah, definitely. I'd be up for a close something in the mould of close encounters. Like i I I I don't know. The trailer ha had a little bit of like Independence Day energy, which Yeah I was worried about Yeah, same.

Samuel
59:27
It was another one where I was more excited about it till I saw the trailer, and then I was like, uh I'm now a bit more devious than I was, but

Matthew
59:33
Uh uh Emily Blunt doing like she's talk talking, then she starts sort of clicking an alien language. Had a a hint of the bit where the the aliens grab that bloke in Independence Day and smash him against the glass and then sort of tickle his vocal cords to get him to sort of whisper portents of doom. Do you remember that bit?

Samuel
59:53
Yeah, I do remember that bit. Yeah. Uh yeah. Okay. That's I don't think that's unfair. That was also the bit that made me go, Oh, it's good it's actually like a chance now this could go completely wrong with the clicking, but um If she if she's talking like that the whole film, I'm out. Uh I think I agree with you there.

Matthew
01:00:09
What's your next pick, Matthew? Uh I've picked Widow's Bay on Apple TV, which uh There's a very cryptic teaser of uh the the reason I've picked it is it stars Matthew Reese, who is absolutely brilliant, like I I loved him in The Americans, uh Perry Mason, less so the beast in me on Netflix last year, but he's always interesting. At his worst, he's he's an interesting actor. And in this he placed the mayor of a small town, New England town, called Widows Bay. And he's trying to kind of make it a big success for tourists, but there is a sense from the locals that the town might be cursed in some way and so they don't want people to come and visit and it feels like it's about yeah the tension of running a place that might be evil and what do you do about that. Uh I saw someone describing it as it's like if they made jaws from the perspective of the mayor, which I quite like the pitch of. Oh, I love that. That's great. I think the guy who's directing it directed uh like a fair bit of Barry and some other um quite prestigious stuff which people like. He's got a very good track record. I saw a list of everything they'd done. It was like, oh yeah, they kind of only work on hits. So

Samuel
01:01:27
Hopefully this will be good. Yeah, I know this was not even on my um on my radar, so that's um that actually sounds really good. Um I'm well up for that. I do have Apple TV until May, Matthew. That's when it my half price deal runs out. And then um I guess actually that'll probably happen halfway through this show, which begins on April 29th. So um that'll be a bummer, but I'll enjoy the first four episodes nonetheless. Um that sounds pretty good. Apple TV is still making like r regularly making like solid four-star sort of genre shows, you know, that seems to be like their whole thing. So that's it. My next pick is The Death of Robin Hood, Matthew. Um this is the next film from Michael Sarnoski, who did A Quiet Place Day One and also Pig with Nicolas Cage, which is on Netflix if you want to go watch that. Um it seems like it's a film about A subverting the Robin Hood story where he's actually like a criminal. Played by Hugh Jackman with like an accent that I really think could cripple the entire film. Um, like it's in the trailer, it goes from I would say it's definitely in the ballpark of uh Russell Crowe doing like the Nottinghamshire accent, where it's like sometimes American, sometimes Australian, sometimes what it's supposed to be. Um but uh it does it is intriguing the premise, like it's basically an old Robin Hood who's critically injured being tended to by a woman played by Jodie Coma, telling telling his story his life story basically. And that's a pretty cool cool pitch um for something as trad as Robin Hood. Like I wouldn't really be interested in something like this unless It was a filmmaker bringing a particular style or take to it. And this feels like it ticks ticks that box, Matthew. There was a trailer for it a few weeks ago. This it This actually is a trailer that despite Jackman's accent did not put me off the film, actually made me more kind of curious about what shape it will take. Is this on your radar at all?

Matthew
01:03:27
Yeah, definitely. I think Y y maybe you tweeted about it or mentioned it on the Discord or something and and that got me yeah, got me looking into it and yeah, I'm excited for it. It looks like it might be a bit more soulful than your sort of traditional blockbuster fair. I'm not gonna say it it looks like the assassination of um Jesse James, but it has like a bit more of that, you know, like we're gonna sort of bust this myth down and it's gonna be a bit more grounded and earthy. Uh yeah, I'm into it. Yeah, for sure.

Samuel
01:03:56
What's the next pick?

Matthew
01:03:58
Uh I'm picking the Vampire Lestat, aka season three of Interview with a Vampire, uh which was It's been a gr a great TV show. Um you watched it a couple of years ago. Um uh adaptation of the Ann Rice l the stats w however many she's done. I think it's more of an a trilogy, um, about y you know the comings and goings of of various vampire lovers throughout the centuries. Obviously they're immortals so that they can keep it in the middle of the early thing. meeting at different times. Um uh interview they've done the story of Interview with a vampire, so season three is yeah they've changed the name to the Vampire Lestat and uh I think it'd be more about him. I i it looks a bit kinda like rock and roly like s like sixties, seventies. So it'll be another time jump closer closer uh about yes his sort of on again, off again relationship with um oh the other vampire we want to called Louis but I don't know if that's right. Um Very, very like full-on melodrama this show up till now. Uh very sort of sort of sexy and sultry and incredibly violent, but also has just good thriller bones, like you know, the the the threat of danger to them and the threat of being caught is very well realised and people meet absolutely horrible ends in it. Um it it I I associate with things on with vampires on TV as being kind of like crap made for sort of like teenage girls and like young adults. There's a lot of like sexy vampire stuff out there. Um but I thought this actually had this had a bit more going on with it. Um so I yeah, I really hope the the the third season is as as strong as those first two. It's been a bit of a gap between them. So

Samuel
01:05:53
Who knows? Yeah, like all TV shows now. They're like, we're going off air for three years, but fingers crossed you remembered what happened and when we come back. Um it's a bit of an ask.

Matthew
01:06:02
Well I don't know if they're treating it because they've changed the name, if they're treating it like a Jump in here and it'll be fine.

Samuel
01:06:07
Yeah, it's rare for T V shows to change their name like that, um mid mid run, but uh they really feel like they've J That AMC who make this feel like they've really found a a corner with all this Anne Rice stuff. It feels like that's their that's their thing. And the people who like this show really like it. So um It's always on been on my list to watch. I know it's both seasons are on iPlayer um in the UK, so you can just watch those um for free, which is cool.

Matthew
01:06:32
Um Yeah. Yeah, I'll get to it at some point.

Samuel
01:06:34
I like the film as well. I thought the film was really good back in the day, Matthew. Um so Yeah, um cool that this is really um yeah it feels like something that could easily have run for one season and been forgotten. So it's cool they managed to find an audience in this these fractured times for streaming services. But yeah we'll give it a go for sure. Um cool. Okay, um final season of the boys is my next pick, Matthew. Um this begins on April 8th. Show's been very up and down over the years. Um had two absolutely brilliant seasons, in my opinion, season one and season three, then two slightly more mid seasons in season two and four. Um I think them ending it after five seasons is pretty much spot on. Um I think the best thing that happened last season is when um uh basically people have been watching this show the whole time. Um basically Trump supporters realised the Homelander was about Trump and then uh all Shatler Pants and the rotting t Rotten Tomatoes user reviews. That was really funny to watch that happen as they figured out Wait, what's this this character's a bad guy? Um and what are they saying about the real world? Really funny to see that. Worth the show existing just for that alone, to be honest. And um it is like in danger of repeating itself a bit, I think. Um and so I think that i it ending now is is the right decision. I'm certainly not interested in the spinoffs they've been doing of this. Um but love Anthony Starr in the show. Mostly love Carl Urban in the show, though that character's been treading water a bit. Still really like Jack Quaid. It's um and um increasingly a fan of The Deep, um played by Chase Crawford, a character who's like got no glamour to him whatsoever, but that actor is so committed to him. That I really I've got a lot of affection for that character because it's just he's such a heinous piece of shit, but like there's no Chase Crawford has no vanity about it whatsoever. He just completely commits to it. So I like this show, it's dependable. The the seasons are all only ever like eight episodes long. It'll come and go, and that's okay really. Um how you feel about this, Matthew?

Matthew
01:08:23
I think it having an ending finally is will really help it because the the The problem this show's always had is it has such affection for its characters like heroes and villains that n none of them ever really get bumped off, you know, it nothing ever really changes. But having a series where you're like, Well, it doesn't matter now all bets are off Um I'm I'm hoping there's some like spectacular violence against some spectacular assholes in this. But Yeah, we shall see. I mean Homelander is just uh it's just such a good character. So I know why they never haven't killed him off so far, it's just 'cause he's he's you know, the best thing in it by a mile. Um so compelling, but uh yeah, I don't know. I hope he gets the worst ending imaginable.

Samuel
01:09:11
He's a really reprehensible piece of shit. There's some great homelander gifts out there, but the best one is that one of that That girl who takes all those drugs to have superpowers, but it's like killing her on the inside. So she starts coughing and he just looks at her sideways. Like, that gif is so good. That's like a great Dis distillation of like Anthony Starr in that role, how good he is. It's it's oh what it's so good. Um what's the next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:09:36
My next pick is a book. It is the first of my Japanese crime uh suggestions or things I'm anticipating. It's called The Ark by Haruyuki Ha Haru Haru Haruyuki. Okay, probably mangling that. Look up Yuki, the surname, The Ark. Um uh not an author I'm familiar with. I think they're quite young. They're a mystery sci-fi writer. It's a book about a group of people who are climbing a mountain or hiking in a mountain and find like an underground bunker. They get stuck in the bunker, it starts flooding. uh and they realize that the only way to survive this experience or get out of there is that um one of their own has to be sacrificed, which in itself is a you know an interesting little sort of thriller setup but on top of that um in that dire situation is when the murders start And there is also a murderer in there with them. So obviously I'm into this ticking clock of the flooding bunker. That sounds interesting. I don't think this is gonna be like any high art, but I'm always interested when they translate an author who hadn't previously been translated. Um yeah, to see where it fits in. Uh I can't really place this one, so

Samuel
01:10:52
I'm excited for it. Interesting. Is it it's always like one or two publishers who do these books, right? And you basically like that's how you found out about them, is that right?

Matthew
01:11:00
There's this really good blog. W I think it's called something really basic like read Japanese fiction, which uh the person who runs that blog is so on top of everything that's being published. Like I'll uh whenever I go on there I see loads of stuff that I've somehow missed. Like I think I'm pretty on top of it in terms of yeah, these are the publishers you can tend to trust to translate this kind of stuff but that that blog is is so comprehensive. Um but it mixes in everything. It's like crime writing you know, more literary fiction, short stories, all those books about cats in cafes, of which there are like a million. Um Yeah, but this I've uh you know I've got a few picks like this uh which I took from that list but uh yeah the arc that's out on the 16th of February

Samuel
01:11:49
Yeah, it's um it it's actually wild when you go into a Waterstones or Foils now how much Japanese fiction's taken over. Yeah. Like it's that's something that's happened in the time that we've been making this podcast. That wasn't a thing. three years ago, but it's now like very obviously a thing. Um is it like just a few a couple of books that have really exploded that have caused this Matthew because I feel like I see your crooked house murders one. Um I feel like I see that ev everywhere.

Matthew
01:12:14
I don't know if it's specifically any of the murder mystery stuff which has really exploded. I think what was massive was there was uh Uh there was a book called Convenience Store Woman um in the last ten years. That that that was like massive in Japan and has been quite been quite popular over here as a bit of um quite sharp in female fiction. Um but th the other thing that's happened is there are all these books, like cozy books about in being in like Japanese cafes or having a cat in Japan or if you really want a payday having a cute cat that lives in a cafe and Like Catherine gets sick of this 'cause there's I mean honestly, I think there were like twenty of these books published last year and I think a couple of those were absolutely enormous to the point that it started this like gold rush on like cat cafe fiction. Um i you know it has actually impacted crime translation a little bit in that last year uh they translated a Yokomizo who's like a quite an old school um Japanese crime writer Uh he has a bla he has a uh mystery called like the murder at the Black Cat Cafe or something. And I think they translated that purely because it had like cat and cafe in the title and they could maybe trick some people into buying it uh thinking it was like cozy fiction which it's not so um I'd say it's in rude health, but it's it it's very specifically gathered around quite a weird niche.

Samuel
01:13:50
That feel that um that book Butter as well, I feel like that is uh another thing that's I've seen in every single bookshop in the in the s in the country, you know.

Matthew
01:13:58
The s not the d direct sequel to, but that author's next book is out this year and is is um thought to be, you know, that's gonna be a m a m absolutely massive one. That's called Hooked. It looks quite like butter except it's got like a fish on the front and it's bright pink instead of being bright yellow. But I I imagine we're gonna see piles of that in like every Waterstone's all year

Samuel
01:14:20
So is that like a is it a bit of a double-edged sword for you then? That s this thing that was so niche a few years ago that you had to dig out really out-of-print copies of the of books that are now like This is now basically popular fiction in this country.

Matthew
01:14:34
Even though it's not the crime writing that's necessarily doing the heavy lifting, I think it gives people the confidence to translate more of that stuff. Because I think people think, well maybe there's an in here, you know, I I people t I I I get, you know, I don't work in in you know, the publishing industry, so this is just a complete outsider perspective, but I feel like people are hedging their bets like it's relatively cheap to get a book out and off the ground. So, you know, if there is this huge appetite for a couple of Japanese books, maybe that's enough to sustain you if you put out things which are adjacent and a Japanese crime story, even though genre wise is very different, I think it's adjacent enough, like the the Japanese cultural stuff in it is close enough to make it worthwhile. Like This year actually there's there's quite a lot already down to come out crime wise. You know, I think there's like eight or nine quite juicy things. So um yeah, it's it's obviously working for someone somewhere.

Samuel
01:15:36
Yeah, well glad to hear it.

Matthew
01:15:38
And it's working for me as a result, so that's good.

Samuel
01:15:40
For sure. Alright, well my number eleven is the pit, um, which is finally launching in the UK this year. Our American listeners may already be familiar with this show because it is uh it's nominated for a bunch of Golden Globes. Um it is largely you know hugely acclaimed um when it came out last year. 15 episodes basically set in real time, I guess a slightly 24 esque in this um Pittsburgh hospital as loads of bad shit happens. um with uh Noah Wiley from ER playing the main character. Um show has some um ER uh alum uh working behind the scenes as well. um and is even the subject of a lawsuit um from the estate of uh Michael Crichton. Um I guess those kids don't have enough money. Um who knows? I don't know. But um uh so uh so Curious to finally see this. We um have been denied it in the UK because uh they wanted to wait for the HBO Max launch. Um my worry with that is it's gonna create a divide where A bunch of the HBO stuff is on now TV and a bunch of it's on this new service you have to pay money for, which is really a net loss for consumers here, like we don't need another streaming service. No one wants more of them. Um but I am curious about this show for sure, um because I think it launched as a bit of a an experiment to see if we they can make something more in an old US network TV show vein. And it's become enormously popular. So they've I think they've commissioned four other shows that are a bit similar to it, um, including a cop show, um, to try and capitalize on that. But Good TV, sort of medical drama. I don't watch many shows in this vein, to be honest, but if I hear one's good, I will I will watch it. How are you feeling about this one, Matthew?

Matthew
01:17:13
Yeah, I mean just uh you know, outpouring critical love for this makes me want to see it and the anticipation and not having been able to see it by regular means. Uh means that yeah it's built up to be quite a big thing in my head. The weird thing is I don't know if I've ever seen an episode of ER in my life Yeah, same. I don't think I have actually. It just wasn't a thing that happened for me, but I could probably tell you all the major beats because it was it was so big growing up. that I just remember reading the newspapers like when major characters died or something shocking happened in it. So I've sort of absorbed it by osmosis. It's probably like the one of the like modern or more modern classic TV shows that I have actually haven't gone back and watched.

Samuel
01:17:58
Um Wikidze as well. Theme tunes are amazing for ER. Like uh yeah. But again, not seen it, but I know that theme tune, you know.

Matthew
01:18:06
Yeah. So uh yeah, I'm an uh but this this everyone says this is so good that um you gotta watch it really, you gotta give it a go.

Samuel
01:18:15
Yeah, for sure. So glad to finally get uh yeah, like a a chance to see that. Um there's a second season already airing in the US, so I assume we'll get both back to back in the UK. What I hope they don't do is put out the first season weekly. Um that would be so shit. Um which is what happened to Mandalorian where they launched Disney Plus here and it was like Come on dog, I could already watch all this in America. Um don't make this my problem just because you took ages to launch your streaming service, but anyway, we'll see how that pans out. What's your number 10 McCoy?

Matthew
01:18:42
I don't think the pit's got a Grogu that it can trade on in the same way.

Samuel
01:18:46
What twist that would be the end of episode one. Um, what's your number ten, Matthew?

Matthew
01:18:50
Just because the way the list works and because we've talked about some other entries earlier, I've got another book. uh another Japanese crime fiction called the The Final Six by Akenari Asakura, uh which is about six applicants for a job at a tech fern turn up for the final interview and find six envelopes with dark secrets about the other candidates. And it feels like it's it's a a sort of thriller about where did these these envelopes come from. Will you use the information in them to sort of screw with someone else's chances? Will they use their information about you? What is the dark secret they have on you? But I like the idea of the kind of like workplace thriller plus something maybe like a little bit more sort of sinister and and sort of heavier crime wise going on. Um yeah, I just I don't know. I I'll I'm always up for things about s sort of set in the the corporate world where it's it g it's you know it's not just morally dubious the company but the actual processes become sort of Slightly devilish, you know? Um I feel like I've maybe seen a few variations on this before, but I'm I'm into the concept.

Samuel
01:20:03
Yeah, I mean that's uh sounds like a great idea for a for a book. So um I kinda wanna read that. That sounds like it captures it would capture my imagination. So um a good recommendation to put on people's radar, Matthew. When's that one out? Uh actually I don't have a release date for that. I th uh maybe that's March. They're all quite early in the year, I think. Alright, well um my next pick is the Amazon Prime video show Criminal based on a comic book by Ed Brew Baker and Sean Phillips. This was filmed in 2024, so it's been a long time coming. Um, I don't know why it's taking so long. Um maybe my in my head, it's because they've got so much source material. I wonder if they're like maybe starting to film the second season so they can make it. quite frequ quite regularly. Um 'cause it's got a pretty big cast and it has a lot of like intersecting stories. So it's basically a crime it's like an ongoing sort of comic book, but like an anthology at the same time. So it draws focus to to different characters and multiple generations of criminal families and then explores like uh flashes back to parts of the history of different characters and goes forward and like and when they've done new new comic books like they um in the series they they connect back to existing stories and basically draws this big tapestry of like crime drama. Um in this like very noirish sort of like way that Sean Phillips art style is amazing at capturing that particular feel. And what is exciting about it, I think, is that Ed Brubaker, um, the writer, is also the executive producer of the show and the showrunner of the show. So he's written the first episode and then um I believe he's um Overseeing the whole thing, um, he left that um Batman Animated show that came out a couple of years ago to go and work on this instead, and fair enough. Um it stars um Charlie Hunt Charlie Hunnam Um Richard Jenkins, Adria Arjona, um and Amelia Clark, Luke Evans, loads of different people are in this as well, like Michael Mando's in this, John Hawkes, Garrett Headland, loads of different people are just like will pop up in this. But It is like I say, like this you can expect different characters to sort of to r to recur over time, but then there'll be like different characters who take the lead as well. It's An interesting book to adapt, but I think it's it could be absolutely enormous if they get it right. And um I think it feels like they've taken the time to get it right. So uh is this on your radar, Matthew? I mean Oh, I'd never heard of it. I mean I love a crime epic though. Recurring characters, like I say. Um yeah, a bit hard to explain maybe, but um they've re they've been working on it for such a long time. I think it started in two thousand six, so they've been producing new material for it for twenty years. If they do make you know, the uh second, third seasons, they've got loads of different material to um uh to to sort of like to to draw upon basically so yeah criminal it's cool very straightforward name but um it's like pulpy but it feels it still feels kind of fresh it's It's a good book, but um and I I think they'll they'll probably reissue them all in time for the show coming out. Criminal. There it is, Matthew. What's the number nine? My next pick is I mean I've I haven't got many left.

Matthew
01:23:14
My list's been all over the place. Um I think we've we've stepped on each other's lists a little bit. Um, I've picked something called Small Profits, uh, which is a BBC TV show. It's the it's the new show from Mackenzie Crook, following on from the Detectorists, uh, which was his uh much sort of beloved, very like low-key sort of c comedy drama about metal detector enthusiasts Um, this looks like it's kind of cut from a similar cloth in that it looks like it's about, you know, quite sort of small everyday lives. um but with a slightly fantastical tr uh sort of twist in it's about a a lonely guy who his partner vanished seven years ago and he's been sort of looking for her and For some reason he he sort of takes up alchemy and makes her homunculous.

Samuel
01:24:09
Alright, I say.

Matthew
01:24:10
Well that's the bitch of the show. That's all that's really known about it, is that this this this bloke makes a sort of uh a a uh a homunculus that can see the future. in his basement using alchemy, you know, magics, I guess. Uh but it looks like a cross between You know, what if y this weird magic comes into your life, but also, you know, your dad is a bloke played by Michael Palin? Um so yeah, like a slice of life plus alchemy BBC comedy drama. Um I d I just read the the synopsis and thought, oh well, that's gotta go on the list. That sounds interesting.

Samuel
01:24:51
Yeah, I saw this on a few of the TV show lists and uh I didn't watch Detectoris, but I know but you say it's much love And uh yeah, interesting, interesting cast and quite a different sort of idea for a show there. So Yeah, we'll check that out.

Matthew
01:25:09
Because of like the detectress was just so s so excellent that the BBC are like, sure, just you know, whatever, we we trust you, just do your thing.

Samuel
01:25:18
So um as long as as long as it's set in no more than like three locations, we'll make it basically. I think that's kind of the Yeah. Okay. Um so my next pick, Matthew, is um the new film from Green Knight director David Lowry, um, which is called Mother Mary. And um I had this on my radar for a little while because I knew it was about a basically a pop singer who's been around for a a little while. And um I think it's about a like a It's described as a psychosexual affair between this pop singer and this fashion designer. Um pop star is played by um Anne Hathaway. Uh the c Mother Mary is the name of the the pop star. And Michaela Cole plays the um fashion designer. And um they really hate each other based on the the past events of their their lives and the ways in which their lives have intersected previously. So um I like this, I think, because it reminds me a little bit of Vox Lux with Natalie Paulman, a film I liked from a few years ago. Um that was a little bit f a little bit ignored. But then I feel like got a bit more attention after the Brutalists from the same director, um, Brady Corbett became like um quite a big a big deal during Oscar season. Um enjoyed that. Um this Looks a little bit more in the black swan vein than that though. A little bit more sort of like heightened. Um hard to really get. Much of a feel for it beyond beyond that, to be honest, um, from what they shared so far. But we'll definitely see it based on that. An interesting director in the sense that he makes He's a bit of a does one for them and then one for him, um, kind of director. And then I feel like Green Knight though became like a big sort of like f film bro hit during COVID and when everyone got to watch it and it was just a really cool stylish film and I know his film A Ghost Story was really beloved as well. Um then he made some like weird uh Peter Pan and Wendy film for Disney Plus that everyone's completely memory-holed. Like I I've never heard anyone bring that film up in conversation. Um so this is a yeah, like his latest A twenty-four thing, but I thought the trailer was was interesting, that the casting quite good. Um Anne Hathaway and Michaela Cole is quite an interesting pair up really. Um has also some real life pop stars in it, um FK Twigs and a few others. But yeah. Are you aware of this at all, Matthew?

Matthew
01:27:39
Yeah, I I saw the trailer and and liked it. I'm me I did file it away as you know, all these trailers, these A twenty-four things, they always look amazing and uh uh s some of them don't always deliver or some of these films work best as a trailer because they just have such crazy visuals. Um, you know, and particularly as this one's about music, you can do lots of fun editing to the music in the trailer and all that jazz. But um yeah, I I hope it's great. I mean it's interesting people. Um I'm always up for a film where someone makes I don't know if it's suggesting they make a demonic coat, but there's maybe a suggestion of that in the trailer, yeah. It was hard to Yeah. Like a piece of clothing that's so Aggressive that it has like a mind of its own or something I have no idea.

Samuel
01:28:32
Yeah, that was um kinda curious, so We'll see how that pans out, but um yeah, definitely curious about it. What's your next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:28:39
It hasn't got a name yet, but I was intrigued by the untitled Jesse Eisenberg comedy musical Which is uh his follow-up to the one that he made last year, which name I'm blanking on?

Samuel
01:28:52
Uh oh uh painful a right pain what's it called something like that uh a real pain that's it a real pa a right pain that's the that's a version That's the version say Yorkshire, right? Oh real pain.

Matthew
01:29:05
Yeah, um interesting you mentioned Black Swan there for Mother Mary, 'cause this this's been described uh from a test screening as imagine Woody Allen's version of Black Swan. in that it follows a housewife played by Julianne Moore who joins a small community theatre project, so you know, amateur production, um, but gets completely lost to a kind of method acting madness in preparing for the role. So uh yeah, that's all that's really known about it. It's a musical. Apparently it's very, very funny, whatever it is, but I liked Real Pain so much that I'm kind of just generally sort of on board with what Jesse Eisenberg does next. So um yeah. I think that sounds alright. I would ya well I don't know. I'm not mad about Black Swan. Um and obviously sort of Uh viking the name of Woody Allen is is not always the wisest thing in this current climate, but uh let's see what happens.

Samuel
01:30:03
Yeah, for sure. Um okay, well good stuff Matthew. That's um I'll definitely walk go watch that too. I wasn't as big a fan as a a real pain of um as a lot of people. But um, you know, it was definitely definitely intrigued to see what he does next, um, for sure. Uh it was rock solid. Okay, uh again, very different, bringing the tone down. Um X-Men 97 season two is my um my pick here, Matthew. Um so the first season of this was the best thing Marvel has made in I don't know, like ten, well, since end game probably. Um it was a it was of like a rare quality where it it was riffing on nostalgia but then like pushing it forward in this very real way, um including it pretty harrowing bit where like the X-Men's kind of like utopia is basically com is basically destroyed by their version of nuclear missiles and it becomes incredibly harrowing halfway through the season. That was really good about season one of this. Like the The since cancelled uh uh showrunner of this is just like you just feel like he grasps the material better than anyone um and unfortunately has now been ousted. So Curious to see that if that the show continues the same level of quality that they had in season one. But um it was just this thing where it could have been like the same thing again Um and you go, oh that's nice that they did that, but instead it was like the better than most of the X-Men films, the vast majority of them. Um really just got the characters the animation was pretty nice for a modern 2D animated show. Um and yeah, yeah, felt like felt like modern and fresh despite being the this like nostalgic riff. So yeah, curious to see what they do with the second season of this is out in the middle of the um the middle of this year. Um I do think that that showrunner who was fired finished his work on season two before he was ousted. So I just hope it has a bit of the ambition of the season of season one. It doesn't f it didn't feel like it was trying to sort of like give you like a very generic X-Men story in the vein that the the films were. It was trying to be messy. It was trying to have all of the different characters. It was trying to have this like soap opera but slightly horny vibe to it that is what the X-Men comics are and what makes them distinctive versus other Marvel comics. So Yeah, curious. Um it really does feel like a proper sort of poison chalice thing of like the one guy who gets these things, it's like it just cannot be cannot be allowed to work on them. That's just you know, that feels like a S sums up a little bit where some of these superhero things are at these days, but alas. So yeah. What's your next pick, Matthew? Uh it's my last

Matthew
01:32:41
book pick is yet another Japanese thriller. Uh this is Guilt by Keigo Higashino. I mean this is you know, Higashino is kind of the guy, th the the the person who got me into Japanese crime fiction in the first place. Um it's interesting that uh everything that they've been translating of his, you know, over the last ten years has been like one of two series. He has um the sort of Detective Galileo. sort of physics puzzle books and then he has the carga detective books which are you know a a kind of a a guy sort of snooping around Tokyo in a very chilled way. Um this isn't either. I don't know if it is part of a series. I don't think it is. Um it's about a man who confesses to a recent murder, but also a historic murder for which someone has already been uh convicted and executed. um and uh the detective investigating this, you know, the hook of it is there's this guy who's confessed to these these two different crimes, um, but for some reason his confession uh rings false. And I He uh Hegoshina wrote this book called Malice a while back. It's one of his best books. Um it's something that I know a few of the Discorders have read. back off the the recommendations of the podcast very sort of self contained but that was a very good book about sort of untrustworthy testimony testimony and the weird things that can happen in the in the kind of you know conf i in the interview room and and during that process and This definitely has echoes of that which which excites me. So yeah, it's I mean I'll I'll any year where there's a new Higashino book is like a good year for me. I'm always happy. Um, I think this one comes out just after my birthday in April. I think it's something like April the 6th. Um So yes, it is yeah, another uh Japanese crime book which you now have to make small talk with me about.

Samuel
01:34:49
Well no I'm always glad. I mean Higashino's the one who I always make the joke about, um, a new Higashino, but it arriving after your birthday is quite fortuitous, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, I'm kind of intrigued by the idea of like someone who's already been executed for the crime. That's quite a cool sort of like dark um sort of like backdrop to the mystery. Um because it obviously implies guilt or sort of the the detectives who made that happen. So yeah. Um keep me informed on that one, Matthew, and on on how it goes. Um I will. Yeah. Okay. I am putting in the second season of Daredevil Born Again. Um I did like the first season of this despite it being heavily retooled, um as in like they shot loads of it and then decided they didn't like what they made and then did some bits around the sides to make it into more of the show they wanted it to be. Um I think that the first season was really was really good. I think this season will be extremely good because that team is making it from scratch and It tapped into the sort of darkness of the Netflix show and the great sort of characters, but without being really flabby and badly paced like those Netflix shows were, it moved so quickly by comparison, so I really appreciated that as someone who who liked their take on the Daredevil character. This brings the character Jessica Jones back into it, played by Kristen Ritter. But I'm more just kind of curious to see where um uh where things go from the quite bold decision they made to kill off a major character in the first season and where that leads the character of Matt Murdoch. But I just know this will be a really dependable like eight episodes of superhero show. So excited about that one Matthew. And um my tell me it was Foggy Nelson. It was, yeah, he did get killed off. Oh, did he? Oh right. Yeah. He gets he gets killed by um Bullseye in the first episode of um Oh, he gets whacked in episode one. Yeah, he does. And then It's quite interesting because it cuts forward and then it doesn't really address the death that much and then it kinda comes back around at the end. Because the way they had they they shot it, it's quite interesting how they do it. But um Yeah, it's uh that they did to the killed off the guy you hate Matthew, so you got your wish. You should watch it because they did the thing you asked for, you know? Yeah, I should watch it. It's good, it's honestly just really entertaining. And it has like this they found a slightly different thing to do with the Wilson Fisk part of it, which is what was getting repetitive about the Netflix show, is just him sitting around going Vanessa in various rooms. Um not very interesting. But because he's like running for mayor and that guy who is Uh James Gandolfini's son is like his kind of like knows about TikTok, sort of like bullshit PR guy basically. Um it they just found a slightly different they found a slightly different angle on on that character as like evil mayor of New York. I think it's quite quite a good pitch for that. So um yeah, curious to see how that pans out. And I thought I'd also give a shout out here to um My fifth pick is the publisher DC Comics in general is on a bit of a hot streak at the moment. Like if you go on the R Comics Reddit, all people do is talk about how much better their books are than Marvel's books at the moment. Um and it's kind of undeniable that they have taken up a huge amount of mind share with the these absolute DC books, which are basically like We're redoing the characters in a kind of modern way and they basically turned absolute Batman into like berserk where it's he's doing all this like mad Sort of it's like a a completely gigantic man who like hit the bat symbol on his chest is like an axe and he's just like fucking dudes up and it's like Bruce Wayne if he was um his mother was s Uh basically he's working class, essentially. And I've read the first few issues of it. It is quite stylish, it is quite different. It's from this comic book writer Scott Snyder who Is like one of the uh he's like the least divisive writers in terms of people everyone says he's good and everyone agrees he's good basically and he's he's one of the best Batman writers ever. Um so he did that and there's like a Superman book and a Wonder Woman book that people really like as well. And they've they're adding to that line this year with uh Green Arrow book as well, um by this really well respected writer writer And it's interesting because Marvel has done their own version of this in recent years. They did like ult they brought back their ultimate line, which does a similar thing of like, it's a fresh take on Spider-Man, etc. But these books have dwarfed that by like a factor of like three or something. Like they are Absolutely enormous. They've apparently new comic book shops have opened because these books are so popular. So they've really found their own niche on it. And um yeah, it's sort of like it's it's reached outside of the usual comic book audience, which is exactly what these publishers need really to stay relevant. So um because I know that you bought your your um Uh didn't you buy your stepdad a couple of these, Matthew, um, for Christmas? Um I think that's the thing that happened, isn't it?

Matthew
01:39:35
Wait, oh my dad yeah, my dad I bought a f a few um a few Batman Bits yeah, on your recommendation. If you could make an absolute book happen for a character who it hasn't happened for, who would it be?

Samuel
01:39:48
Ugh, well thing is they've done most of the main ones. They've done like Green Lantern, they've done Okay. Martian Martian Manhunter is the one that got like a low loads of acclaim last year. That's the one where everyone was like that this is the best. comic of the year, followed by Wonder Woman, which people really like, and then followed by Batman, which everyone agrees is like really like a steady good one. People seem a bit more down on the Superman one. So I don't know, they've done most of the superheroes I like now. They've done The Flash, for example. So I'd I'd really be like picking I don't know your fuck your fucking Nightwing level characters that none of our listeners will give a shit about. So Yeah, but that two books I w two um combination sorry two superhero things I wanted to throw together there, Matthew. Um DC comics in general. Check 'em out, they're doing some cool stuff. Even they're like main continuity, people really like those books. The um Current Batman writer. It's Matt Fraction who wrote the um Hawkeye book that everyone liked about ten or so years ago. So cur They're just on quite a yeah, they're on a a rare sort of hot streak. Um so wanted to shout that out basically in case that might be of interest to the listeners. What's your final pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:40:53
It it's gonna sound really grim, but I think it's I think it's gonna be good. Uh it's another BBC show. Uh big sort of UK swing in my picks this year. It's called Babies. It's made by the writer who did him and her the kind of comedy show about a couple who were always sort of slumming it in their sort of bed, never seemed to leave their flat, but it was quite a sort of Well I say it's quite an accurate representation and they're quite different p you know that's not already a a lifestyle I've ever had, but a quite a believable representation of um you know, a young couple, kind of ps everyday life really. Um and then he did a show called Mum on the BBC, which had Leslie Manville, and it was about her dealing with her life after her husband had passed away and the kind of tension between sort of her wanting to move on with her you know, she's got a clearly has a sort of romantic spark with one of their their family friends, but also her son being very sort of resistant to the idea of her moving on from her dad and uh his dad. And uh it was just kinda like sort of bittersweet. Wouldn't say it was like laugh out loud funny, but it was just s both shows were like brilliantly observed and just felt like absolutely real people. Um and this show is about slightly kind of tougher subject matter and which is why it's a bit of a I should have put this in the middle of my list rather at the end. um in that about a couple dealing with um repeated pregnancy loss which is obviously you know quite a sort of dark, sad, grim territory, but I also know Just from their work. I I keep forgetting the guys' name, so apologies for not saying it. Um but from those previous shows uh you know he just he works sort of like m minor sort of drama miracles with very normal lives so yeah I'm just super super intrigued about this one Um a bit like the Mackenzie Crook pick and the Hugo Blit uh pick. Um, you know, these are just sort of creators who the BBC have just trusted over and over again and have always delivered, um, which is quite a nice trend. You know, th that a lot of their work is coming out this year again. So Uh yeah I think it's gonna be I think it's gonna be a really, really strong year for British T V. That's cool.

Samuel
01:43:24
I feel like this is why I uh pay my license fee money so they you know this stuff gets made because you know I feel like th it's worth having a vested interest in the the T V and film output of the country you're from, um the jobs it creates and all that stuff. So Even though I know the you know they're sort of like have funding challenges to BBC, it's nice that this stuff is still getting made, you know. Um yeah, sounds sounds intriguing Matthew. I don't know much about I haven't seen either of those shows, but um I do know they were very well regarded. So uh Yeah, um a good recommendation I'm sure um that'll put it on listeners' radars. It's just not like a lot of fun after you've talked about DC.

Matthew
01:44:00
And devil.

Samuel
01:44:03
Well I've I've put I've put more superhero stuff in here than like I would like really, but it just hap so happens that quite a lot of the superhero stuff that I'm interested in is happening this year.

Matthew
01:44:13
So I think this represents our, you know, outside of games, our, you know, our tastes are a little bit more diverse, I think.

Samuel
01:44:22
Yeah, it's true. It's we don't really have much crossover. I've put like no regular books in here. All my books have to have Batman in them, or I just cannot engage with them, Matthew, as you know. So that's um that's my uh cross to bear. Um Yeah, so I have four other things to discuss here. Um I will start with June part three, which I probably would have been on your list if there weren't quite. Oh good, well, you know. Yeah, so the third uh coming down the tube a bit faster than I think anyone was really expecting. This is out at Christmas this year. Um it is the the third part of this yeah it is the final um instalment that Denny Villeneuve will direct. Um so completes the trilogy, brings back the cast of um uh Timothy Chalamet, uh Zendaya, Florence Pugh, um, etc. , Josh Brolin. So, you know, here it it's It's going to uh complete that story of this Messiah of this desert planet and it is based on the uh fuck, what's it called? Is it called June Messiah, the third book, Matthew? I think it is. Um is it no, it's the s that's the s it's the second book. The first two films were based on the first book, the two halves of the first book. Is that right? That's there, that is right. Not terribly familiar with our source material, but I think the overall kind of like suggestion. I mean this was the first two films were building up to this idea of like is Paul Atreides um actually this prophesized Messiah or is the entire idea of the Messiah um GBS and a complete bust. And so I imagine this third film will interrogate that. But I don't know much about it beyond that other than that they've roped in some other cool uh cast members. Robert Pattinson is in this film, for example, so um just a g uh they've just been the most dependable blockbusters of the last few years and it's exciting that the third one It's exciting that they're completing that story this year. So I really just can't wait to see how it pans out, even if I don't know much about the story, but I just love the production design, how it's shot. how seriously it takes the material. It's of such a high bar compared to like what most of the most of the Hollywood blockbusters have looked like in the last five years, Matthew. I thought last year was a absolutely terrible year for blockbusters. So you're excited about us too?

Matthew
01:46:28
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Sorry, I had I had it up higher on my list, but I knew it would be lower on your list, so I I I thought I'd park it for later and then I just forgot about it. Yeah. Um A year with both this and like a Nolan blockbuster, I mean I just I feel like we'll be uh uh well fed, huge nutritional value compared to the blockbusters of last year. Uh I'm kinda pleased it's coming out as Christmas as well. It's always nice to have a big film to look forward to in the the Christmas holidays where you finish work and then you like, well I can now go and watch something excellent as a little treat. So Yeah, I'm up for that.

Samuel
01:47:03
Yeah, for sure. Um this releasing opposite um Avengers is cool as well because I feel like um I feel like this might win against Avengers given where Marvel's at and where the the sort of like rising reputation of this is a so it'd be quite nice to see it kick Avengers ass personally but um either way I like you I do also like a a big Christmas film to look forward to um that's not just the Oscar stuff so yeah. Um okay so that completes your picks, Matthew. Um I have four more picks. Wait, three more picks. Um first up is um Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Colon New Sunnydale, which is um a sequel series to Buffy which ended in 2002, 3, 3, I think it was. Um features Sarah Michelle Gella, but then apparently features Bu Loads of other new characters that don't have anything to do with the original show. Um but I'm most interested in this because it's Chloe Zhao who's making it, um, who is you know, Oscar winning filmmaker made Hamlet, the film we discussed at the very start of this podcast. So Great fight scenes in Hamlet. Um I can't really get I can't really work out what this is gonna be. There are a few pap shots from it and so You know, for people who didn't watch the original Buffy show at the very end of season seven, the the town Sunnydale is destroyed. There's a fucking crater at the end of it because um Buffy closes the hell mouth. I think that's what happens. Basically i th the thing that was brought all the monsters of the week throughout Buffy's lifespan. Um she closed that portal and then that was the end of the show basically. And then she went off to live her life. And you didn't really know what else happened to her. But you got little hints in Angel Season 5 of what she was up to, um hanging out with some guy, um immortal man in in Rome is the last thing you really learned canonically about Buffy, I think. In any case. Um just curious about this because of the Chloe Zhao factor. I'm not really a big TV revival person, even though I've put both this and Malcolm in the middle of my list, I realise. So I think that's because my specific era of TV is now being revived and I'm curious to see what shape it takes, but I bet this'll be a good looking show because of the Chloe Jell connection. So yeah. Curious to see how that pans out, Matthew and Whether they'll bring other characters in it is complicated by the fact that vampires are supposed to be immortal and, you know, if it's twenty years later not a lot of these actors are going to be looking a bit wrinkly than they did when the show was on on the air. Um But I like Sarah Michelle Good, I want this to do well. Um it doesn't feature Joss Whedon, obviously a man who's been cast out of Hollywood. Um but I'm actually okay with that. I think I actually would rather see Chloe Zhao's take on it than the original writers of the show, um just because I just kind of curious to see what she makes of it because of you know her creative voice. Um and then I put um Godzilla minus zero in here, Matthew, which is the sequel to Godzilla um minus one Um one of those unexpected hits from a few years ago. I think everyone pretty much loved Godzilla um uh minus one. So Um Don't really know much about this other than that it's coming out later this year. And yeah, same director. I have no doubt it'll be a very high quality uh kind of like uh action film with some rad The Godzilla set pieces in it, which is what that that film managed to sort of re-establish. Godzilla is this, you know, pr very threatening presence and and also has some really good character drama in it. I'm guessing this is on your radar as well

Matthew
01:50:20
Yeah, I just didn't know it was out this year. Otherwise, um I didn't do as good as a Reddit searching as you clearly for this list or I would have added it.

Samuel
01:50:27
Yeah, like it's out in um November sixth in the US. You would expect it would come out here before the end of the year. And uh yes, um it's apparently filmed in Japan, New Zealand and Norway, so might be a might have a bit of a wider scope to it than um the previous film did. But uh yes. Um okay so uh s yes so so the last thing I was going to discuss Matthew And this is w was number one on my list of things to talk about was um the trip to the Northern Lights, the latest in the series of Steve Coogan and Rob Bryden's uh semi-improvised um trips to have eat loads of nice food in different places around um around Europe. And they said they wouldn't bring this back after the last one. The trip to Greece, which was the fourth series, came out. just before COVID, but I'm delighted that they're going to I think Sweden, Norway kind of way to make this and um don't really know much about it other than the the fact that it got revealed because Steve Coogan was dealing with some kind of speeding charge from from the law in the UK. But I absolutely love the trip. Um I think it's very backpage coded the trip. Is that is it one of your things, the trip?

Matthew
01:51:36
Oh, absolutely. I absolutely love the trip. We quote it all the time. I'd say more bits of the trip have entered mine and Catherine's general like vocabulary and and sort of behaviors than any other show we've watched together. Yeah. Like a any time we're in a restaurant and someone gets a wine, we do the whole how you're meant to what you meant to do when you're tasting the wine and Rob Ryden just does the very sort solemn nod to the waiter. Things like that. I mean it's what One of one of the all-time great TV shows. Um, you know, for me I'm I'm way more into this than I am like any of the Alan Partridge stuff, for example. And you just like, what impressions are they gonna do?

Samuel
01:52:14
That's all I wanna know. Yeah, I'm really glad they've gone back to it because I don't I don't think that the it ever really wavered in quality. I think it was always great. You know? Um and they always found something slightly different to do with it. So yeah. Maybe I feel like it's one of those things if you just w I think by waiting in the way that they have, it just means it'll feel fresh coming back to it. And they're both like um like nearly 60 now. So yeah, very backpage coded. I kind of I kind of want to do a trip rewatch before this and I wondered if you'd be up for doing an XXL on it, Matthew, because Oh, I I would actually be up for that would be good. Yeah, 'cause a very it's a very easy rewatch, isn't it? You can just have it on and it's not really like that taxing. Okay, cool. Ha yeah.

Matthew
01:52:58
On a side note, how do you feel about uh Steve Coogan in White Lotus? Ye

Samuel
01:53:03
Sort of I worried it'll feel like the trip, um, because he'll be there in these quite nice hotels eating and eating stuff or whatever, but Uh yeah, I don't know, I sort of I'm up and down on Coogan outside of his core sort of like Coogan universe projects like the trip in Alan Partridge. I sort of how do you feel about him?

Matthew
01:53:22
The same. He's a really funny guy. Um, but I sometimes think when he's like acting with a capital A, it doesn't always work. He was good in uh Philomena that that but ever since then he's done like variations on that which None of them have worked. I guess it'll it'll hinge on the character. The problem with the White Lotus, if you get like a slightly shit character, even a great actor can come quite unstuck in that. Um see Jason Isaac's last season

Samuel
01:53:49
Yeah, I I hope he gets to play a Brit because I I worry that maybe the White Lotus characters, the more like performative accent stuff they're asked to do, see also Jason Isaac's last season. like the m the more caricaturish the they actually seem in the show. So yeah. Um that's I'm hoping that it just sort of plays through its strengths and doesn't ask him to do too much because that's when it I'll be a little bit like I thought this is just Steve Coogan doing an accent basically. Um see also uh Joker Folly adieu. No, absolutely not I'm glad you're up for the the trip podcast though. Like that's I think that'd be really good. Um and inevitably we'll we'll we'll we should do something like that one day, Matthew. Just have like a a weekend in Weymouth or something, then make the trip version of the backpage podcast. I'm sure the listeners will quite enjoy that as long as it's paywalled and we never do it again. But um yes. Well there you go. That was very comprehensive. Um You should um share your list with me after this podcast, Matthew, and I'll give it to Graham to put on the old backpagepod. co. uk website. Um but so people can refer to those picks, particularly yours, in more detail in case they they miss the names and they're kind of curious about them. Definitely some stuff I want to check out from your list, Matthew. Otherwise, people know where to get us. The um the podcast next month on Patreon is going to be uh the GT4 DLCs, and we've both been playing those. That'll follow um this Coming Fridays, two three giant men play GTA four episodes. So um much like the Married Galaxies, we're doing one for the Free Feed, one for the um the Patreon. And there's something else happening on the XXL next month that I can't remember, Matthew, but um I'm sure that'll be good no matter what. Oh yeah, we're gonna rank the best picture nominees. I w I think um I think Matthew's seen all of them and I've got one left to see. Is that right, Matthew? You've seen every Oscar film? Every best picture nominee? Yeah, I've not seen Train Dreams, but I've seen the rest. So um Oh I've not seen Train Dreams either.

Matthew
01:55:46
Yeah.

Samuel
01:55:47
Okay, cool. So we'll watch those, we'll we'll uh we'll rank those. There's a few films in there we've not talked about before, so I think that'd be fun just ahead of the Oscars and then uh Yeah you can do some alt Oscar nominations for other categories. That's a great idea actually. We'll do that. We'll throw in some comedy awards as we enjoy doing on this podcast. Otherwise, thank you for listening and for your support and we'll be back next week. Goodbye.

Matthew
01:56:07
Goodbye.
