Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's it going? Do you have any sandwich or lunch updates for me in Bath? Because I've got one for you, actually.
So I was curious how it's going for you.
I've been going to Time quite a lot.
Right, right.
Which I know some people are down on since it changed hands, but I've been going there enough that we're reaching the dangerous Euregular Zone, which is where they become over-familiar with me. And it's not every day I want a chicken baguette.
Okay, interesting. I've not been there in a long time, actually. Isn't someone else?
Yeah, it used to be run by these sort of like, I would say like a squad of like old school dinner ladies.
That is 100% accurate. That is exactly who they are, yeah.
And now it's run by, I think, a Greek couple.
Right, right, because when you go in there now, it's actually got the vibe of a kebab shop or something. It's got like those glow up kind of boards with about 80 different options on them.
Yeah, the guy who runs it seems quite kind of quiet and timid, but then he's also got an ear stud, which I can never quite put those two things together, because I'd say that's quite a confident move.
Put those things together.
You know, it's kind of like his demeanour is like, don't worry about me, but then the ear stud is like, check this fucking guy out. That's really funny. That's my single observation about time.
I've been getting into Chandos Deli recently, which...
Oh, interesting.
We've never talked about it before, but as the name suggests, it does a few more things other than sandwiches, but the sandwiches they do have are pretty good. They've got some kind of old cheddar and sort of mayo and salad sandwich that I had this week that was pretty solid. And it's served in enormous bagels, like a four-batter bagel I've not seen previously in bars, like massive ones.
And they let you gamble on a whole, whether you would just want to go for a half. And I went for half, and then I was hungry by 4 p.m. so I went for a whole the next day.
Plus I had a hands-on event, which also I thought I'd just go for the big sandwich. That's pretty decent, actually. They do a smoked salmon cream cheese one that's tipped up as well.
You know I like those. When you say old cheddar, what I mean by that is, you know how they call it, I don't know, antiquated cheddar or whatever?
Oh, so not like old, or it's not like some left old, you know?
It's not like 50 years old.
It's not like bad cheddar?
No, I think it's like deliberately, it's like quite hard, crumbly cheddar, but it's like a, maybe it's a sort of type of cheddar, a format of cheddar. I'm unsure.
Format of cheddar.
But anyway, it's a pretty solid selection they've got up there, and I'd never been in there. But then when, I remember like a few years ago when Tim Clark, a PC Gamer, came in for a flying visit, he was like, oh yeah, I used to get a slice of quiche from there like every lunchtime. And I was like, okay, well, they'll finally give this place a go.
I've never been in there. I've walked past it many times. It's actually, I mean, not that anyone's interested, but I'll share it anyway.
I think if you were to do a heat map of the center of Bath of like streets I have and haven't walked on much, that stretch of shops is one of my least walked bits of pavement.
Yeah, I do agree. It's like, yeah, it's just a sort of a dead end in an open world game, isn't it?
Because you would never walk all the way up there to cut across and then go down the high street. You'd cut across on the heat map around that road by the salamander and all that road. I use that a lot.
Right, because it's got Mr. B's, the bookshop, right?
It's got Mr. B's, it's got that cake cafe with the extraordinary lunchtime deal.
But that one at the top, I couldn't tell you outside of Chando's what's actually on that street is how little I walk it.
Yeah, that's how I feel about the area of town that goes off from where TK Maxx is and goes near Portnay Bridge. That whole strip of stuff.
Because I used to live on Portnay Street, I've walked that quite a lot.
You know how it's got that place that just sells those little, are they Spanish pancake-y things, those little cake-y things? They just seem to sell that, or you have to have a sit-down meal, and there's that place, and then there's a few coffee shops, and then Chez Dominique, which is one of the best restaurants in Bath. But otherwise, I don't ever really have a reason to go along there.
And isn't there a shop that just sells Bath rugby stuff as well? That's around there too.
Yeah, but that's quite near the rugby grounds, so it makes sense.
It does make sense.
It's not completely wild.
Well, no, no, but that's like a part of Bath culture I do not engage with. So it's like, you know, when I just see those shirts, I'm like, oh, okay, town is going to be a fuck show today. Then I'll stay home basically.
So, yeah, but Chando's top stuff. So yeah, I do recommend looping around there and then we'll see what they've got.
Yeah, I need to adjust my heat map.
The only thing I would say is that I swear that the staff seems to change every day. It's like someone hits randomly generated a button on like a sort of character model of 20-something women and they just change every single day. I've not seen the same one three times.
I wonder if it works like while you're in the store, if you just did have 360 degree spin, it would load in new assets.
Oh dear. These are the things I think about when I'm working from home. Very exciting.
So Matthew, we've got what we've been playing episode coming up today, but I thought I'd give people a rundown of what we've got coming up in October as well because, you know, start of the month. So, you know, people wouldn't want to know what we've got in the pipe. So this is October 6th, you're listening to this.
What we've been playing, again, it's been a little while since we've done one of these, like six weeks or something. We've actually got some good games to talk about, it should be good. Obviously, we always have some good games to talk about, but this week Matthew's really been killing it.
October 9th is our XL episode, the best Resident Evil moments. Matthew, not sure how we're going to record that with your holiday, but we'll try and figure it out.
Yes, it'll be fine.
Maybe we bump that back a day. Should we say that's coming on the Tuesday instead, just to kill ourselves? Yeah, let's do that.
Just to have that wiggle room.
There you go. October 10th, you heard it here first. And October 13th is the best games of 2001, so we're going to do our best games format and talk about the year, but we're going further back because we decided 2017 would be slightly too depressing, so that's the choice we made.
October 20th is an interview episode. I won't say who it's with. We're actually still figuring out exactly what the content will be, but it's a good one.
I'm excited to do that one. And then on October 27th, we're doing the games of Remedy with a guest. I think I can say the guest is Simon Cardy from IGN, so that should be a fun one.
He's been doing a lot of Remedy content online, so hopefully he's well placed to offer us insights.
Absolutely. So we'll try and play a bit of Alan Wake 2 for then, because that's the day that Alan Wake 2 comes out. And I have seen some really cool stuff dropping for that in the past week, actually.
It's made me quite pumped about it, so that should be good. Then finally, to close out the month, slightly later than we normally do the XXL, but I think we're just going to need the time this month, is the Top 10 Scorsese Movies, Matthew. So I'll look forward to that one.
I'm watching my first Scorsese rewatch film today.
Exactly. You'll go to Casino with Catherine, which meant I felt weird about going, because I can't sit in the same... It would be strange if I just went there.
You could have come. You just have to put up with all the snogging, because there's nothing that gets me going like a man's head in a fucking vice.
Yeah I seem to recall when we were in the same cinema during Perfect Blue, you were like, oh yeah, perfect time for a bit of snogging.
Perfect necking material more like.
So that's the month of podcasts. It should be good. Then we've actually been planning ahead in November as well.
We've got Spider-Man 2 episode, an old Hitman games episode in the XL, all kinds of fun stuff.
I've got to get going on that fucking Hitman one.
Yeah I'm a bit stressed out by it. For the rest of the world, actually, I'm going to try and squeeze in some Code Veronica. So I've got some fresh Code Veronica thoughts.
That's the one that I don't think either of us have played. So I've played it just not for more than about a couple of hours.
I've played it in the format of Dark Side Chronicles light gun game.
That kind of counts, doesn't it? So yeah, that's what's coming up. If you want to support the Patreon podcast and unlock those extra episodes, patreon.com/backpagepod for the XL and XXL.
We've got a bunch of games that we've each been playing and then we've got a load of listener questions as well. So classic podcast format. You can see why it works for many other people.
Matthew, let's start with you. You have two very sexy things to discuss here and then one also sexy, but slightly less sexy thing to talk about. So why don't you kick us off?
I'm going to kick off with Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty, the new expansion, which was very much on my radar because I think the Witcher 3 expansions are two of the best around. So the idea of CD Projekt RED weaving more of their DLC magic was very appealing to me. Do you know much about this one?
I don't know if you've been following Phantom Liberty.
There's something about America, some kind of spy thriller and Idris Elba's in it. That I know, and then I know about the larger update that basically completely re-does the progression system in the base game Cyberpunk 2077.
So yeah, I know it's basically a headline feature. This adds a new region to Night City called Dogtown, hilariously just wasn't there before, but now this huge thing that everyone keeps talking about is suddenly pops out of nowhere, which I always like it when a game does that, the sort of retcons in something geographical and massive. Which is like, I'm not entirely up to date with the Cyberpunk in-game history of like what the relationship is between Night City and like the rest of the United States, like I get the feeling that there was like a war between them at some point, so like Night City is like its own sort of separatist state or something.
But basically Dogtown is like a bit of Night City, which doesn't really belong to Night City, doesn't really belong to anyone and is now ruled over by kind of warring military factions. It's the sort of skeleton of what was going to be a sort of luxury kind of casino resort. Like it's a little bit kind of Las Vegas-y, I guess is probably the vibe that they're going for.
There's this big neon sort of pyramid in the centre of it, which looks like it could be a Las Vegas casino. But in the timeline of this world, this big resort never got finished. I don't know how well you remember the base game, but do you remember Pacifica?
Which was the kind of like half-built coastal bit?
Yeah, yeah I do. It's where the... Is it the Haitian kind of gang?
Yeah, the Voodoo Boys. Very sensitively depicted Voodoo Boys. Dogtown is part of Pacifica, so it's got that very similar energy.
The Voodoo Boys are in Dogtown as well, so it fills out that area of the map. You are called in by... I'm going to spoil the setup, because they've talked about it a lot, but I won't spoil the rest of it.
You basically get a phone call from a person on board the Cyberpunk equivalent of Air Force One, who says, our plane is being hijacked and it's going to crash into Dogtown, and I've been able to hack into your brain for whatever reason. It's a netrunner on board the plane, and she says, you're the only person I've been able to contact, so I need you to come and save us from Dogtown. So it starts off as a sort of save the president mission, soon becomes something else, which is where Idris Elba comes into it as Solomon Reed, who is a kind of a deep cover agent who's been embedded in Dogtown for like seven years, and you are basically working with him to solve the problem of Dogtown.
Everyone keeps talking about it being like a spy thriller, and I thought that was going to be marketing bilge, but actually it's like a... it is a pretty good spy romp, is my major takeaway. Like it's very James Bondy, it's very Mission Impossible-y, a lot of the set pieces and the bigger missions are kind of heists, or breaking into swanky parties.
There's a machine which lets you sort of change your entire physical, you know, appearance, so you can sort of steal faces, so it has the kind of Mission Impossible face-stealing, you know, quite a scripted mechanic, but it's done in quite a fun way, and it, you know, it has lots of those scenes where people gather around tables and like lay out the plan, exactly how it's all gonna play out with like holograms and diagrams and all that, so if you love all that shit, Mission Impossible, there's loads of that here. I would say like because of that, like its strengths are its big story missions, which are as like amazingly and expensively produced as they were in the main game. I don't think this rewrites the rule book in terms of how Cyberpunk functions in RPG.
Like there is the wider 2.0 update which changes character progression and you know, that definitely changes like how you behave in combat and the specific kind of like physical combat ability build that you make. But as an actual RPG I still find it like quite linear, quite scripted. I'm sure this came up when we talked about this before with Cyberpunk, but like my big Cyberpunk take is that it's never better than in its very scripted story missions and those scripted story missions, I think they feel more like elevated Call of Duty levels to me than they do traditional RPG levels.
Like, if it wants you to do a stealth sequence, you're doing a stealth sequence, it doesn't matter what you build. If you're doing a big shootout, you're doing a big shootout, whatever you build. There are some grand sweeping changes you can make by deciding things at key story crossroads, but the actual moment to moment action, I think you're only ever doing exactly what CD Projekt RED want you to do and that's fine because they've done it really well.
They choreographed these set pieces beautifully and like I say, this one is really fun because it's got all this spy stuff. So if you enjoyed the big story missions of the campaign, like the Kumpeki Plaza, this has got several missions, I would say, as good as that Kumpeki Plaza heist level. It's kind of fat, which I think is fine, but the negative to this is I've seen some people go like, it's finally become the RPG it was always meant to be.
And I don't really buy that. I think it's like a cool shooting gallery with some quite colourful character options around the outside rather than a full-fledged RPG. And nothing in Phantom Liberty kind of changes my perspective on that.
That's interesting because I thought that one of the things I think I saw a review pulling out of this was that the choices were very meaningful and exciting and the consequences what you really felt them. And that's something I just never got from the main game.
Yeah, I mean, they are in that there's a very big decision that you have to make in this, which splits you down two paths for the last couple of hours of the DLC. So it does branch off. I don't think that's much different to what they do at the end of Cyberpunk where you basically pick a side to ally with to go into the final set piece.
You know, this is maybe more substantial, but it does fundamentally come down to kind of ending one or ending two. I've seen people try and pitch this as a Witcher 2, like the entire second act is different. It's just not that, you know, but because they can't like the like to make a game of that to make that much content, you know, the length of game you'd have to make like the expense and the resource required to do it at this level of fidelity, which has always been Cyberpunk's big kind of calling card, just how fucking amazing like all the performance capture looks and the bespoke details and the weird mechanics.
And I'm not, I'm not like dinging it for that. I mean, this is probably as substantial as the, as the branching has been. But the idea that it's like a finally a reactive kind of reflective RPG that's bringing all these choices into play, I don't think it's miles different from what they were doing already in the main game.
But you know, the Witcher 2 is a hard act to follow. They were never going to, I don't think any game will ever do that again, just because of like the cost of making these things now. Like it's just, you know, it would be obscene in the way that game did.
It was, you know, start to finish, Witcher 2 is like 30 hours as opposed to 100 hours. You know, that's how that stuff works. But this is definitely like for all Cyberpunk's flaws, I think Phantom Liberty is like a, it's very much putting its best foot forward.
Idris Elba is absolutely amazing in it. I don't really buy Keanu Reeves that much. I think he's actually, I think he's only okay in the base game, which has got like phenomenal voice acting and performances across the board, but all eyes are on Keanu because he's the flashy bit of casting and he's just not a very good voice actor, you know, that is a very different skill set.
And for whatever reason, I just think Idris Elba's like tone performance just fits this world much better. Like he's very world reary and crucially, and whether, you know, maybe this is just because I like Idris Elba in other stuff, you really like want to kind of like impress him. You know, you really like him.
It's quite a canny bit of casting for making you kind of feel very like allied to him, which is kind of at the heart of the dilemmas in the game is kind of like how much you're going to go with this guy or not. And you're like, well, I don't really want to let Idris Elba down. Which that's this is kind of how I felt about it.
And that's that does give some of the choices a bit more weight than they might naturally have because in the main game, there was just a lot of stuff about like, you know, you're going to cyber Johnny. And it's like, I kind of fucking hate this guy. And I don't really buy him as a thing.
You know, he's found him like quite hard to kind of gel with. And maybe that's not Keanu's fault. Maybe it's just the character itself.
But yeah, this is this is this is good. Like, you know, it's kind of Idris Elba more in like stringer bell mode. Just like quiet, authoritative.
And, you know, it's a mode I really like.
Well, that's the thing is, he is one of the most miscast actors.
Right.
In terms of like his potential versus the the outcome for his career that there has ever existed. Like in when you see Stringer Bell, you are like, this guy is all raw potential. And then it's just been lots of times where I felt like he's massively like in the wrong, the wrong role, like the Suicide Squad was a really good example of that.
He just wasn't funny. He wasn't. He did not gel with that cast and he was completely out of place in it.
It didn't it didn't work. And I've I haven't counted that a few times with him over his career. So, yeah, yeah.
It's good to hear that it's you know, it's it's it's the right fit. Is he doing is a British accent or is he putting on the American accent? Yeah, weirdly, that is what people seem to enjoy about him.
So, yeah, yeah, I I don't know if it's because I encountered him first in the wire, but I've always struggled with his act. It's like natural voice a bit.
Yeah, which is dumb. But I say Christian Bale is saying with Dominic West as well. Whenever I heard Dominic West go, hello, in real life.
You know, it's better when you're doing your slightly caricatured Baltimore cop accent.
But yeah, he does sell it really well. And the character model on him is pretty amazing as well. In the same way, obviously looks like him in the same way that Johnny Silverhand looks like Keanu Reeves.
The kind of stillness to him and the hard glare from him just, I don't know, just suits their character models and engine and animations really, really well.
Right. So it doesn't significantly push forward Cyberpunk, really. It's just a really good slice of Cyberpunk, is basically what you're saying.
Yeah, I'd say so. One thing it does do, which maybe will be of interest to some people anyway, is it gives you like a new ending to the whole campaign, like an option in the same way that you have like these various options at the end of the normal campaign, you now have another option on top of that, which is tied to what happens very specifically within this expansion, which I really rate. I think it's an ending...
I don't want to spoil it obviously, but it's an ending that addresses some of my problems with the original ending in quite a clever way and kind of recontextualises some of those other endings. Some of the things I found unsatisfying about them, and I would have voiced the opinion of well, they should have done this instead. They kind of do do this instead and show you that maybe you didn't want that after all, you know?
Which I found quite interesting. It's totally very different energy to the other endings.
Well, the bad ending in that game was also bad in the sense that it was basically tied to the fact that you didn't make enough mates in the side quest to get you the good ending.
Yeah, there isn't really a good ending to Cyberpunk 2077. That's like the slightly sort of nihilistic bit of that game is that kind of whatever you do, you're slightly fucked. And not to just relitigate Cyberpunk 2077, but one of the problems with that is that if you play the game fully and you make friends with everyone, there isn't actually an ending that brings everything together particularly neatly.
It's always kind of, you basically have three different faction endings, and all the other stuff is kind of ignored, which is why I think, you know, that sort of, there's an unsatisfyingness baked into it. This remedies some of that in a way, but it's definitely interesting, it's one of the bits of it I was like most curious about, like, what's this new ending gonna be, you know, is it gonna, because The Witcher 3 Blood and Wine kind of gives a new ending, you know, it's kind of about, like, retirement and what happens to Geralt once the quest is done, like, that's the vibe of the whole thing. This doesn't quite do that, because it's, the expansion's designed to be played, like, in the middle of the campaign, it's not like, and it doesn't go after the events of the main story.
So, it just feels like a mad romp that you can go off. I'd be interested to hear, actually, how people feel about it, if they were playing this game for the first time, and organically encountered this adventure, which takes them out of Night City for quite a long time, to go and, like, do this other thing, because, you know, given the whole setup, as you've got this ticking time bomb in your head, the idea that you can go for this little, like, romp in Dogtown is, it's kind of, you know, a bit contrived, but you have to kind of deal with it.
Interesting, so does Dogtown have any particular sort of, like, visual elevation over the rest of the game? Because they've obviously made this just for next-gen consoles, right, so it's not actually on PS4 and Xbox One this time. Does the city, is it particularly detailed or exciting versus the other areas of the city, or is it kind of the same deal, really?
It's sort of the same deal, like, it's quite a high, there's quite a lot of sort of skyscrapers in it. Like I say, it was meant to be very glamorous, but it wasn't quite finished, so, like, it still looks pretty ugly. It's actually, like, quite war-zoney, like, the roads are all kind of fucked, and it's quite hard to drive around, it's not a very satisfying driving place, but it's so small that you could probably walk it quite comfortably, or, like, use cyber-fucking-heels or whatever to sprint around.
Just like Bath, Matthew.
Yeah, it's basically like Bath. I haven't worked out where the Chando's Deli of Dogtown is. Which bit of Dogtown do we go to, at least?
Actually I do know it's up on the cliff, for those that have played it. Yeah, a couple of other things about it that are quite neat. It adds a few more, like, open-world activities.
There are, like, air drops that come in, which, if you kind of get to them fast enough, you have a little fight, and then you get some, like, rare bits. It feels like those are designed just to give you some, like, very fancy bits of cyberware and upgrade parts so that you can play with the new cyberware system quite easily. It's almost like a shortcut to get to some juicier builds.
There are some cars that you can steal from Dogtown and then deliver outside to, like, a fixer in the outside Night City. They're basically there to show off the car combat, because every time you leave Dogtown, like, everyone's suddenly fucking swarming you and you have them just shoot out the window, but I get why they do that, because they've added car combat and they want to kind of show that off. And probably the other thing of note is that it has, like, the gigs that the main game had, which are like the...
not the full-on side missions, but the, you know, go to this location and steal something, and actually the quality of those is quite elevated, like, they've got a lot more storytelling within them. That was a big complaint of mine with the base games, that I feel all the gigs were just, like, a building with guys, and then you'd hack a computer, and they felt very undercooked.
Yeah, you'd read their entire backstory after having murdered them all.
Right, that's the thing, it was like, here's the world building on a datapad that you find at the end of the mission, and you're like, this blows, but now they've got, like, characters and you have to make choices in them, and they're much closer to the proper side missions of the main game. So, like, they've definitely, it definitely feels like an expansion which has addressed the complaints of the main game, like, they've obviously gone out of their way to, like, really try and deal with these things. I'm not saying my Edge review really got some whatever, but I did, I was actually tickled by how many of my things were very specifically targeted by this expansion.
Interesting, well, I guess it just shows their listing to feedback, you know, and this is kind of is the last proper update, isn't it, for the game, really. This is kind of their sendoff, really. Do you think they've closed the leap on the narrative of this game, Matthew?
Because when we did that podcast, I think it was last year about it where I played it through for the first time. I did think it was pretty good. I think all of the things you say about its limitations in terms of choices and some of the mission design was all completely fair.
But the game was at least pretty nicely polished then. And now it seems like they've gone one step further into leaving it. So if you discover this game three, four years down the line, you download the complete edition, you're going to have a great time.
And I guess much the same way that The Witcher 3, they're kind of like, that's always packaged up and has this kind of evergreen reputation. Do you think that Cyberpunk is now at a position where it will just, it's very satisfying as a whole?
Yeah, it's definitely the best it's ever been. It's probably the best it's ever going to be. Like I said, I don't think it's a top, top tier RPG.
I think it is a step down from The Witcher 3 personally, in terms of what I enjoyed about that game and that world. I'd say it's finally a very solid eight for me. It's like where that game's landed.
And they can absolutely take that and run with that in an inevitable sequel. There's still just some fundamental oddness in how big that world is and how they choose to use it and what's actually in it. And like I say, it's not really an RPG as I sort of see it or think about them or what I value in them, I don't think is there.
But if you like building colourful combat builds, this is great for that. But maybe that's just not part of an RPG I'm into. That's almost got more in common with how you think about like a destiny build.
It's kind of how do you change these endless fights you're going to be having rather than how do you change the kind of fabric of this world with your character?
Yeah, exactly. I had no real sense of that. I was just like, okay, I've got the springy legs installed, I'm delighted and then just kind of go.
Right. And that's fine. And that's that's fine.
But yeah, there's been some absolute walloper takes around this game of like, either it's finally become a 10 or the people are like, it was always a 10. And you're just like, come on. I mean, you're just not doing your job if you think that like you're either a liar or a fool.
Amazing. That's the Sunday morning spice I was hoping for in this podcast. I think it's like an eight in a 10 world.
That's how I feel about it. Like, you know, the world is like, is really amazing. Like I think you just have to look at it if you've got and it's still the most next gen thing I've seen in a game.
This this open world for sure, even though it was on last last gen formats and obviously ran badly on their bit, they're just the setting like the, you know, the effort that went into making it as this high fidelity, incredible world. It's just that is amazing to boot up on a PS5 ago. Look the fuck at that.
That is still something that's true about this game. But 8 seems fair for what the experience otherwise is, Matthew, I look forward to digging into this. I might save this for Christmas though, because I don't think I'm going to, I'm not putting cyber bunk on my game of the year list.
So this is like a, this is like a great like pre 15 hour romp.
Nice. So well, you know, very reasonable in the context of this year. When you think about it.
So that's good. All right then, Matthew. So I guess like my first game is on along similar lines, really.
So Resident Evil 4, Separate Ways have been playing.
So I just heard you play as Idris Elba in Resident Evil 4.
In a red dress. No, it's, this is, you play as Ada Wong, obviously. For people who remember the original Resident Evil 4, there was like a side story element to this.
I remember, I realized, I remembered almost nothing about Separate Ways other than the fact that it intersects with the bits of the cut scene where Ada meets Leon, as you'd expect. And there was a bit with a big boat. And that's basically all, I think everyone who played it only remembers the boat, Matthew.
I don't know if I ever finished the original Separate Ways.
Yeah, it was quite, I thought it was quite lukewarm. Like it was never, whenever I would replay Resident Evil 4, I wouldn't replay Separate Ways. It wasn't that kind of thing.
So, so with this, though, you know, I was obviously the Resi 4 remake we were very impressed by. I think I still stand by the idea that it's probably the best third person, best modern third person shooter that I've played in terms of how, how good those mechanics are, how good the guns feel. It was such a successful update of the combat dynamics of the original Resi 4.
They took what worked and then, and then built a sort of like a contemporized it, I suppose. And so this comes along, it is eight quid, which is a very low price, very reasonable price for basically...
You sound like the merchant.
Yeah, so it's like, I think it's five hours long. It's a similar deal, but what has changed is it has the same production values as the main game. So you have cut scenes, quite a lot of cut scenes, actually, with Ada interacting with Luis and obviously, eventually Leon, and also Albert Wesker and other characters who you encounter in the story.
That side of things is fleshed out a lot more. The other slightly interesting thing it does is it actually has, it reintegrates some of the cut content from the base game that wasn't in the remake. So I don't want to spoil what all of that is, but let's just say the cable cars, that's one of them, right?
Right.
Yeah. So which is an interesting choice because it got me to sit and ask, would I have just preferred to have these in the base game? I think the answer is yes, I would have, but it's still nice that it's in here.
And I think actually what's interesting is this sort of functions as fan service in some ways. It has a reference to dirty treasure, which I don't think was in the base game. But people might remember in Resi 4, the original, there was like, if you didn't shoot down this little like wooden panel thing, and you shot down some treasure and it fell into the dirt that it was basically like worth nothing.
And this, there's a bit in this where I shot down some treasure and it landed in a muddy puddle and then Ada just went, oh, I don't want it that badly. And then she just leaves it there to kind of like sink into this like brown liquid. And I thought that was nice because I don't think there's anything like that in the base game.
So that kind of like felt like the statement of intent to me, like that and like a lot of interaction between her and Luis. I was like, oh, I'm playing fan service here. That's kind of what this is really.
But Jumper is just an interesting philosophy to take with a sort of like a bit of single player DLC. Eight quid is very reasonable. So it feels quite generous.
I saw someone say that it's about the length of Resident Evil 3 remake and it's a lot better because five hours, I mean, you know, I think being honest, Resi 3 remake probably took me about seven hours. I don't think I got it done that quickly, but I can see why people are comparing it favorably. It remixes some existing content like it's got like a big El Gigante fight, but it has a different mechanic where Ada has like one of the interesting things that Ada obviously brings to it.
She has like a grappling hook. It can only attach to like, you know, several points in the map, as you might expect. What that means is this El Gigante fight with a big troll lad is running at you, except you are going from building to building, and the El Gigante can destroy those buildings while you're stood on.
Oh, nice.
And then chuck rocks at you. And you're just... But it's a different approach to something you've already played, and I think, again, that sums up what this DLC does quite nicely.
So yeah, I think I'm like, I think I'm five chapters in? Something like that. But yeah, it's a generous chunk of game.
And you know, it's obviously a nice reminder of what the game does well. It does the kind of like the arc of gun upgrades and sort of fast motion. So you've already got a pretty good armory from basically the start, which is a good which is a good thing.
It expects that you played it before. And yeah, it's I don't know if story wise, it's that nutritious. But gameplay wise, I think that it's it's more Resi 4 remake and it is it is different to what you've already played.
So when I think about it, it does things like show that she rings the bell and things like that, right?
Yeah, yeah. And it shows how she intersects with that whole village set piece. Like I think I believe like in the first one of the first set pieces is you're in the village and Leon is under attack from everyone else.
They're all swarming towards the building with the shotgun in it that's got Leon.
Oh, yeah.
Then you're doing your bits around the outside. I think that's right. My memory has gone to gone to fuck this week.
It's been it's been a busy one. But yeah, it's it's just really yeah, it's just it's just better than it had to be. Like I think I think the original Separate Ways is actually longer than I realized it was.
I looked at how long to beat I think it was about four hours long. So it wasn't like super short. I remember it being like an hour or two hours or something.
But yeah, I think they might have added like another one to the right of the PS2 version. Another Ada bit. And then maybe I'm confusing it with that.
But either way.
Well, I thought Separate Ways was added for PS2. I didn't think it was in the GameCube, was it?
Is that right? Okay, that's yeah.
And then and then they add and then you could play it in the Wii edition, I think was maybe the first time I played it.
That makes sense. Yeah. Because I was.
Yes, it wasn't part of the original GameCube release. Yeah, that makes sense. Right.
So it kind of was the yeah, the slightly cheaper content added to enhance the PS2 version. That makes total sense. So that's that would explain why you've not really you've not really played it, Matthew.
So yeah, worth digging into. There are there's other stuff in there to be found. The other thing that it adds is it gives you Ada and Wesker in Mercenaries as well.
And I think it gives you another Mercenaries map. I've not dug into that side of things too much. But when I think about the fact that when Resi 4.5 did like it's Lost in Nightmares DLC, which I really liked, and the Desperate Escape DLC, which is less good, those combined were basically what this cost.
And they were that was probably about three hours of game between them. They were pretty short, pretty slight. This is like a lot more substantial.
I think it's more plausible that when you play Resi 4 remake again, you will also play this, which is quite high praise. I think the fact that it has all those cutscenes, it just makes you realize they've not just treated it as a bit of a knockoff bonus mode. It is basically meant to be an expansion pack.
So yeah, it's yeah, it works for me, Matthew.
Would have been fun if it was I know, wishful thinking, but if it had been baked in, you know, one of my kind of like minor complaints about remake was when you get to the end, you don't get that kind of exciting rush of Capcom extra goodies unlocking, which would have probably felt a bit more special in the moment if they just had, you know, bitten the bullet and putting it put it in there. But I'm curious how many people will play this because it is DLC, you know?
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's it could be it could be easy to miss, but I think because they've been doing like loads of price drops with Resi 4 remake recently, like 30 quid and stuff. So it's more plausible.
I think you'd pick up the pair of this like 38 quid or 40 quid.
Well, that's it. You know, be a game of the year edition and then like a year down the line, you'll be able to buy Village, you know, Village 7 Village in this for like a £40 bundle or something.
Exactly. Yeah. So yeah, there's like I don't think I ever see any game on price promotion more than the Resi 4 remakes like the Resi or the Resi remakes in general.
They are always on sale in various packages. Yeah. So there's there's something else that's actually I don't know if there's some of this might have been in the launch trailer.
You might have seen it, but there's there's something else that's missing from for that's in this as well. So that's that's a nice addition. So I think it just attempts to close the loop on Resi 4 remake in a nice way.
Is it the perviness?
No, it's very unpervy. It's a very, very tame. The Ada dress is very practical, practically dressed into.
I really love the Ada character model and voice actress in this though. I really liked that in 4. I thought she fit it brilliantly.
She got a lot of shit, didn't she?
Yeah, well, she's mad because she's great.
I think it's because she gives a live action performance more than a voice performance. That's why she's slightly different to the other characters. If you saw her playing Ada in live action, I think you'd be like, oh, I really get this.
But because she's just more subtle than the other characters, that's the sort of difference there. But no, I agree, that's one of the magic things about the Resi remakes generally, right? It's the look of the thing.
They just started with that and got that right. And so, yeah, very satisfying. But yeah, in some ways, I am torn though, because I would slightly prefer to have had that cut stuff in the main game.
Right.
Because it just adds a little bit more meat on the bones to something that was already very easy to recommend, you know? Well, that was one of mine. We've got to come to another very sexy one of yours, Matthew.
Well, moderately sexy. Assassin's Creed Mirage, which I've only played about six, seven hours of. It's kind of an interesting one.
It feels like smaller, quote unquote, maybe slightly easier to make stopgap between the absolute giant monsters that they've been making recently. If you've got like your 100 hour Assassin's Creed RPGs, your kind of Origins Odyssey Valhalla, the pitch of this one is kind of like a little bit more restrained and they framed that as a little bit more back to basics. So the pitch of this is you are in 10th century, 11th century Baghdad playing as Basim, who is the assassin who trains you to be an assassin in Valhalla.
So it's almost a direct prequel to Valhalla. Has led some corners of the internet to say that this is glorified DLC, because internet is going to internet and put its fucking dumb narratives onto everything.
Yep, building an entire city. That sounds like a DLC to me.
It clearly isn't as big a game as those other games. I think that is reflected in the price, I want to say, without even being refusing to look up on Google what it is.
It's like 45 quid.
So it's a little bit cheaper than the main entries. And yeah, but they've taken this slightly smaller game, you know, they're certainly the PR line is that they're kind of going back to basics and they want it to be a little bit more like Assassin's Creed 1, Assassin's Creed 2. I think more one is the vibe in that it is sort of stealth first.
It is about assassinating loads of people in a city. I don't want to say like Baghdad is like Jerusalem. It's not, but it's like in terms of color palette and vibe, it's slightly closer than some of the other places they've done, especially if you've played the last three where like big crowded cities, it wasn't really the strength.
And because of that, you know, in those last few games, I'd say other elements of it were dialed down. Like the parkour didn't feel quite as important here. It's super important because you're on these kind of cluttered rooftops.
The stealth element is kind of represented in that combat feels quite stripped back. Like you're still quite capable, but it's not like the power fantasy isn't. You've got this huge spread of combat abilities to use.
It certainly isn't Valhalla or Odyssey, which, you know, were very combat focused games. So it's about sneaking around. It's about investigating targets in this city and kind of uncovering this sort of network of conspirators, which I guess is thematically quite similar to Assassin's Creed 1 in that you have these targets and a lot of the game is kind of laying the groundwork for the bigger assassination missions.
So you go off and investigate. Obviously in Assassin's Creed 1, all those investigations were pulled from a pool of like five very bad mission templates, like sit on a bench and eavesdrop or follow a guy and eavesdrop or just stand near them and eavesdrop. A lot of eavesdropping basically.
This like the missions are a bit more kind of fully featured. You know, you're doing a much greater range of things. A lot's been said about this free form investigation.
Like you have this kind of clue board that you're filling in to kind of work out who everyone is. I think a lot of that is basically colourful framing for how these games have always operated. It's like instead of a bloke giving you, you know, missions in succession before you uncover the main target, it's a cork board giving you those missions in succession.
Like I don't feel like there's anything particularly interesting going on with regards to that. So to put rest to that marketing line, you know, this isn't like some fucking Sam Barlow Assassin's Creed where you're kind of chipping away in all these different directions and discovering stuff. You're very much playing the game on its own terms.
But I have enjoyed playing in the city. Like that is the big thing that's slightly different here to the previous games. That's probably due to the fact that we haven't had a big city like this in one of these games for like six, seven years.
I was definitely sick of them by the time we got to like Origins. I did think the series needed to change. But actually here, stealth being the focus, they're being more of a wanted system.
Like if you get caught, there's, you know, running up to the rooftops, escaping, breaking line of sight. I definitely got bored of that back in the day. But here I don't mind it as much because I haven't done it for a while.
It's all quite slick. I guess the big problem I do have with them doubling down on it being like stealth Assassin's Creed again is that Assassin's Creed has never been a very good stealth game. Its stealth systems just aren't sophisticated enough.
Like its AI is too basic. Like this is still a game where best tactic is to crouch in a bush, whistle guards over one by one, assassinate them in the bush. As long as you're standing in the bush, you can assassinate them even if their mate is looking at the bush.
That's been true of like the last five, six of these games and it hasn't moved beyond that. They've tried to give a more aggressive stealth momentum, I guess, in that you charge up this focus assassination, which is quite like Sam Fisher's Mark and Execute from Conviction, in that you mark three guys and then you'll chain assassinate. And it's basically you sort of teleport between them.
It's like whoever you get, you can assassinate. So often there'll be a combination of guards. You couldn't possibly take out one with the other two seeing.
But so you build up this focus assassination by doing smaller kills and then fire that off. That's quite satisfying. But again, you can also sit in a bush and whistle them over one by one.
So as long as they give you that crutch, I don't know if this will ever really convince as a stealth game. And I actually I'd be up for it. I don't know if the mainstream audience would.
Like there's a reason stealth games don't get made as much. You know, the feeling is their audience is that much smaller. I don't know.
Do you agree with that?
Well, I think like in some ways it's depressing that this is the main touch point for a mainstream audience with a stealth mechanic. You know what I mean? They're more likely to have encountered in Assassin's Creed than any other type of game I would expect because there are so many of them and they're so widely available.
So to a lot of people, I think that Assassin's Creed is what a stealth game is, you know. I don't mind that Assassin's Creed has always had like these, I guess, quite broad mechanics, like they're easy. It's easy to pick up and play because it's built for a gigantic audience.
It was the original game that did that, you know, that sort of said that this doesn't need to be complicated. You don't need to have a jump button. You don't need to have hard stealth.
You don't need to have hard combat that can all be done with, you know, a couple of button presses or holding down a button or whatever. And I think it all these years down the line, I do think that element of it could probably use some mixing up if it's still sounds like it's kind of the same as it was, I don't know, what, 15 years ago, kind of similar, you know.
That's the canny thing about saying this is back to basics is that you're almost meant to not question it because you're like, yes, this definitely feels like a stealth game from 15 years ago.
Right, right.
And it looks beautiful. I will say with these games, like, I actually am a bit of a Valhalla apologist. I quite like that game, even though I never see people saying nice things about it.
I liked the rolling hills of the British countryside. I thought you looked phenomenal. I loved the more aggressive kind of thrust of being a Viking in that world.
You know, I don't think it ever quite squared the fact that you were a big, loud, angry Viking and also a very quiet stealth thing.
This, by kind of getting rid of that combat, it does have its own identity. It does look amazing. The city is really beautiful.
The lighting and the weather and the sand in the air, all the thickness of the air of being near a desert region. It captures that all really well. It's certainly spectacular in that regard.
I just feel like once you've literally done the stealth tutorial, you've done everything that game is going to do stealth-wise. And they can put it in more impressive buildings. There's quite a few big buildings in Baghdad which allow for inside stealth set pieces, which is slightly different.
They feel more like... I just did the one where you have to break a guy out of a prison and working carefully through the innards of this prison where you don't have the freedom to instantly just leg it up to the rooftops or escape. You're kind of penned in with everyone.
Actually, that did have a little bit of claustrophobia to it which is slightly different to the last few games and I quite enjoyed that. But, you know, so much of the time it's go to this boatyard and whistle guys into bushes while collecting three doodads. It's always, you know, free three slaves or collect three scrolls or steal three, you know, shipments of something.
And that stuff is, I don't know, it just feels like it's completely run out of ideas.
Right, right.
And it makes me sort of excited for the next one because the next one's Clint Hocking's behind it, right?
I can't remember. Did they announce like three of them at once or something?
Yeah, but I think his is the next one. And the idea of him coming in, you know, Mr. Splinter Cell, the good Splinter Cell games, and maybe like giving it a shot in the arm or like questioning its stealth fundamentals. But at the same time, like, I don't know why they didn't do it here, given that its pitch is it is the stealth Assassin's Creed this year.
And what that actually means is we've stripped out everything that wasn't our same old stealth system. So I'm really curious that we're recording this before the reviews have come out. I am really curious to see how this reviews, because it feels like all systems that were in Valhalla just missing a load of systems that were in Valhalla.
Right.
And I don't know if that's going to be particularly satisfying for people.
What was the deal with people's sentiment towards Valhalla then? Because, I mean, this one thing is that is notable. There's three years between this and the last Assassin's Creed game.
That's a long time. Now they did do a lot of DLC for Valhalla. And I think it was a very successful game, like even, I think in the second year, maybe it made more money than the first or something like that.
It was a lot of people kept buying it and buying the DLC. But I remember people really liked Odyssey, right? And so I don't know if people just like, again, had enough of that formula after three games.
Origins Odyssey and Valhalla kind of a trilogy in themselves.
Yeah, I think it was pure fatigue. I didn't get on as well with Odyssey. Like I found the tone of it and the setting of it great.
You know, the kind of the sunny kind of Greek holiday, you know, all these mad mythological things. Everyone really likes, you know, the Cassandra character in particular is really good fun. And I get all that, but I found it so bogged down in like the loops dropping.
And I don't know how much Odyssey you played, but it had this system where the war is constant throughout the game. And it endlessly generates side objectives, which you can use to swing the war one way or another. But it is fundamentally an endless war.
So it's a world that you can't like ever fully kind of cross everything off, because it's always generating more chores, more map filler for you to do. And you know, I liked Valhalla in that it stripped back a lot of that loop. Like I probably changed my loadout a couple of times across 100 hours.
It was finite. You could actually finish bits of that map and go, well, I don't ever have to really worry about that ever again. And I also, you know, I liked the Viking-ness of it.
I liked the aggression of the combat. I actually preferred the violence and the punch of the combat in Valhalla to Odyssey. I thought it was a better game all round.
I really quite liked Valhalla. It very almost made my top 10 for that year. But yeah, I think everyone else was just bored of it.
There's a lot of anti Ubisoft sentiment as well. So, you know, and I get that. It seemed at the time it just wasn't the cool thing to like for many different reasons.
Yeah, it's been an odd Ubisoft generation, right? Quite strange. When you think about just how much they dominated the 360 and PS4 generations, I feel like their games were very much at the forefront.
They were like the big deal. Far Cry 4, huge deal. Assassin's Creed had a bumpy start with Unity, but as discussed, people really liked Origins and Odyssey.
And then this generation, Valhalla was a cross-gen title. There was a Far Cry title that feels like people were just not in love with. The Watch Dogs Legion, which was interesting, but people didn't seem to love either.
And so they now seem to be going to more of a licensed game sort of like paradigm, I guess, like doing Avatar and Star Wars, which is a bit different. But we're three years in, and I don't know if there's been that standard bearer big Ubisoft game yet. You know what I mean?
Everything's been lost. Like Mirage is still PlayStation 4 as well. They just won't give up the previous generation.
I'm not saying that's the key to it at all, but it feels like they're tethered to things that worked for the last 10 years. And you're right. I'm not saying that's just because they haven't moved on from the last generation, but given that there was a period where they created three or four franchises, which are still their key franchises now, like it is sad that we haven't seen anything kind of new from them or anything interesting from them.
Or what was interesting, they don't seem interested in doing anymore. Like, you know, Rayman was, you know, in such a good place to not make any more Rayman games and whatever's going on with The Ungood and Evil 2. And, you know, look at their arduous journey of fucking Skull and Bones.
You know, a game based on like almost a mini game from a game from 10 years ago. You know, it's like, remember those boats you loved in literally like 2012 now? I think it was the first time we saw the boats in Assassin's Creed.
And like, that's just mad that they're so hung up on that. But they probably know that.
Ubisoft like used the original Assassin's Creed to, you know, to basically kick the door down on that generation, right? And be like, we're making this really sophisticated thing. Now, the game went up being feeling like more of a tech demo, but they built on it in some cool ways eventually.
Watch Dogs, same thing for last year, right? Again, like not exactly my kind of game in some ways, but was like a big shiny next gen thing that got people excited about generation. Just hasn't happened this time, which is just weird.
I think Avatar is meant to be. I think that's going to be their first, it's not on PS4 game, like it's their first new gen only game. Yeah, yeah, maybe I am overlooking that.
But then it comes always like fucking Avatar baggage, which like even if that game is the best game in the world, a lot of people are going to be so turned off by like, you know, sticking their tendrils into a horse or whatever it is.
Yeah, like there was some in that last trailer they released where like you were ripping dudes out of mechs or whatever, they look pretty cool. But I just I don't I can't say it's like something I'm massively pumped for and it's not something they own either. It's like, you know, that's Jim Cameron's baby.
So, yeah, just a bit of a weird one. Yeah, and it was it. Yeah, and it was interesting for them to go all in on the kind of like this is like classic Assassin's Creed as you remember it pitch with this one.
But the only problem with that is I remember what classic Assassin's Creed is like because there were like a million of them. Like, it's not something that even with a bit of time I haven't built up like an enormous amount of like fondness for it.
If anything, when you see the bits in this that are lifted from those old games they're never things you want, like guards being on their fucking heels for too long and you eventually, you know, they've got those it's got those weird little, I don't even know what they are but they're on rooftops and they've kind of they look like confessionals, they've got like curtain boxes that you jump in to hide.
Yeah.
You remember those? I never really knew what what those things were for in the original games. But they're back, so it's like finally you get to sit in a box while the AI plays out its search routine.
Like, great. I don't know. I feel like this is a game that's probably gonna be about 30 hours long based on like the structure of it.
And like maybe you'd rinse through that. You know, this will come down in price. This will, you know, the Ubisoft games tend to, you know, appear in sales and things like, you know, 20 quid.
If you're really into the Assassin's Creed lore and all that stuff, like that will be fine. But yeah, it just it feels like it's sort of treading water. It feels like here's something Assassin's Creed-y while we work on the actual the big important one.
It's the feeling.
Yeah, I think the next one actually might be the Japan one.
Yeah, I mean that one, like people have been dreaming of that one from like the beginning, you know, I think after Assassin's Creed 2, everyone was like, they're going to go to Japan and then they never did. And like, that's when you really have to get right. Like that Assassin fantasy is so specific.
If that's still just whistling in bushes and stabbing people with the hidden blade, like you'd be throwing away one of the richest like assassination settings ever.
You also have a very real danger that it just ends up being Ghost of Tsushima again. Which like that game that game has done something quite similar. Like it's not a stealth game per se, but it has a stealth elements.
Like it's yeah, it could end up being you don't. I don't you don't want a repeat of that, you know.
But it is. That's the thing. Tsushima is like the same.
There's this bar now of like cinematic stealth. And it's Assassin's Creed, it's Tsushima, it's the stealth in Spider-Man. You know, it's just it's sort of.
It's maybe the stealth in like Uncharted and The Last of Us. They've got a little bit more going for them, I'd say.
Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. But they have other things to them as well.
That's the thing.
Yeah. I just I just don't want to crouch in a bush anymore, you know.
Yeah, it's almost like it's almost like a third. I would say it's not a third person stealth problem because Metal Gear is a stealth game. Like Metal Gear Solid V is a very sophisticated stealth experience.
Yeah.
So like so yeah, it's just it's just the it's blockbuster stealth, isn't it? That's the problem. It's not and it's not and it's not interesting.
That's the problem.
Yeah. It's flashy, but it can't sustain your interest for like a whole game.
No, no. So I'm with you on that one. So, okay.
Well, interesting. Well, okay. Well, I appreciate your your your insight in this one.
I only played this yesterday. So quite rambling thoughts there in Mirage.
No, it's all good. It's all good. So we come to our last game of this episode, Matthew.
We've both been playing this one, Cocoon, which is a game that featured in the Xbox conference this year. Is that right, Matthew?
Yeah, it was definitely at Summer Games Fest. It's been popping up here, there and everywhere.
Yeah. So how best to describe it? It's like a puzzle adventure game where there are these series of orbs you collect in the game and the orbs contain entire worlds.
And you use the orbs to both solve puzzles and also you dive into them and out of them again. To basically solve our best... It's a really hard one to really boil down into a couple of lines.
But basically these objects are key because you dive into them as levels and then you use the objects themselves to solve puzzles. And sometimes you will take one orb into another orb. So you're basically carrying entire worlds with you at once.
And you'll leave worlds, re-enter them. Some you won't enter for a while. Some you'll use just to store an orb and then come back later.
And like this, it's a really interesting central hook for a puzzle adventure game. It's got a lot of acclaim. It's sitting at 89 on Metacritic as we speak.
So people really like it. And it's also from the lead game designer Jep Carlson. I hope it's Jep or Jeppe.
Jep Carlson, the lead gameplay designer of Limbo and Inside. So, you know, much like Somerville last year, I guess, it's carrying some of the prestige of those games. And okay, so it's on Game Pass, which is great.
It means you can just play it. And I gotta say, I think presentationally, it's incredibly impressive. Like you're playing this little like fly dude.
I don't know what his whole deal is, but I'm sure that...
Is he a cicada?
Something like that, maybe. He's got little wings and can occasionally fly from one thing to another. There's also like...
There's a lot of like weird bug imagery in this one. And yeah, you're basically just solving these puzzles. I think it's like...
Looks incredible. It's very, very polished, this presentation. I would say that actually like the sort of simplicity of the presentation is no HUD and there's no explanation of even how to play.
The game just leaves it to you to understand. And those things combine, the polish and that. That is where the similarities to Inside and Limbo are, I would say, Matthew.
Just that sheer level of like, this is airtight. There are no bugs. It doesn't feel like it needs a patch or whatever.
It feels playtested with an inch of its life.
Exactly. Whereas I think like Summerfield, we can say, didn't really. It was a little bit bumpier in terms of gameplay mechanics.
Spectacle, absolutely incredible. But yeah, like gameplay wise, it wasn't quite there. That said, I think like, so the interesting thing about this game is it's not that hard, really.
You will solve most of the puzzles without breaking a sweat. And that is one of the good things about it. There is just like almost unbroken sense of momentum to it.
You solve a puzzle, you run onto the next thing. And it's always giving you these eureka moments. But I think the real secret behind that is that none of its puzzles are that complicated.
And so I think that leads to a small problem where, maybe like a medium sized problem, where your brain is not quite stimulated enough by it. And you start to like, I think in the second half, you start to phase out of it a little bit. That's been my experience of it, Matthew.
It's immaculately presented. But I'm sort of like, I'm nearing, I think I must be nearing the end. And I'm just, I fell out of love with it the longer it's gone on, which is a real shame thing, because I thought this is going to be the indie darling of the year from the way people are talking about it.
And it's not quite doing it for me. How do you feel about it?
I would say hard agree.
Oh, OK, interesting.
Yeah. So I thought one of the really interesting... I loved Christian Donovan's review of this for Eurogamer.
He gave it five stars. And one of the things he kind of pulled out and sort of celebrated about it was that how it doesn't sprawl, how it has a lot of tricks that it does to kind of cut you off from stuff that isn't important anymore, to kind of keep you focused on the problem. Like it's almost essential mechanic is so potentially mind boggling that it has to kind of do a lot of work to kind of keep it tame and workable, which leads to that like momentum.
And he was celebrating is like this is very elegant to like take something this kind of crazy and out there, but also have very kind of clear cut rules of how it behaves. And you can't really, you know, it won't let you walk off in the wrong direction or anything like that. It won't let you make stupid mistakes.
It won't waste your time. But I think it does all that to such a degree that I don't really feel like I solved most of it. I felt like I did the only thing that was available to me in any given moment.
Your actual interactions. So like you have these orbs, which are like, like say these nested worlds. And, you know, the pitch of that of like you can take an orb into another orb and you're like, whoa, that's pretty crazy.
And it's like, you can do it on these very specific pedestals and you can't drop an orb anyway. You can only put it on these very specific spots. And often there is only one place you can put an orb in those situations.
So as long as you do the thing the game is so obviously telling you to do, like you will just you will do this game. And I think the magic of it, and this isn't to put it down, like the magic of it is that like you can still be like, wow, conceptually, that's really clever. You know, and I'm really impressed by how they visualize that.
And, you know, the idea of this puzzle is really great. But I also feel like if it's the only solution available to you, it's not really a solution at all. It's as linear as anything.
And I think that's kind of a problem in a puzzle game. And it's what stops it from being, you know, like, like the masterpiece. I think a lot of people think this is and that's fair enough if they do.
I think it's, you know, what it is, is a very enjoyable, like you say, visually impressive, frictionless trip from A to B, which I enjoyed. Like it wasn't a waste of five hours or whatever, but neither was it. Like this will stay with me forever because I really worked it out.
I mean, I'd say there are like maybe two or three exceptions to that. I think there are a couple of puzzles where actually it does open up enough and do stuff with the nested worlds and like worlds within worlds and what happens when something on layer A has to reach layer D within that. And but it only does that a couple of times.
It almost like it's so disciplined. It's like so playtested that it doesn't want to repeat itself ever. And so there's no iteration on puzzles.
There's no bagginess, but there's also only one opportunity to enjoy a few of its best ideas. I also think another thing it does. So it has the worlds within worlds, which is like a key mechanic, but also the orbs themselves.
When you defeat a boss in the orb worlds, the orbs, they have like abilities which you then use to solve other puzzles. So like there's an orb that reveals invisible platforms. There's an orb that solidifies kind of gas platforms.
Those mechanics I think are pretty boring and not very interesting puzzle mechanics. Walking around invisible platforms, I've seen that so many times. And the one which solidified things and then dropped through others.
Like that to me is such a distraction from like the nested orb thing, which is interesting. I was really surprised at how much of that stuff, which just is only fine.
Is in this game is that that solidifying platforms thing. It's basically like the when you jump in Mario 3D World and then like the entire and then type platform swap locations depending on, you know, whether it's jump.
Yeah, that's that. Yeah, that's exactly. It's also there's a in Mario Galaxy 2, there's electric Yoshi who creates platforms around him when he illuminates.
He's like light bulb Yoshi and he like illuminates platforms. You can I've just I've seen that a million times before, which given that it also has this huge idea that I've never seen before. I'm kind of surprised that other other stuff made the cut is kind of my big takeaway from this.
But like I would still like say you absolutely play this game. I get why people love it like it's it's so it's so well made and so seamless and the wordless element of it is definitely to be celebrated like it's an elegant beautiful thing. But is it actually a properly good puzzle game outside of a couple of like set piece blockbuster nested world moments?
I'm not sure.
No, and the other thing is it is a perfect game pass game, right? It's like I say, it's about five hours. I saw some people say it's three hours.
That's a lie. It's only three hours. Like if you if you like never ever stop and you have a walkthrough, I would say like it will take you a bit longer than that.
But like it's yeah, so it's enough for you to easily fit inside a weekend or a couple of evenings. And and for that, like that's that's perfect for game pass, right? It's sort of what you want.
Yeah, I thought about playing Norco last year, right? But like at the same time.
This ain't no Norco.
No, it's no Norco. It's definitely not. So yeah, it's I just I think I think my whole thing this year is I really do want to find like the some indies to have in my top 10 list, you know, and that I will love.
And I've just I've just really struggled either with this this crop this year or I've still not played the right ones. I've just bounced off of some of them. And yeah, this is a weird one.
I haven't bounced off of this as such. But yeah, I do agree. Yeah, I do agree that it has it has this amazing signature power and then it has these slightly underbaked additional mechanics that the other thing is like there are other orbs you get.
But it takes so long to get them. And then some of them don't seem to have any abilities attached them. And it's just like, I don't know.
It's just yeah, just it's really missing something, I think, in that respect. So yeah, just second half of it. Just I'm just like, yeah, I'm switching.
I thought for the first hour or so, I was like, oh, yeah, this is like an easy shoe. And this is this is great. I'm really loving this.
And I can't wait to see this get going. And I just never really did get going. It's like the excitement about the promise of it was never, never quite met.
One thing I do really like about it is I really like the boss battles in it. Yeah, each boss battle kind of has its own bespoke mechanic. And they're all done with just the the analog stick and like one button.
And they're kind of like Zelda bosses in that they're kind of puzzle. You know, you have to work out how to use the ability to kind of expose their weak spot. But they're just, you know, again, that's where like the really spectacular animation kicks in.
You know, it's also smooth. It feels really satisfying. You know, it looks and sounds satisfying.
Like those, those really nice moments. So, yeah, it's weird, like there's nothing in the 10 out of 10 reviews where I'm like, oh, I really disagree with that, you know, but I just, it didn't quite take off in a way. Like it's on paper clever rather than like in my heart, clever, you know.
Yeah. And sort of like I started, I just noticed it, but I agree about the bosses. They are incredibly impressive and they are like, they give the game the visual spectacle that you that you really want.
And some of the, you know, the orb worlds, they do all look very different from each other. They do look cool. But I felt my heart sinking when I'd come to a new place and say, oh, yeah, there's a gassy platform.
There's like a little sort of like notch to indicate there's like a floating platform there that my little orb will detect. And there's a barrier that only the little robot lads can get rid of. There's the little thing that catches the robot lads.
And it's just, I was just like, oh, that's how I started to feel about it as opposed to like, oh, wow, here we go. Another puzzle set piece. It just, it's just not quite adding up for me.
So, yeah, I feel like a real bummer because it's quite rare these days. I'm massively against, yeah, against the consensus. But here we are.
That's a big contrary back page take.
Yeah, that's it. We're both all in on not liking Cocoon. No, I do like it.
I love that we're all in on God of War 3. But Cocoon, delicate, beautiful Cocoon. Absolutely not.
We just passed the anniversary of the death of Queen Elizabeth II. And that reminded me that when she died and we got that day off, I spent that day playing God of War Ascension. It's what she would have wanted, Matthew.
So yes, Cocoon, not quite the one dog. So Matthew, shall we take a quick break and come back with some list of questions?
Okay I'm just quite tired of my observations are coming through very garbled today, so.
Oh, I thought my Assassin's Creed bit was very unfocused, so.
Oh, God, I don't have an answer to this first one, actually, do you?
Yeah. Yeah.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, we've been given plenty of listener questions. For reference to people who want to send in questions, by the way, you can join the Discord.
There's a link for that in the Twitter at twitter.com/backpagepod and also in the Blue Sky account. But there's also, you can also just email us questions at backpagegames.gmail.com. Also, if you add them at us on Twitter, I can add them to the sheets too.
So, just for also to let some listeners know, we have decided to skip some questions where we feel like we're getting a bit of repetition. Someone asked what your favorite sub-genre of Hitman level is. I think we covered that pretty well.
Someone asked us to come up with Hitman levels we play in real life. We literally did that whole bath thing where we did the fake bath level. So, I feel like we've just done a few of those things.
I wish you well, but.
We wish you well, but we won't be answering them this time. So, no offence, Dolg. Okay.
I've been playing Arcade Paradise and on it there's a Frogger clone. A challenge was to complete a level without moving left or right. This led me to realise that you could move left or right on Frogger.
Is there anything else you've missed in a game or have been blatantly playing wrongly and not realised? That's from RaphRasile. Matthew?
I never understood a CQC in Metal Gear Solid 3 until I watched a YouTube video about a year ago. There's just so many abilities that character has, I just didn't know existed. I literally didn't understand the guy I was playing as, all the different things he can do.
I'd basically just shoot people in the head with the Trank Darts and that's it. So it felt like the whole sales pitch of that game I'd ignored.
I might not know this either. So he can grab people, he can slit their throats and he can choke them out, and he can slam people to the ground as well. He grabs them.
And he can interrogate them.
Yeah, okay, I did know all of that. Okay, that's fine then.
Yeah, that's the thing. It is in there. It's all in the instruction manual.
But a lot of it is kind of, you grab them and then it's like the pressure that you exert on one button, which maybe I've got a heavy thumb, but if I grabbed you, you were getting knifed my man.
A heavy thumb. Yeah, well that's the other thing. I think that was partly related to the PS2's analog controls.
I think the analog buttons were maybe like, it could better detect how softly or firmly you were pressing the buttons. I think that might be right.
I just never really understood it. I knew it was there. I was just like, I don't know what that means.
The pacifist run of MGS3 was never going to happen. I'm afraid I don't have an answer to this one. I have chucked in a bonus question, Matthew, from Koig about Arcade Paradise, who did want to know from me, related to Arcade Paradise, what my favorite arcade games were in there.
I'll just quickly say I like Bomb Dudes, which is basically Bomberman. That's pretty good. Space Race Simulator, which is like a mix of Wipeout, F-Zero and Outrun, like a presentation very nice that one.
And Zombat 2, which is a twin stick shooter. Those are all pretty good. And then obviously like classic sort of like darts and pool and air hockey.
All of those worked pretty well, too. The rest, I don't know. There was an inconsistent bunch, but then it was like about 20 games inside one big game.
So didn't expect them all to be masterpieces. So yeah. Matthew, do you want to read this next one?
What game series do you think would make the best, worst, funniest musical?
Would any of them be good, is my question.
Like, no, my, my attempt to answering this was I really like the musicals. That was from Jamie, by the way. I really like the musicals of Stephen Sondheim, who wrote often about like quite introspective people in like relatively mundane situations, kind of weighing up their life choices.
You know, he isn't like Phantom of the Opera style spectacle. It's like a guy working out whether he should settle down, you know, with a partner or not. Kind of more like that, which was quite radical at the time to just write about, you know, quote unquote boring things.
So I wouldn't do anything like too bombastic with it. I don't think you could like make a Gears of War musical, for example, but I think that would be a disaster.
Gone Home Live!
Well, Gone Home is actually probably closer to something you could do as a musical, like in terms of it being a smaller character piece. I think you could make like a good Sundyne musical out of Thing Park or a similar management sim about like the push and pull of like what makes commercial sense and what's like creative and what's good for your like artistic soul. That feels like a very sort of Sundyne-y subject matter.
Right.
So that, or if you want to be more spectacular, we could do Jurassic World Evolution. That deals with similar problems, but with dinosaurs.
I'll pass that along to our executive team, Matthew. So yeah. Okay.
Yeah. So I was like, the sort of comedy answer I got to this is you get Lin-Manuel Miranda to do Assassin's Creed 3 the musical because it's sort of like a similar time period to Hamilton, so I can sort of envision that. I think one problem I have, and I don't know how other people feel about this, but I feel like the combination of The Simpsons Planet of the Apes musical and Streetcar Named Desire musical, South Park, like Trey Parker and Mastodon, I think they poisoned my brain against what a sincere musical should be a little bit.
So that's happened where I'm like, could you make that Planet of the Apes style musical about like metal, the entire Metal Gear saga, for example, and what I like an epic undertaking that would be. That would obviously be terrible. So yeah, I think Matthew's suggestions would be that like along the better side, but yeah.
Yeah, I mean, the problem with trying to make a Sunday musical out of anything is that Sunday is like a truly singular talent and is dead now, sadly. So it would like never happen.
Well, I think I can use Chat GPT to get the same effect, Matthew, pretty sure it would do the same thing.
So maybe in Jurassic World evolution style, we could clone him from some DNA, get a new Sunday and make him write endless musicals for us.
And on that dark note, I suppose we'd be wanting to...
We got a Sunday out of his amber. Just a full grown man sitting at a piano in amber.
That's much more twisted than I could ever have expected. I think I feel the same way about it that I do about, you know, movies that are made out of video games, really. In some ways, video games are just meant to say video games, you know, it's kind of what they're for.
So I don't think that even the best stories in games I want to see in other media. It doesn't mean I don't think those stories are comparably good to other media necessarily. I think a lot of them, you know, a lot of the writing, sure, is absolutely comparable.
But I don't know. I feel like I'd feel the same way about musicals that I do about The Last of Us TV show, which was a... I was completely non-plus by it, you know, so...
Although that, again, is another very contrarian back page take.
No, that's fine, that's fine. Or indeed, I felt similar about the Bowser Peach song that everyone seemed to like in the Mario movie. Very undercooked.
I refuse to watch that film under any circumstances. OK, next question, Matthew. I'll read this one out.
Hi, Samuel and Matthew. Which games do you think took the skeleton of the gameplay and assets of the original framework and built them to build a variation with a twist that is as effective or even more so? I've been playing a Hitman Freelancer mode recently and the rogue-like elements and collectible weapons make it feel quite different with its limitations compared to the campaign setting.
It's some little lead person. I've really got to fucking play Freelancer at some point. Have you given that a go yet, Matthew?
This is a huge blind spot for me and that's mad given what this podcast is about. It's been a year. It's been a year though.
It's hard.
It is. Yeah. It's like, it's probably not going to happen in 2023 if I'm being honest, but it's, I would like to...
What might I put you saying?
Maybe we can talk about it a little bit on the Hitman XL episode we do. I don't know. But yeah.
So I got a few answers to this. I think that like, Mirror's Edge is a game that comes alive when you play it in time trial mode. It just is, I think.
I think it just, you start to see the permutations and how you can like very quickly get across the map and what the difference of seconds will be. They're not all levels, but there are a few levels in that that I gladly replayed over and over again, trying to like optimize my score. Really enjoyed that.
I think it again just lets you highlight the mechanics and not think about the story. And yeah, just make you focus on the momentum side of things. Obviously, Resin Evil Mercenaries is an all-timer for this, particularly Resi 5 Mercenaries where it takes you to a bunch of those locations and turns them into excellent sort of like levels where you basically have to always be on the run, but you don't have many places to run to.
That's what I really like about Resi 5 maps. Exactly. I love a good skirmish in RTS.
I like the scenario editor in Age of Empires 2, for example, like that's, again, you are just using the same bones that the designers have, but you can build like ridiculous scenarios. We have like 10 William Wallace's fighting 10 Joan of Arc's. That's like, that's king shit right there.
Like I love that. So those come to mind, Matthew. What about you?
Yeah, I had mercenaries as well. I was thinking of Assassin's Creed's multiplayer, taking its assassination and like social stealth and turning that into a game of identifying your targets, but against a human opponent as opposed to AI. That was super exciting.
Always a shame that they abandoned that. Another Hitman one. I really like the Hitman Sniper Assassin levels.
Like how much they feel like a Hitman level, but all from long range. The idea of like manipulating people's fates, but with like a bullet from afar rather than up close and personal. I always thought that was very neat.
Yeah, those were those were the biggest for me. But you're right about like score attack modes. I mean, it's not quite this, but like some of the Bayonetta challenge rooms make you kind of connect with bits of that combat system that you wouldn't normally in your own fighting style where it's like juggle all these enemy, you know, make sure no enemy touches the ground ever or whatever.
And you suddenly have to just sort of like learn a whole other part of what this game's about. That's always cool.
Yeah, I suppose as well, like you could say that along the same lines like Devil May Cry's Bloody Palace mode does this to.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
You are, you know, you exit the framework of the main game and it's all about your raw understanding of the mechanics. I mean, it's, you know, the same applies, I guess, to like horde modes and the likes of Halo ODST, which had an all-timer horde mode firefight and then obviously Gears. Yeah, a few examples there.
Probably some stuff we talked about before, but hopefully a couple of new ones too. Matthew, do you want to do the next one?
Hello gents. Honoring your request, could you come up with some video game cocktails? That's from Betamax Bandit.
I went to NQ64 in London with Jay Bayliss. By the way, when I told that story in the podcast, I asked him, was that an accurate telling of the story that day? He was like, it was 80% true and then it was 20% podcast entertainment factor layered on top of it was basically his response.
I think he was fair there. Basically, they had a lot of cocktails that were not particularly like in sort of like imaginative. There was one that was just called Kirby that had pink gin in it, for example.
So yeah, yeah, pretty weak.
Yeah.
So what about you, Matthew? You got got anything here?
I got loads.
Go on and then cook. Let him cook.
They're not all good. I got a hit Manhattan.
That's good. I like that.
Mahitoad.
A Long Island iced tea virus. Moscow Mule, but Mule is the acronym Mule from that Atari 8-bit game. In honor of Donkey Kong Country's rolling move, I've got April spritz.
Oh, oh, that's great.
I've got a Mario Sunshine inspired drink called a Floody Mary.
Oh, very good. I had an April escape, by the way. That was one of the ones I came up with.
Yeah. Yeah. Go on.
Sorry. My favorite one. This is for Skyrim.
I took an arrow in the Martini. You can also do, I took an arrow in the Negroni.
Mortal Kombat drink, Shangri-La from Shang Tsung.
Nice.
I've got Soulcalibur drink, Voldo fashioned.
Right. Oh my God. You're killing it.
I've got one named after one of the weaker Hitman levels, Pina Colorado.
That was a bit of a stretch, but you know.
My last one, I'm not ending on a high here. Named after a terrible vehicle section in GoldenEye, Cosmopolitanque.
Yeah, I'm afraid I slightly misunderstood the assignment on this. Only a couple of my ones are puns. The rest were like, I actually did think about the ingredients for them.
Oh, please go ahead.
I mean, I just had one that was called T-Virus, but it had some of that toxic waste candy in it and then some rancid ingredients in it. The only other pun I came up with was a neon white Russian named after the end he came from last year. That and April Escape was the only two I came up with.
I can't compete with that, Matthew. You absolutely killed it there. Well done.
Well done. That was truly you earning the Patreon bucks there, so I respect it. Okay, next question.
Greeting Pods Podbods listening to the recent Resi 4 and Mikami episodes. For context here, this was a question from a while ago we didn't answer and we asked us to answer it again, so we're doing it here. Has reminded me how that game is one of the best examples of an almost university lauded title that I don't click with.
So many people, including many whose gaming opinions I respect, rank it as one of the all-time greats and yet it doesn't do it for me. Whatever that game is putting out, I'm just not receiving. I wonder if the pair of you have any good examples of games which are held up there as all-timers but that you just don't get on with and what the reasons for that deviation from the consensus might be.
Cheers and keep up the great podcast work. That's from Genual. I would think that many of these have probably become, have emerged over time, Matthew, with us doing this podcast now.
Games where we just don't get them, like Dark Souls, for example. But I guess I don't really question whether Dark Souls is good. I just know it's not for me.
But that kind of is what he's asking, right, because surely you've got to accept that Resi 4 is amazing even if you don't like it that much. There's a few games like that for me. Playing Valorant, for example, and I really love Valorant, but I respect it.
You know what I mean? Or, you know, actually a really good example of this, all MOBA games. Do not get those whatsoever.
Like literally that entire genre, I'm out on it. The time I've played with Dota were some of the least happy times I ever had on PC Gamer. They were terrible.
So that would be up there. But I don't know. There aren't like many.
I feel like our key techs have been established on this, but there aren't many games where you and I are just completely down on them. What do you think?
Yeah, I guess an obvious one for me, and it came up in the first episode, like Skyrim, Elder Scrolls more generally, but specifically Skyrim for, you know, I work with a lot of people who are obsessed with that game and I really see nothing in it. Like that's one I just don't get. I find it not at all immersive.
Very plasticky. I think it feels like a Disneyland animatronic version of a fantasy world. It just doesn't speak to me in any way, shape or form.
So that's that's probably like the major one where I have to just kind of grit my teeth and listen to people bollock on about that. Pokemon, you know, I don't like it because I'm a grown up and I find it quite childish in its like outlook and language and the dialogue, it's the dialogue in Pokemon, I just it awful. In terms of like, I don't know that this is considered an all timer, but a game that I know I deviate from a lot of people on, and certainly a lot of peers who I know this is an important game to them is Broken Sword.
Oh, OK, interesting.
I really don't like Broken Sword. It's everything I hate about point and click writing in that it's trying to do the kind of funny, you know, that sort of funny sort of point and click games are written by funny, smart people. But sometimes that veers into like slightly smug, slightly sneering.
I hate the guy in Broken Sword, never liked him as a character, I find him really off putting with his smug little observations about life and it's really grim. Some people might think I'm projecting on that because Charles Cecil famously walked out of that interview with me because he'd rather talk to IGN.
Oh, I don't remember that. I don't know if he talked about that on the podcast before.
Oh, I think I've talked that story.
Oh really? I don't remember that. I feel like I don't remember that one.
He stopped in with the answer and went, oh, this is someone from IGN and literally left the room to go and talk to them. He'd rather talk to them. Yeah, those are probably the biggies for me.
Yeah, I've got a few more actually, like thinking about it. So the Sims don't get that really. Like I just don't think the outcomes of that game are that exciting or what happens to your characters is that exciting.
Like I do like this. Plenty of sim games I like, like, um, sim, uh, sort of city skylines and stuff like that. I'm big into those kind of games, but for some reason, I just don't think there's anything that exciting about the Sims and the way it does things.
I feel like there's just something a little bit missing from it for me.
Just got the idea of a man speaking in that baby sort of sim language and you just sort of grimacing at your PC as it tickles me.
Well, I just maybe just had a bad sort of encounter with it, but I just remember playing at Cousins House in the first one in the early noughties and just being completely like non plus by it. Like this is the game that people lost their minds over. You build a house and then I mean, the most interesting thing you can do is drown them or electrocute them.
That's it. Like it's I don't know. It's not like I kind of want these games to be more emotional depictions of people.
Like I want someone to be like you can't go out for two years because it's a pandemic and then I want them to like their mental health to decline and their and their relationships to decline and their children to go like completely mad. And I want that level of simulation. But the games aren't about the psychology.
They're about selling you more furniture. Honestly, like maybe when the there's a kind of like a version of this type of game coming from Paradox that sounds like it might be a little bit more freeform, like moddable. I can't remember what it's called.
Like this world is yours or something like that. It's called.
It's still a lot of acts about like decorating a house, though, right?
Yeah, exactly. But that seems to be more the fantasy they're selling, whereas I want to know what happens to people and what I can do with the people and their dreams to come true, their dreams to not come true. Like I just that is surely the more interesting angle of what that kind of game can offer.
Then I've got they've do like they've added a fucking pumpkin spice latte to it now or like a new bookshelf. You know what I mean? Like it's that.
So I'm only interested in The Sims if they add the option to turn a coffee table on its side, line it with pillows and stick your head in it to be a podcast. It doesn't reflect my house. Where are all the magic books?
Well, that's the thing is I just I think that's because also like when I think about my relationship with Animal Crossing, a game I do like, it's because I like the interactions between you and the other animals, the psychological warfare you can unleash by hitting them with bug nets and like the the strange passive aggressive like letters you'll get from them and stuff like that. So that that sort of thing is interesting, but no games ever really simulated that in any meaningful way. But that is surely what what surely more people would find that interesting than I can build a house.
I guess not. I guess like literally the sales of The Sims proves that's not true. But to me, to me, that would make it interesting.
And it's not as it stands, you know, it doesn't do it for me, though, when I was working on RPS with Ash Laguri, they did a lot of Sims coverage and we did like Sims streams together and seeing the kind of like how it tapped into their creativity was super interesting. I kind of understood it a little bit more after that. So maybe that's what you that's what you need to do is to spend 10 hours of something really into it, building a special house for you and then you'll love it.
Yeah, I like I can I can not generalize, but I feel like I'm outside the target audience of The Sims a little bit. And that's and that's fine. Not all games are meant to be for you.
But I suppose I've just pitched my dream version of The Sims and it's about just your characters losing their minds or, you know, having their dreams fulfilled or wiped away. Another one I played this year and then I felt I fell out hard with and that I actually didn't I don't know if I mentioned the podcast before, but I could not get on with Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis. It was just too old, too old to enjoy.
Interesting.
Yeah. Yeah. So like I respected the indie of it.
I could see why it would be very exciting to you as a player back in the 90s when, you know, like, just hearing like quite a good Harrison Ford sound alike and, you know, just being a framework for new Indiana Jones adventures. I could see all that. But yeah, didn't quite gel with that one.
That's you wishing me well.
Yeah, I wish you well, Matthew. So do you want to read the next question, Matthew?
You are in court for your willful, cruel and unusual punishments. Ironically, dished out on your own Games Court podcasts. Which video game character is your lawyer?
Who are you most scared to see as a prosecutor? That's from Welsh boy Mick.
Yeah, funny, actually, Matthew. I was listening to that film podcast we like and they basically came up with their version of Games Court in real time and they're going to be like Directors Court for like directors who have made like good films and bad films to see if they hold up.
Sounds like someone's listened to Games Court. Maybe they're listening to us. Maybe it's gone full circle.
That hasn't happened.
No, it hasn't. But when I heard it, I was like, oh, no, they're going to do this and it's the one thing we was original to us is no longer.
I think we've established court as our thing.
Yeah, I think so. I very much think so. So scared to see as a prosecutor, I think Revolver Ocelot would be quite scary.
I feel like he would also dish out the punishment. He would just like riddle you with six bullets and then spin his little guns around. That would be tough.
Video game character is my lawyer, I found this a little bit harder, but I think I just put like Thane from Mass Effect 2 up there. He's a very reasonable character, he's very likable. Thane or Garrus, one of those two would be fine.
Matthew, what about you?
Like on my side, like arguing my corner, I probably want someone quite scary. I was thinking like, maybe because I've been playing Miles Wallace and I've got Spider-Man on the brain, but like Kingpin from Spider-Man, I could see him being like intimidating in the courtroom and also knowing kind of like legal workarounds. Like he could probably put pressure on the judge somehow to kind of get me out of it.
So Kingpin from Marvel's Spider-Man.
Well yeah, because in the comics he and Daredevil square off a lot in the courtroom, so that makes complete sense, you know.
That makes perfect sense. In terms of a prosecutor, I'd be more worried about like less than being scary, but more than being someone very sympathetic who everyone likes. So like, I don't know, like a Nintendo dog?
Maybe. Something where people are like, I know what people are like, because a lot of this is like if you can win public opinion on Twitter, and maybe I'm basing this on the children I follow on Twitter, but I know there's a lot of like, oh, lovely dogs or whatever.
A baby Labrador has sent Matthew to the slammer basically.
Because no one wants to see a baby Labrador lose.
No but then like...
Guess who didn't prep an answer to this question?
And so we move on to the next question instead. What was your most disappointing Metal Gear boss out of the whole series and how would you improve it? That's from Daryl.
I think like probably B-Man and MGS3 is maybe among the worst ones. I think you have to throw in some of the high concept ones though like I actually think that maybe one of the worst ones is that last MGS4 fight. Like the Spectacle is amazing fighting Ocelot on top of that.
On top of whatever that big boat thing is. But it's a right pain in the arse, like it's melee combat only and it's not necessarily up to the task. So yeah, that's, I don't know, I don't know how I'd improve it as such.
But then you've also got like the Fortune boss fight in MGS2 which isn't really up to much. I think like the way I'd improve that one is if there is some like work around where you can defeat her. Like I always thought the thing with Fortune because she got like this little device that means bullets like just go around her so they can't hit her.
Surely if you just punch her in the face that will work fine. You know what I mean? Like it's, you know, if you can, you must be able to grab her.
There can't be some field of gravity that stops you from just like, I don't know, poking her with a stick or something. There must be something to do that. So if you could, if there was like an outcome where you could defeat Fortune just by like avoiding her big electric bolt shots.
And poking her with a stick. You're like, oh man, I wish we picked up that stick from the beginning of the rig that we didn't think was going to be important.
Yeah. I don't, I don't know if any of the MGS4 like Beauty and the Beast fights are up to much either. They're a little bit hard work.
They're like, they're all sort of like slightly worse versions of other MGS bosses. So yeah, those, but they all look kind of amazing. So there's big mech ladies.
So yeah. Matthew, what about you?
Yeah, I'd agree with a lot of that. I think Vamps a bit of a bust in Metal Gear Solid 2.
Oh yeah. That's probably fair. He's just swimmers around and he's throwing grenades into the water.
I don't think there is a gimmick to it really. It's just a fight against a guy running, given that he's like a guy who can't die, you think there'd be some like creativity, like the number of times you fought him or something like that. Like, you know, it's the Castle classic.
He should be a Mr. X style, unkillable boss who's just constantly on your on your tail.
Well, that's kind of it. That's the thing with MGS4 is you need to inject him with that thing in order for the him to actually be able to be defeated. So yeah, I do agree.
He kind of just swims around in the water and then you throw grenades into the water.
It doesn't sell you unlike this boss's gimmick is he's literally undefeatable. And I don't think they ever really find an interesting answer to that.
No, no. So yeah, I think that's those some good examples there, Matthew. As for how you'd improve Bee Man, it'd be quite funny if you did like you could just chuck some insect repellent at him and all the bees went away and then you just punch him in the face and he goes down.
But that'd be quite good if you just really undermined the premise of him by being like, I killed all your bees. You have no bees left.
You get the Queen Bee and then you become in charge of the bees.
Oh my god, that's quite a good idea. Yeah, you somehow take his ability.
Then you have the bee attacks. Yeah, you're like, not the bees. And you're like fucking throwing bees at him.
Fuck yeah, you watch him get killed by his own creatures. That would be quite a nice ironic sad MGS3 death. So yeah, okay, good.
All right then, next one Matthew.
Question from Matthew primarily, because I know Samuel's been giving this a wide berth. With the Discord's Tears of the Kingdom chat finally wound down, what are some of the best Tears of the Kingdom takes you've seen from other people and what are some of the worst? They needn't be from this Discord, though I'd be lying if I wasn't interested in learning which takes pushed you away from that thread.
That's my baladeer.
I've never been in that thread Matthew, I've just avoided it.
I think I explained my Discord weariness earlier in an earlier episode which was more the thing that gets me is the kind of granular beat by beat assessment of a video game because this is not how it's designed to be consumed so just offering an opinion on an individual mechanic as if it has something to say about the whole I find that you know I love a through line you know me you know I love a narrative I love a take I love a big take I don't want to hear like I didn't like this one NPC and you're like all right well there's fucking 500 NPCs so who cares you know like I'm just that that that just doesn't interest me sorry to discord and there was a lot of that in there um I not in a not in a mean or shade casting way I don't know if I've read much amazing stuff about tears of the kingdom um I feel like there are lots of reviews when people were wrestling with it and just trying to get down their thoughts on this quite big unwieldy thing and I feel like there hasn't been loads of follow-up writing or I've certainly not seen loads of follow-up writing I like I'm still mulling it over like I've still haven't fucking I can finish the thing, I'm still playing it, it's still chipping away at it. I thought there was an observation out there about, I thought Simon Parkin in his New Yorker piece had written about the kind of evolution of technology in this game, about how the power curve takes you from quite crude vehicles to basically modern day military vehicles.
Yeah, I'm gonna be saying that on this podcast.
Yeah, it isn't, I imagine that take.
Is that your take, Matthew?
I don't think there's a line in Edwin's Tis of the Kingdom review about how you start off with just a paper glider bird and build it up into a fighter jet. But I hadn't read that review when we did that podcast. So I don't want to say the only good take is my take that I came up with.
But that's the take that sticks with me. Whoever said it, whoever put it in my head, I like the idea that, I like the observation that the power curve in this game is increasing technology and efficiencies and that you are working towards almost like automation, you know, it's the industrial revolution in fast forward. I think that's quite a fun angle on Tears of the Kingdoms machinery anyway.
But I need to go digging for like takes that I really love. Just no take particularly lines up with how I feel about it, I think is the problem. But I just want to say that the other takes are bad, or that the Discord takes are bad.
I wasn't really reading it that thoroughly, but I did, to be honest. I was just doing a bit on an episode.
Yeah, I've not been in there. I agree with you about the full up writing thing, and I think that's because the divide on this game really is between did you want more of the same with some new ideas chucked in, or were you looking for something else from Tears of the Kingdom that it didn't give you? And I honestly think that is the divide that's kind of hit people here a little bit, you know?
Some people really did just want more of Tears of the Kingdom, more of the same beautifully designed little kind of like puzzle dungeons to figure out the shrines, and also some new mechanics layered on top, and different parts added to the world without the world itself necessarily being brand new. And I think that ticked the box for some people, and then other people wanted that blow your mind first time you've ever encountered something like this, feeling that Breath of the Wild gave them. And I think that where you fall on that scale is how you feel about this game, basically.
So yeah, that's been the divide there, Matthew. But I'm sure...
Well, I'm looking forward to relitigating this game of the year.
It is the most controversial.
You are going to turn me full fucking Joker with the wrong take, I can tell you. I can see it coming from miles away.
Yeah, I think that's going to happen. That will set the tone for 2024, the dark year of The Back Page podcast. Okay, now, so we've got time for this week, Matthew.
