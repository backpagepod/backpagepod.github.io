Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, in the words of Rob Thomas, man, it's a hot one. It's a fucking hot day outside. Do you get that pop culture reference?
I can never tell.
I don't. I was thinking, is Rob Thomas someone I'm meant to know?
Well, I thought you might have gotten confused with the creator of Veronica Mars, who is also called Rob Thomas, but no, is that Santana song, Smooth, you know that song?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, sure. I didn't get the immediate twig of recognition, but I'm prepared to believe that you understand what I'm talking about.
Well, sometimes lyrics are quite hard to hear when you say them in such a different way.
It's true, yeah, as well. Also, my parents, they would always, whenever I tried to sing them a song to sort of recount what the song was, they would always go, oh, if it sounds anything like that, it's rubbish. And they basically said that to me, my entire childhood, just to dissuade me from ever singing.
And so now-
A classic parent bit.
Well, that's it. So now I will never even try and sing because they just completely spooked me out of it.
They could have robbed the world of a real talent.
No, they didn't, they didn't. I remember I had an ex-girlfriend who once told me that she liked my singing. I thought, it's just like, you're too smitten because that's not an objective opinion because everyone else has ever heard me sing.
It's a bit like, you know when Homer Simpson's voice breaks when he's in that choir in early Simpsons, very much that vibe really. Just sort of gargles and fake noises.
You're too smitten. What a problem to have.
Yeah, I think so, that's when you know that someone's lost all that objectivity when you're braising my singing.
And that's just not very attractive quality in a person.
No, not really, no. So, not sure how we got here. Oh yeah, I do because it's fucking 30 degrees outside or whatever and I'm baking a life here in my underpants recording this podcast.
So, how you doing man? How's your not E3 week been?
I've got a lot of work on in my day job, in my side hustle. I don't know what's better. Is that the side hustle to this?
This is the side hustle.
But I don't know if the listeners want to believe that they're getting like 100% of my sort of attention.
Oh, I think they all know that they're getting at most 70%. Same for me, you know.
But yeah, work is busy. There's some big games to be played for review. So, I will leave it at that.
Yeah, who knows what you could be talking about there. A game that comes out in the next few weeks, that is huge and may or may not be associated with PlayStation. No idea, no idea.
It's frankly confusing. So, yes, okay, cool. So, yeah, it's been an interesting week, I guess.
It's been the same thing that we've had throughout the pandemic, a bunch of live streams in a row. That has not changed. There is an informal, well, that's not true.
It's a formal in-person element that Geoff Keighley organizes that has happened last year and this year it seems to happen in a more elaborate form. E3 itself, of course, did not come back. There was an attempt to do that that did not pan out, which is a shame.
I would like to have seen what the new E3 would look like, but yeah, Matthew.
I obviously didn't go to Geoff Keighley's thing, but I worked with some people who did and I looked it up on Google Maps and it is so far from, not distance wise, but sort of what you're expecting and where it is. It's so not the convention center. Honestly, I looked it up on Google Maps.
I typed in the exact address and it took me to quite a scary looking alley on Street View. And I was like, well, I'm not showing this to the person, people who are going out because they'll freak. I think I'm sending them somewhere dangerous.
Well, I've definitely been to, I remember I went to a Ubisoft event once in the old E3 times, because they used to do these pre-E3 events and you got to play all their games before the actual show floor opened up. And it was like, it was in a quite a nice venue, but in what I would describe as quite a shooty neighborhood in like vibe, do you know what I mean? I'm not sure that's an appropriate term to use, but if I had to stay in a neighborhood where I could hear gunshots, I get to call it shooty, god damn it.
You know what I mean? So yeah, that was my take.
It feels a lot like the, whatever was the press day that used to happen before E3.
Right.
You know, there's that secret thing that the American press would sometimes go to, which meant they all had their previews when E3 opened.
Oh yeah, Judges Week.
Yeah, Judges Week. It feels like someone's just taken Judges Week and turned that into Summer Games Fest behind closed door, they call it Play Days.
Right, right.
Cause yeah, like the lack of, yeah, like public framing and, you know, I've seen pictures from inside the venue and it's, you know, it's smart enough, but it's not like, it's not even pretending to be, you know, any three replacement.
The good thing is though, that like, unlike Judges Week, people from all around the world do actually get to go and see the games. So, Judges Week, the very strange thing about it, we might've talked about this before on the three episode we did on Patreon, was that it gave US journos the chance to see everything before the other world's journos. And it was so obviously a bit of like, a bit of superiority going on.
It was kind of like treating like a meritocracy even though it wasn't, you know what I mean? There was a little bit of that to it.
Well, it's just the annoying thing of like, I really hate it when journos have seen stuff and then they sit on it and then they still do like the, oh, rumor is this game's gonna be there. And it's like, you fucking played it at Judges Week, you big weirdos, what a weird stance to take. I hate that bullshit.
And there was so much of that. Going to the conference, knowing you've got in your back pocket, you not only know what's gonna be there, you fucking played them. It's just, it is unfair.
And that isn't me going, I'm jealous. From a perspective of like, everyone turns up, and wants a fair shot at covering these things. But lo and behold, nothing would puncture my excitement than sitting down and have someone say to me like, oh yeah, I already played this.
You know, it happened in the Nintendo one. People were like, oh yeah, I've already played the Wii U before they even announced it. I was like, oh great, well, good for you, I guess.
Here I am, old muggins from a fucking official Nintendo magazine.
Yeah, yeah, it's, there was also weird stuff like the, there was one game they didn't do, I won't say what the game was, just in case there's any kind of like old legal gubbins that was not playable for a long time after a very splashy debut. Like they waited months to let people play it. But I know for a fact that Journos played it before that E3 had even happened.
So it could be eligible for awards at E3, because that was the whole thing with Judges Week, is they give out the awards, which are then like considered quite important as sort of marketing materials to go into it. And like, I'm glad it's gone because it should be a level playing field, it just should be. And it was never really fair, and it never really made sense.
And when UK Journos got to go, I think they did feel a bit sort of smug about it because someone from the US couldn't go or whatever. But now it's gone away. That's a part of E3 I don't miss, to be honest.
That was, yeah, but hey-ho. So yeah, quite a lot of long ramble there, Matthew. But-
That's a nice little burst of bitness to stop the cast.
No, no, it was a thing. Like, there was always a sense of like, do journals from this country think that they're better than me because of X, Y and Z? And when you heard about Judges Week, it was like, well, I guess that someone does.
You know what I mean? Because, yeah. I don't believe I'm holding it.
When I was editing Official Xbox Magazine, which suddenly Judges Week meant a bit more. Because when you're on a Nintendo Mags, you're like, Nintendo aren't going to Judges Week. They have nothing to do with that.
Nintendo understand how E3 is meant to work. Having a, like, this, does some American freelancer reach out going like, well, I'm going to see this, this, this at Judges Week. And I was like, oh, no.
So I got in contact with all those people going, hey, it'd be good if we could come to this because it's a bit weird that we'd have to like, buy all of this stuff off this very expensive freelancer. And they were having none of it. It was just like, no, you know, it's like the same 20 people we invite every year.
And like, you either manage to kind of get access to one of them or forget it. Very odd. But it's dead now.
So I don't know why I'm complaining.
Well, I know it's good to hold a grudge against the people who wronged you in case you could ever take it out on them. That's like what grudges are for.
I never will be able to. This is the best I'm going to do is just moaning about them on this podcast and making for a stodgy intro.
Hey, well, you know, an audience of 6,000 will very much enjoy.
That's what they say about revenge, isn't it? You got to dig two graves. One for the person you're after and one for the podcast that you're going to spoil by talking about it too much.
Yeah, very profound. Yeah, I think that sums up the overheated vibe that's going on.
I'm sweating so bad and I ate a really grungy burger during the, well, not grungy, just grungy.
It makes me think of like Nirvana, do you know what I mean?
It made me feel all kind of like sort of greasy. I ate one during the Ubisoft thing because me and Catherine don't have time to eat.
Yeah, you squashed into your little pod as well to record this one.
Yeah, so I'm really sweating away.
Oh, fuck, we've got to get you a sound studio at some point, man. That's like gotta be a stretch goal is get Matthew out of this pod.
Maybe I'll use the Patreon money to buy a shed out back.
Well, you're kind of like, we're both nearing that age, aren't we? A shed age, really, where it's like, there's got to be a room to conceal your hobbies because they're too shameful to be in a house. Do you know what I mean?
There's a bit of that that goes on when you reach middle age. Not that we're middle age. We're definitely not middle age, Matthew.
Okay, right then, this podcast. So our 10 most anticipated games. Very straightforward.
We watched a bunch of trailers. We franked the ones we liked. That's it.
That's all the podcast is basically. But we need a bit of lightness. You know, we just talked about Edge 10s with Christian.
A very well received episode, Matthew, which I was very proud of the outcome for that one. Sometimes I think that my free willing interview style comes across as informal and fun. And I really, I'm just a Wall-E who doesn't know what he's doing, but I feel like he's not aware of that one.
That was good. So how are you feeling after the horde mode of live streams this week, Matthew? You excited about the future of games?
Not excited or somewhere in the middle?
Somewhere in the middle. I saw a couple of good things in most of the streams. But yeah, I just didn't feel like there was any curation.
So I just feel a bit overwhelmed. I just feel like I was shown 500 things in the course of four days, which I basically was. And then you're expected to kind of make some sort of sense of that.
And also they're like trailers and some people are very good at trailers. Some people are bad at trailers. Some people show you what the game is.
Some people try and sort of capture a sort of vibe. So actually kind of working out like what's going to be good and what's there. I think most of the stuff I actually reacted positively to was just stuff that kind of fattened out the details on things I was already looking forward to.
Yeah, I think that's fair enough. There was, you know, actually, I think my favourite live stream except the most obvious one was the Day of the Devs one, which I actually had never sat and watched that. I just, but this year I thought I would because someone mentioned there were a couple of cool games that were there and I did watch it and I didn't realise how curated that was.
It's basically about 10 games, isn't it? And they just pick things. They're super selective about what they pick.
A couple did seem to be from the same publisher, which made me think, okay, maybe they've got some ties there. But it was, I was quite impressed by it. It was, you know.
Day of the Bones more like.
That's the sequel to the Double Fine documentary. Yeah, so it was really nice to, you know, to just see these, these devs get passionate about the things they're introducing. There were like at least two or three games there I thought looked cool.
One of which has made my list, one of which has made my honorable mentions, because it was too shameful to put in the list, we'll talk about that. So yeah, but I don't even mean like there's a lot that happens there. Some of them I just got summaries for this year.
It's funny because I consider myself obviously very engaged in where modern games are at, but even I just couldn't quite make time for all the live streams this week and end up reading some summaries of them. Like I didn't watch Wholesome Direct this year. I read a summary of it, for example, even though I do, I do value the work, the work that they do on that stream, but it was just like, oh, yeah, it's a little nice model train game and a few games to have frogs in them and that's fine.
That's good. And everyone had a good time. So that's good.
So yeah, I'm in the middle. I'm in the middle like you, I think I actually I'm slightly more optimistic than I thought I would be coming out of it though, because I am I am just like, I've got this thing where anything that reminds me of the pandemic, I just can't really do any more. I can't engage with and I can't enjoy this.
It's like a whole thing. I went to the pub with two sets of people this past week and I asked them, what did you do during the pandemic both times, because I think that's just like something I'm fascinated by is what were your hobbies, and etc. What was your living like?
And it was, yeah, I don't know, that kind of interests me a little bit, I suppose. But it just means that when I'm doing things that feel like I'm still in the pandemic, it just makes me feel like I'm still living it somehow. And you do get that when you're watching nine live streams in a row.
But that said, you know, I do appreciate the hard work that went into all of them. And so a bunch of stuff are like, so I've got a good list here, Matthew. So I feel like we've covered the E3 thing.
We're both missing it a little bit, I guess, right? Like the sort of, I didn't like it when it became a sort of a show floor thing that the public could go to. But the proposed repop version was going to have a few days where the public couldn't go.
And then some days it would just be industry only and it would still have a show floor, which sounded like my sort of things. And now that we're here and it's not happened, I do miss the idea of it. Like it would be nice to know the convention center would be open.
COVID's not over, but let's face it. I mean, I don't know if you saw the crowd of that Ubisoft livestream, but they were sat so close together. We have like basically forgotten about social distancing.
So I feel like this was a year that a show floor actually could really have had a bit of an impact. So I'm sad it's not there. Is that how you feel about it as well, Matthew?
Yeah, that Ubisoft conference had like weird energy because they usually put on quite a big show, but it seemed to be sort of in a more private warehouse somewhere. Like the stage seemed a lot more kind of cobbled together. I didn't really get where they were doing it from.
Was it maybe they had a... Because I know that Ubisoft have had a capture event out in LA, sort of separate to Geoff Keighley's thing.
Right, right.
So I'm assuming they just doubled that space up.
Yeah, it seems so.
But it was just stuff like when a guy was talking, there was a demo playing behind him and like the colours were all a bit saturated because they were just filming off a TV screen. It just looked a bit wrong compared to the production values of like when they they usually take over at theatre and it's, you know, it's a proper like stage managed extravaganza. This definitely felt like a sort of smaller version, a lot more kind of intimate, which makes kind of Yves Gilmore being right there in the front row.
Like, I don't know, probably a bit intense for the presenters. Like you're in this quite small room with like your mega boss in front of you. I wouldn't like it.
Yeah, I was trying to work out how all the people were. I was like, are they employees? Is there any journalists there?
Is Phil Spencer there? I just couldn't, I couldn't quite.
I felt, it felt like a private Ubisoft thing.
Yeah, absolutely. And that probably makes sense for the sort of response that they got. You know when people at journo sat there like sort of shrugging at another game in the crew franchise.
When everyone you can see in the audience is wearing a dark suit, it just looks really funereal and you just can't get around that. It's like, who died?
Yeah, not Skull and Bones Matthew, which refuses to die. That's always coming back. I actually did watch that bit because I went out for a bucket of Kokoro rice and chicken Matthew and by the time we got back it had already started.
So I zipped past the Skull and Bones bit. How was that looking?
I may have turned my head from my screen for a bit.
Not your favorite genre.
The second they got a band out to sing like a shanty and one of them had like an incredibly deep voice. Everything about it was just a bit off for me. And then it was like, oh yeah, the naval combat from Assassin's Creed Black Flag 20 billion years ago.
Yeah, a 10 year old game.
Oh, it's so cursed. I know I've said it before, but I will always think back to having dinner with lunch with Rare when I was on Xbox One and we had a bit of behind the scenes access and Ubisoft had just announced Skull and Bones and Rare were like, oh no, are we going to get like totally gazumped on Sea of Thieves by this huge Ubisoft machine? And it's just so funny how like, it's not that it just didn't happen, it just didn't happen in the most extraordinary way.
Yeah, we are like getting to the point where Sea of Thieves is going to have launched its Monkey Island expansion while Skull and Bones still isn't out.
It's like, Skull and Bones is taking so long to come out. Before it comes out, I think Sea of Thieves will have a Skull and Bones DLC.
Yeah, it's a weird one because again, I did mention I played it at a previous E3. I don't remember which one, 17 or 18. Sam White was there, he listened to the podcast.
And that's how long ago it was, and it seemed fine. It was like, it was what they were selling it as. It was multiplayer boat combat, and it was fine.
I thought that's all it was going to be, and somehow, yeah, we're still not there. But hey-ho, games take a long time to make, etc. these days, who knows.
So Matthew, I think to get to the big thing here, we both basically agree the Xbox conference was the best, the highlight of the show, and the best of these kinds of showcases for quite a while. First of all, do you agree with that assessment?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, good. So what did that have that recent shows have maybe lacked?
Surprises? It's weird, because fundamentally, it was just a load of game trailers, like all the other things, but there was just some, I don't know, there was something like particularly magic in the kind of order that they showed things, or how they grouped things, like it, you know, other shows had a habit of putting things that are like a little too similar next to each other, and then a little bit of fatigue came in, I mean, on a personal level, the fact that it didn't have any, like, obvious big games of service pitches, which is kind of what sunk the Sony one for me, like it felt like, you know, here's five life-consuming things coming your way, and I was like, uh-oh, I've only got one life, you know, I can't really give it to five different things, so I was already feeling stressed about that. Um, yeah, like, and I think just relief that all those studios they bought are, like, making stuff which looks pretty cool, and that they've got ambitions beyond those studios, and they're working with interesting people, and maybe that's just pumping money into a bit of a marketing exclusive, but, um, you know, whatever the nature of those relationships are, they've surrounded themselves with some cool people, and it feels like, maybe it was, like, a load of people who we haven't heard from from a while, who made good stuff in the last generation, and you're just like, oh, those people are still back, you know, Stoica still were around, and this is what they've been up to, and that's nice, you know, you almost needed to give people four or five years to kind of get their houses in order for this generation, so it feels like that was maybe finally kicking into gear.
Yeah, absolutely. I think that the thing you just had to do was meet it halfway on most of those games being next year. But the thing you can fairly say is that a year that's got Starfield, Forza, Hi-Fi Rush is already out.
That's pretty much what a platform holder exclusive line up is meant to look like for a year, right? It's meant to be at least three games where you're like, yep, this is cool, this makes me excited about what I'm playing here. And, you know, that I think that between them, Starfield is, you know, undoubtedly going to be the biggest game of the year.
It's and it was a very comprehensive showing that, yeah, I agree. It's sort of like it had there was a vision of the future there as well as a vision of what you'll be playing in six months. So I think that combination was why it succeeded for sure.
So it's funny because I was at first when it started with Fable and the Compulsion Games game, which have not written down something, something south, something like that that those I was a bit like, okay, it feels like these games don't quite exist yet to me or like they asked maybe too early on. I thought these feel like because I don't I mean Fable didn't have a release date. Yeah, right.
Everything that had like this coming 2024, they said it was. So it's definitely a 2025 or later game.
So Fable had like they showed a set piece in it.
I get the logic of saying, oh, Fable still exists. We know we told you about it three years ago, but it's still happening. It's still from the same studio.
And, you know, obviously being made in the UK, I hope it hope it goes great. Love Fable is a series, but I guess I thought at first, oh, is this stuff a little bit too far out? Is it going to be a whole conference of this?
But it wasn't. And it was, yeah, it was it was very curated. It was very exciting.
There were loads of stuff in there I wanted to play. I thought it was really, really good.
It could live up to the single player stuff.
Yeah, exactly. It felt like they were appealing to the core, quote unquote. I mean, obviously none of it could live up to the Doordash ad and the Silver Games Fest livestream.
Matthew, was there anything at these shows you were particularly swished off by? Anything where maybe people get hyped by it and you weren't that into it or anything like that?
More broadly, I was going to say bad banter at these things. Very, very hard to judge, but there were some shows where I was like, yikes. I've written one of these showcase type things before and it's a tough gig, but I don't think anyone's quite cracked the form.
I think you just need to get in and get the fuck out of the way of the games, basically. In terms of actual game trends, I mean, really just that kind of games of service thing that I mentioned that there seemed to be a lot of that in the Sony showcase slightly before Summer Games Fest. A lot of the things that were coming were online shooters with lots of characterful avatars, which just isn't really where I'm at.
I'm sure a lot of people love that stuff and they definitely do. Everyone trying to have a slice of the Fortnite pie. That's just not for me.
Other stuff? I don't know. Is there any trends or individual things that leapt out for you?
I would say that it was quite a weirdly big show for strategy games, actually. There's quite a lot of that kind of stuff, whether it was turn-based games or real-time strategy games. Sort of like Disclosure, I'm working on one as well, so I kind of noticed it.
But there's a lot of RTS games and then prominence of more turn-based kind of things and stuff that's sort of somewhere in the middle. So there's a little bit of that going on. I was sort of like...
Obviously, you get the usual spate of Souls-like kind of games. Those sort of go on. Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know if there's anything I was switched off by, but I think it was like you, where I just needed maybe slightly more curation than just sitting and watching nine hours of livestreams. That was maybe just a little bit too dense with reveals.
I will say, not to get ahead of something that I imagine we'll probably talk about in the top tens, I will say it's not in mine. I didn't quite feel the overwhelming kind of like, oh my god, I've never seen anything like it that some people seem to have towards Starfield.
Yeah, I would agree with that.
Like, you know, I don't know. Is it in your top ten?
No, it's not.
Oh, it's not in my top ten either. I didn't really know where you landed on it. I just, I thought it was a great demo, and I think Bethesda are really, really good at doing these demos.
Like, they've done them before, like the famous ones for like Fallout 4, where they just, they know to sort of jump around the world and show you like the very best cuts of it. I just thought this one, for all the talk of like, it's got the same Bethesda handcrafted feel and the kind of great writing and quests that you love. I thought so much of its big ideas were like these big sort of shapeless systemic ideas that I would associate more with like No Man's Sky.
I just couldn't get over that. I couldn't shake that. It just felt like a really expensive, very shiny version of No Man's Sky.
And it was just in the first minute, they shot a laser at a rock and some minerals came out of it. And I thought, I just do not want to do that in a game. I have no interest in doing that.
And you can build any kind of ship and you're like, I just don't give a fuck about that. Whenever I can build a space base, or I have to build a space base in a game, there'll be a tutorial mission where you plant down one module to prove that you understand the concept of building a space base. And when I play Starfield, I will put down that one module as part of that tutorial mission.
I will never touch it again. Every time I come back to that one room that I have a crate that I put equipment in and maybe a save station or something. And I know that like 20 content creators on YouTube will build absurdly amazing things using it, but I was just ticking off things that I'm not going to engage with in that game.
And at the end of it, I was like, I just don't think there's much for me here.
I will not engage with this crafting system, says man who just engaged with crafting system for first time in his life.
Well, yeah, I mean, if it was playful, like it just seems dry as shit. I don't know, like they built a big Transformers looking thing. I was like, well, it's not for me, you know.
If it was stick a fan on the back of a fucking bird glider and just fly around a lovely mountain, then sure.
Fly around a lovely mountain. Yeah, I got to say, I think that there was nothing wrong with the showcase. I would say I'm not like, I'm neither down on it nor am I like raring to go.
I think that what was really interesting about it is that as a presentation, it was like, it was presenting it as a known quantity in a lot of ways. It was saying, everything about that said to me, at its core, this is a Bethesda RPG and you know already if that's for you or not for you. And so that is useful to go into that game knowing that because I thought this was Fallout 4 when they're making a big deal about crafting and that.
Ultimately, all the additional stuff you can sort of leave to one side and then go do the main quest or the side quest or what have you. The thing I'm really curious about, and this is always a question with games that do this kind of like, you know, partly procedurally generated planet stuff, which I think is what they say they're doing. And then they kind of draw, they can draw from a bunch of hand crafted sort of like bits and pieces to build worlds is kind of the impression I got of how they're doing it.
Is that, you know, how good will that stuff be really? Because I remember there was a time where the radiant quest system in Skyrim seemed like the coolest thing ever. And then, you know, you do eventually, you get it and you're like, yeah, you can play this game forever, but it's not, you know, it's just like rinse and repeat experience and resources and stuff like that.
So the handcrafted content is actually what I'm in it for with Bethesda RPGs. I like doing the main quest. I like doing the character quest and stuff like that.
So those bits I'm the most excited about, but they were only really part of the focus of the demo. The demo is very holistically about these are all the things that are in this massive game we've built. And so I was very impressed by it.
I also respect it when they show a game in a way where they're like, this is what the game looks like. We're not hiding anything from you. This is it.
You're lucky at it. There are even times where the frame rate dropped because you can tell it's trying to simulate a lot this game. You can see it creep below 30 FPS to my eye.
It seemed like that when you're watching it. But that was very frank and open. It's not a CG teaser.
It's what the game is. And so I did think it was a good presentation. And yeah, it was really open.
And yeah, it was cool. But yeah, I didn't come out of it thinking. I guess it was designed to generate hype.
But it didn't generate hype in me. Just because it almost debunks hype by telling you what the game is in such detail. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, but then it obviously did for a lot of peers. You know, scrolling through Twitter, I saw people saying all kinds of like, you know, I've just had this religious experience and it's this. And, you know, even I don't know, maybe it rankled me a bit that Xbox were like, they themselves labeled it like one of the most important RPGs ever made.
And it's like, is it? But it says who? It says you?
Well, of course you're going to say that. Why aren't you saying about Fable? I'm much more interested in Fable.
So I don't know.
I'm definitely looking forward to playing it. It's going to be on Game Pass. You know, you can spend what is it, nine quid, and just play this game that is preposterously generous.
So, yeah, that's good. That's, yeah, wait and see on that one for me. In some ways as well, I did also turn bits of it off because I was like, I almost don't want to know too much about it.
Like, there's, you know, I want the element of surprise and what it's like to step out into a world and things like that. But, yeah, you know, when like the spaceship took off and there was spaceship combat and stuff, I was like, well, this is a ridiculously broad canvas they've built here. On that level alone, I feel like it's something I have to see.
You know, it's got that feeling of here's what a next-gen version of something you've experienced before actually looks like. So that is exciting to me, for sure. OK, Matthew, that aside, did you identify any more trends or was there anything you wish was there that didn't make an appearance?
We speculated about hoping to see Indiana Jones at some point this year. That would have been nice. I'd like to see what machine games are up to.
Generally on the Bethesda side, I feel like a lot of their studios are kind of in quiet, beavering away mode at the moment. So we don't really know a lot of them up to. I mean, a very boring pick from me, the unlikeliest of Gears of War heads.
I definitely want to see a Gears of War 6. I loved Gears of War 5. I would settle for Gears Tactics 2 as well, should they ever choose to make that.
Two games that I thought were incredibly strong and I just want them to make more of. I was surprised that there wasn't even a teaser for Gears 6. It felt like it's been a while, you know, to enter this generation without like your big kind of graphical showpiece for this generation kind of isn't even on the, you know, on the horizon yet, so.
Yeah. And the fact that there's just been nothing Nintendo, like it's a bit of a bummer. Like Nintendo just like, nope, does that mean they really have nothing?
I don't know.
Well, they got, there's a new Pikmin out next month, doesn't there? That's, is that exciting to you?
Yeah.
It's got a little dog in it. Were you offended by that? I know you're not a big dog guy.
No, I don't mind that. It's fine. When Nintendo, like if anyone can make dogs good, it's Nintendo.
What a take. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
There is that thing as well of like the Sony one was just far enough ahead of it. They didn't quite feel connected to the same event. So in my top 10, I have picked one game that was in that showcase, but because it happened back in, was it back in May it happened?
I think it was. That means that it's, you know, it feels a little bit detached from this. So there is that feeling of if this week had a Nintendo Direct and Sony in the same week, it would really change the vibe of the week, I think.
It would suddenly seem like a much bigger deal than if it was just Microsoft holding it up. So there's a bit of that that goes on with it.
I mean, there's a Capcom showcase happening while we record this, I think.
Yeah, yeah, I assume that that won't have any announcements in it, but will have more elaborate information on, elaboration rather on, you know.
If I miss the announcement of Ace Attorney 7 because I'm recording a podcast, if I wasn't there the moment it happened, I'm going to be fuming.
Yeah, okay. Well, let's hope that doesn't happen then and end this podcast as a concern, as a going concern. That would be bad for both of us.
After all, this is your main job as established, Matthew, not a side hustle. Yeah, I was with you on Indiana Jones. It felt like the year to do that was going to be when the film came out, which is it makes you think, do they want to like not attach it to the baggage of that?
Or is there a feeling as well of like maybe Xbox has a big 2024 planned and they wanted to tease a little bit of what was coming, but not everything. And also, yeah, like that's the thing as well. That film is not reviewed well, has it?
So it might be that avoiding that film might be a good idea. And maybe when we've all seen it, we'll regret that it ever happened. So, yeah, perhaps there's an element of that to it.
Yeah, look out for more Indiana Jones chat on the Patreon feed later this month. That should be fun. So, yeah, I don't think there's anything besides that, really, to be honest.
I've never really sat here thinking, oh, I want something I saw like a one-minute trailer for two years ago to pop up again, like Contraband, for example, the Avalanche game that Xbox is working on. Or I suppose you could say that 007, the IO Interactive game, is one of those things, Matthew, where that's been, you know, almost three years now since they announced they're doing that. So you would think that next year they would be ready to either release it or break cover on it.
I mean, you know, that would be the hope, wouldn't it? So, yeah. That aside, Matthew, there's one other thing I wanted to ask you about, which was what was the least impressive showing of a game you're otherwise excited about there?
Now, there was one very specific game I had in mind when I suggested this on here, and I wondered if you'd twink what it was. Oh, right.
Yeah, what did you have for that one? I've heard since that it previewed really well behind closed doors, but in Jeff's stream, I wasn't that bothered about Alan Wake 2.
Oh, right. Yeah, I didn't think it... I wasn't blown away by that either.
She just sort of went into her room and started shooting like a dude.
Yeah, and then a man came out and she pointed a torch there, and I was like, yeah, okay. But people say that there's quite a lot more to that game, sort of behind closed doors.
Yeah, I think I can believe that from the demo, from the bit they did show. Yeah, I think I agree with that. But I suppose, as well, in my head, I'm just thinking, well, I know I'm going to play that anyway, so it doesn't matter what...
Alan Wake doesn't need to sell itself to me. I'm one of the people who really liked the original and will definitely play a longer-awaited sequel 12 years later, 13 years later. So yeah, they've got me over a barrel anyway with that one.
The thing I was fishing for here, Matthew, was Hellblade 2, actually, which...
Oh, right...
.was one of my all-time favorite showings of a proof of concept for what the game is, back when they did that... Was it a Game Awards trailer that they did in 2021? Something like that.
And it was fighting this giant monster on a beach in Iceland, essentially. And there was, I would say, a God of War-esque scale to it. And it felt massive and exciting.
And this one, because obviously Senua is suffering from psychosis. Is that essentially what her condition is? So it was kind of just her in a cave by herself.
And that was it. And I was there thinking, well, this is a game where you fundamentally slash motherfuckers up. Just show me a bit of combat, you know what I mean?
Because I really believe that this game looks incredible. I just want to see more of what it was teased in. Maybe they thought, okay, maybe that first show wasn't quite thematic enough.
So maybe they need to balance it out with something more story focused. But I was there thinking, nah, come on, let's go. I want to see if this is like the Ninja Theory God of War.
Sort of like equivalent. I want to fucking see it, you know, let's go.
Yeah, I just, you know, I believe that video game makers can do very convincing human faces now. And, you know, if it's more sophisticated on a pixel by pixel level, like my eye can't comprehend that. So, like, just having a showcase for very fine details in a small scene seems very misjudged for a show which is all about like bluster and scale and size.
Just, you know, I was like, yeah, I would hope that a small cave would look this good. I would hope a small cave would look better.
Was that your most disappointing small cave of not being free, Matthew?
I wouldn't say, the reason I didn't pick it for this is because it's not really a game that I'm otherwise that excited about. Like, I'm not a big Hellblade guy. So, I'm still waiting for that game.
I think the big man was the big man. The creepy guy from that last demo was pretty cool and more along the lines of what I was into. But yeah, I don't know.
It's not a very fun hang, the world of Hellblade. It's not for me.
Yeah, that's kind of fair. I did sort of divide people. I remember a couple of people in our office were really quite down on it compared to some of the other outlets out there.
So, yeah, certainly I think that it takes a risk with its themes that I think can gel with you or not. And then its combat was quite tricky. Some of the sword fighting duels in that game and the way enemies will pop up behind you and stuff.
But yeah, I sort of I know this one this one does still have the air of this is their big thing. Like this is why they bought the studio so they could take the germ of that first game and build a mansion on top of it. Does that work as an analogy?
I don't really know.
The big guy in the cave, he ain't popping up behind you. You don't see that guy come in. You've really messed up.
No, exactly. So, yeah, that was that was my least favorite cave of not E3. So, Matthew, with that in mind, shall we take a break and come back with our top tens of what we've what we're excited about?
Top ten caves.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I've got caves. Caves are glorious caves.
I don't really know.
Fuck it.
Yeah, okay, let's do it. Let's have a break.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, the Baked Page podcast, because we're baking in this heat, eh, am I right? Yeah.
That's all I've got in the tank, Matthew, because I'm just fucking boiling it like this. Bodes well for this next section, doesn't it?
That one works better written down. Yeah, I think it does, yeah.
The Baked Page podcast, that's like, just that's, yeah, real kind of five out of 10 stuff there. But hey, you know, you don't fucking get my Santana Smooth reference, what am I supposed to do, you know? Man, it's a hot one.
Still not triggered for you, that one?
No, I can't even imagine what that song would sound like.
I will say not to kind of review the podcast while it's still going on, right? But I will say there is a slight element with this where, you know, when we did that, what do we do that episode on like, oh, it's a PS5 versus Xbox Series X, like revisited we did for Patreon, where we got to the end and thought, is there much gas in the tank here? And that is kind of happened slightly here where I'm like, I don't think I could do the podcast churn thing everyone does every week where it's like, they just talk about news and stuff.
Because you don't have those really juicy takes you have from like deep seeded opinions on games you've actually played for hours and hours. So it ends up being very empty calorie podcasting, you know what I mean?
Oh yeah, talking about what might happen kind of blows. I'm glad that we only do it like twice a year.
Yeah, exactly. So let's fucking get this over with and log off.
Sorry listener.
No, no, I'm excited to talk about this stuff. There's some, yeah, it was nice to curate this list. And I did have more than 10 jostling for spots here, Matthew, which is good for me, because I'm quite fussy when it comes to what I like.
So yeah, I would say actually, there is one thing that kind of links all these and that is they all had gameplay showing. So I haven't picked anything that didn't have, like what I felt was proper gameplay in it. Okay.
Yeah, what about yours?
Some of mine are very flimsy and I just picked them because I was like, yeah, that'll do.
I've also picked something where I thought, I thought I am definitely infringing on Matthew Castle territory here. So I'm hoping you'll have something to say about it too. And who knows, it might be on your list.
So, okay. Do you wanna go first Matthew with your number 10?
Yeah, I sort of didn't realize until quite late that this was like a ranking.
Oh, right, yeah. Cause I did say in the chat, but I thought, should I underline that this is a ranking in case you missed that?
And then I'm like, oh, okay. So I've tried to put them in some order, but like, yeah, this is all, this is definitely wrong. I'm actually gonna kick off with one from the PC gaming show.
I was quite intrigued by Islands of Insights.
Oh yeah, that was pretty cool. Yeah.
It looks like a big old weird mix of the Talos principle, The Witness and Professor Layton, in that the kind of Talos principle of it all is that you seem to be sort of exploring the ruins of ancient civilizations and solving puzzles. But the sort of the witness of it seems to be that it's quite open world and you can kind of navigate this big mad sort of floating island landscape, however you wish. And then there are lots of different puzzle mechanics, which is kind of what was making me think of Professor Layton.
Like in bits of it, they were doing kind of perception puzzles, lining up bits of the environment. In some of them, there was clearly some sort of like sequence puzzles going on. There was some stuff with Tetronomos, which looked like something from Professor Layton.
I was just like, oh, this looks like a big fucking dweeby island, where big dweebs like me will be able to just chill out and solve loads of puzzles like we did in The Witness, maybe without like as much kind of sort of wankery around the edges. There also seems to be like flying with like sort of fairy wings, which I thought, is that too kind of cringe for me to include this in this list? Do I really want to be associated with that?
Well, that was, when that happened, I was like, oh, there's a bit of Immortals, Phoenix Rising in this as well.
Right, that's it. Yeah, there's a lot going on there, but I do like big, shiny, 3D logic puzzle games like The Tower's Principle. Maybe I should have picked The Tower's Principle too, but this one was more on my mind.
So yeah, the powerfully dorky Islands of Insights it is.
Well, I'm pleased that you've talked it down while also praising it as something you're excited about.
Well, that's why it's good. It's like, yeah, like that is a genre of get like, dorky puzzle games is a thing. And like, you can try it.
Like their idea of making it cool is having all these like giant ancient civilization kind of bits of scenery and stuff, which in itself is very nerdy. Like if you get really pumped for like an old pillar, it means the aesthetic is a little bit misty as well.
Or like, you know, the witness, the witness is obviously the good, good calling card for it.
I just, I like it. It's like really sincere in that slight silliness. I apologize to people who like pillars.
I apologize. I don't mind them.
Well, there was also the, there was also a shared world element to it, right? Like a co-op element to it.
Yeah, that doesn't speak to me. Like, I don't want other people in my world solving my puzzles. Like that would annoy me if like, you know, I go up to some plinth and find someone else pushing a crate.
I'll be annoyed.
You just go in like hit kick. You know what I mean?
Yeah, I'll be like, get the fuck out of my island, man. That's my crate. Well, I'm not looking.
I don't want to see any dirt.
This is my island of insight, says the cool guy. Yeah, that's really funny. So yeah, good.
So we've not only gone over why you're excited about this game, but also the ways in which it could go wrong when it gets here. So perfect. That's great talking up there.
Okay, cool. Well, my first one is, I've got to get out of the way, Matthew, because it'll just probably just like, you'll go, oh, for fuck's sake. It's just Sonic Superstars, okay?
So put this in here. It's a 2D Sonic game made with 3D graphics. I thought it looked quite nice.
It was the one thing I kind of checked out live during the Summer Jeff Fest. I thought it was like, oh yeah, this is decent. I'm excited about this.
So yeah, it's like four different increasingly cursed Sonic characters have to go and get some Chaos Emeralds. There is a very cursed old fucking Sonic Game Gear enemy called Fang who's in this. When I read the line on like, and featuring the exciting return of Game Gear something Fang, I did laugh out loud that when I read that on a website earlier this week.
Obviously Eggman.
Somewhere there's Jay Bayless fist pumping.
No shadow of a hedgehog though, which is important. They'll probably sell him as DLC though. So let's not count him out just yet.
Yeah, it's sort of like the thing that I was cautious about with this is, one, I would have been happy just for the Sonic Mania lot to make a sequel because I think we all agree Sonic Mania was actually great. And in the two levels that were like a massive departure visually from what had been previously established in Sonic, it was agreed that they'd added something to the formula that wasn't there before necessarily. Like that Press Garden Zone, fucking amazing in Sonic Mania, I had a really great time with that game.
So this, I feel like people had forgotten that Sonic 4 happened a little bit when people were discussing this. I was like, well, there was already a game that did this that had like 3D visuals but looked like 2D Sonic. So people have short memories for Sonic, I think.
But it did also make me think, oh, with Sonic, they're at least going for an easy win. It's something that doesn't seem that hard. It shouldn't be that hard to do a good 2D or side scrolling Sonic game.
So yeah, I thought the style of this was just right, Matthew. Preview seemed quite positive. So yeah, a bit of optimism from me.
And certainly less curse than live surface Crash Bandicoot, which was a firm no from me, dog. So season pass, the Crash Bandicoot is not the one, I'm afraid. Yeah, no thank you.
I don't understand what that game is at all. Like, why not just put that games as service model on like a new Crash Team Racing? People really like that game.
Yeah, that's true. And they sort of, it's always like in the sales charts on PlayStation as well. When you go to buy a game on sale, it's always there.
So people must just keep buying it. So yeah, but yeah, I don't even watch that trailer.
Poor old toys for Bob. Who is Bob who is receiving all these toys?
Yeah, my guy Bob just. So yes, Sonic Matthew, any thoughts on that? Or just should we just move on?
No, I was gonna ask whether it was the Sonic Mania 2 because I haven't really been following this one, but it sounds like it is not.
No, but it is made by an old, old time Sonic guy, which is the, basically the original characters.
That could be many games journalists.
The original is the original character designer, is it now to Ashima, that guy. So yeah, so I'm pretty sure.
Is he one of Uji Naka's like enemies now?
I can't remember.
He's got bigger enemies to worry about now.
I don't know if he's been. Oh yes, he was the one who was blotted from the photo. He's that guy, which a great couple of years for him really.
He's just like, it's like succession, isn't it? He gets erased from a photo, Naka goes to jail, and this guy's making the new Sonic. It's just like, yeah, it's a succession with Sonic the Hedgehog, truly a cursed combination.
So, good stuff there, but yeah, so there is an original creator at least involved with this. I don't personally take that to mean that much, because, you know, like it's, you know, if he's an artist, it's all about the platform, isn't it? And that's what made me got right.
So that's enough Sonic talk, Matthew, what's your number nine?
My number nine is actually a bit of a double whammy. I've put together the two Like A Dragon games, which is Like A Dragon Gaiden, the man who erased his name, which is a sort of side story that fills in the gap between Yakuza 6 and Yakuza Like A Dragon. And Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth, which is basically Yakuza 8, the sequel to Like Yakuza Like A Dragon.
God, these names are confusing, which obviously had, like they didn't show any of the gameplay, but it was the Ichiban waking up on the beach in Hawaii with no clothes on, and people screaming at him with all the slightly goofy sort of Austin Powers sight gags where his junk's covered up with like seashells and like well-placed tubes of sun lotion, which is always a good bit. Yeah, like these guys just, they make so many games. It's unreal.
I love most of their games. I just love the industry of this team and how many of these things they managed to make. It's incredibly impressive.
They're like the anti-Rocksteady, a hundred games in eight years or something mad. So a future with both of these in it is a good future for me.
Was struck by the contrast in tone between these two reveals. So yeah, Man Wakes Up Naked on the Beach, very different vibes for sure. But also Infinite Wealth is a great subtitle for a game.
That's just, that's as good, isn't it? So yeah, I saw that and thought, yeah, they are still coming out a steady clip. You will not be short of these games ever now.
That's two in one year, you're gonna have. So let's see how far they push it. Because I think I read from another rumor as well, there's another Judgment Game coming, Matthew, at some point and, yeah, I hope so.
Yeah, so who knows? I don't, I think the same rumor said that they're, they may not do another adaptation of an old one. Like they might not get to Kenzan, for example, the PS3 historical one.
But yeah, so yeah, big time, big time to be a fan of this series. So yeah, good pick, Matthew. I don't know how you get the time to play through all this shit, to be honest.
It's just so much game, isn't it? Okay, Manobanai is Sword of the Sea. This was my only game from the PS Showcase.
This was from the artist behind Abzu and before that Journey, and then did the game Pathless as well. This was like a kind of a similar vibe of sort of like a sand surfing game with that very distinctive art style. But while actually I'm quite, I'm guilty of only playing a little bit of Pathless, it did seem pretty cool.
And I think at the time people kind of dug it, but maybe it wasn't considered the sexiest of the PS5 things you could do at the time. This kind of art style is sort of adjacent to what the Ico in Shadow of the Colossus art style was in some ways it's warmer and more colorful, but it's just so singular and creates such a specific lonely mood in you that I was just, I just thought it was a nice trailer basically and thought, oh, well, I will play that. I will play the sand surfing game with absolutely beautiful art direction.
Did this one make an impact on you at all, Matthew?
Yeah, this almost made my list. Definitely an honorable mention. Yeah, you're right.
It's like really soulful looking, but at the same time, it seems to have a kind of playfulness at its core in that your surfboard is almost seems to behave more like a skateboard, but there are like half pipes and ramps and things in the trailer. And you're almost doing quite gnarly tricks in this very beautiful environment. I'm intrigued to see what like the balance there is.
I think sometimes these things can be a bit too sort of solemn. So the idea of it being a bit bodacious or whatever the surface slang is. Is that surface slang?
Yeah, rings a bell. Is that something that Bill and Ted say? I don't know.
Yeah.
Bodacious.
Often they say like there's bodacious babes. Obviously, I wouldn't say that myself.
Yeah, I mean, it sounded wrong coming out of you, to be honest.
Yeah.
It's not right at all.
It sounds hateful when I say it.
Yeah, I said that is a hate crime.
Rather than celebratory, which I imagine it's intended as.
Celebratory.
We're like, look, look at these bodacious babes.
It's got a big like 80s sort of quiz show energy, that, hasn't it? So yeah, it's, yeah, anyway, yeah. That's, I know what you mean though.
I think like the part, I think the path was like this too, where I think there was some quite precise combat mechanics in there combined with nice sort of movement and stuff. And I think I agree that these games, I think to have that, if you can combine intricate mechanics with that, it's all about the vibes, man, approach to environmental design and stuff. I think you need that now rather than, those games that are just experiential, I just don't think people have as much time for them.
So I think, like you say, the fact that there are half pipes and they've said that they're trying to combine the speed and flow of skating games with the emotional core and exploration they're otherwise known for, that's a really good combo, I think. So this left an impact and it's one of two games involving skateboard-like things on my list, although this is actually a sword that you skate. And yeah, acts like a hoverboard and a skateboard and a snowboard all in one apparently.
That's according to the developers, Joe and Squid.
What a boobish surfing sword. Why didn't Tony Hawk ever stick a sword on his thing and chop any naysayers down, like the policemen who are like, you can't skate in London.
Or the reviewers who gave Tony Hawk Ride a three out of 10, you know, those naysayers. Okay, what's your number eight, Matthew?
My number eight is Prince of Persia, the Lost Crown.
That's on my list too. Slightly higher, but we can discuss it now. In fact, it's my number eight as well, so that's perfect.
Yeah, this is Ubisoft's return to Prince of Persia has a 2D sort of Metroidvania style. So you could say like, oh, it's going back to Prince of Persia's roots, but it actually looks very, very different from old school, quite methodical Prince of Persia. This has seemingly like a much more kind of rambunctious kind of combat system reminded me in ways of the 2D Lords of Shadow, Mirror of Fate in some of the kind of 2D combos, that sort of 2D sort of Devil May Cry, very athletic.
You can kind of throw yourself around. I know other people have sort of said, sort of Metroid Dread in the 2.5D-ness of it as well, which I definitely see. I know some people who've been to play this and went over to Montpellier to play it and were telling me about it.
And they were saying that like, it actually has some really fun time mechanics in it. Like you can kind of leave a kind of copy of yourself that you can kind of revert back there at any time. So you can kind of go off and do stuff and then very quickly like rewind time to get back there.
And it feels like it is leaning into the kind of time powers of sands of time too. So yeah, a real hodgepodge of stuff that I'm into. And I just, I just like the look of it.
And you know, a flashy, slightly like bigger budget Metroidvania is something I will always be into.
Yeah, it's funny one this because I actually didn't see the Summer Jeffest trailer for this. I just saw like the response to it and our guy Jeremy Peel going viral on Twitter saying it was, you know, this was the same studio that made the Rayman games Origins and Legends. So, but I watched the, you know, the full gameplay presentation at the Ubisoft thing and it looked great, I thought.
So, I was really surprised to hear there was even any disappointment. I guess you could say the art style is, you know, it doesn't look like a AAA Ubisoft game in that sense, but it sort of looks like, to me, I think all of the bits you pull out there about, you know, Castlevania, Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate and all that stuff is accurate. There is like such a Metroid dread streak running through this, I think.
It's just that handbook of, well, obviously, there is original Prince and Persia DNA in this too, but how do you make that modern, athletic, exciting vibe where the camera pulls in as well sometimes, so it kind of looks, it does look like a kind of 3D blockbuster up close sometimes, but then it pulls back and you're size scrolling again. And just presentationally, just really impressed me, Matthew. So I was with you on this.
I thought this was a real highlight of the show. And I just looked at it and thought, I'll definitely play that. I'll definitely play that.
It will cost about, probably about 25 quid. I absolutely give that a go. So yeah, an impressive reprise for this series.
It's sort of had a weird, neglectful few years. It's just been sort of like left to fester a little bit, which is strange because for a long time, this was the Ubisoft calling card, you know, for basically the PS2 generation. So yeah, good stuff, Matthew.
Very cool.
Yeah, that was my number eight. So your number seven, I believe.
Yes, is Dragon's Dogma 2.
Oh, nice. Yeah, not on my list.
From the PlayStation Showcase, I don't imagine being shown at the Capcom Showcase tonight. I will say, I did also really like the look of their other thing that they announced at Xbox, Kunitsugami, Path of the Goddess, but I also found it slightly hard to pass and was waiting for them to kind of explain it a bit more. Dragon's Dogma 2, I just kind of sort of know what I'm getting, or sort of have an idea of what to expect, which is sort of action, adventure, RPG, but with a slightly more kind of sort of physical satisfying kind of combat at its heart.
You know, I think it has sort of Capcom's sense of how games are meant to feel, and how games are meant to feel kind of very kind of reactive and fun under the fingers, married to a genre which is sometimes a bit more sort of stodgy and detached. That's what I'd say is the strength of Dragon's Dogma 1, and this just looks to be more of the same. I just really like it's very broad fantasy palette that it's all kind of like Medusas, and there's a sphinx, and a giant griffin, and you're climbing on its back and stabbing in the head.
It's very sort of unfussy, sort of not worried about being anything too kind of ground breaking within its own fantasy vision, and that I've got a lot of time for. It's just a game about hunting down a big dragon, it looks like a dragon who steals your heart, which is a good reason as any to kill a dragon, I guess.
Yeah, I think the current Capcom Golden Age sort of started about three or four years ago now, when Resi 2 Remake and Devil May Cry 5 came out, and it has only persisted. And now we seem to be entering this quite interesting phase where they are, I would say, taking risks relative to what a lot of other big publishers are doing at the moment. You know, there are new series in here.
There is like, you know, there's some quite unusual looking stuff like Exo Primal, you know, made of like familiar parts maybe, but seems quite Capcom, according to people who have played it, and I'm looking forward to it. And, you know, Dragon's Dogma was arguably the most kind of like, you know, the biggest Capcom wild card to come out of the 360 era. One of the highlights of this podcast was the time Joe Scribs talked about it in detail.
That was a really fun, fun bit of whatever podcast that was that Joe came on. I think it was the Indie Games one, actually. It was, it was really, really good.
And so, yeah, like I agree, the monsters look rad. The combat looks really nice. It's a Capcom game, so it looks pretty as fuck.
It also looks quite goofy, as you'd expect from a Capcom game. So it's all there, you know, all the pieces are there. Some great fucking monsters to kill.
Definitely up for this one. We'll definitely give this a proper go. So, yeah.
It's just interesting. I think a lot of what's being said about Final Fantasy 16, in terms of what Square Enix were trying to achieve, by literally bringing in a Devil May Cry combat designer, it's just interesting that there's a lot of that DNA already in Dragon's Dogma. It maybe doesn't have quite the Devil May Cry-ish sort of stylish combat system.
It's a bit more functional than that. But it's the same guy behind this, as is behind Devil May Cry 5 and 3, I think. And 4.
I can't remember, isn't it? Is it Azuka, Azuna? Anyway, apologies to him.
And yeah, so like that marriage of something a bit more kind of fun under the fingers, but still satisfying the kind of fancy kind of tropes, isn't like quite as out there as some of the Final Fantasy 16 publicities trying to make it out to be.
Right, yeah.
That's my take.
No, that's an interesting take for sure. But you know what it needs is it needs more hot boys, Dragon's Dogma 2, Matthew, if he wants to stand out, and Ralph Innocent, you know what I mean?
Yeah, it has got a lot of hot boys.
Yeah, or Ralph Innocent, so that's tough.
Well, we don't know that yet. We haven't heard the entire Dragon's Dogma 2 cast.
You gotta go out there and kill that dragon. That was the best I could do, is the most generic Northern voice. He's got such a specific voice, it's never gonna get anywhere near that one.
Okay, good, Dragon's Dogma 2. Did they give a release date for that one? Is that?
No, not yet.
Vague next year kind of times, probably.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, cool. Yes, okay, hashtag do it for Scribs. By the way, that Prince of Persia game is $50, so I was completely wrong about it being 25 quid.
So yeah, that's different. You can play it, you play plus on day one though, so maybe I get a seven day trial or something.
I fear the internet's decided it's bad.
Oh, what, do you think it's already too late for it? It was good, they look good though.
It was, yeah, that's tough. I know.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna fight the internet on this. Okay, my number seven is Star Wars Outlaws, Matthew. So they got me over a barrel, right?
They announced the Star Wars game at the Xbox conference. And I was like, yeah, you know, CG teaser, whatever, fine. And I knew this, obviously we knew this game was coming.
This was the announcement they made when Lucasfilm were like, we're not just making games for the A now. You know, we want loads of people to pitch us Star Wars games. And this is their big thing they came out with, is there is an open world game from Ubisoft Massive, the division developers who also revealed Avatar, the game which is not on my list and not on my honorable mentions either.
I'm not really an Avatar guy, unfortunately. But obviously Star Wars, this is this podcast have been subjected to three of my podcasts about the subject now, poor bastards. This was, I was considering putting this slightly lower because the demo they showed, which they very smartly said it's coming to the Ubisoft Conference tomorrow and then showed it last.
So if you only wanted to tune in for that one thing, you had to watch the entire live stream to get to it at the end, which to be honest is quite smart scheduling. But it's sort of like at first, it was just some sort of third person shooting and then your main, the main character when she gets on a bike and then she kind of drives off. There's little very familiar mechanics and it's just got a little like, sort of like dog like companion things you can tell to go and sort of activate and deactivate things and which seemed quite a Ubisofty sort of mechanic with their, you know, sort of Far Cry companions and various watchdogs kind of mechanics and stuff like that.
So I thought it was a little bit familiar on that front. But the thing it did that I really liked was when the main character got on a spaceship and took off, she could actually fly into outer space. And that is always going to get me, I'm afraid.
That's like Starfield did the same thing. It's like we've not only built, you know, what you're always used to in these games is you fast travel between the worlds, right? Or at best you get what Jedi Fallen Order and Survivor give you, which is a little bit of a montage, you little wait around and then in real time, the new planet loads up and you get out and you know, fine.
But now we're at the stage where you could actually get in a ship, fly off and then go to, you know, without a loading screen into orbit, get into a space battle, go into hyperspace, and then arrive at your next destination or whatever. And I really dug that Matthew, even if the rest of it I was sort of like, I guess I wasn't down on, but I'm not sold on it yet. How did you feel about this one?
Yeah, I was quite excited about what it was going to be. I must admit that demo didn't set my world alight. It just had all the hallmarks of those very kind of scripted demos where, you know, all the little extra lines of dialogue that they've added to make it seem incredibly reactive.
I just sort of see through that stuff. I think you're right about the scale of it and the taking off, but I don't know, open world game, different factions. The chat around it didn't particularly fill me with hope, I must admit, but I don't have that little Star Wars buzz.
You know, that doesn't really do anything for me either way.
So, well, that's fine. I think if it had just been all that stuff on the planet and have been like, ah, that was quite a lukewarm showing for something that is meant to be, presumably, like probably the biggest thing that Ubisoft's got next year. Assuming it comes out next year, which I think is another question, if the same studio's making Avatar, and that's taken years to make, so, yeah.
I've only got room in my heart for one slightly knockoff Star Wars character with a little comedy sidekick.
And they did, that was the other thing, is it is tough to do this after Jedi Survivor, right? Because getting on the speeder bike and driving off in it didn't really have the same, like, Jedi Survivor has some of the best traversal mechanics of any modern blockbuster game to me. It was, you know, a bit of skill, a bit of spectacle, it's all there.
And this game, this game coming afterwards is like you're a normal human on the ground with a blaster and you've got to scoot around on your little bike. And it's, yeah, it's tough to have the same appeal as you've got your grappling hook thing and then you hop, you know, you go wall running up this cliff and then suddenly you're in the sky or whatever. Like, it's tough to compare to that.
It's just something about at the heart of, like, Star Wars' visual DNA, which I don't know if it suits, like, a big, busy open world, you know, like the films and the more successful games, they're very kind of controlled spaces where you can really, like, manage the kind of, like, the amazing sort of background scenery that you never actually get to, you know. It's like linear paths set in front of these amazing bits of, like, concept art, basically. When you just give someone that big sort of, sort of generic open world with, like, some hills and loads of rocks and loads of trees everywhere, like, not a single frame of it looks like an iconic Star Wars game or an iconic Star Wars moment, which is something you can say for, like, I think the Jedi Fallen Order game or the other good Star Wars games is that they kind of, in moments, look like the films.
I think there's something about the visual language of Star Wars that just doesn't suit an open world. It may be.
It looks more like Star Wars when she got into Outer Space, I thought. That iconography is unmistakable. I think it's a fair point about the bits on the ground.
The thing I also try to keep in mind is I'm the guy who is constantly complaining about the fact there are no more third-person shooters anymore. So when they're actually doing third-person shooters that have linear bits in them, I thought, well, I probably will enjoy this still. But yeah, that stuff I was slightly more lukewarm on, but I want to believe that this could be good, even though I've also got the same fatigue with the open world genre that a lot of people do and sort of do wonder how much this will blow away those cobwebs, which is a much larger challenge and more of an existential question about that genre really, which has not really evolved despite its, well, perhaps because of its absolutely enormous popularity, you know?
So yeah. Okay, well, that was a weird note for that one, but I nonetheless look forward to it. What's it number six, Matthew?
Cocoon.
Ah, made my honorable mentions.
Yeah, by Geometric Interactive, which is some ex-Playdead people, I think. I'm still not 100% sure what, like, the central puzzle mechanic is. It's kind of worlds within worlds.
Like, you're in, like, a little puzzle, a sort of 3D puzzle world, but then you can kind of step outside of that world, and it reveals that that world is contained within an orb, which in itself is contained within a 3D world, which is contained in an orb. It's like kind of inception for sort of worlds, and the mechanic seems to be that you can kind of pull things in and out of the different layers of this world. So like something that may exist in one of the orb worlds could be pulled out to the outer layer where it will help you solve a puzzle there.
I'm interested if there's more to it in terms of like where those orbs go and how they behave. Like when you're carrying the orbs, it seems to change the behavior. Like one orb seems to reveal like hidden things that were invisible.
It's kind of like a special lens and you know, another orb might, I don't know, let you throw it as a weapon or something. I'm not entirely sure for the trailers. There was a lot going on.
Some interesting mechanics where you could sort of like jump into an orb world to avoid a threat in your current layer of the world and then quickly exit again. So you could literally use it as like a dodging maneuver. Yeah, like whatever's going on, it looks sublimely animated, visually very striking, as you'd expect from people who worked on, on like limbo and inside.
Yeah, I just, I dig it, but I don't really know what it is.
Yeah, I was sort of, I was sort of with you, it had that slight whiff of like, is it like sort of Death's Door sort of thing, a little bit of Tunic in there maybe as well, just sort of like, those kind of like high end isometric-y games, is that fair? Do you think?
Yeah, but I think with like puzzle rather than combat at its heart.
Yeah, that's probably fair. So yeah, yeah, I thought this looked really cool too. Which of the streams was this in, was this in the Day of the Dead?
Yes.
I think it was, because he had a bit where the dude was talking first. I think he's like, I think he was the gameplay designer or something like that. Or, yeah, like an artist or one of those things.
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, I think it was gameplay designer actually. So yeah, it was a cool showing. And yeah, another indie game where I was like, yep, definitely gonna give that a go.
So nice to see it there. My next one, Matthew? Time to infringe on Matthew Castle's turf and pick Shadow Gambit, The Cursed Crew.
So I actually don't know which of the live streams this is in, Matthew, but I watched the trailer for it, which I think announced a release date. Maybe it's in the PC gaming show, actually.
Yeah, it was PC gaming, yeah, yeah.
Which it screams them, because Phil was always a big Shadow Tactics fan. So yeah, so you have previously talked about this. You are the big me, me, me head of this podcast.
And it's-
It's always about me, me, me.
But the thing, I watched a couple of the previews that came off the back of this as well. And what kind of amazed me about it was it is like this, basically this pirate themed stealth game, kind of top-down stealth game, where yeah, you are basically fulfilling a series of objectives across these maps and taking out enemies silently and hiding and things like that. But so in that kind of like, what is basically the old commandos mold, right?
That's basically what they're drawing from. And they've done this with Desperados and Shadow Tactics. So they're definitely, they are basically the owners of this game type now.
What I loved about this one is the maps seem to be vast, Matthew. There seem to be some really fucking huge, the sort of like sandboxy locations to figure out and quite varied objectives and things like that. But it was also just the art style.
It's a really, really beautiful looking game. It's sort of like, it's sort of, obviously we live in this sort of sea of thieves age and it does feel like it's got a little bit of that to it, right, in terms of the sort of tone. It's fun, again, there was a sea shanty over the trailer for this one, Matthew, which you will no doubt have paused by.
I'll allow it.
I'll allow it, reluctantly. I was just really impressed by it and I thought, you know what, I have not played one of these games at all and Matthew's banged on about it for so long. I should just fucking play one because this looks like it's, it seems like it's the culmination of what they're great at.
You know what I mean? They arguably, they've already had that sort of apotheosis moment a couple of times. But people seem so reassured that what this was doing as a stealth experience was so fucking good and so modern feeling that they just, they were really overwhelmed by it.
So there's some really great previews out there about it. So that got me hyped, Matthew. How are you feeling about this one?
Yeah, I'm really excited. I haven't put it on my top 10 just because I've talked about it quite a lot, you know, and it's quite a known thing to me. Catherine was playing a big preview build for a big RPS preview, she did.
And yeah, it looks really great. I mean, the big difference between this and Shadow Tactics and Desperados 3 is that it is a bit more open, like that it's set on like these big islands. You can choose kind of where you enter the level from different angles.
And also the squad of undead pirates you bring, I think it's a squad of three, you build them yourselves, where in the previous games, they always gave you quite explicit, like these are the characters for this level, and then they built the challenges around them accordingly. So the big challenge in this one is, how do you build this satisfying stealth challenge when you don't know which direction they're coming from and who's coming at you from that direction? Each character's powers really change how that game plays.
There's one who can kind of create more cover, so we'll block sight lines that way. There's another one who has a cannon who can shoot characters, can pick up the heroes and then fire them to new places. So yeah, there's huge potential here.
I'm really interested how they've done that without blowing the tension at the heart of it and how tightly crafted the levels were in Shadow Tactics and particularly in Desperado 3. So yeah, I have absolute faith they've worked it out and they know what they're doing, but yeah, this should be one of the better games of the year if it all works out.
Yeah, it's out on the 17th of August as well, so just a couple of months and you'll be able to play that one. So yeah, I was really buzzing from it. And it might just be the one that breaks them through to that next level of popularity, you know?
It's their IP as well, so yeah, hopefully they'll do the numbers for them and let them carry on doing these things. Though, as I've said before, one day I do hope they get the Mission Impossible license just because that would be the raddest game ever. I'm going to keep saying it on this podcast so that one day when it eventually does happen, everyone will think I'm some kind of prophet.
That is the most Matthew Castle game you could possibly request, outside of some kind of rhythm action Randy Newman joint. But that would seem a bit too on the nose for you, wouldn't it?
Yeah, especially if they then did alias DLC for Mission Impossible games.
Yeah, just seasons one and two. Okay, good stuff Matthew. So what's your number five?
Maybe a little out of character in that it's a little bit Diddly D. I've gone for that sheep herding game Summer Hill.
Oh, you know what? I thought about putting that in here, but I thought, will Matthew call this out as being Diddly D? So there was a little bit of that too.
Yeah, it's very much a Diddly D game, particularly when like this very rustic looking chap who was working on the game said in a little interview like, oh, we're all, you know, we all come from this land and Big Edgar Wright energy to that guy. We're all into like sheep herding and all this kind of stuff. I was like, well, fair enough.
Yeah, I mean, like my guess is that this is going to be a little bit like Pitman, except you're sort of herding sheep. You're a shepherd with his dog and there's a load of sheep and they seem to have very nice flock physics, flock AI. I don't know in that when you chase them about the way they seem to run across the landscape looks really nice on their Steam page.
It talks about kind of guiding the flock and using that mass of them to sort of solve puzzles and split the flock up into different groups to solve puzzles, which to me sounds very Pikmin-y just how you interact with them, which is like guiding them with a separate character rather than directly steering them with like the Pikmin cursor. Yeah, I thought that that was super intriguing and just the look at the thing like that, you know, immaculate vibes, as they say, very kind of stormy dour coastland with lots of cool little sheep running everywhere. Yeah, I think it was cool.
Yeah, I did too, you know, it's obviously that's a bit of the old West country sort of tendrils getting into you there, Matthew, you know. Yeah, I liked it as well. I thought there was a little bit of, you know, it was like quite forlorn tonally and there's like a coming of age, you know, story element to it.
So there is, you know, that it's trying to conjure up emotions as well as having like good sheep physics or whatever, which, you know, sheep animations which look very nice in the trailer. And yeah, I was impressed by this too. And I actually, one thing I also really liked about Day of the Devs is they did all get to make their pitch, right?
They did all come on camera and they said, here's what we're making, here's what it's inspired by. Because they said it was inspired by their own games and their journey. And yeah, I think I was like, why be one other thing in there?
I can't remember.
I couldn't deal with in Day of the Devs seeing people who are like characters from Psych Odyssey, their documentary, because obviously they film it with Double Fine. And so some of the Double Fine people, you're like, oh, it's that person from the documentary who wasn't like a big character in the documentary, but has obviously since then gone on to be a bit more important in that they're hosting bits of this stream. So that was quite cool.
Good for them. I feel like I'm very parasocial with Double Fine because of that documentary.
Yeah, you're a big Greg Rice head these days.
That's like Greg Rice and there was this, I can't remember what she did at the studio. I thought she was like an artist. There's this woman in, I can't remember her name is terrible, but she was in the stream as well.
And I was like, oh, her. She was like quite a quiet background character in the documentary, but she must be more important because Greg Rice left in a very moving episode.
Yeah, I've still not finished it. So that's on me, but yeah, as mentioned, Matthew, I've got the mental block from the, as previously mentioned, like someone in that documentary unfollowed me on Twitter, so I've still got to get over that mental barrier. So that's a lot for me to deal with.
Yeah, so yeah, I agree with you. This did look cool. I'm glad you called us out because I should have put this in here too, but I did just think.
You scared me. You feared my ridicule.
Well, I don't know why because you don't judge. You're very encouraging of all my bullshit. Well, yeah, you do, but you do it quietly and behind my back.
Yeah, exactly. So, no, I agree that I was like say, pound for pound, Day of the Devs was probably my favourite stream of the thing. It was just curated and cool.
So in fact, actually, my next game, Matthew, was from that stream. It was Hellscape. Did you see this in that live stream?
Yeah, I did. Not quite my cup of tea, but I'm interested to see what clicked with you.
So this is basically a fusion art to me. It seemed like the coding in the language was we've combined Devil May Cry and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. And frankly, I was digging that.
As a man with a lot of PS2 genre heritage, that sort of spoke to me. I thought it was a really convincing pitch for a game, but also that the actual gameplay they showed looked pretty cool. It was hard to kind of describe the art style, really.
I guess I'll kind of come back to that. But what was interesting is that the skate part of it is not being sidelined because they've got combat. It's meant to be in addition to it.
So I get the impression that you're going to be doing these combos that combine tricks as well as the combat in the way that both Devil May Cry and Tony Hawk would rate you, but doing it at the same time. So they've actually got one of the designers of Tony Hawk's Underground working on this one. So I thought that was really interesting.
It's really hard to find out information about this game on the internet, though. It's got no Steam page or anything like that. It doesn't seem to have an official website.
It was just in that stream. And so I guess they just submitted it or something. But yeah, it was just the thing.
It was maybe like the game-iest thing that was in Day of the Devs. But yeah, it just spoke to me as something a bit different to what else was in the show, Matthew. What did you think of this one?
Yeah, I mean, it looked a little hectic and wasn't there a demonic skating game in Devolver Digital last year?
Yeah, that's like called Skate Story, I think.
Yeah, there was one that was all, it was like a guy skating, but he was like made of crystals. It looked really evil.
Right.
Do you remember that?
Yeah, that is cool. I think that is called Skate Story. That is the one, I believe.
The one that's where the camera is really up close and it looks like it's the Silver Surfer on a skateboard.
Yeah, that's the one. I thought it had a weird name, like Ice Demon or something.
No, I think it's called Skate Story. I think that's right. But yeah, I don't think it's come out yet.
That looked quite different though. That did look…
Yeah, I know, but I was sort of like, oh, it's like a skating game with a weird energy to it and maybe I've only got enough head space for one of those.
That's fair. You were at capacity for that particular genre. This was a bit more colourful.
I'm really curious to see how this plays out, but the level seemed quite vast as well. It just was moving really quickly, just, yeah, yeah, sort of spawn as a kind of, oh, that really speaks to me. I hope it's good, basically.
So, yeah, roguelike as well.
A part of nothing, I just remembered the worst thing I saw over the last week.
Go on.
That twisted metal clip from the TV show. Did you see that?
No, I didn't. I wasn't watching the stream at that point. Was it?
Oh my God, that looks so bad.
Isn't it Anthony Mackie in it as well?
Oh, it's just, yeah, but like it was a scene not in cars. So it was like him and Sweet Tooth, whoever the fuck that is. Like just in a casino.
Oh, the writing was atrocious. Oh, it was so embarrassing. I felt so embarrassed for Anthony Mackie.
You shouldn't be allowed to be an Avenger if you've also done that.
Yeah, because I think that dude is talented. So it's weird when you see him making those kind of choices. This is not-
Oh, it's so bad because they've got like some huge wrestler guy playing Sweet Tooth, but he's voiced by Will Arnett.
Oh, God. That's a bad choice.
So it's like a live action performance, but because his head is hid behind a mask, it's just Will Arnett's voice coming out of it, and just really bad. Really bad.
Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to watch that. I don't think this is going to save the flailing Peacock Network, Matthew, this kind of thing.
It's ditching Girls 5 Ever and commissioning Twisted Metal instead. That's tough. Okay.
What's it up before, Matthew?
Borders Gate 3.
Ah, not on my list.
Which again, super obvious, Matthew Pick, this one, they've just been showing off more and more of this game as they get closer. The big news here was at the PC gaming show, they finally showed off Borders Gate, the city itself. You know, the big mystery that kind of hung over this game was how are they going to do the city?
Because with their level of kind of like dense quest design and environmental design, you know, surely you weren't going to do a whole city. And I'm still not entirely sure like how big it is compared to some of the urban spaces they've done in like Divinity, say. But it looks substantial.
And the big point that they were making is that it isn't just like a load of connected areas that you walk between, which was their original idea and how they would normally handle like a really big environment. They say it is a big open world city. So there's like interaction between the different parts, and if your character could fly, you know, they could fly across the whole city, say.
And you know, there is something quite magic about seeing buildings that you recognize from that world, you know, from the original game when you went to Baldur's Gate and there's some quite iconic landmarks. And, you know, in the original game, it was split into like a series of like eight or ten different screens, which you had to constantly kind of walk between, made it quite a chore. So just being able to sort of sell the fantasy of that place.
And in that side, that place is a character voiced by Jason Isaacs, which they announced as well. Quite a starry cast slowly amounting for this one because it's got Jason Isaacs, JK Simmons as well from Whiplash is like another villain in it. So yeah, I just feel like they're certainly throwing some money at this one.
And it's so close. Like it's coming out in August, is it? I think.
Very exciting.
Yeah. So I have not really been following this one. Have you chatted out in early access much since it first launched?
I've played it a couple of times for key updates for like RPS coverage and things like that. So when I've gone and interviewed them at various things, I haven't actually touched it for a while just because I wanted a bit of distance and wanted to kind of go in fresh. I felt super familiar with it in maybe the first six months, year of it.
But now I feel like I can just enjoy it. But there's so much this game they haven't shown, this entire kind of characters that you can play throughout it, they haven't announced yet and classes they haven't announced. There's all kinds of stuff.
And even though I'm not like hugely invested in D&D and it's not like I'm waiting for my favorite particular thing to be announced or anything, like I am slightly intrigued by the sort of sheer scale of it and how much they've committed to bringing each class to life with all these bespoke mechanics and things. It's a huge, huge undertaking this game. Yeah, I just wonder if it's going to have that kind of breakout appeal.
So we shall see.
Right. Yeah, I went to go and get a drink of water actually and came back and looked at the city scape and I was like, oh, fuck, what's this game? I had no idea what it was and then I saw Sven's head come up and I was like, oh yeah, there it is.
I like that. The video had Adam Smith, formerly of RPS, who really looks like Max Payne 3 now. He's got a big beard and a bald head.
It's very striking similarity.
He was diving in slow motion and wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Yeah. Yeah.
That's cool, Matthew. I'd be pleased to hear. Maybe we should do something on this sort of genre when it comes out.
Something maybe about the history of these types of RPGs. Going back to original Baldur's Gate might be a...
Light the peel signal.
The Lord of the Rings style, the kind of like peel torches. From here to Sheffield. You know what I mean?
We like the one in Bath and it reaches him by the end of the week. Yeah.
You can play some amazing music. I used to tell people that was my favorite scene in the trilogy because I found it genuinely moving when that music is playing. But I don't know if that's a wanky take or not.
I think that plenty of people have enjoyed that scene over the years.
It's just not a fire lighting, but you're like, this is so cool.
Yeah, it was good. It's also, I guess it's probably alluded to in the book, but it's not like the book can convey that. That's a very like a thing you can only do in a film really, isn't it?
It's that particular moment, that combination of sound and images. So yeah, a great scene in a Lord of the Rings film, but back to the podcast. Something on CRPGs at some point, sure.
Why not? Let's just pen that in. Jeremy, drop us a line.
We'll give you 80 quid or whatever. It'll be fine. Cool.
Next up then, Matthew, my number four, Space Marine 2. So I have been dancing around this a little bit in recent months because I did almost pick Space Marine for the Xbox 360 draft, which I won, but I won't rub it in your face, we both had a great list, shake hands, et cetera, et cetera. But I also did mention this in my favorite 7 out of 10s episode that we did on Patreon too.
So I was a huge fan of this when it came out. It was a relic made, proper action game made for consoles and PC that combined shooting and melee combat. And even though it was made with, you know, these are like the dying days of THQ level budget, it was really, really good for what it was.
It put enough of the 40k universe on screen to make it feel like you were there, make it feel exciting, started with orcs and then dropped some chaos lads in halfway through as well as a kind of like a twist sort of second race to deal with. And you also had these, you had like the chainsword, like an iconic sort of ultramarine weapon and yeah, like Mark Strong voicing the main character. It was just sort of spot on as a take on that universe.
It's something I felt like I always wanted to see in Space Marine finally did it. And so that game, you know, all these years later has enough of a reputation to, you know, Saber Interactive, who are, I think like they're now owned by Embrace a Group there. And they're like properly staffed up and making quite a lot of stuff there.
They're making this quite big budget looking sequel where you are fighting Tyranids, who play as the same character from the first game. I don't remember his name. Is it Titus?
Something like that. I think it is. He's not voiced by Mark Strong this time, but you know, it sounded pretty good in the trailer, but has like, it feels like a lot more money has gone into the environments and stuff.
So it's got that going on and it has a three player co-op campaign, which the original didn't have anything like that. So the idea of sharing this with someone is quite exciting to me. This is the kind of like, the kind of 40k game that really speaks to me.
So quite excited about this. This is a big, for people who listen to the podcast, it's a big me and Andrew game. We talked about this game.
We talk about this game every time we meet each other, basically. Big fans of it, the original one. So Space Marine 2, out later this year, apparently.
And I imagine, much like Space Marine, the original, it will have some kind of second faction who turn up halfway through for you to fight as a kind of like twist. So that's going to be good. But yeah, gory finishes.
Yeah, like really nice environments. Just looks like it scratches the 40KH to me, Matthew. Any thoughts on this?
You're not really a Warhammer guy.
Not at all. But listen, I'll absorb some of your enthusiasm by osmosis and keep an eye out for it.
OK, great. That's I feel reassured and comforted by that statement. What's the number three?
My number three is Clockwork Revolution.
That's my number three too. Let's go, BioShock Infinite 2.
Well, is it? I don't know if it's going to have a BioShock budget.
Oh, well, I don't know. I thought it was a very, very convincing showing. And I don't know.
Did you think it looked low budget? I didn't think it did.
I don't know. It's not that it looked low budget. Just why not?
Like, maybe it's the in exile of it. You know, like, I really like their games and that the games they've made have been you know, like The Wasteland, sequels, really good games, but of a certain level. Now, maybe they've, like, unlocked something, you know, some crazy budgets now that they're part of Xbox.
Like, definitely when they talked about it on the Xbox Wire blog, which, side shout out to our friend Scribs, has some excellent write ups that went up after the show, courtesy of him and his team. They talked about it being their first, sort of, AAA effort, a first person action RPG. But all that aside, and I don't want to get bogged down in that, because the art design's really fucking cool and that sort of counts, it's just the...
I just really like the concept of, like, a... It sounds like it's sort of doing what... It's sort of doing for real what BioShock Infinite did in a very scripted way, in that it's about, sort of, time travel and meddling with the past to change the future, except in a much more open way, in that you're going to be able to, like, move between to and from the past and the present and see the direct consequences of what you change in the past, and you'll be doing...
Like, that is its central mechanic rather than a single story beat, as it was in Infinite, I think is my take.
Yeah, I think that's fair. Like, the time sort of manipulation element was a really cool twist in that trailer. And also, even though the presentation was superficially BioShock-y, they said it's like an RPG, you create a character and that sort of stuff.
So I think it will have a lot of the hallmarks. But my other sort of thought on this is, no one's really going to go back to this kind of art style in a game, I don't think, to even approach the level of lavishness that BioShock Infinite had. So to even knock on the door of that to me is quite exciting because it's otherwise just left there, right?
It's a bit of a, people don't know how they feel about it kind of game and it seems like it's ripe for exploration to push it a bit further or do something different. So I agree with you, some of the ideas of Infinite but done in an unscripted way kind of cool and some kind of hint to that cause and effect, Matthew, which could end up yielding some quite interesting experiences. So yeah, this is definitely up there for me.
I thought it was BioShock but I wasn't even remotely bothered that it looked like Infinite. So I think there's quite a lot of discussion about this online. How did you feel about those basic sort of similarities?
Yeah, I think it's being worked on by people who worked on that Arcanum, which was a kind of like isometric kind of steampunky world. So I imagine they'd say that they're pulling from like their own sort of steampunk interests that they'd explored before BioShock. I mean, whatever it does look like, it looks cool and that's all I really care about.
Yeah, an unexpected highlight. This completely floored me because I really did think this was the new BioShock for about 25 seconds and then it started to dawn on me because I was thinking, oh, maybe this is the ultimate zag for the new BioShock Infinite is they just went back to Columbia. It seems so unlikely, but let's go and then know it's a completely different thing.
Yeah, quite shocking, but cool. What's your number two, Matthew?
My number two is actually Fable, which we talked about earlier. I know there's a lot of debate about it. Well, it's not a debate, people saying like, well, this doesn't really show us anything about it.
Crucially, I think it does show the tone and the direction they're going in the story, which for me is just a big relief that it's not exactly the direction I thought it was going in. There's been a lot of rumours that it was going to go like earlier in the sort of Fable timeline rather than being a kind of continuation of 2 and 3, which were kind of wrestling with the idea of like a fantasy world kind of becoming industrialised and what happens sort of post-fairy tale. So the pitch of like, this is going to be more of a sort of fairy tale world and kind of like how it deals with that.
And I wondered like, is that going to be like a lot more kind of twee, like magical and twee? Is it going to be more traditional fantasy? There's a lot of kind of potential potholes for this series kind of going into that territory.
But I actually think the direction they've gone in of like, you know, this quite knowing, you know, it's a literal like Jack and the Beanstalk style kind of parody, you know, shows, you know, it's engaging directly with like literal fairy tale. That's kind of interesting. The kind of celeb casting of Richard Ayoade, whether that's for the trailer or in the final game, I don't know.
That's, you know, the right kind of tone, the kind of person you would sort of expect to be in it. Yeah, I don't know. It just I just I found it very charming, very likeable.
And it made me feel huge relief without really showing me anything about the game. Though you do see her doing like a bit of sword fighting and showing a fireball, which I think is kind of what they're aiming for. That didn't look just like a cut scene, for want of a better word.
Yeah, I sort of I thought the tone of it seemed sort of spot on. It had a chicken being kicked, you know, as you expect from Fable. Yeah, it looked it looked like Fable.
And I suppose that's like, you know, the most praise you can give it. Richard Ayoado sort of person you'd expect to see in a Fable game as well, right? So, yeah, yeah, I thought, yeah, I just I think it's like it's not disappointment, but just I guess like a kind of, oh, I just wish it was in my hands now kind of feeling with this one.
Yeah, there's definitely that, but I don't know, I just, it's the RPG sort of series that I'm like most into, you know, after Xenoblade, of course. So to see it kind of like actually manifesting, actually happening is kind of enough for me. I thought like, even though it's hard to see like what is gameplay, is there any gameplay in this trailer, the actual like scale it was suggesting of that set piece, you know, of like being in the Giants' house and it kind of like pulling you around and stuff, looked very similar to the Giants' set piece in Magnaroth.
Yeah.
Do you remember that? When you were in the Giants' kitchen.
Isn't that part of the Oxpatting sequence in that game?
Yeah, it's the good end to the Oxpatting sequence. It's like, thank you for putting up this bullshit for an hour and a half. It is actually quite a rad visual kind of boss fight.
Yeah, that's kind of interesting. I wonder if it's going to be a little bit more scripted, a little bit more... Maybe it is going to be a little bit more God of War style action RPG rather than RPG.
Fable has never been a game which has lent fully into anything really. It's always been a quite light version of whatever it's tried to be. So, yeah, like quite shiny looking.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. If it looks anything like that, then that's, you know, and it seems reasonable that it might, then that's good. I'd love to like have a go on whatever this, whatever playable form this is.
Like I'd love to, if it's like the Richard Ayoade tech demo, I'd love to just have a go on that basically. Just give me 25 minutes for that and see, let me take some capture. I better have a great time.
Everyone lining up to take a pop at Ayoade.
Yeah, exactly. So yeah, yeah, good to see. I think it was about time that they just had to acknowledge Fable in some way.
It couldn't be another year.
No, I don't think so.
I would have worried then.
Yeah, because then you're looking at four years since they announced it, right? And fair enough, the first one, the first announcement was like, was much probably a recruitment ad as it was about, well, because there'd already been that rumor as well, they were making it, they just had to get it out there. But yeah, now it's about time.
I'm thinking it should probably come out in 2025, this, right? It shouldn't be more than two years away, really, at this point. So yeah, let's wait and see.
My number two, Matthew, is Metaphor Rifantazio.
That's my number one.
Oh, really? Awesome. Then yeah, that's good stuff.
So a new fantasy RPG, a completely new universe from the makers of Persona that asked the question, what if our world was their utopia? And then cut to this very stylish, anime-infused fantasy universe that sort of looked, you know, it did very much look like all of the, you know, basically the big wigs of Persona making their version of what a high fantasy world looks like. That's essentially how best to describe it, including the, you know, the cool-looking teenage character designs and rad-looking menus and all this sort of stuff.
I suppose it was, the reason I put this so high, and I'm sure it's the same for you, Matthew, is a combination of there was actual gameplay in this. Like, they went out and they showed, here's what it looks like. It was completely unexpected that this would be in the Xbox conference because this was one of those MIA, people knew it existed games.
It was mentioned in that Archipel documentary about the Persona team where they followed them. I think the artist, one of the main devs, they followed around for like a little while and they showed some illustrations. For it to turn up in the Xbox conference as they did was pretty incredible, I thought.
And then everything they showed was in-game. So yeah, really impressive. Is that how you felt about it, Matthew?
Yeah, basically it was the surprise of the thing, the quality of the thing. It's something I want to happen. I like this team, I like their vibe.
I thought for a second, I was like, is this the next Shin Megami Tensei game? Because there's arguably some... That game is a bit more flexible in terms of like, it can be a bit more fantastic if it wants to.
Like, that game has stepped into like, slightly more fantasy looking realms before. But yeah, this is just... This would have been like a great in the room reveal at a conference, you know?
Because all the dweebs who are really into it go nuts. It's got real pedigree behind it. It did look great.
I've watched the trailer several times, but I can't really pass a lot of what's actually happening in it, you know, on a nuts and bolts level. You know, I couldn't read... I think the combat system is going to be sort of a variational sort of Persona's combat system.
But, yeah, I really like the energy of this team. They just make incredibly cool games. I'm just really, really into their vibe.
Yeah, this is good. Good thing. And also, I think it helped in a way that, like, their other two Persona games leaked before the show.
Yeah.
So almost to the point where you're like, was that on purpose? To make you think there's nothing... Like, we've seen everything Atlus have.
Right.
I don't know. Because that's what I thought. I thought, oh, here's the two Atlus things.
Yeah, tick, tick. And then this, you're like, oh, wait a second. What's this?
So it's speculating as a PR. I wouldn't completely rule it out. Because this stuff leaked ages ago.
Well, actually, like a few weeks ago, I should say, because of, like, a URL that was doing the rounds. So there was a Persona 3. Is it reloaded?
I think it's cool. Something like that. Persona 3, yeah.
And then also the P5T was a thing going around and people were like, oh, is that some kind of tactics game? So that stuff did come out. I don't think they orchestrated the overall leak, but I did wonder if the Instagram leak was maybe on purpose, because it's, you know, to get it wrong by two days seems very unlikely.
And also, like, you accidentally leak two, but not the big one, you know?
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
You'd think the fuck up that allowed them to leak two there, and we're getting into conspiracy theories here. I was, a tiny voice in the back of my head went, is this legit?
Yeah, yeah. So that's interesting. It is a conspiracy theory, but I want to go along with it.
I want it to be a narrative. Like, we threw them off and they did not see this coming, and no one saw this coming, which is why it absolutely ascended as the real highlight. I suppose it was also that excitement, Matthew, of the fact that there is so much persona being made now that the fact that this was a once-in-every, sort of like almost 10 years kind of franchise, it's now, even if you're not exactly getting Persona 6, you're getting something that its best minds, the best minds of Persona are making.
So that is basically the same to me, at least, you know? So, yeah, exciting stuff. Okay, my number one then, Matthew, is Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
So, really obvious here. This was the last reveal at Summer Jeff Fest. It was a really great trailer.
Basically, the Final Fantasy VII remake, the whole thing with it, it was a set entirely within Midgar. So even though the combat system was this really sophisticated mix of what... I suppose, like, what the original VII combat was combined with FF13, I would say, in terms of the...
and then also being this kind of, like, real-time combat system too. It was sort of like a... I guess like a little bit of 50, a little bit of 7, a little bit of 13.
That's kind of what the combat system was. But the overall world you're in was quite narrow, you know? This trailer basically promises we've built this world map for you.
Like, the thing with FF7 in the original game is you leave Midgar and you have this continent to explore, and then when you get transport to reach more continents, and there's this whole world that opens up. This is the world opening up sequel, it feels like. So you have lots of, you know, big, sort of, like, verdant scenery and then recognizable locations like the Dune and Canon.
So you can see little bits of the, you know, the original game settings sort of popping up in there. It's hard to get an idea from this, what sort of, like, how much the story or world they're going to try and fit in there, but it feels like the building of big, gigantic world to explore is the key thing here, and that's the difference between it maybe being on PS5 and not PS4 this time, you know? So really promising.
You had a really funny tweet, Matthew, about watching this in the office, and then someone saying, Are you watching Bougainhagen? And you've been like...
Loads of people were like, Is that Bougainhagen? Is that Bougainhagen? And I was like, What the fuck's a Bougainhagen?
I thought that was a village.
Yeah, so...
I had to sheepishly ask my brother later when I was walking home. I was like, Alex, what's a Bougainhagen? When he's at home.
And he was like, Oh, that's that little guy. He said, I thought... He said, It's a little guy who I didn't think had legs.
So whether or not that's true.
That sounds like a take you would have, I would say. That sounds fully plausible. So yeah, Bougainhagen.
Yeah, he was very much in there. He's in the mix. And yeah, so otherwise looks pretty similar.
I think that's the good thing. It feels like they already have the combat system set so they can add more playable characters like Red 13 and probably a few more they haven't revealed yet. But also, you know, they could just go build content for this thing that they think they've already built the shell for, essentially.
So I was very excited by it, Matthew, and I thought it was a strong showing. And it seemed to get the internet excited. There wasn't much cynicism for this one out there.
I am amazed they did this trailer just before FF16 is coming out.
Yeah, it made me wonder, is there some kind of thinking behind it? we want to try and get the franchise front of mind and remind people that it's a huge deal still. But then I don't know, really.
It is quite unusual for that sort of thing to happen. Yeah, I do agree with you.
Yeah, I'm really interested, actually, seeing people react today to play in the FF16 demo. How people are going to think this does stack up to Final Fantasy VII Remake, because they're both kind of doing similar things in terms of being a bit more like action forward. And whether people find one combat system more sophisticated over the other, and whether there's a bit of a hedge in their bets going on by showing this now.
I don't know. I find it very curious, these two rival... I would say, are they rival games, or do they not see it that way?
I don't see it that way. It feels like they're some of the only third party games that exist now where they have that Sony first party level of budget behind them. They're just massive blockbusters.
It's pretty amazing they can mount them at the same time. They feel like they run in parallel, so you're not waiting basically four or five years to get a new Final Fantasy game. Yeah, yeah.
They must be so confident. It's like putting out that big demo. It's like a two-hour demo.
Yeah, it also carries your save progress over, right? So they're probably just trying to get you hooked.
To let people just play the first two hours of your game, that's confidence in like, you're going to like this and what follows.
Yeah, I hope so. So hopefully it's good. It actually didn't occur to me until the last week or so where I was like, oh yeah, this really is like a third-person action game.
That's what I'm going to be doing for 40 hours is, you know, combat through a kind of like Capcom lens, essentially. And also it's kind of transpired today that Platinum Games has contributed to it in some form. Matthew, you would expect the combat consulting on that a little bit, maybe.
And also the Kingdom Hearts team, which I know you're very excited about. Yeah, my guy Goofy making a cameo, maybe. I don't know.
It's like, we came in and we basically took the Kahiran story and made it just total bullshit. And you're like, thanks for that. Yeah, we're like bullshit experts.
We're here to ruin your story.
That's good. And that's why there'll never be a Kingdom Hearts episode of this podcast. Well, that and all the other reasons.
So, yeah. Okay, that was my last one. Gawrish.
Gawrish. I hope they got insurance. Yeah.
So I've got some quick honorable mentions here. Matthew, do you have any too?
I don't have any honorable mentions. I like just those 10 things.
Fair enough. You've been at work all day and I've just been sat on my ass. So it's completely fair.
Are you off this week?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm off. I took the week off.
Just tired. I woke up feeling like Robocop after the intro to that film. My body is just completely wiped.
I was going to say, what a fucking rad robot.
Without the robot armor though, just the bits of Peter Weller that are left at the end of that.
His face and his hand.
Yeah, that's essentially all that's left after the last few weeks. So honorable mentions. Alan Wake, like I say, I think I slightly prefer the story trailer to the gameplay footage they showed.
So the story that preceded this at the PS5 event. Still wakes the deep. Curious about this, Matthew, from the Chinese room.
Yeah, North Sea oil rig horror game. And yep, I definitely looking forward to that one. So like I couldn't quite get a grasp of what it was completely from the trailer.
It's sort of like a spooky something and then a cool setting. But I was like, well, you know, this studio's made games. I like I'll totally play this.
There was more of an aggressive presence than like in Rapture.
So yeah, for sure. And I'm curious to see what that presence is. So imagine there'll be more about that game going around very soon.
So that aside, I was kind of curious about Aternites, the action and dating game that was at Day of the Dead. Well, I definitely wasn't going to put it in the list, but I was a bit like quite interesting to have a game that looks sort of like a bit Persona-y, but then is an action game. And then also as you...
Well, that's the thing. It looked like a lot of Persona fans had tried to make something that's like, I don't know.
I don't want to get back.
I don't want to get back.
I did think it was like, it was kind of novel. It sort of stood out, I think, amongst that crowd. But yeah, I couldn't put it in my top 10 list for that very reaction.
This is not a horny podcast.
Definitely not, especially not for like underage teenage characters. So yes, Dungeons of Hinterburg, Matthew. Do you think that would be cool?
Oh, I almost picked that actually.
Yeah, that was in the Xbox conference. That's like a game from the studio Micro Birds, I think. But it sort of was again, maybe probably the most comparable to something like Cocoon, some kind of like actiony platformer-y parsley thing, you know, with nice graphics.
It looked a little bit like Sable.
Yeah, there's a bit of that to it too, for sure.
That sort of texture to it, but the colors were mad and it seemed to be like changing kind of like form. There seemed to be lots of different sort of genre things going on in it. I didn't include it just because I'm rewatching and trying to read about it.
I couldn't quite pass like what the game was.
Yeah.
Like 100 percent just that it had good vibes.
Yeah, Sable is definitely the comparison point here. Yeah, it has like some kind of skateboarding element, a lot of story as well. It looked quite big budget, I thought.
It was deceptive, I think, at first. I thought it was maybe a much smaller thing than it was. So yeah, that's it, though, Matthew.
Those are my honorable mentions.
I quite like that one about the person climbing a big weird mountain.
Oh yeah, was it like just something? Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
That's it. Yeah. Okay, cool.
Well, we've emptied out our hype bucket. That's it done now for another year. Back to some old bullshit.
I got such a sheen on.
Yeah, same, man. It's tough in here. It's not good.
I'm excited to open my window almost immediately. Also, I just read an absolutely scathing one-star review of our podcast on Apple Podcasts. Oh, shit.
It pins it entirely on my laugh, Matthew. It says... I'm going to read it out, actually.
This is from Steven779988. Incredibly annoying laugh ruins show, which is a great headline for a review. I loved PC Zone growing up, and on paper, this should be the most incredible podcast.
However, one of the hosts' really annoying, obnoxiously loud screech of a laugh makes it impossible to listen to. It's both irritating and deafening. One star.
One star.
Yeah, I don't take it personally, but I was there thinking, okay, fair enough. I do have an annoying laugh, right? And maybe I need to have better audio engineering skills to phase out that laugh, or maybe we can ask Chat Cheapie T to phase out my laugh or something.
But I was there thinking, one star is harsh. I would take two stars off for the laugh. I'd still at least give it three for the content.
Overwhelming laugh. Oh, that's ridiculous.
It's a laugh. Someone told me I need to affect some kind of Jimmy Carr-style laugh that's less high-pitched. I'm not sure that's on the cards, to be honest.
I don't really know what to do about it. I haven't got time to go to fucking audio editing school or whatever.
I drop the volume on your laughs.
Maybe that's it. Maybe I just need to do more of that myself. I don't know.
I drop the volume on my laughs too.
Fair enough. That was it. We just got to bookend the show with a bit of negativity there.
I hope you enjoyed that. With that hilarious note, the podcast comes to an end. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
At MrBazzle on the school pesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts and Matthew still has time to catch the Capcom stream. Good for him.
Bye.
