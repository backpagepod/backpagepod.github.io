Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how was your excursion to see old-ass Indiana Jones?
It made me cry like a big fucking baby.
That's embarrassing. I mean, it's actually quite sweet, but what was the deal?
It was the end of the film, which I won't spoil, and in classic Castle fashion, a musical cue from an older film that just made me feel very sort of nostalgic, and it was hilarious because it follows one of the biggest parts of bullshit, not the whole film, but the end of that film is fucking ridiculous, and then somehow managed to pull me back in, him sticking his hand under the door to grab the hat kind of moment, except for sort of emotional catharsis. It was good.
Yep, the power of a John Williams music cue, so yeah, pleased to hear that. Powered you through. No blockbuster in recent histories made me think about my immortality more than that film, so that was good.
So this episode, our guest this week is PC Gamer's senior editor, Wes Fenlon, a former colleague of mine and only our second US guest on the podcast. Wes, how's it going?
Hello, going well, Sam. I'm now thinking about my own mortality since we've worked together starting nine years ago, nine and a half years ago at this point.
Yeah, we met at GDC 2014 for a sort of kind of creative conference for the PC Gamer brand, and that was the first time I met you. And so yeah, you have not aged at all in that time. I have aged horribly.
So that's the difference between you and I, basically.
Tell that to the white hairs on my chin, Sam. I don't know if they agree with you.
My white hairs are everywhere, my friend. That's probably the most cursing I've said on this podcast. So Wes, how are things going on your side?
How's PC Gamer these days?
You know, PC Gamer is really good. I think probably every website has kind of dealt with the last couple of years of a strange media landscape. You know, there was a real boom during COVID while everybody was just sitting at home with nothing to do except go on the internet.
And then there was kind of a lull after that. We had Elden Ring come out, which, you know, more people read about on our website than probably any video game of the last decade. And then it kind of felt like there was nothing after that for like a year.
Like it just sucked all the energy out of the room, you know? So there's been some interesting times of like trying to figure out what people wanna know about. So there's been some hustling, you know, but that's actually been kind of exciting to sometimes do a little bit less long-term thinking and a little bit more just like going out there and trying to find cool stuff to talk about that week.
Battle bit remastered, for example, which a friend of mine told me is too Gen Z for me to enjoy. And I was like, okay, fine, I'll stay well away. I appreciate that.
Yeah, it's like a battlefield game made by two people or something, like a tiny dev team, but it still has the huge, you know, 100 player sandbox or whatever. Yeah, like that's the kind of stuff that just pops up on PC every once in a while, and you're just like, oh shit, where did this come from? Okay, like this is the next big thing now.
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, it's great to have you, Wes. And in this episode, we're gonna talk to you about your career and then switch focus in section two to talk about Nintendo in the noughties, which is one of your specialist subject and crosses over with our expertise as well, particularly Matthew.
So yeah, I know you've got a lot to say on the subject, so excited to get into it. So to kick off, Wes, what's your early history with games and what did you grow up playing?
Oh, you know, I feel like my dad owes like, I owe him a big debt to helping get me into games when I was a kid. I would sit on his lap when I was really young and play, really more watch him play some early PC games. He was always kind of a tech nerd.
So we had like a family PC, probably a bit before it was common and played some truly horrific games on those PCs back in the day. One called Montezuma's Revenge, which was just like the worst pitfall or Mario Bros. like platformer kind of knockoff.
You can imagine just a terrible game or at least it was terrible on our PC. Maybe it was good on a Amiga or something. Some cool helicopter game we would play with a joystick.
But really like I started getting into shareware games by myself a few years later in like the mid 90s. And like I somehow completely missed Doom. I don't think I was really even aware of Doom, but I loved Wolfenstein 3D and I played a ton of the the shareware version of that, which was the first handful of levels of that game.
Didn't know until much later that there were actually like 50 or 100 more levels of Wolfenstein 3D. I just thought I had played the whole game because I didn't understand shareware.
Is Montezuma's Revenge some kind of euphemism, slightly racist euphemism perhaps for like some kind of illness you get in Mexico from drinking the water or eating the food or something? Is that what that phrase means in your life?
That is 100% what that phrase means. I don't know if it's a dysentery situation exactly, but yeah, it's some sort of like you have been bacterially poisoned by water you should not have been drinking and you're probably gonna die. But they turned it into a video game about exploring like ancient Aztec caverns or something.
I don't really remember. I remember there were keys and there were little skulls that would kind of wobble across the screen and roll into you. Not like one of the great platformers, I would say.
I don't think you'd name a game after that these days, but you know, it's certainly an interesting time capsule. What about from there, Wes? Were you always on the kind of like PC gaming track or did Nintendo figure into you growing up as well?
You know, it was mostly PC for me, especially early on. I really loved the LucasArts games and like Commander Keen. But again, there was mostly stuff I was just playing like demos or shareware versions of.
I owned like a few PC games. I was really into Warcraft II and Command and Conquer, which you and I have in common, Sam. But consoles were always sort of this like mystical thing that I didn't quite understand, but was as any kid would be like really attracted to.
My parents didn't want to buy me one, you know, they preferred I go play outside, I guess. I don't really know why the PC was considered separate from that. Like, did you guys have that experience too, that because it was a multipurpose device, it wasn't like, I don't know, forbidden in the way that a game system could be?
When we got our first PC, our parents were actually very protective of it. Like us not fucking up with games. They had this like fear that games would somehow like mess it up or we'd put loads of viruses or things.
Like they didn't understand the PC. We didn't really understand the PC. So it was actually quite, it was very much for like work first.
Though we had a few like, you know, point and click games on it and things, but.
It probably also costs like 2000 pounds, right?
Right, yeah.
So a good reason to be protective.
I had a similar sort of experience, I guess. Like my parents sort of, they definitely saw the PC as more multi-utility, but I've heard that as a fairly common sort of like reasoning for people. They just, for some reason, games on PC were not, I guess like Doom was demonized, but the actual idea of using a PC was seen as something new and exciting in the 90s and not necessarily vilified, whereas games consoles kind of always were.
But yeah, I think that my dad, though, definitely got to the point where, similar to Matthew's parents, my dad blamed all of the PC Gamer demos I installed on our PC for it no longer working properly. And that was a great moment.
My friend Craig, he had an Amiga and he had a Captain Planet game. And, I don't know what you'd call it. Our own personal urban legend was that his dad broke Captain Planet by not understanding the Amiga, by like hammering a button during load up.
And it meant one of the Planeteers could never be accessed in the game ever again.
He was just permanently fused into Captain Planet's ass or something.
You could play the gate levels in any order, but one of them was you could never load it up. And for some reason, we pinned this on his dad having pressed the key when it was loading up one time. So, it goes both ways, the kind of apocryphal stories.
Yeah. So, I guess I'd ask you a question, Wes. No, but we had some good stories anyway.
My gateway into console games was I had a family friend, basically an honorary aunt, who, for my birthday one year, I don't remember how old I was, probably like six or seven, eight, went to the local, probably blockbuster, which was still around, and rented a Sega Genesis or Mega Drive, sorry, here to respect your culture today. You used to be able to rent game consoles at movie stores, at least in the US. I don't know if that was common in the UK.
She rented it for me for my birthday, and I got to keep it for like three days or something. And the only game we rented with it was Sonic the Hedgehog. And I just played probably the first three levels of Sonic the Hedgehog multiple times, because that game was pretty hard when you were seven years old and did not own the console.
And I just, I loved it so much that she did it for me for my birthday, like every year after that, for several years. Oh, wow. And one year, they didn't have the Mega Drive anymore, but they did have the Saturn.
So I got to rent that along with, I think, X-Men, Children of the Atom, and maybe like Clockwork Knight or Knights. I don't remember. I don't know if you guys remember that game.
Again, not a great all-timer platformer. And eventually, well into the life of the Nintendo 64, I had an older cousin hand me down his Mega Drive. Like he had GoldenEye.
He was like, I don't need this old system anymore. So he gave me that in like probably 97, 98 or something. And I just went on a spree of going to game stores and like buying up old used Genesis games, which were quite cheap by that point.
My parents were 100% right in not wanting to buy me one of these because I had the console fever at that point. And within a few years, I would have an N64 and then a GameCube and then an Xbox and then a PS2.
Yeah, that's cool. So yeah, it was kind of inevitable. I like the several years there that you had the kind of like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory experience of one chocolate bar a year.
You enjoy that. And then the concept of games goes away for another year.
That's a... It's like a fairy tale. You turn into a man for three days a year.
Every year when the clock strikes 12.
Yeah, otherwise I'd have to go over to friends' places to play their consoles. And to this day, I am really bad at the 2D Mario games. I probably used 300 lives, 500 lives going through Super Mario World on the Wii Virtual Console when I finally played through it properly because I was so bad at it.
Just getting killed by goombas left and right, it was embarrassing. It's like I didn't learn the language of it young enough and it's like trying to learn Spanish or Japanese or something as an adult. I just like study it for a few weeks and then give up because I'm just completely hopeless.
Yeah, it's a pretty common experience. At least there's a rewind on the Nintendo Switch Online version so you can just pretend that you're good even when you're not. So that's good.
Wes, what about games media at that time? Did you pay much attention to magazines or websites while you were growing up? What did that landscape look like in the US from your perspective in the 90s and then the noughties?
I was kind of a, I guess kind of a late comer to this stuff. It was really my interest in the lead up to the GameCube that had me go out and discover that there were actually magazines that people made about video games, which was pretty cool. And there were all these websites about video games.
Really like the gateway one for me. And I actually have it on my desk right now because I went back to my dad's house a couple years ago and found a bunch of my old mags in storage. Was an issue of Next Generation magazine from August 2021.
Specifically the Life Cycle 2 Volume 3 Number 8 issue of Next Gen, which was like a couple months before the GameCube came out. Has a picture of Mario on the cover looking really pissed at Luigi who is playing a GameCube with a big GameCube controller. I don't know if this is officially like Nintendo sanctioned art.
It doesn't really seem like it. They're a little off model, but yeah. This one, I was just so ravenous for information about the GameCube.
I had definitely converted from a Sonic kid to a Nintendo kid with the N64. I played so much GoldenEye and I was so excited for the GameCube. And this magazine, I think I just saw at the local grocery store or Walmart and saw Mario and Luigi, saw the word GameCube, specifically the word GameCube exposed is like the cover line on this.
And I was like, I must have this. But it was the only issue of Next Gen I ever bought because the magazine died like within six months of this. And I think it was the last one that my local store carried for some reason.
That's because Nintendo probably sued them into the ground for these dodgy Luigi and Mario renders. I've looked it up on Google. They are not official.
Luigi has like guns. It's really unnerving.
It's quite a time capsule, plus the latest on Sid Meier, SimGolf and Star Wars Obi-Wan. So yeah, very great little time capsule of 2001 there. I'm kind of curious from there then, like, how do you combine, I guess, your passion for games media with your, you know, passion for games into a career?
So what, when did you know you want to write about Games for a Living?
I would say when I was like 15 or 16. I had been subscribing to Electronic Gaming Monthly and Nintendo Power for a couple years. Basically, as soon as the GameCube came out, that was my, like, that was my awakening moment.
And I subscribed to both of those magazines. But EGM, like, I was like, I need to subscribe to this, this magazine. And then I subscribed to Nintendo Power, probably pretty soon after that.
They always had really cool, like, subscriber gifts or bonuses where you could get, like, a soundtrack from a game. I think the one I might have chosen the first time I subscribed was the official CD soundtrack for Donkey Kong 64. Because at the age of 13, for some reason, I, like, needed to have the DK rap on a CD.
Like, that's where my mind was at this point.
Yeah, that's pretty cool. I mean, it's not, but, you know, I can see why at the time it would have seemed pretty cool. So, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, it did have a curse word in it, Sam. So it was pretty grown up.
Yeah, I've had an issue of EGM around this time, too. I think I had the GameCube cover they did, actually, because they would ship it to UK newsagents. You could spend a little bit extra and get it.
First of all, I was shocked by how many ads there were inside, compared to UK mags. There's so many ads, because I know that's the economics of how US mags work, is that they're ad supporters, so the subscriptions can be super low in price, basically. But yeah, I think I had that GameCube issue that has loads of the characters.
Basically, I think it's Smash Bros. renders around the rim of the GameCube, basically. And yeah, it did seem like...
That moment was huge, and it was interesting to get the US perspective on Xbox, GameCube, kicking off at the same time.
Yeah, there was a lot of console wars stuff at the time, which... I don't know, maybe Matthew and I both might have partaken in back then. I don't want to speak for you, Matthew, but I certainly did as a newly minted Nintendo fan.
I would never badmouth the other consoles, but I did live in such a Nintendo bubble that it has frustrated Samuel in some of these episodes where I claimed that Xbox didn't sell a single machine in the UK. Because I didn't personally know anyone who had one. So I have a very skewed vision of this period of time, which doesn't align with anyone else's.
Well, I think there was a lot of skepticism towards Microsoft when the Xbox first launched. And that wasn't just here. I think that people were just like, you know, PC had maybe a slightly fussier image at the time.
And so there was a question of what they actually bringing to the medium that they didn't have before. But then I think EGM were one of the first, like the big proponents of Halo as a huge deal. I felt like they wrote about Halo loads and the issues that I've read of theirs.
So, yeah, sort of like, yeah, it seemed like a huge deal from the off because of that one game, really. Whereas from the US side, how do you think games media has differed from UK games media? The Internet used to feel a little bit more local.
So in the noughties, I know that sites like OneUp was a huge deal. I know GamePro was a magazine and a website. There was Ugo and GameSpy.
Do you think that variety created better games journalism generally in the US?
Surely not. If you go back and read any of the magazines or game reviews from that time, I feel like they're almost universally pretty bad. Just not great writing at a technical level, often very surface level criticism of the games.
But in terms of the regionality of it, it feels almost embarrassing to say, but I feel like I was barely aware of what was US or UK or European writing about games. It was probably because I wasn't reading any UK or European writing about games. I don't remember when I became aware of Eurogamer, but it was, I have to imagine, many years after I was reading sites like IGN and GameSpot, I was probably going on fan sites that were made in the UK, but it was just not something that I was even aware of.
So it feels like a big blind spot to me who the significant voices were in the UK media in the early 2000s, and especially in the late 90s when the internet era was just beginning.
Yeah, I think it's interesting because when I think about this period, I know I mostly asked you about websites there, but I think that to be honest, I don't think I really paid attention to websites until I was working in games media and then it suddenly dawned on me what a big deal they were compared to magazines. I think the kind of watershed moment for me was seeing how many comments Eurogamer's 8 out of 10 Metal Gear Solid 4 review got and realizing how at the center of the conversation they were in a way that I just simply wasn't working on a single format PlayStation magazine. That was just a bit of a dawning to me of just, oh, this is what reality is now.
It really is moving towards websites. So yeah, that's kind of a... Matthew, I don't know if you felt that as well.
Outside of Eurogamer, there's no one site that felt particularly British in any way. I associated UK games media with magazines and probably more like the forums scene, which kind of grew out of like fandoms for individual mags. And I know that some of the people we've had on the podcast before kind of came up through that forum scene as well.
So it's definitely a big thing for them. But I just assumed all the sites were just American.
Yeah, it's true. But I suppose one thing I did also notice though, Wes, is that, and I know you covered this actually on PC Gamer, but there was a podcast scene that exploded in the mid to late noughties in the US that simply was not replicated on the UK side and arguably still isn't. And there aren't that many UK games podcasts, but I feel like in the US you just had this massive scene of it driven largely by, I guess, like OneUp and those kinds of outlets.
Yeah, OneUp was definitely the big one. Going back to your initial question here, naming all these different sites, you had the Game Pros and the Game Spies and YouGo all competing with each other in addition to, of course, IGN GameSpot, I wonder if that crowding was kind of what partially led to the more personality driven approach that OneUp found its way to and that really has become the dominant form of games media and kind of all media, I guess, at this point. Maybe they really found they needed to distinguish themselves because there was that early period for websites where just getting news on the internet very quickly was extremely novel.
I remember Jeff Gershman talking about on probably on a giant bombcast about how they could put up screenshots for a video game that a publisher sent them and that would do insane traffic for GameSpot like, you know, that was zero effort on their part, no work involved because nobody else was getting those screenshots. There were only a few big websites. They had, you know, the domain authority.
People were coming to GameSpot to see screenshots and by the time OneUp was really kicking off, screenshots weren't necessarily going to cut it anymore for getting people to come to your website. And so I think they realized like, well, shit, we have 50 amazing people here who work on a bunch of different magazines. We've got like every kind of interest covered here.
We've got Xbox, we've got Nintendo, we've got all these different specialists. Like let's do this podcast thing. Let's put them on video.
Let's make these people, you know, the star of the show. And it absolutely worked for them. They were just kind of ahead of the technology curve and they weren't able to monetize it in a way that kept OneUp alive.
Which is a real shame because I do think that, you know, going all the way back to EGM as well, that magazine was really good at surfacing the different personalities of their writers because even I knew just from reading probably like four or five issues over the course of a couple of years who like, is it a Dan Hsu was, you know, the, yeah, like, it's like a presence in the magazine and like someone who had a perspective on games. And then, yeah, you definitely saw that kind of filter down to OneUp and the sort of like owning little bits of the website, having your own sort of area of the website to talk about your stuff, nature of that, which I thought was really, really cool at the time. So that's why I asked about it just because I think that that scene has just changed so much now, and the UK and US games media, the lines are just so blurred because outlets just work so closely together.
They are like, much like we have on PC Gamer, some international teams. And yeah, I guess I'm not necessarily saying it's worse, but it's just different. It's a different world in a lot of ways.
So going back to how you got into games media then, which I realize I cut you off there when you start talking about EGM. You mentioned one of your notes in our document for this episode says, who's ready to talk about Final Fantasy fansite, so to what extent is that fansite element part of your journey into games media?
It is absolutely the genesis of it. I don't remember how I found this one particular site. It was called Eyes on Final Fantasy.
It's still around and they had a really active forum at the time. It was probably the second biggest Final Fantasy forum, just a lot of great people there. And that became a place that I spent most of my time, like made some friendships there that I still have in real life.
Pretty quickly after I started posting there, I don't remember if they had like an open call for people to work on the site or if I just volunteered or what. But around 2005, I started writing news posts for this fan site and just going to a site like IGN or something whenever they had news about a new Final Fantasy game or just a new like Squaresoft or Square Enix game in general. And I would just rewrite the news basically and put it up on this fan site.
And I probably wrote a couple hundred posts on the site over the next few years, you know, and that was kind of like me cutting my teeth. And I'm sure most of the writing is not particularly good, but it was just a it was good practice, you know. And from there in college, I started doing some some freelancing.
I freelanced for a site called Nintendo Wii Fanboy, which is a pretty embarrassing name in hindsight, but it was a spin off of the you know, the blog era joystick and Kotaku were both, you know, really, really big. And joystick had a couple spin offs, Nintendo Wii Fanboy. And then I don't remember what the I guess Xbox 360 Fanboy was probably the other one.
And they like re-posted some stuff from joystick proper, but then produced a bunch of their own articles. And I guess, you know, AOL was hoping to grow them into bigger brands or something, which never ended up happening. But I wrote a column about games that would be great on the Wii with like the Wii motion controls and nunchuck and stuff.
Not really the most exciting premise for a column, but I kind of just got to write about cool games. I think one of the early ones I wrote about was this game called Cosmic Smash for the Dreamcast, which has just gotten a remake on PSVR 2 now. So that's kind of cool.
I was like, I guess 15 years ahead of the curve in pitching that one.
I would not like to have played that with the Wii remote. Motion Plus maybe, but original Wii remote, that would be rough.
Yeah, yeah, I think you're in hindsight, you're probably right there.
How does that lead to you getting more sort of like full time work, Wes?
I did a bunch of freelancing, you know, I graduated college in 2010, which at least in the US was a real bad economy. I don't remember if the UK was the same, but over here, it was like kind of right after the like subprime mortgage crisis where we figured out the real estate industry was literally built on nothing, just complete bullshit. So, yeah, not a lot of great opportunities at the time.
So, I was mostly freelancing and got a great tip from someone that I was in a class with who was like, you should pitch this site, how stuff works. They'll like let you, if you can write about kind of anything as a generalist, like you can get work from them and they paid super well. And I would just write articles for them about how ATM skimmers work or like how to get the rights from your neighbor's property to like put a driveway through it or something, just like random bullshit that I would just have to research and then write an article on and like cite all my sources and I would get like 400 bucks for it, which was like great money for someone who had just graduated college and was living like rent free in a family, like my grandparents' old house that my family hadn't gotten around to selling yet.
So I kind of just like started doing some freelance here and there and then sent in an application to tested.com, which was a new tech site part of the Giant Bomb family. And I owe a tremendous debt to Will Smith for getting my application to freelance write news for Tested, which I had written in like Microsoft WordPad or whatever and saved as an RTF file. I don't know if you guys remember RTFs.
Oh, yeah, still got those. Still got a few of those kicking around.
And then copy and pasted it into the email. And when I pasted it in, it looked fine. But then when I sent it, it collapsed like all 12 paragraphs that I had written into one sentence.
So he just got the most garbled, like the worst application anyone has ever sent for a writing job in history. And instead of just immediately deleting it, which is what I absolutely would have done, he wrote back and he was like, hey, I can't read this. Can you like send it as an attachment?
And I was like, oh my God, holy shit. Like, how did this happen? Like, I'm so sorry and sent it back to him.
And they ended up hiring me as a freelancer. And I did a bunch of work for Tested for years, first doing news and then features. Eventually did more and more game stuff on the side until that clearly became like the thing that I wanted to do more than tech.
I was always amazed that you could actually write about hardware as well as write eloquently about games. Because it seemed like those things you tend to, I always thought, assume people had like one skill or the other, but you seem to have both. So yeah, pretty impressive that you had your brains in the, you know, how to build a PC, you know, kind of graphics card side of things as well.
Thank you, thank you.
So how do you end up on PC Gamer from there?
When I moved out here, I ended up meeting Evan Lottie, who is still at PC Gamer. He's been there for a very long time. He's the global EIC of PC Gamer and met Evan.
And after a few years, they were eventually hiring for another spot in the US, which was like a features editor position. And I had spent the last kind of two years or so, it tested mostly writing like a mix of news and features. I would do like a few news stories a day, and then I would do like a couple features a month that were usually fairly long, just like picking some topic I thought was interesting and probably writing too much about it in hindsight.
But that was kind of my, I was like really eager to do more of that stuff. And thanks to all the people I met moving to San Francisco, that really gave me an in for that job.
Yeah, for sure. So yeah, you've been there for now for a long time. So you've really sort of, you know, took the opportunity and ran with it really.
So one thing I really liked about how you progressed at PC Gamer is how you transitioned from a hardware role to something resembling a traditional features editor role that you might have on a magazine. I felt you worked really hard to build that space for yourself on the site. And it made the website richer as a result.
Can you talk about doing that and how you sort of did go from guy who reviews graphics cards to, you know, driving a lot of the voice of the site?
Yeah, well, thank you for the compliment, first of all. But yeah, I was, you know, I was technically the title I was hired into was Features Editor, but I was quite green at the time. I had done a good bit of writing, but not really much editing, you know, and editor is always kind of a strange title on websites.
I think often it's applied to everybody on a team, regardless of what your job is. I didn't have much experience doing, you know, commissioning other writers, giving people, you know, briefs for what they should be writing about, coming up with, you know, larger plans for like, here's a game coming out, what are all the different angles we're going to cover it from. So initially I didn't have, I wasn't doing too much of that.
And I'd only been on the team for probably eight or ten months when we made the decision to cover hardware more in depth. And I did have that tech background from working at Tested for a few years and freelancing for them. So our boss, Tim Clark, who I think has also been on The Back Page, is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
Tim came to me and was like, you know, we want to launch a hardware section on the website. And like, do you want to be in charge of it? And, you know, it paid better.
And honestly, I didn't, I don't think I really was enthusiastic about it, but it felt like one of those things where if I didn't take it on, it was kind of going to be partially my responsibility anyway. So I might as well just like get paid more for it and, you know, like have it be my actual job. So I like launched the hardware section, was in charge of that and did that for a couple years.
And like, honestly, it really burned me out. It stopped being fun pretty quickly. I think I learned that I really enjoy hardware, but it is absolutely like the passion that can be ruined by it being my full time focus, you know, like I like the tinkering aspect of it.
But when you write about games, you have so many opportunities to talk about the human element, the people who make the games, how people play with them. Like they're just, and video games have stories generally, right? There's not a lot of that in graphics cards, you know, there's not too many narratives attached to GPUs these days.
Like back in the day, they had the weird like fairy box art or whatever, but they kind of killed that, killed that off. So not a lot of personality in hardware.
The one interesting bit of hardware.
Who is that fairy and where did she come from?
Well, it's funny because I, one of the things I ended up doing when I was editor-in-chief of PC Gamer UK was when I would log in in the morning, there would be a review from Jared, one of the features editors, one of the hardware editors in the US for me to read. And Jared did write about AMD and Nvidia like it was like Game of Thrones or something. And it was like this kind of epic narrative of, you know, sort of like giants basically.
And so I became very familiar with it from that. But definitely writing those reviews is a, you know, it's not necessarily for everyone. It really does.
The specialist side of that is, yeah, you've got to have the passion, a very specific passion for it or you just can't do it. So I can see why it would burn you out, you know.
Yeah, I think I could do something with hardware full time, but not kind of within the constraints of a traditional media outlet, where there are just things that you need to cover from a certain way, you know, like you need to review a CPU or a GPU and tell people, you know, based on all the testing you've done, like is this the one you should buy or not, right? There's so much cool stuff out there in the world of PC hardware and like hobbyist stuff, like people who get super into mechanical keyboards, like there's tons of interesting avenues you can go down, but you can't do just that on a website like PC Gamer. You need to offer buying advice, you need to cover the news, and that stuff just didn't really keep me invested enough at the time, especially because we had a very small hardware team of people who were working full time.
So it just didn't quite work for me, and I was really desperate to get back to games after doing that for a couple years. And so I was able to make that transition back to more or less my old role of features editor. And I think by that time I just had had a lot more experience doing commissioning, doing kind of organizational stuff, doing planning.
And also I had like the, you know, that feeling of like when you get to make a change in your career, in your life that just feels right and you're relieved and you feel like a weight has been lifted and like you get that renewed burst of enthusiasm. Like that was how I felt at that time, right? So I think that really motivated me to just go out and commission as many cool stories about, you know, weird niche corners of PC gaming or stories about the big PC games that were coming out then.
But, you know, trying to get an interview or trying to cover some cultural aspect of it beyond just what's our review say, you know, what's the news.
I think that's what I really liked about working with you is because I was like definitely in the headspace of if I look at this year on year Black Friday graph again, I will just have to like leave games media, which is basically what I did. But you always had your eye on the prize for like building big ambitious features. You were like, I want to do this multi-month project.
I want to get all these writers involved. I want to get all these devs involved. And I really like that about your vision for the site, because not all websites can afford to do that sort of thing or don't invest in that sort of thing.
And so, yeah, I think it was cool that you made that your mission. And what are your highlights of what you've produced on PC Gamer so far, what you've ever seen in that role?
Oh, geez. Well, one of the ones that you're, I think, alluding to there is I did this list of the 50 most influential PC games of all time. The list itself, I could kind of take or leave like the items on it, but I was really proud of how I put it together, which was just going out to a ton of different game developers and games journalists who had written for sites like 1UP over the years, all kinds of different sites, and just asking them like, hey, will you write a couple paragraphs about this particular game?
So I got all kinds of interesting people to contribute to that. I got some Cliffy B. I got Jeff Green, who was an editor of Computer Gaming World Magazine for a long time.
Never got Will Wright. Couldn't track him down. I did get a guy whose name I'm blanking on now, but he was kind of the father of the Xbox, who left quite early on.
Ed something really interesting.
Ed Freeze? Freeze.
Ed Freeze. That's it. A bunch of other people's names that are escaping me at the moment.
But that was a really fun project to put together that I mostly did in my personal time, honestly. I don't do so much of that anymore. I mostly keep work to work hours.
Jody McGregor is one of our longtime contributors who's been full time on the staff for a few years now, but he was a freelancer for a really long time. And I can't say that I was the one who discovered Jody for PC Gamer, but he did become like my go-to features writer for many years. Like anytime I had an idea that I was either too lazy to do myself or honestly just didn't think I had the chops for it, I would just be like, hey Jody, here's the pitch.
You know, do you want to write this in the next month? And he would do it. So he went and did a great feature about Warhammer 40K, Warhammer Online?
Was that the name of it? I guess it wasn't 40K, was it? It was traditional Warhammer.
Yeah, Warhammer Online. Yeah, it was fantasy, I think.
One of my favorite genres of story is MMO or online game that gets shut down and then community of people who are so dedicated to that game that they can't play anything else decide to resurrect it and spend like 10 years, you know, figuring out how to rebuild the server infrastructure and everything. Like, you can play Warhammer Online right now thanks to fans who have gone to extreme lengths to bring that game back to life. And he went in and kind of wrote about the whole resurrection of that game, which was really cool.
He did a great feature about why the cyberpunk genre of video games has like trended away from actually being punk and counterculture into being games usually about just like cops, but with neon.
Right.
So that was like a good piece of criticism that I was really happy he wrote. I've gotten to do some cool cover stories for the mag over the years and one very uncool one in hindsight, which was interviewing Palmer Lucky before he had gone full mask off. I kind of regret that one.
His Twitter feed is a tough hang, I must say, and the rest of it. But yeah, it's cool. I mean, you bringing Jodie and also reduced my weekend work because Jodie was suddenly weekend editor who knows exactly how to run the site on Saturday and Sunday.
And I was like, oh, there's no more DMs on Twitter for me. That was good news. So, Wes, something you did recently that I thought was really cool is you arranged some developer round tables at GDC.
How did that come together and what was the sort of result of that?
I have the privilege of living in San Francisco. There are all these game developers coming to this event. It's generally an event where people are a bit less guarded because it's kind of more academic.
It's more industry. People are not there to promote their stuff to such an extent as they are at an event like an E3 or a Gamescom or something. So you can kind of just reach out to people and see if they're interested in talking about something.
I've done big interviews at GDC in the past. One of the first ones I did probably in 2015 or so that I was really proud of was talking to a bunch of folks about the immersive sim where it was at at the time. I did one kind of on RPGs as well with Josh Sawyer from Obsidian and Brian Fargo of In Exile.
But at the time when I did those, they were the kind of things where I would like, you know, take my little dictaphone, record this hour conversation between these people and then turn it into like a 4000, you know, word Q&A interview on the website that not a lot of people want to read, it turns out. It's really hard to get people to read that kind of interview. So at this point, I feel like we've learned so much about what our audience is interested in, what Google algorithms are interested in, you know, all of that kind of stuff, right?
So going into this GDC, we sort of had the plan of, okay, if we're going to do these interviews, let's get a good quality recording so we can put it out as a podcast. Let's invite people who have worked on something, you know, semi-recent or a game that is going to be of interest to a good chunk of the audience that we can potentially mine several news stories out of this conversation, right? So that even if somebody doesn't want to listen to a full hour and a half of audio or they don't want to read 5,000 words of transcription, they'll still get this like one interesting anecdote about a game or this one bit of potentially breaking news about a game, right?
So we kind of went in with the idea of each of these conversations producing several different things for us and hopefully one of those things will interest somebody who comes to PC Gamer to read or listen to stuff about games. So that was kind of what I was gunning for at the outset.
Yeah, it's cool. I saw there was an article about how Michael Adelor expired and how Dragon Age companions were written and stuff like that. So yeah, it's cool that you're able to derive a bunch of different features off the back of that.
I was incidentally in the same bar as Josh Sawyer at GDC, but I was so sort of like obliterated from jet lag. I basically just left because I didn't want to get to the point where I had to talk to him and I knew it would be a net loss no matter what I said because I was just so tired and I thought I cannot intellectually impress this man. So I just got to get the hell out of there and that's what I did basically.
That's actually quite fitting for the role playing game teammates.
Yeah, I guess he would probably appreciate that detail.
Your character traits are so shitty that you're not even worth talking to.
You just need either a good bike or watch or classic car anecdote to lead off with and that's your in for Josh.
I really wanted to talk to him about Shower UI because I think he did quite a big tweet at some point about a shower that had like five different nozzles on it and eight buttons or something. I am obsessed with that as well, like how there is no good shower UI until there is some kind of Apple-related shower device. I think it's always going to be that way.
But again, do you want to seem like I was just someone who was Twitter stalking him and trying to make conversation? Best to just leave the situation altogether and never find out. That's what I think.
One last thing about those GDC talks, Sam, which I think one reason they came together really well, I think, is as much as I love and appreciate getting to ask game developers questions about the games they make, I think the best stuff almost inevitably comes from people being more relaxed and talking to their peers about the things they make. And their peers are also just going to have insights and questions that I would not have because I don't make video games. So that was a big part of my goal for that was get two people like Mike Laidlaw and Josh Sawyer in a room together and let them talk to each other with kind of as little of my interference as possible and hope that that conversation bears fruit, you know, because you're just you're going to be less guarded when you're talking to someone who knows exactly what the fuck they're talking about, who has made games the same way you have and just has insights that I would not have.
So I'm sure the coolest conversations at GDC are the ones that just happen at bars or at these kind of just like chill meetings where people just get to talk about how how they make games. But if I could capture even a little sliver of that, it was I was going to be going to be happy with it.
Yeah, for sure. I think like it's not a lot of that stuff is on the record, whereas in, you know, comic books, for example, you have comic cons where you do have those kind of creative roundtables. People talk about work your image in the 90s or whatever, or you have, you know, those Hollywood Reporter actor or director roundtables, which do get that thing of, you know, the interplay between the different actors, so they are asking each other questions.
So, yeah, really cool that you were able to put that together, you know. Yeah. So, Wes, last point on PC Gamer, I guess, before we move on to something else that you're working on.
What are your memories of working with me? What's your take on Samuel Roberts? I guess I should ask, because I have you on my podcast.
So, yeah, what's the deal there?
I'm just like, I'm wondering what Matthew is expecting from this. Like, what dark secrets.
This is the therapy being the podcast. We have a habit of asking guests to, like, basically evaluate us as people.
Review us, yes. Please review us.
Well, I think we had some good times commiserating over figuring out how to make SEO work on PC Gamer without wanting to absolutely kill ourselves. Like, I think we probably wanted to kill ourselves a little bit. Neither of us went and did it, so we're still here.
That says something.
Absolutely.
I think we were kind of kindred spirits in our views on the site and on what we liked in games. I think we always got along really well. Something that has really stood out to me listening to The Back Page over the last few months is how often you laugh on this podcast.
It occurred to me, I don't know if I ever heard Sam laugh in a meeting at PC Gamer. This is a very different Samuel Roberts. Whoever wrote that fucking iTunes review a couple months ago about your laugh being the reason for the one star, that guy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.
The Sam laugh is a delight and I'm glad that it is a key part of the Back Page identity.
I appreciate that. I took my time on PC Gamer just too seriously in retrospect. It's weird doing this podcast.
I think I found my critical voice more doing this podcast than I ever did working games media, which is a bit of a shame because I think I always felt this pressure of being a multi-format person at heart who was trying to adapt to PC gaming and not necessarily show my ass and just get things wrong. I think that put a little bit of caution in me, which in retrospect probably just held me back from thriving, if that makes sense. This really is therapy.
You know what I mean, Wes? Did you ever have a bit of that?
Most of our interactions, probably 95% of them, were in meetings that were at 9 a.m. for me and 5 p.m. for you.
Already not the best setup for really jovial times. But I think you were in charge of the UK team at a time when we were going through not terrible growing pains, but we were growing a lot and there was just a natural process of having to figure out how you become a bigger team. And that was a challenging thing to navigate.
My guess is that you were maybe too polite to carve out a more satisfying set of responsibilities for yourself. Because you clearly are super enthusiastic about games, but I don't know if you were able to take advantage of that enthusiasm to the fullest at the time.
I think you're right. My number one weakness was I was terrible at asking for help. So as soon as I left PC Gamer, the UK team basically expanded to be fully functional in UK hours.
And when I was there, it was just me and two other people. So it was a completely different ball game, really. So I was really just two or three months away from probably getting that opportunity to carve out that niche a little bit.
But that said, I was just so passionate about it because I was so certain that this is what a good website looks like. And you do have to fight the odds a bit to build a website that is able to have those values and not just be an SEO chasing machine. So I was incredibly proud of being part of this growth journey, even though I fully believe that you, Evan, Tyler, Stephen, etc.
in the US, Andy Chalk, of course, really kind of built out that website into what it became. It was just amazing to be part of it because I just really, just really loved it, you know? So, yeah, oh gosh, there's really a steripy, isn't it?
But those are kind words. The thing about laughing is very funny. I was very intense in those meetings because I thought I just have to like, because I'm in charge of the UK team, I just have to seem super competent.
So I probably just was never in a fun mood. So I was like, OK, this is Evan's one interaction with me this week. I better just not seem like a fucking idiot.
And that was honestly really what was going through my head.
So, yeah, I mean, I think just in hindsight, like it's it's probably OK to come off some like like the right kind of idiot, probably. Probably in the workplace, you know, that there's always a line. Right.
But I think one of the trickiest things about navigating are the kind of career progression you go through in media is like early on. You kind of need to be the person who can say yes to anything and deliver. And then at some point, you need to be the person who knows when to say no to stuff because it's going to either destroy your, you know, your desire to do the work or you're not going to be able to do it to the level of quality that you want.
You know, I always try to keep in mind, like, how much can I do as well as I want to do it? And if I have the opportunity to turn something down because I want to focus on something else, you know, I try to I try to do that.
Yeah, I think you navigate that really successfully. So, yeah, that's a good way to wrap up that very self-indulgent part of this podcast. Yeah.
So, Wes, switching tack, tell us about Read Only Memo, your emulation newsletter. It's really cool to see you launch this as a sub project because on PC Game, you've been covering the emulation scene and not in a kind of like gaudy look at me playing Rogue Leader on my Steam Deck kind of way, in more of a kind of like hobbyist looking at the people actually making this happen and also the kinds of weird games uncovered off the back of the emulation scene that maybe, you know, hadn't had fan translations, that sort of thing. So what were the origins of this as a project?
Well, thank you for teeing me up. I feel like I don't even need to pitch this thing out. You know, it really came out of, like you say, like I wrote about, have been writing about emulation on PC Gamer for a long time, particularly Dolphin, which is the GameCube and Wii emulator that I have been a fan of for a really long time.
I probably first used in the early 2010s or late teens, late aughts. I don't even remember. It's been around for a long time.
It's always just been a topic that's interested me, I guess, ever since I was in like computer lab in school, which is that that feels like a phrase that dates me. Do they have computer labs anymore? Everybody just has a computer.
Like that's such a dead concept.
Very millennial concept, I think.
And like figuring out we could download SNES 9x onto the computers and play Super Metroid in class. So I don't know that kind of just like stuck with me. So I've been writing about it for a long time.
And this year kind of just really felt the desire to have something that I that I own completely that is a personal project that I can put a lot of passion into. You guys were honestly partially an inspiration for that of like seeing how much fun you have with this podcast and talking about games. And I was like, I should have an outlet like that.
As much as I love my work on PC Gamer, it is still work. And there are things that I'm not going to write on PC Gamer because they're just not going to. It's not worth the work hours to write about some aspect of emulation that a couple thousand people probably are interested in reading about.
But that's worth it to me if I'm interested in it. So it was sort of just like, here's a place I can put some of my passion. And it was a really good excuse to push myself to start making more connections in that space and like going out to people, asking them for interviews, even if it's just like via chat on Discord, you know, and building up some sources so that when something is legitimately breaking news that would be relevant on PC Gamer, like I know who to go to for comment, you know.
So it was kind of just like a nice dovetail where it could be beneficial to me personally and be a fulfilling thing to work on and fun. And it could also pay dividends at work and give me kind of a better in to some avenues in that space that is very, you know, it's like a hobby scene, right? There's a bajillion different people spread out over all these different platforms and projects.
And if you're not really keyed into it, like it's hard to know where to start. So I'm kind of just giving myself an excuse to dig into it more.
Yeah, it's cool. You had a Danny O'Dwyer as like a guest columnist last week. So, you know, you kind of like building it out in that respect or two and bringing different contributors in.
Is that something you're just focused on doing to kind of like mix things up?
Yeah, I mean, it's partially like I'm kind of framing this thing as emulation news with like two big stories in each issue, which is biweekly and then a bunch of little tidbits. Like I'm trying to keep it fairly bullet pointy and like quick to read. I'm not using it as a space for me to just like write a thousand words about a game that I like that I played on an emulator.
But I thought a fun way to honestly like partially promote the thing would be to just go out to people who's writing on games or other work, you know, around games. I really respect and just ask them like, hey, do you want to write a really short thing about some memory you have of playing a game on an emulator? And then I'll try to dig up some trivia about, you know, how well that game runs an emulator or something about the history of the emulator that it would run in just to kind of give it a little bit of extra context, I guess, for the newsletter.
So I did that with Danny for the first one. And I've been reaching out to other folks asking them if they want to partake. So it's kind of just a fun way to get more explicit games writing into the thing without it just being me just shitting out an extra 500 words of my own thoughts about games.
Well, if you want to guest columnist from The Back Page, then just let me know and I'll happily oblige. I think it's one kind of games media writing I can probably still do. So, yeah.
So Matthew, you're an emulation skeptic. And, Wes, I was curious, why is that scene so interesting to you and what makes it worth covering in that level of detail?
Well, I mean, I feel like first I want to hear Matthew's actual take here and make sure that you're not, you know, besmirching his reputation.
Well, is it true?
I think the thing I kind of rail against a little bit is some corners of the Internet, particularly with emulating like new games, like new Switch games and where they run better on PC than they do the hardware. I kind of balk a little bit at the scoffing kind of nature of it, which isn't what you're doing. But this sort of like, you fools, why are you playing this on Switch, the thing it was made for, rather than PC, which is the thing you don't necessarily own.
That's always kind of annoyed me. I think the emulation thing for me is quite niche and it is quite hobbyist. And there's just too much stuff I have to kind of keep on top of to be able to kind of indulge in that.
I don't really go back and play a lot of old stuff generally. What I do, you know, I'm catered for and what I have, I sort of feel bad. I've been reading Read Only Memo in the run up to this and thinking, oh, this is just so much more sophisticated than my very crude takes on emulation, which I've shared on this podcast.
Actually made me feel a bit sheepish. I think what you're looking at is slightly different to just this like raw power replace this thing. And of course, I'm not down on the, what's the word I'm looking for?
Preservation.
The preservation element, which is vital. Also, my really basic bitch take is I don't really like doing stuff with my PC. Like, I like the console experience for what it is.
Yeah. And I don't want to play those games on my PC.
I mean, to be completely fair, I have absolutely scoffed in the past, so you're not 100% wrong in your read. You know, there are plenty of emulation enthusiasts out there, which I have been one at some point who do sort of look at people playing a game in a way that you can have such a better experience, you know, some other way. That's almost like the DNA of PC gaming at this point, right?
Is looking at people playing a game on a console and going, well, it's just so much better on PC, right? At least if you don't have all the shader stutter and all the, like, bad shit that's been going on at PC ports the last year or so. But I think there's a lot of reasons to love it.
And one of the big ones, I think, only this box is only checked if you are the kind of person who has those PC gamery tendencies where you find it satisfying, tinkering with games and modding games and kind of trying to get the most out of them in some particular avenue, whether it's deeply technical or whether it's, you know, even trying to recreate the experience of playing a game on a CRT by using certain filters and things that, you know, change the way the image looks. It's kind of funny that Emulation has this branch where it's all about, you know, 4K maximum quality, high res texture pack, like widescreen hack, all of these things to make a game look as kind of new as it possibly can. And then there's this other avenue where it's like, I want this to look like it was run through a dogshit composite cable, like, you know, plugged into my cable box and then plugged into my TV.
And like, you can do both of those things, but it definitely takes like a lot of tinkering to kind of nail either one. I think the big thing for me is I'm a strong believer in, like, if I buy a piece of software, I should be able to do kind of whatever I want with it within reason, right? Like I don't think I should be able to sell it to other people on online.
I mean, like sell on eBay, but like not make copies of it and sell it, right? But like I should be able to, you know, take a PlayStation 2 disc and put it in my PC and play it on my PC if I want to. I bought that PS2 game, and I know that's not technically how software licenses work and all that stuff, but I think our copyright system is incredibly broken.
And all of the stuff around emulation, you know, all of the kind of legal gray area, I think most of it should just be legal and should not be gray area. I think you should be able to hack and reverse engineer a console to your heart's content if you have the skills to do that. It's a really messy, like legal question.
But generally, I think if you're not pirating games, if you're using your own hardware, if you're doing this stuff, you should be able to go wild with it. And it's, you know, going back to Nintendo, which is like really near and dear to both of us and like seeing what's going on with the like Tears of the Kingdom emulation. And man, when Breath of the Wild came out, like I played so much of that game on the Wii U at 720p, 26 FPS, like being generous, you know, that game did not run super well.
And I think Nintendo for such a long time has been creating games within the limits of very affordable hardware. And they use the strength of their art direction and their design to make up for that. I mean, even going back to the Game Boy, right?
Like the Game Boy was kind of a piece of shit when it came out, but it had Tetris on it. And they knew how to make games for their very limited hardware that were incredible. And I think if you can have that limited game experience, but free it to some extent from those limitations, it can only be better.
You know, the magic of Breath of the Wild was not that it ran at 25 FPS. It was that they managed to create this incredible expansive world with like a beautiful art style and it barely worked on that hardware. But man, does it look really, really nice if you run it at four times, eight times that resolution at a solid frame rate.
And it's just like, it's just a more fun game for me. And it's a clearer realization of the vision that they had for it that they just, you know, did not build a piece of hardware that cost $500 because that's not the way Nintendo markets itself. You know, they're never going to make a PS5 type console probably in the future.
They're going to always make something that's a little unique and much more affordable for them and for the audience. And that's okay. Like, you have to make peace with that.
But then I want to be able to put it on my PC and play it, you know, in a way that looks freaking amazing.
As long as you don't think I'm an idiot for proudly sticking with my Switch.
No one does, Matthew.
That's all I ask. So much of this is just wounded pride, you know, it's just not wanting to.
Having gone through...
No, I can't admit that I'm wrong.
The process of like doing the Switch custom firmware stuff, which I did, you are not an idiot if you don't do that because it is a pain in the ass and it is very complicated. But I wanted to like prove that I could do it the legit way and not just like download, you know, a hacked version of the console keys or whatever you need for the emulator. But going back to the newsletter, just a little bit, like Sam, you mentioned before stuff like fan translations and stuff.
And that is what really gets me excited about the emulation scene, is that it is kind of an avenue towards being able to experience games that I never thought I would be able to experience or games that I didn't even to this day. Like every time I'm doing a new issue of this newsletter, I'm finding out about cool looking Japanese games that I had no idea existed up until the point at which I'm just like going on romhacking.net or some random person's Twitter feed and finding they translated some old RPG or action game that looks really cool. That's so exciting to me and that stuff wouldn't happen without emulators.
And thanks to emulation becoming kind of more and more accepted and mainstream, we now have some companies like Limited Run Games, for example, who are putting out like official translations of games that never got them before. You've got companies like Digital Eclipse doing stuff like the Atari 50th Anniversary Collection where they're using emulation as like an avenue to basically create, I don't even know what you would call their games, like a museum exhibit, you know, it is like a historical document first and then sort of a collection of games second. So that stuff is really exciting to me, you know, even if a lot of the game companies themselves still look at it as sort of a dirty word when they're talking about the hobbyist scene, you know, Nintendo is obviously not a fan of emulation, but they made the virtual console and that was just emulation that they put a different face on.
And that's the future of this industry as they try to mine their back catalogue more and more. It's going to be through emulation, you know, they're not going to do native ports of all of their hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of old games. So it's going to only become more common.
It's going to be interesting to see how they kind of how they frame it, I think.
Yeah, I think what I like about your emulation coverage is I sort of like, I'm with Matthew a little bit on games that are commercially available. I think like, regardless of whether they can run another hardware, like I think anything that potentially encourages people to not buy games or circumvent buying games, that I have no support for. But when it comes to things like you covered Racing Lagoon, a PS1, the Squaresoft RPG, you know, right from the kind of like late 90s era.
And that sort of thing, it's like, kind of like what you're alluding to, it's not commercially available. You cannot give Square Enix money for that game. But it is an interesting artifact that people should be able to discover and learn about.
And it is legitimately interesting that someone's fan translated this game and it's now a lost piece of history can slot into, you know, your knowledge base of what they were making at that time. And that's the kind of coverage of yours I really like where it's like, this is stuff that is obviously tinge with your interests, but it's also, you know, it's, but it's about the kind of like the undertaking to bring it to life. So, yeah, that's what I like about your emulation coverage.
Yeah, you know, the games industry, I think, has proven for decades at this point to be a terrible steward of its own legacy. In the early days, they just didn't have processes for retaining data, you know, they would finish a game and be like, that's it, we did it, like, we made a bunch of disks, like, delete it off the hard drives, or they would just lose stuff, you know. Like Panzer Dragoon Saga is an example of a game that was not printed in large quantities.
I don't know how many disks they made of that game, but it's not a lot. And I believe Sega lost the source code for that game. Now that might be apocryphal, maybe it is still sitting on a server somewhere, but I would not be surprised if the source code for that game is completely lost to time.
And if they only made, you know, 50,000 disks or something of that game, like, do you know what the shelf life of a CD is? Like, it's not great, especially if it's not, you know, kept in a museum archive somewhere. Those are the kind of games that are going to eventually disappear or not be playable on old hardware when the hardware fails and like emulation is kind of going to be the only avenue for that stuff.
So kind of whether the games industry likes it or not, people are going to take it upon themselves to make sure that people can experience these games 50 years from now.
Okay, well, that's a great note to take a break then I think and then we'll come back in section two and talk a bit about Nintendo in the northeast where it's another subject that's close to your heart.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, in this section, we're gonna talk to Wes a little bit about Nintendo in the noughties, subject close to his heart. By the way, every time I say noughties on this website, I do sort of like feel the hairs on my skin prick up a little bit.
There's still something wrong about that word somehow. So, Wes, when we were talking about you coming on the podcast, one of the things you mentioned to me was an EGM Top 100 list that you read in 2001, and you mentioned this as being a big deal to you at the time. I'll read the Top 25 out in a moment for context for the listeners, but why was that list a big deal to you as someone who was just getting into games?
You know, it's funny to compare it now to my own knowledge of making these sorts of lists. You know, PC Gamer does a Top 100 list every year that you have taken part in many times. Matthew, I'm sure you have been involved in many a best games ever list.
I love it. I love a good list.
But for me, like encountering this, this was probably the first list like that I had ever read, and the fact that it like spanned multiple systems, generations of consoles from people who clearly knew so much about video games, it just felt like a holy text at the time. Like I had discovered the actual definitive list of the best video games ever made.
Right, right. Yeah, it's an interesting list as well because I attracted down on an old IGN board and people were in there arguing about the list like people still do argue about lists of video games on websites to this day.
Nothing's changed.
Yeah, exactly. But I found it really interesting because it's not a very PC leading list. It's a very console heavy list and I assume that's by design, but this list doesn't have, I don't think it has Deus Ex in it, for example.
I think it has no PC games actually. I think it was all console.
Yeah, so super interesting. Right, so I'll just read out quickly. I will say number 26 is Chrono Trigger, one of my favorites.
So I sort of mentioned that before going to the top 25. So I've got Original Zelda at 25, Super Castlevania 4 at 24, Gunstar Heroes and Matthew Favorite at 23, Super Mario Bros. at 22, 21 is Dragon Force, a game I'm not familiar with, Gallagher at 20, 19 is Panzer Dragoon Saga, a game that no one has played, like you say, Wes.
18 is Pokemon Puzzle League. That's an interesting choice. That's higher, by the way, than Link's Awakening, I believe.
So yeah, that's a funny bit of list making. 17 is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, 16, Super Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island. Is that Super Mario World 3, actually?
Is that wrong? No, that is right, isn't it? Sorry, I'm getting the GBA version mixed up.
15 is Gran Turismo 3, 14 Metal Gear Solid, 13 Street Fighter 2 Turbo Hyper Fighting, 12 is Final Fantasy 5, 11 is Super Mario Bros. 3, 10 is Super Mario World, 9 is FF3. I'm guessing that is Final Fantasy 6.
Correct. 8 is Ocarina of Time, 7 is Majora's Mask, 6 is Soul Calibur, 5 is Super Mario 64, 4 is Castlevania Symphony of the Night, 3 is Zelda A Link to the Past, 2 is Tetris and 1 is Super Metroid. That is an interesting snapshot of the time.
Definitely like you say, there is obviously a console leaning here. But I could see why that would seem appealing to you, Wes, as someone who had a burgeoning knowledge of this stuff. I suppose I'm curious to know how much EGM drove the conversations in games in the US up until the mid-noughties when websites took over.
Why did you have a particular affinity for that magazine, and I guess why did this list matter to you in the midst of that?
Looking back on it, it's funny to me how many of the blurbs here, I went back and reread through this feature, are barely saying anything about the game or they fall back on the like, it'll keep you interested like for tons of hours or like all the way to the end or whatever. And I'm like, what the fuck are you, like you're saying nothing. Like you could insert this into any game you're talking about.
But then there are some other ones that I think really land, even though they only have 40, 50 words to work with. Having worked on these kind of things now, I know that it was produced in probably two weeks after like one or two argument meetings. And then they just hammered this shit out and got it in the mag.
I had none of that insight at the time. And I think it struck the right balance for me as sort of someone having this like awakening to people talking about games, there being games, magazines, there being this sort of history of video games for me to tap into. It hit a really good balance of stuff I had heard of that I knew to be very acclaimed or prestigious.
You know, the Super Metroids of this list, the Tetrises of the list, the Zeldas. And then to be a lot of games that were really interesting and mysterious that I had never heard of or had some very dim awareness of. And to see them like codified in this way that felt so official like was, I don't know, really like cemented them as significant games.
So at least from my perspective, EGM did drive the conversation. I don't know how widespread that was to, you know, everyone who was a game enthusiast in the in the 90s and early 2000s. But I feel like it had more cache than some of the other game mags like like a GamePro or Nintendo Power was kind of its own thing that we'll talk about.
But, yeah, I don't know, maybe it just felt a little bit a little more cutting edge, maybe a little bit more grown up. I mean, even just the name Electronic Gaming Monthly, even though it was like an old weird 80s name, I feel like that sort of has a little more prestige to it than than GamePro. I don't know.
I think as well there is something, you know, having experienced this myself, if you discover Nintendo more around like the N64 era, then when you look back on the SNES, as you call it in the US, Wes, not the SNES, it seems exotic and exciting and so different because there is such a vast chasm between the N64 catalogue and the SNES catalogue. They are just so, so different. So obviously, like the identity of Nintendo first party games kind of remains the same and it's about translating them to 3D.
But obviously third party support on the N64 was just so limited. So when you look back on all of these, a lot of the games in this list, there's not really an equivalent to them that exists past that point necessarily on a Nintendo platform. So I can see why that might seem exciting as someone who is more focused on Nintendo, you know?
Yeah. And I only experienced the Super Nintendo through friends who owned one and pretty limited amounts. It's funny, like I was so kind of clueless as to the console game space for a long time, even after I got that hand-me-down Genesis that I remember kids in like the lunchroom talking about different games, different consoles.
And there was definitely a time where I thought the Super Nintendo, the SNES and the SNES were like different things. Like I didn't understand that that was just people saying the name of the console in different ways. So it really wasn't until like I read this issue of EGM and started subscribing to the magazine and to Nintendo Power that I started kind of filling in a lot of this history.
But one of the funniest things for me looking back at this list is how much a few of these little blurbs like stuck in my mind as almost definitive bits of information about these games. Number 43 on the list is Final Fantasy Tactics. And the blurb says it has one of the most convoluted, poorly written slash translated storylines in the history of video games.
And that like when I was rereading this the other night, I was like, holy shit, that is where my understanding of the PS1 release of Final Fantasy Tactics came from. Like it was not a review. It was the first sentence of this little blurb of this list because I read it so many times.
I remember when they were re-releasing that game for the PSP and they did a re-translation and stuff. I remember thinking like, oh, well, yeah, that makes sense because the original one was like so convoluted. No one could understand it.
Like I hadn't played the game at that point. I just knew that to be true about it.
Yeah, this stuff really does get passed down. And, you know, it becomes received wisdom and everyone sort of repeats the same thing. And then no one quite knows where the information came from.
That totally happens in the UK too. Matthew, you talked about that as well with N64 magazine before, right? Where just certain opinions stick around in your head even though...
Yeah, I mean, we maybe got two new N64 games a year and they were reviewing all these other ones. And you just take their review and pass it off as your own opinion all the time. I guess like probably a closer thing to this top 100 list.
Although the mags did do top 100 games once in a while, but they always had the directory of like the best 100 N64 games. So I think N64 actually had a score for every single N64 game.
Were there 100 N64 games to put on a list?
Well, that's, yeah, I think that's where it changes. Yeah, but like their little blurbs and scores from that section, you know, I'd be parroting those for years. There's loads of N64 games I haven't played, but that I know from those descriptions.
And even when I was working on NGamer, which was one of the successor magazines to N64, I was still kind of just repeating these things, thinking, that's just crazy. I wonder how much stuff they were just repeating from the SNES mag before them, Super Play, and just keeps going on and on.
Another bit of this that proved to be like a really definitive text for me is after immediately following the list of the 100 best games is EGM's Crapstravaganza, the 20 worst games ever written by the incredible Sean Baby of Legend. And this list absolutely cemented for me these are the worst video games that have ever or will ever been made, which included the likes of Bible Adventures, Bubsy 3D, Night Trap, Custer's Revenge, Superman 64.
No one has played Superman 64, but we all hate it.
I have rented Superman 64. Did I rent it or did I just come across it at somebody's house? I have played that game and it is absolutely vile.
The thing is though, everyone knows that as a game about flying Superman through rings and that it's one of the worst games of all time. Those are the two bits of information that people pass on and on about that game. Is that what your experience was with that game, Wes?
Yes, you fly through rings and the fog is so... It's like Turok level fog, you can barely see anything. There's just rings and then I think there's robots that shoot you with lasers and you die really fast.
It's just an absolute piece of garbage.
In one of our big Nintendo mags, NGC, which was like the unofficial Nintendo mag in the UK, they took a line from that game. There's a line of dialogue where Lex Luthor challenges Superman to solve, he says, solve my maze. And there was a regular sort of box out, sort of side column in NGC called solve my maze.
And it had a picture of Gene Hatman's Lex Luthor and it was just like a nonsense puzzle every month. And that ran for like years and years and years. So like solve my maze is like burnt into my mind.
I think we had like forum users on NGamer's forum called solve my maze off the back of that. And like, again, never touched it.
Similarly for me, after, what was it? One of the Turok sequels or like reboots a few years later, EGM, there was a, the villain of the game was named Tobias Bruckner. I have never played this, this video game.
I think it was like very bad. Or maybe it was, it was okay. I don't know.
But EGM like hated this game. And they, for years after that, did the, like I think it was called the Tobias Bruckner Memorial Awards or something, which was their like razzies for the year. They would celebrate the worst games or the worst characters or something.
I don't remember exactly. I just remember, I know the name Tobias Bruckner and will never forget it, even though I've never played this Turok game.
That's good. I'm going to use that name when I inevitably go into, you know, like witness protection at some point.
If you live in Texas, like perfect, perfect. No one's going to think twice.
It's funny how these things stick with you though, actually. We're just talking about EGM reminded me of how there was a little, there's like a paragraph. I think it's like a sexy moments in games feature or something.
There's a paragraph about a cut scene in Luna 2 Eternal Blue that was about like a hot tub scene and like how one character takes like her clothes off and there's like a boy in there being very embarrassed. And I just assumed for decades after that, that Luna 2 was like a pornographic RPG. And then it was quite weird to come back to that series and realize it was pretty celebrated.
You know, it wasn't like one of the RPG heavyweights, but people really love that series. And then to discover that it's really not the profile of those games. But that was my only frame of reference for the Luna series for two decades was just, oh, yeah, it's just like porn, a porny anime game, and it's just not that.
So, yeah, this stuff really can stick with you. Whereas I was curious to ask about Nintendo Power because it's quite, from the UK perspective, it's quite an odd prospect or an interesting prospect, where is this, you know, there's a kind of like a pamphlet, I guess, from Nintendo for Nintendo players that has this, you know, there's a lot of love for it, you know, from people who grew up reading it and that existed. I think it started around the NES era and then obviously kind of continued from there, and it was eventually closed around a decade ago.
I'm curious from your perspective as someone who obviously enjoys reading sort of great games journalism and that sort of thing, like what the significance was of this magazine to you and in the continuum of games media. What was the appeal of Nintendo Power and was it good, I guess?
Good question for sure, whether it was good. I think Matthew and I can probably both relate to being like Nintendo-pilled at this point in the late 90s. I don't know when that like set in for you, Matthew.
I'm sure it was a bit later for me. But there's no powers like the place you could go to just gobble up, you know, every bit of Nintendo information that was you could possibly get. At a time when I started reading it, you know, around 2001, 2002, was Nintendo was kind of entering a dark period or I guess they'd kind of been in a dark period during the N64 days, which I wasn't really cognizant of as an N64 player because like, I don't know, I had Zelda, I had GoldenEye.
Like those games were so incredible that I was not reading magazines talking about how much better shit was over on the PlayStation. Like I just wasn't aware of that. So I became more aware of it during the GameCube era where obviously it was the third place console.
There was not nearly as much third party support on the GameCube as there was on the PS2 and the Xbox. And, you know, the great Nintendo games certainly got coverage in Electronic Gaming Monthly in every game mag and website. But I feel like they're probably on balance was a lot more PS2 and Xbox coverage because frankly there was more going on on those systems in the multi-format mags.
So Nintendo Power was the place where you could go and sort of be reassured that like, yes, there's amazing things happening on Nintendo all of the time. Look at all these cool games.
Yeah, that's interesting. So, yeah, I can see why that would be appealing, especially when especially in the 90s when it was like there was no direct outlet for this information and there was no Internet. It seemed like Nintendo Power probably had more of a place then than it would ever have after that, I suppose.
Yeah, I think I came in probably past Nintendo Power's peak in relevance.
You know, I think early on, Nintendo was very savvy to sort of control its own media outlet, basically. And at the time when there was no Internet, they could be the definitive source of information for Nintendo games and really just use it to hype up the fans, right? I think it was very, very popular and effective in the 90s.
And by the time I was reading it, it was not probably fulfilling that purpose anymore. But it was probably still selling pretty well, early 2000s magazine scene. It was still a great tome for fans because you would get a cool foldout poster with every single issue.
You know, I had so many of these skinny vertical Nintendo power posters on my wall at the time when I was 15 or so. And you know, you would just get to occasionally read about some really cool game that was supposedly going to get localized and brought to the US. The one issue of the mag I kept is the one that has a feature on this game called Magical Vacation, which was made by Brownie Brown, kind of a small RPG studio that did Sword of Mana.
And then they went on to do Mother 3 in collaboration with Itoi and Nintendo. So they really stepped it up there. But there was this RPG section in Nintendo Power called The Epic Center.
And they had this big feature on Magical Vacation, which was this game that I thought looked so cool, had really great GBA pixel art. And I was really psyched for it and waited several years before it kind of dawned on me that it was never actually going to come out in the US. But happy ending.
I got a fan translation about two years ago or so, so you can actually play it now.
Nice. I think a major difference between Europe and the US in the 90s is the JRPG didn't really happen here at all until Final Fantasy VII launched. So that's aside from my import reviews and in some UK magazines.
But from the outside, looking in, the US always seemed to be a big JRPG territory. It sounds like from what you're saying there, Nintendo did its part to really push that and really build that as part of its brand in that 90s time period. Was that the case?
Was the JRPG as big as it seemed from the outside? Or did it just seem that way because Earthbound or Dragon Quest VII or Final Fantasy VI launched in the US when they didn't come here?
It's a good question. I didn't really become aware of those games until the early 2000s. I didn't play them growing up.
The first JRPG I played through was Breath of Fire 2 for the Game Boy Advance, so that was like a port of the game. And from there, a friend of mine did me the incredible favor in like the summer of probably 2001 of loaning me his PlayStation 1, the PS1, the little really tiny mini one. Did that come out in the UK, the one that's about this size?
The baby one.
Yeah, so I think he must have had a PS2 at this point. So he loaned me his PS1 and like a stack of about six JRPGs. And I played all of them like through in a summer basically, like one of the all time summers of my life.
I played through Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, Final Fantasy 9, might have played through 8 at the time, might have played through Chrono Cross. I honestly can't remember how many of them I played in that contained period. A lot of those games had been out for a year or five at that point, and I just wasn't aware of them.
But I did look up a list before we were talking, though I don't have it in front of me, of a lot of Squaresoft games that did not come out in Europe, that were out in the US. And like it's a pretty long list. So I'm not shocked that it feels to you like the US was much more of a JRPG territory, because it does seem like they just kind of left out Europe on a lot of those games.
Yeah, it's hard to tell why that was exactly. Actually, the reason is probably very simple. It's probably because they had to localize it for France, Spain, Germany, and that was too big an undertaking to justify what might have seemed like, you know, a lot of work for a niche genre at the time.
That must have been it. Yeah, but like Xenogears, Parasite Eve, Brave Fencer, Musashi, Chrono Cross, like those are some, I mean, not all big hitters, Final Fantasy Tactics, like some of those are some big hitters and some of them are kind of weird niche hitters that were not ever Square's most popular games, but like still were formative games for some people, you know, like Parasite Eve is such a unique game. Xenogears, like, I mean, that is the predecessor to the Xenoblade Chronicles games, right?
Like that stuff made a big impact on some people, even if they weren't selling millions and millions of copies.
Yeah, absolutely. And that stuff is, you know, I think still, those games are still worshiped as almost like mythical objects from some people in Europe because they just didn't happen here in the way they happened in the US. So, yeah.
I was reading that big, was it the Polygon? The big oral history of Final Fantasy VII?
Yeah, that's Matt Leone.
Yeah, it's quite interesting when they talk about, you know, from their perspective, bringing out Final Fantasy VII, they're like, this has to be the JLPG that really lands because our other JLPGs that we bring over to America, you know, they do fine, but they haven't done that well. I think our perspective from the UK or Europe is like, every kid grew up playing Final Fantasy. You know, like, actually hearing them say, if we'd done Final Fantasy 6 numbers for Final Fantasy 7, we would have been in big trouble, you know, and you're like, oh, maybe it wasn't, maybe I have got a very skewed perception of this.
It's just, grass is always greener, I imagine, from the other side.
Yeah, and I mean, Final Fantasy did better than a lot of them did, and it even wasn't a massive seller, but like, the Dragon Quest, the original Dragon Quest, Nintendo Power gave it away as a freebie for a while to, like, promote the magazine or promote the game, I guess, either way. So Dragon Quest just, like, never landed over here. Like, it never sold enough to break through, you know, I guess because it was a little bit older by the time they localized it, and I don't know, just for whatever reason, it didn't kind of have the, you know, the bombast of Final Fantasy and those games just, like, never really penetrated.
So I think over here, it was kind of a similar story, and that 7 really was the breakthrough JRPG, and I think a lot of those games on the Super Nintendo would be, you know, passed around from kids who had the 80 or 90 dollars or whatever the cartridges cost at the time to actually buy them, but they weren't really huge kind of until they had that global breakthrough.
If I may ask about another US specific phenomenon, Wes, is that reading the EGM list and knowing what I know about, you know, the people who produce RetroNauts, for example, there was such a huge affinity for Castlevania and Metroid on the US side. And I was curious to ask about that. Like, why, it doesn't, I guess it's not uniquely American, but it just, those games just seem to have landed in a way that, you know, they are just part of the consciousness of US games media in a way they just, I don't think they were as much here, but maybe have been in recent years with that, the Metroidvania games exploding, you know, across all formats and a wave of new ones.
What's, I guess, what's that all about? What is the US love affair with Castlevania and Metroid all about?
Honestly, I don't know, because I came to both of those way later as well. Like, I didn't play Super Metroid until I think the Wii Virtual Console was the first time I played like all the way through it. I think a friend of mine owned it, but it was one of those things where when I go over to my friend's house to like hang out and play games, he's not going to go, hey, let's play 24 hours of this video game or whatever that you're going to have to stumble your way through for the first time.
I guess once you know Super Metroid, it's like probably six hours long. But anyway, the point is like I did not really have much experience with those. I still don't like old Castlevania.
I find it so, the movement so clunky and so just like stolid that the NES game, it was too hard for me. Really, like I don't get on with NES games super well for the most part. Some of the later Castlevanias are amazing and Dracula X is pretty awesome or Rondo of Blood, the one that was like only released in Japan for a long time that has like some characters who actually move faster than, I don't know, Richter moves like the mummy basically so freaking slow.
So yeah, I don't have a good insight into why those games are so popular other than they just like, they were. I don't know. The Castlevania was huge on the NES and then that carried over to the SNES.
That's probably it. You know, it's just there as a formative game. It's big on the NES and that's going to send ripples through people's playing habits for the next 20 years.
And it's got to be up there as one of the bigger third party games on the NES, surely. It's always there on like the NES mini and the virtual console. So, you know, it's so associated with it.
Yeah, Super Metroid is a more interesting one where I feel like it's somehow one of those games where even if you're not someone who thinks very critically about games and game design, probably because you're, you know, a teenager when you're first experiencing it, the quality of it shines through so remarkably that you can get a sense for just how artfully put together that game is. And I think you don't have to be like a super technical, like speed runner kind of player to discover some of the kind of hidden elements of that game, you know, like the way you can kind of take advantage of the wall jumping and was it shine sparking? Is that the like the advanced technique?
I feel like some of that stuff is just accessible enough that you could realistically stumble upon it by playing that game a few times rather than having to look up, you know, a strategy guide and be like, never in a bajillion years would I have figured out how to, you know, cancel myself through that wall or whatever that like people, you know, that speedrunners do, right? So I think it just the pacing in that game was so amazing. The atmosphere was so amazing.
It played so well that I think it just it just hit for people and got people invested in it in a way that not many games on consoles kind of had that like all of those ingredients kind of add up together. But if it wasn't as big over in the UK, then honestly I would be mystified as to why it landed differently here.
Yeah, like they existed, but just it seems like, you know, just looking at that list, it's just the cultural impact of them just seems more outsized. So yes, it's interesting to dig into for sure. So, Wes, when it comes to the GameCube launching in 2001, I'm guessing then you were quite, you know, fully cognizant of what the games industry was and what was going on across the different platforms.
So what did you make of the GameCube as someone who was a relatively recent Nintendo convert?
I would say I was not yet fully cognizant, though I would be before long, you know, after owning a GameCube for a little while. I was just so hyped for that thing. Like, too, I was absolutely annoying the shit out of my friends with how excited I was for the GameCube.
I remember saving up like all of my odd jobs and allowance money the summer before it came out. The only thing I bought like that year was Majora's Mask. Which I think I bought in like, I don't remember when it came out, but I bought it in like June or something of 2021.
And that carried me through November when the GameCube came out over here. And that was really like when I started getting into mags. Honestly, like I made some of my lifelong friends by being enthusiastic about this stuff.
Up to that point, I didn't really have like my video game friends. Like I had friends that I had grown up with and we played games together, but it wasn't like our obsession. And when the GameCube was coming out and I was so excited for Super Smash Brothers, especially and Rogue Leader that like I kind of bonded with some friends on the bus and like the next few years of us really all the way up through late high school.
Like we would play like link cable GBA games on the bus and we would, you know, talk about the new games coming out, you know, share mags. And we moved on to stuff on the Xbox and the PS2 as well. But I was really just like, I don't know, I was so blinded to differences between, you know, versions of the games on the Xbox and the GameCube and the GameCube's disc not being able to hold as much like all of that stuff.
It was just like Nintendo games look so cool. That like that was all that was going through my brain.
I think I was in exactly the same place. That's and that's when I when I, you know, have jokingly dismissed the importance of other concerts in the UK. I was just so all in on GameCube.
And it was like amplified by the fact that we got it everything so much later. Like it would always hit in the US and having to wait like another six months and like reading all the reviews in English and seeing how excited everyone was. Oh, my God.
It was just death. That I associate kind of those two years with just always waiting for something amazing that someone else had just that frustration. I'm followed by absolute elation when you play the things and they were just fucking incredible.
I remember one one particular thing of looking at screenshots of Mario Sunshine online in the lead up to it coming out. Maybe it was it must have already been out in Japan, but it hadn't come out over here yet. And all of the, what do you call it?
The sort of victory screen after you would collect a shine at the end of the level. Mario would hold it up to the camera and it would say shine get on the screen, which I thought was very funny and just, you know, sort of poor English in the Japanese version of the game. But when they released it over here, they changed the phrase.
I don't remember what it says now in the English version, but it's like you got a shrine or something like that. And I was so sad that they changed that. I don't know.
I was just like so keyed in to looking at every screenshot I could of this game that that was like, this is how this is what it says in the game. That's part of its personality. And then when they changed it, I was I was bummed out.
So really like very uncool levels of investment in the minutia of Nintendo games at that time.
Whereas I think one of the more confusing things to me in retrospect, and I understood exactly why this happened at the time, is just how badly the GameCube failed versus previous Nintendo generations. But the software releases seemed languid at the time next to PS2. But in retrospect, I think when you take the top 20 of the PS2 and compare it to the top 20 of the GameCube, they really are comparable in terms of quality.
They're completely different types of games in most cases. But the actual like very top tier is great. The PS2 just had volume on its side.
So why do you think the GameCube failed aside from the very obvious factor of not having a DVD player where the PS2 did have one?
You know, there's probably a bunch of different factors here, but I think Nintendo did what they always do, which is make some really incredible video games. But I think more than at any other point in its history, they were just completely out of step with the culture of the time. I think it's hard to articulate how different the year 2001 was from now, especially for us having been teenagers at the time.
I think our perception of it was probably through a very specific lens. But that was still very much the monoculture then, in a way that will never exist again. But everything in 2001, if you think about it, rotates around the culture of frosted tips, Paris Hilton, deeply ingrained misogyny.
The culture was in a very specific, edgy place at this time. And I think Nintendo was deeply uncool and did not know how to navigate that era. Or I should say deeply uncool by the standards of that time period.
And I think they were just so out of step in that moment.
I just had that flashing image of the Getty images from a GameCube launch of Jason Alexander holding a GameCube or holding a fucking Game Boy Advance. And you're like, no, this is what's wrong.
The culture was just so different, right? There is no fucking universe in which Animal Crossing New Horizons comes out in the year 2001 and sells 40 million copies. That just does not happen in the culture of that time.
Yeah, it's funny how there's just so much blanket appreciation for Nintendo now for the, you know, sincere appreciation for the games they make. And they are not edgy games even now. The profile of them is not a million miles away from the games they're making on GameCube.
But the work, I guess, the we did to build the profile of Nintendo or get those games in people's hands and then ingrain a new generation with this appreciation for the iconography and the games they made means that they can sell the Switch now off the back of GameCube games. There are increasing numbers of GameCube games returning to Switch. And just really interesting to see that turn around.
But I think, like you say, it's like, you know, there was the era of the band Carl's Jr. ad with Paris Hilton in a bikini or whatever. Those were those years. So, yeah, the GameCube did seem out of step.
That's a really good point.
I've genuinely never really thought about it like that. And it's so true of just how culturally unlike the things are. As much as I loved GameCube, it was a private interest, you know?
I was at college at the time. And just the idea of talking about GameCube while the very particular music played on MTV in the common room or whatever, it just wouldn't have flown at all. The gulf between those things as well.
Yeah, it's an interesting coming off the back of the Dreamcast, right? Where I think the Dreamcast actually was on the cutting edge of having an attitude that fit the culture at the time. It was a really exciting thing, but there were too many other obstacles for it to break through.
And maybe it was still a bit too Japanese to really pop off in the big, wider culture of the early 2000s, but I think it was better poised to do that if Sega hadn't had so many roadblocks in its way to success at that point. The GameCube was just, even when they tried to fight back on that sort of kitty image they had, with Reggie coming in and doing his, you know, I'm here to kick ass and take namespeech or whatever, it was still the cringey corporate version of we're edgy now. They were trying, they recognized that they were out of step, but they couldn't really change that.
Because that is not Nintendo, right? They are not that company. And I think it shows when you look back on that Twilight Princess reveal from E3, where everybody in the room is just melting down, and they're so excited to see the hardcore Link come out, and he's frowning, he looks angry, and the graphics and all that shit.
But it hasn't aged, that moment, that trailer does not age well. It feels tryhard. It feels like them trying to adapt to what was trendy, but it was not what was in their heart.
And eventually the culture changed, people's tastes changed, interests splintered off enough that Nintendo can be largely more true to itself, I think, and still find great success with its games in the modern age.
They gave a Gayboy Advance a tribal tattoo.
I mean, what clearer example is there than that?
That is an interesting segue actually, Wes, is the Gayboy Advance is obviously happening at the same time as the GameCube and was significantly more successful. It did only last for around four years, which is shorter lifespan, the Gayboy, which went on forever, of course, and then the DS and 3DS, which were a little bit closer to the seven year mark. So I guess like the Gayboy Advance, similar to the GameCube, why does it have this enormous reputation despite that?
Because when you look up a list of the best games on the platform, a lot of it is remakes, but it's remakes of stuff that was actually very welcome at the time, which that was kind of one of the things I think maybe goose that level of interest, is that there was a lot of SNES nostalgia from around that time, or these games were not easily accessible before. But what has powered the GPA's modern reputation, do you think?
It's a great question because it is wild to think about it only being out and relevant for four years, like you say. I mean, that's like in the same period that Squaresoft was releasing 100 bangers on the PS1. They were doing Aaron Sorkin on Coke levels of productivity from like 97 to 2000, right?
And the GBA was kind of the same where it feels like it was around twice as long as it was. Maybe that's because the evolution from the Game Boy to the Game Boy Pocket to the Game Boy Color was like, that thing was around for so long and was such a kind of minor evolutionary steps each time. Even though the Game Boy Color added color and was more powerful, it was still pretty close to that original hardware.
So I think maybe when the GBA came out, it had that kind of, like it's the year 2000, we're advanced now, it's edgy, it's got a new design for the first time really since the Game Boy was debuted. The Game Boy Color is kind of just looks like a slimmed down Game Boy more or less. So the GBA was, I think it hit that sense of newness when it came out and it was able to run, maybe this is the first time where we really had that phenomenon of like all the new, this handheld device can run something you were playing on your TV a few years ago.
I don't know if that's historically true, but maybe it feels right. The fact that you could play a Super Nintendo game on the GBA was probably pretty freaking exciting at the time it came out.
That's a good point, actually. Yeah, I hadn't really considered that factor because, yeah, that was definitely the defining element of the handhelds that would follow as well, like the PSP, you know, bringing that kind of like more, yeah, PlayStation 1 to even 2 era experience to a handheld. So, yeah, it's a key part of the mix for sure.
Yeah, I think it's Matthew, I was also curious to know from your perspective why you think there's so much GBA nostalgia, because it's not something we talked about loads in the podcast. I know we're threatening to do a GBA draft at some point. But do you think that's what it is?
It was just we have actual Mario Kart in your hands and that's pretty special for the time.
Yeah, I think that's part of it. You know, it feels like it's a continuation of like a different line. It's a continuation of 2D Nintendo game making, whether direct remakes of the series or series that you loved on the NES or SNES, you know, Castlevania on GBA is a great example of like if you have that natural affinity for it, you know, it is still the home of many great JRPGs, whether they were remakes or things like Golden Sun, which were amazing.
So, I mean, yeah, scratching that 2D itch. It's weird because the narrative in certainly in games magazines in the UK was once we entered the sort of 3D era, mags started getting a little bit sniffy about 2D games on more powerful hardware. That was often like a negative mark in the review of like, you know, why aren't you using this power to make a 3D game?
This is preposterous, but maybe having this space where that stuff can continue more naturally and not feel like a kind of waste of power, whatever that means helps. But I don't know if that really has much of an impact, you know, if that's just a weird UK games mag hang up.
I wonder if it had a big impact at the time, but I think at least in retrospect, it absolutely has in that if you think about looking back at games from the PS1 era, PS2 era, and then especially like on the DS, like early 3D stuff does not hold up well, often visually, but especially from a camera control perspective and you know, all of that stuff. And I think the GBA with hindsight has the benefit of being a really good platform for pixel art. Like it's just high res enough that you can have some really expressive sprites and all of that stuff.
And it was a very colorful system to look at screenshots of on your computer, partially because they had to way oversaturate everything because the screen was so fucking dim on that thing. So when you look at a screenshot of like what's the Zelda game? Minish Cap, right?
You look at a screenshot of it and it's so vibrant and it looks so freaking nice on your computer monitor. And that was because you're not having to get it under a lamp and look at the initial model of the GBA. The SP obviously solved that.
So I think when we look back at these games and you can upscale, pixel perfect upscale pixel art, and GBA games just look so nice. And it was kind of the last era of a handheld or a console, really, where you were only getting those kind of games. You know, like, yeah, you can have really good 2D on a DS for sure.
But not everybody was doing that. It was, you know, maybe half the library or less probably. And on the GBA, like, everything is potentially gorgeous pixel art outside of like X versus Sever or something like that.
Yeah, you know, even X versus Sever had its moments for a dooma like on a GBA. Where's that? I'm curious, as someone who was, you know, following the JRPG genre, the GBA was huge for that as well.
You mentioned Breath of Fire there. But like, there's also like Tales of Phantasia on there and some pretty good ports of like Final Fantasy 1 and 2, for example. It was a big, big platform for that genre.
Was that significant for you in terms of you deepening your understanding of the JRPG?
I didn't play too many on there. I did play the Lunar remake. I think it was called Lunar Legend or Legends or something like that.
I didn't play a whole lot. Yeah, I played Breath of Fire. Tales of Phantasia, I actually played on a Super Nintendo emulator years before that because there was a fan.
It was like maybe the first fan translation of a game I ever played that one of my friends found. I don't think I even really understood what it was other than like, this is a game that was never released here, but now you can play it in English. And I remember it had like a really raunchy fan translation.
Like there's a line in the game where one of the characters says, I bet she fucks like a tiger because it was this like really aggressive member of your party. That yeah, that would that did not make it into the GBA version of that game for sure.
It's more about a madman dialogue, that kind of thing. That's a little bit out there.
Did you ever do anything with GBA GameCube Linkup? Did you ever play any of those games?
Yes, I loved. Well, I wouldn't say I loved Crystal Chronicles. I loved the idea of it.
I loved the Four Swords game. That was really good. Only played it with one friend.
Crystal Chronicles was really cool, but it was such a barrier to entry to get those get like a friend over who has a GBA and spent the 20 bucks or whatever on the link cable and get it all hooked up and everything that we didn't do it much. That was definitely one of Nintendo's like less thought through concepts for a for a cool tie in. But it was the games that they designed around it were quite fun.
It was just so difficult to really experience them. But but I wish to this day that they would do something with Four Swords Adventures because it was it was a great game and like you could easily replicate that online now.
They put out that weird little free version on DSI. Do you remember that?
Yeah, that was the one that was part of the link to the past cartridge, I think.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah, that was good, too. But that's the last time they like acknowledge it existed, right?
That feels like something they'll salvage at some point, you know?
Yeah, they should just shove it on like Nintendo Switch Online subscription.
They really should.
So, Wes, as someone who covers the ambulation scene, what are some hidden gems on the GBA and GameCube, in your opinion?
So, I made a short list here in the notes doc, which I don't think these will probably be a surprise to anybody who has played GBA, or at least most of them won't be. But I mean, if you haven't played Mother 3, that's not a hidden gem, but it's a game you should absolutely experience, like regardless of whether you've played Earthbound, even if you don't like Japanese RPGs, I think it's worth playing. It is a truly incredibly written game.
It holds up so, so well. It's so expressive, despite being, you know, limited to quite simple sprite art on the GBA.
Is it very nihilistic, that game, where it's at its outlook? I remember when I, I think maybe there was a Retro North episode about it, or I read an article, but it sounded like quite intense, the themes of the game, and maybe that was part of the reason it never came here.
Intense, definitely. You need to play Mother 3. It's really worth experiencing.
I would not say it's nihilistic. It's one of those kind of stories that is deeply sad and about cynicism and death and big things, but also like very hopeful and sweet in some ways. So I think it is a story that expands far beyond a Game Boy Advance cartridge.
It's the kind of thing that leaves you with feelings and things to ruminate on much greater than you would expect from... I mean, even from a Final Fantasy kind of story, it is much more reserved than that, and it has plenty of silliness in it, but it is certainly more of a thinker's game. If you read anything about Itoi, the creator of the Mother series, and what he does outside of video games, his design and philosophy stuff, it makes sense, the kind of game that Mother 3 is, coming from someone like him.
It is not really concerned with telling an epic adventure story the way so many RPGs are.
Right, right. Gotcha. Okay, cool.
Yeah, so you put DER next to that in your list. What else would you recommend?
Astro Boy Omega Factor from Treasure. It is one of the great action games ever made. You don't have to know anything about Astro Boy to love this game.
I did not know anything about Astro Boy going in. I'm an anime head, but I have not really ever read any Astro Boy manga or watched any of the cartoon. But it's just, you know, it's Treasure, the same people who made Ikaruga, Gunstar Heroes, you know, so many legendary games and like this game is right up there with them.
It just happens to be about Astro Boy. Kind of a weird one maybe is Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories. I do not have great respect for the Kingdom Hearts story.
I have played the first two Kingdom Hearts games. You would not find them on a list of games that I would recommend to many people. But Chain of Memories is like a cool card battle RPG.
From like now we have like 10 million of those on Steam, right? But at the time it was pretty novel. There were not many games like that.
And it's a very like simplified retelling of the first Kingdom Hearts PS2 game, but on the GBA. And you're pretty much just going around like nice pixel art environments and then doing like a cool card battle system. There's not, it's like pretty light touch in terms of the story and everything.
So you really could play this game and not pay any attention to the Kingdom Hearts-ness of it. It doesn't have a lot of that bullshit that would come to define these games and just be like, yeah, this is a cool battle system and like the art's really nice. So that's one I recommend.
You've picked two games there where it's actually that I hoovered up when I bought my DS and made the most out of the GBA slots. So I bought Astro Boy for like £9.99. It was just like a fire sale.
I just sold for no money in Europe because it just, you know, Astro Boy has no real cultural footprint here. So yeah, I agree with you. That game is amazing.
Like Matthew knows it's going to be one of my draft picks when we finally do that GBA draft, I'm sure.
You hope it will be one of your draft picks.
Very true. But I think, you know, the magic of that game is there is a lot of Astro Boy lore in there, but it kind of just it's in the form of like very brief character encounters. And the overall story it tells is very good because you basically lose the first playthrough.
It's like the apocalypse, the end of the first playthrough that you kind of reset and restart until you keep going until you find the optimal ending. So I really love that. And on the front of the Kingdom Hearts Train of Memories front, I kind of like I had mixed feelings on it as someone who, you know, maybe like the PS2 game slightly more than you did.
Even I think it's a hilarious flex to expect people to play the GBA game to understand the second PS2 game of your series. But, you know, obviously that's very that's part of the course of Kingdom Hearts. But I do I do think as well, if you like the world ends with you, there's like connective tissue between this and that, right?
In terms of a combat system that is not exactly direct action, but involves, you know, like item usage, like it's like, is it like badges, that kind of thing in the world ends with you? But there's a little a little commonality. Is that do you think that's among the right money there, Wes?
It's been such a long time since I played it, that I don't remember the details of it outside of the cards. It just being that was novel to me at the time. But I think you're absolutely correct in the lineage of those games and like the people who probably worked on them, that this is definitely a predecessor to The World Ends With You.
And I think you can see that even in just the art style of, you know, even beyond just like it's a Nomura game. I think the 2D representation of Kingdom Hearts here, you can definitely see some carryover to the 2D art in The World Ends With You, which is a great game too.
Cool. So what else do you have on your list?
Really quickly mention the Klonoa games on GBA are pretty good. If you ever liked the Klonoa platformers on PS1, PS2. And then this is probably the deepest cut.
It's a weird series. Kuru, Kuru, Kuririn, I think is how you pronounce it. And it's a game where you control a, are you a, you're not really a propeller.
You're a, you're like the pong paddle, but you're just spinning either to the left or the right. And you're like navigating through a maze.
I thought it was like a helicopter from above almost.
That's a good way of looking at it. Yeah, it's just like a weird kind of, I guess you'd call it a puzzle, puzzle game or a puzzle platformer sort of. It's not really a platformer in the way we traditional think of, traditionally think about them.
But yeah, it's just a game where you like navigate mazes. And it's really about just the motion of this thing. You don't really control, you know, you kind of like, you're very limited in your control, right?
And so it just becomes about doing, I guess, geometry in your head in real time or trigonometry. I don't know. It's a cute little game that you would, I think you would look at it and be like, why would I play this?
This looks really dumb. And then like cut to five hours later and you're, you know, 17 levels deep. And you're like freaking out over the like 17 degree angle that you managed to like get your paddle in just as you're going around a curve.
I don't know. It's a weirdly fun little game.
Yeah, that's included on the GBA selection on Switch Online subscription.
Oh, cool. So yeah, people can check that out. I think it had a, critically, it was very well reviewed here, wasn't it Matthew?
So I think people, some people did discover it.
It was definitely big in NGC magazine. Like people were into it. And it doesn't look like anything else.
It's one of those games where you see a screen of it and you're like, oh yeah, that's Kiri Kiri Kiri. And it's like, it can only be that thing. This like pastel, this big, weird blue line.
Okay, that's awesome, Wes. So those are your GBA picks, but you've got a few Game Key games too, right?
Oh yeah, I am curious how many of these Matthew has played. DK Jungle Beat may be the best platforming game ever made.
It's up there, truly incredible. What the Galaxy team did before Galaxy basically. And it's like every bit as good as that should be.
I remember not really knowing what to expect out of this game. I played the Wii version actually, which isn't even as cool because you don't play it with the bongos. You just play it by doing the basically Ravi drums, but as Donkey Kong.
But it's a platformer where I believe you can finish probably every level in the game without touching the ground if you play it perfectly. And when you first start playing it, you're like, oh, I got a combo of like, I don't know, 13 points or whatever, where I managed to bounce on a thing, like zipline on some bananas, you know, bounce to the next one. You're like hitting your drums on beat to stay in the air.
And then once you've been playing it for a few hours, you're like getting through half of a level by doing all of these moves without ever touching the ground and breaking your combo string. And it just, it's a game that like feels so incredible and empowering once you get down the rhythm of it and what DK can do that like, the Donkey Kong Country Returns games, I think get a lot of love. But this is, to me, like this is the far and away the best Donkey Kong platformer ever.
Oh, for sure, for sure.
Yeah, Matthew's extolled the virtues of that before, even if the way to experience it is still trapped on GameCube to a large degree.
Yeah, I mean, the bongos are clearly the best way to play it. But here's a deeper cut, Bomberman Generation.
Oh, nice.
Weird version of Bomberman that has the traditional Bomberman multiplayer mode, but then also has a full campaign with different elemental bombs and almost a light Pokemon-esque thing where you get these companions that can do elemental stuff for you when you're navigating 3D spaces, like kind of an adventure game. I don't know. I haven't played it, granted, since the year 2003 or 2004, so it might not hold up really well, but I remember thinking it was pretty cool at the time.
Yeah, I think it's like a mixed history of like single-player bomb man experiences. So yeah, I think we might have had this game in our office and people on GameStream used to play the multiplayer, I believe is what happened with that one. Yeah, that's cool.
A cool pick. So you got a couple more, Wes, is that right?
Beaten Kytos Origins, which is coming out on the Switch within a few months, I think. That's a great JRPG, one of the last GameCube games. Maybe the last JRPG ever made with pre-rendered backgrounds.
It's an absolutely gorgeous, gorgeous looking game.
What do you think of Monolith Soft's journey as a developer from making these quite niche sort of like propositions on GameCube and Wii to becoming the sort of like, you know, the RPG sort of like masters are seen as now. What do you kind of make of that as someone who did play this game?
I think it's cool to see. I never played the Xenosaga games, though I had one of my friends who was big into the first one. Those never struck me as great, honestly.
They seemed like too cut scene heavy at a time when they weren't doing actually very good cut scenes and too wordy. And I think the first, Batan Kaitos was like, okay, but the second one is really good and has like a strangely good English dub for the time, English voice acting. So I think they were kind of finding their sweet spot around the time that they made that game.
And they think they really stepped it up with the first Xenoblade Chronicles game. And I think they get the love that they deserve, though I personally do not really like the aesthetic of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 or 3 as much as I like the look of like Batan Kaitos or the first Xenoblade Chronicles, honestly. They got a little too like plasticky anime for me.
Though it seems like 3 is a lot better than 2 in that regard.
I think 3 kind of clawed it back to sort of a better middle ground.
But it's cool that they're kind of, are they the only studio doing these like big JRPGs that still give you quite a bit of freedom in how you explore the world? And like they feel like they're not on rails in the way that so many RPGs are at this point.
They still are kind of like fundamentally go to, you know, point A to point B and trigger the next 20 minute cut scene. But once they open up, they definitely have more freedom to them. I don't really know what other people are doing.
Like I don't really play like the Tales games, for example, or the Trails games or whatever the fuck that series is called. And like, wasn't the recent Star Ocean meant to be a bit more like this?
I don't know much about the new Star Ocean other than I was surprised that it came out and it didn't seem like it did super well. But good for them for still being... Good job hanging around, Tri-Ace, like you're still there.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to speak to the character of the JRPG scene where I basically only play Xenoblade because they're all like 500 hours long. So that's all you can play Xenoblade.
That's very nice.
I think I would like to see them do something different at this point. Like they've made enough Xenoblade games for a while. I would love to see them get to stretch their wings and try a different setting, you know, because I think the Tenkaitos is like a really different vibe than Xenoblade.
And it'd be great to see them do something different again, because I think they are a very good studio and they could probably kind of nail whatever they go after. They just need to get the opportunity to do so. But it's tough to launch a new series and put all that money into it for sure.
So, Wes, your final game here really proves your GameCube bona fides, I feel, because this is a true oddity. So why don't you tell us about this one?
Matthew, have you ever played Cubivore?
I haven't played it, but I've covered it from afar.
This is a weird one where, like, going back to my story of just finding Next Generation Magazine at the local grocery store and that being sort of my gateway into reading about video games, this is a game that I just found at my local, like, movie rental shop that had, like, a small selection of video games. I have no idea why, first of all, this game was localized to the United States. Second of all, why it was one of the probably 20 GameCube games that my local rental shop had, because it is so weird.
It is like if Keita Takahashi, the creator of Katamari Damacy, watched, like, 100 hours of nature documentaries and then decided to make, like, Pokemon. Like, this is the game that would result from that. You play as a little cuboid creature.
You start as, like, a baby, and then you kind of grow into an odd-shaped animal. Everything in the world is made of big blocky cubes and rectangles and stuff, and you gradually, like, eat other animals and take on their body parts. And so then you become this weird, ungainly creature with just, like, strange rectangles and cubes sticking off of your body.
And then you get in fights with progressively bigger monsters that can then, like, tear pieces of your cube body off of you. It's a really weird game. It does not try to not be weird.
Like, in the localization for this, they did not attempt to, you know, to sanitize it for a general audience. They were just like, this is the weird-ass game we've got and we're gonna lean into it. And I don't know, I rented this and it never left my mind, even though it is not a great game, I think, by any measure.
But it's, like, one of the most interesting games I've ever played.
I love that it was called Animal Leader, I believe. It's like the translator Japanese title. And Cubivore is as deep and early-North-East energy.
And also that Nintendo chose not to bring that to the US. But Atlus stepped in and did bring it to the US. That's quite an interesting touch there.
We've got you freaks.
We know what you want. That's awesome that you picked this up.
Very, like, pre-Persona being a huge deal, Atlus, right? Like, Atlus in the early 2000s, like, what the heck are we doing? I don't know, let's localize Cubivore.
Yeah, yeah, that's awesome. Also, like, just to sort of underline its slightly cursed nature, originally started development for the 64DD peripheral. What a perfect background for that kind of game.
Amazing. What a great way to round off. So, yeah, thanks so much for joining us, Wes, and talking us through your passion for Nintendo and your career.
It's been awesome having you. So, yeah, thanks for coming along. Where can them people get you on social media?
Well, by the time this podcast comes out, I don't know if Twitter is going to exist or if it'll have just like sunk into the sea, but you can find me if you Google Wes Fenlon, I'll come up. readonlymemo.com is my emulation newsletter. Of course, you can find me on PC Gamer.
Yeah, it was a pleasure to be here. At the risk of throwing out a cursed idea, Sam, if you ever want to do an Excel episode about Babylon and talk about that movie for three to six hours, I would be delighted because I think you're the only other person I know who has seen it and I believe liked it as much as I did, question mark.
Yeah, I did really enjoy it. Like Matthew, you're a bit cooler on it than I was, right?
Yeah, but that's okay. I wouldn't mind observing from the sidelines.
I think as this...
What if just a fascinating sort of disaster of a movie that almost pulls it out? I don't know, I kind of loved it.
There's no reason that it should have existed in the more conservative post-pandemic Hollywood landscape. It's like such an anomaly, a beautiful cursed anomaly. Yeah, I was a big fan of it, but yes, that's something for us to ponder whether Matthew can sort of sigh through three hours of that podcast about that one thing.
I'll sit there looking like Tobey Maguire in that film.
So yeah, thank you so much for having me on.
Yeah, of course, Wes. Thank you so much. And Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzill underscore pesto.
Awesome. I'm Samuel W. Roberts.
If you'd like to support the podcast, we're patreon.com/backpagepod. XL episode this month. 20 games we think deserve a remake.
XXL Mission Impossible movies ranked. I've still got two and six to watch from that series. So excited to discuss those.
Yeah, and I can't remember what else I say at the end of the podcast. Farewell.
