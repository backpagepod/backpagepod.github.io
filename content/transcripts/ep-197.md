Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Sorry, I do that in a dumber and dumber way every single time. It's S really, S, like, yep, you've noticed. Matthew, that's good.
Okay, so Matthew, we are joined by another special guest for this draft episode, because the last draft, which you won with your collection of PS4 games, I mean, PC games, managed to really baggy the vote there marginally by 1% plus a Twitter poll broke. It was a great experience all around, really.
Well, it was for me.
Yeah, well, yeah, evidently so. We are back with another three-person draft, because I thought that would add a little bit of spice to this one. So joining us for the PlayStation 4 draft is returning guest Dave Scarborough.
How's it going, Dave?
Hello. How's it going? Yeah, I'm doing good, thank you.
How are you both?
Yeah, not too bad, thank you.
Very excited to be here, to be in a draft. I'm a fan of all drafts of all kinds. And yeah, I'm just, as you know, a very competitive person, so excited to throw down the gauntlet and try and win this thing.
Excited to have you back, Dave. I think that this is particularly relevant to your interests because you're one of many, many people who own the PS4. But also I worked with you on GameCM during the year that the PS4 released and the Xbox One released 2013.
That was when we worked in the mag together, had to put these black boxes on the cover about eight fucking times to try and make them interesting each time. So we both were covering that narrative live as it was happening. I say live, I mean on a basically two and a half week time delay as it went to the printers.
But nonetheless, some expertise there for sure. How's the MCU treating you, Dave? I know that you're synonymous with the Marvel Cinematic Universe on Twitter.
How are you feeling about that particular area of pop culture these days?
Just lovely. Actually, I've shifted more to the DC EU recently.
I just started watching the Shazam movies. I don't know much about this Zachary Levi guy, but he's very charismatic and I think he's got a big career ahead of him.
Yeah, his views on medicinal companies seems to be definitely on the level for sure.
I don't know anything about that, but yeah, definitely a big fan of his output. No, the MCU is good. We've got Agatha for a long, come on.
That's the show we've been waiting for for years. It's absolutely living up to the anticipation and the hype that we all had for it. No, it's actually quite funny.
Very liberal use of the word we there.
It's actually quite fun. I like Catherine Hahn a lot and it's just kind of a, a not very serious sort of spooky Halloween treat. You know, it's a three-star entertainment that Sam will probably watch in about six months time and you know, tell me it was a pile of crap.
Well, I don't know about that. I liked WandaVision. I just questioned the sense of doing a Mayor of East Town parody in 2024, when that show feels like pandemic ass content.
That just feels like a long time. It feels like centuries ago, but I'm pleased to hear that it's treating you well. Otherwise, Dave, Dave was last on for our Spider-Man 2 episode last year, which is an interesting one.
Cause me and Matthew talked about it in retrospect. And I think I was, I, it's the one time actually a comment said, this sounds like an advertorial. They sounded like what they said that we were a bit too positive on it.
And it's funny because almost a year hence, I do feel a little bit cooler on that game than I did. And I, I did think I was holding back a little bit to not sort of like rain on your parade a bit in that episode. So consider this a corrective to, to that that I like Spider-Man 2 a little bit less than I did last time Dave was on.
So important to point that out. Okay, Dave, so, you know, you're joining us for this, this PS4 draft. It's exciting.
We've got 10 categories, all going to be competing, similar to deal to the PC gaming draft. But as ever have our beloved preamble here, probably won't be quite as long as the PC gaming one. That was an hour long preamble.
This is, we're recording this on a Monday night. So our aim is to keep it a little bit shorter. Plus I feel like we talked about some of this stuff before Matthew.
So I think that will help. We definitely covered this area when we did best games of 2013. And some of our assorted PlayStation content around it.
So key narrative of the PS4 then at launch is Sony is ice cold during the PS3 generation. Though the console progressively got better in terms of software over the generation, and it arguably had a better back half of the gen than Xbox did in terms of exclusives. It was just, the PS3 was this overpriced multimedia device.
People didn't really like it. It wasn't great to develop for. It kind of languished a little bit sales-wise until they launched a slim model.
Then it kind of took off a little bit. But generally speaking for PlayStation, relatively speaking, it was a failure. It's still a pretty big success.
I think it's still ultimately outsold the 360. But for Sony who are used to the PS2 and PS1 being massively dominant, it was a bit of a change in fortunes and it just wasn't that convincing a machine. It was a flawed favorite, the PS3.
That's very much how we've kind of like adopted it on this podcast. So what do you each remember about the environment that PS4 was launching into? Dave, I'll start with you.
It was that shifting sands that we were experiencing in games journalism. We were moving from I guess analog media into digital, and so what I remember very clearly was Xbox really trying to embrace that, and then Sony was just doing counter-programming constantly. Whatever Xbox was pulling out there, Sony had some sort of rebuttal that was either more in line with what community and players wanted or it came in at a lower bar for entry.
That's my main memory of it. It was always like, well, here's the price of Xbox. Well, we're undercutting it.
We're going diskless. Well, we're going to have a disk drive. Disks are important, retail is important.
You can't share with your friends. We absolutely can. You can trade with your friends, do whatever you want.
It's your game to do whatever you like with. I remember it just being very competitive and Sony really being out for blood in terms of getting back that dominance of the market to your point, which didn't really exist in the PS3 era.
Yeah. I think that's basically where they were at and then what they were stepping into off the back of that. Matthew, what do you remember about this transition point between PS3 and PS4?
I know PlayStation wasn't your focus area at this moment. You were deep in the Wii U mines.
Yeah. I was there thinking I'd hate to be going up against the Wii U. We had an internet browser with a privacy curtain.
That was exciting. I remember it feeling like definitely both the 360 and the PS3 felt like they were, if not quite cooling off, were entering those sort of slightly choppy waters of trying to kind of dip into the expanded audience that Nintendo cultivated with the Wii. And that stuff just wasn't very satisfying.
Like what Xbox had with, you know, the kind of connect to the latter years of that. And Sony less to that extent, you know, still was a little bit like Move ones and Ike cameras and all that kind of crap, Wonder Book. Was that a thing?
Did I imagine that? I think that was a thing.
That was correct. That was part of the whole Move camera. Yeah, right.
Pushing to casual thing that happened. Yeah.
So, you know, it definitely felt like, you know, you need something new and it was time. Like I remember feeling a little bit disinterested in games in general, but I was just so focused on trying to sell the concept of the Wii U, which, you know, had already been out for like, you know, six months when these consoles were announced and was sort of already in the midst of like violently shitting the bed. So we just had so much to kind of, you know, keep our hands full at the time.
I did kind of jump the gun going into the sort of start of the console war. But yeah, to your point you made earlier, I think as well, towards the end of that generation, I really remember Sony starting to come out with interesting exclusives. You know, we had The Last of Us towards the end of the PS3 era.
We had Uncharted 3. I was just sort of like getting my feet under the table at games TM at the time. And I just remember it was a more interesting time for exclusives on PlayStation versus Xbox.
I don't know if you remember that differently, Sam, but that's only what my takeaway is of just towards the end of that generation.
Yeah, all I remember about Xbox at the end of that generation is you have Halo 4, which is pretty good and very good technical showcase for the console. Even if the campaign wasn't quite as beloved as a bunch of Halos were, you had Gears of War Judgment and you had, after Fable 3, they're kind of done for, and then you have Fable The Journey after that, which is obviously kind of the last hurrah. Well, not quite the right word maybe, but the last major new Fable project that Lionhead gets to release.
So you can see that things are changing, that there is this push towards casual players, and we know that that kind of ends in tears for all involved. What's interesting about the start of this generation, the next generation, is that Sony and Microsoft switch places in how they announce their platforms and how they position them. So Xbox, which is still under Don Mattrick, goes all in on consoles being a multimedia device.
Sony learned their lesson from the PS3 where they were pitching a multimedia device and focused on the games. They were just selling a games console, quite notably as well. I would say that the Kinect was like a much bigger conceptual success than the PS Move.
PS Move was just not quite as neat. So I don't think they necessarily had as much sort of stake in that side of things. So while the Xbox One had a Kinect, basically that came with it, that you had to pay for as part of the console package, Sony just focused on pretty hardcore games when they announced it.
It was like destiny was front and center. It was Killzone, not necessarily the most exciting, but The witness was there when they unveiled the PS4, for example. So I think it's interesting.
You basically have Sony learning their lesson, focusing on games and Microsoft not learning the lesson that Sony had learned, despite succeeding against that approach previously. It was quite odd that it happened, but it would seem very dramatic in the moment, and something that there's no real comparison point to now. Matthew, what do you remember about those dueling console reveals?
Dave summarized it really nicely in terms of the back and forth rally that was going on. I just remember like Xbox One as a general disaster zone, because we sat opposite official Xbox magazine, hearing the kind of nervous laughter of how they were going to sell certain things. You know, everyone had been laughing at us, trying to kind of put the sort of positive spin on Wii U, and then, you know, you could see another team kind of in real time, realising they had sort of as much of an uphill struggle.
I think what's interesting about the PS4 announcement, less so the games, like I think you're right in that, you know, games were a focus, but I think the actual like very first wave was quite poor, and not particularly interesting, or they wouldn't go on to be very good games, a lot of them. But definitely the talk about the hardware, the fact that it was all headed up by old Mark Cerny. It feels like in that reveal, it invents the playbook for every bit of console announcement that's followed, which is, we listen to developers, this is what the developers ask for, and so this is what we've put in the console.
these are the people who make the games you like, so we're trying to empower them, and people were just so scared of being perceived as a hostile development environment, which was always the problem kind of attached to or perceived with the PS3. So it was a little dry, but it was also super effective. I think it actually kind of picked up way more at E3.
I remember that's when like you actually had some games people were interested in. I think that's where Bloodborne turns up. indies get a good push.
You know, you get Bastion and Don't Starve and Octodad, and it just sort of showed that they were putting that stuff front and center while Xbox was still scrabbling. At least that's kind of how I remember it.
It's the only E3 conference of Sony's I ever got to go to. And it was just this huge moment. I remember Kingdom Hearts 3 being revealed there and Final Fantasy XV being re-revealed because it was Versus XIII.
And then I remember this transition screen where the XV logo comes up and all of that kind of happening. It's like short of the 2015 E3 where they announced FF7 remake Shenmue III and The Last Guardian came back in the same conference. I don't think there's a more dramatic one to be at.
It felt like you were truly at the heart of games, at that particular E3, I remember. And poor old Dave was back at home filing copy while I was swanning around and staying in the lowest quality Howard Johnson's hotel chain that Imagine Publishing could afford. Dave, what do you remember about these dueling console reveals?
I don't know if you feel the same way, but it felt like they were also... That was like the transition from those more stuffy conference call style press conferences that we will reveal conferences, whatever you want to call them, that they used to have to something more akin to what we have now. It was sort of halfway between the two where it was less about sort of going.
I remember sitting in a PlayStation conference previously where they went over sales figures for the PSP and the PS Vita and then sort of were revealing the 3D TV and all sorts of other stuff that they had going on outside of actual games. Whereas this felt more of that sort of very specific focus on experiences, games, developers, and it felt more in tune with what players and community members wanted at that time. And so yeah, it felt like it was like a shift towards that direction.
I don't know, am I right in thinking that?
It's interesting because we sort of charted this when we were doing all the different best games of different year episodes, and that's definitely a thing that happened, like the, even when you got to the later sort of like Jack Tretton years where they were doing like Kevin Butler and stuff on stage at Sony, they were still doing a lot of the kind of dry business talk. And yeah, you're right, by this point, it kind of becomes like shotgun out trailers back to back and see what the response is. And it becomes entertainment and replacing business in a way that had taken a long time to sort of get to that point.
But yeah, you're right, like the state of plays and things like that, that the larval form of that is basically this this kind of conference.
But it still had developers on stage, it still had personalities there. And it felt it felt very authentic, but it didn't. Yeah, it didn't have those jokes.
It didn't have that filler. It didn't have that. What felt like, you know, very forced product placement sort of shoved into the middle of this gaming conference.
It felt it felt like a good sort of direction it was pointing towards. Now, obviously, it's more just trailer after trailer after trailer, which is very different.
You don't see any graphs. That's simple. No, no graphs, no pie charts.
No people on stage pretending they're playing the game going, Oh, wow, look at this. You do really well. You know, each other, you know, they're playing co-op games.
That was what I remember a lot of. But this, I don't remember the Xbox reveal at all, the Xbox One reveal. I do remember the PlayStation 4 reveal.
It was in February of, it would have been 2023, sorry, 2013, right? And I was in hospital. I don't even know if you remember this, Sam.
I was nearly dying of a horrible infection I had and I was in a hospital ward using my 3G on my phone to watch the conference in little 10-minute chunks before buffering would kick in. It was a very unenjoyable experience while surrounded by old men groaning from the various pains and ailments that they had in the middle of the night. It was not great.
So on the plus side, I avoided having to write any copy around it, but on the bad side was I had lots of tubes connected to me and I was watching it on a tiny screen.
It's not ideal, is it? I remember the Xbox reveal because I vividly remember I was at a bethesda press trip for Wolfenstein, The New Order and Evil Within, on this Adam west Batman style estate in the middle of just nowhere. I think it even had grounds you could roam basically, and I was just incredibly hung over and then started hearing all the bits and pieces.
I think I'm getting this right, that the game ownership stuff started happening around, almost straight after because I think it was Tom Brownwell's interview for the Xbox One stuff that kind of set the pace. But yeah, I should have noted down which one came first, but I'm pretty sure that Sony's came first, and Xbox's came second. But I can only really remember this through the prism of covering on PlayStation.
Because I remember when the reveal happened, I was on Play Magazine still. I feel like when the Xbox reveal happened, Dave, I think I would have already moved to games TM and you were in hospital. I think I've got that right.
God, I'll figure this out and put a correction in when I'm editing it.
I can't remember either.
Yeah, I can't remember. But yeah, the narrative emerged straight away and it was weird because at this point you've got to remember that 360 was everyone's default platform. Just everyone we knew was playing on 360, multiplayer, stuff like that.
It changed so quickly and by the time you get to June and the conferences, it's like everyone, I think both us and Edge, probably first, Dave, did the PS4 is your new console cover. Basically, PS4 is one. That was just the narrative that emerged.
It was more reasonably priced. It was easy to develop for. They had courted indies, at least at the start of this generation.
Then it just seemed like it was a slam dunk reveal. In general.
They spoke about the consoles before they revealed what they looked like as well. I remember, right? Wasn't the reveal of the PlayStation 4, they didn't actually have it on stage.
You didn't know what it looked like. I think we still had to run with those. I was going to say crappy, but whoever the artist who did them was, did an incredible job.
Those mock-ups of what they may look like. We had the two consoles on the front of games TM, with artist's impression of what they could look like. We had a couple of those different renders across various front covers that we did over the course of about a year, I think, before the actual real ones were revealed.
Man, they're so cursed as well. Just these different low effort renders, basically just the lamest looking things you've ever seen. Then yes, they turned out to be black boxes.
By the way, I did fact-check this. PS4 was revealed months before the Xbox One. PS4 was revealed at the conference in February 20th, 2013.
Then the Xbox was revealed in May. Basically, because they did a May reveal, and then that led into the Xbox Showcase. I think the idea was that they would do the hardware stuff first, and then they would do the game second.
The content of the conferences tells that story, but the narrative got out of their control so quickly because of the game ownership stuff. It just kind of snowballed. It just kind of went from bad to worse.
Sony was there to take advantage. But you know what? Neither console could play PS3 or 360 games, and that was what I was bummed out about at the time, and why I didn't buy a PS4 at launch, because that's why I bought PC instead.
Plus, I went to work on PC Gamer. That might be part of it. In general, the PS4 feels like a lesson in creating reasonably priced console hardware.
It isn't necessarily PC class. PS4 definitely wasn't PC class, but it's accessible to a wide range of people, and it's good enough to play everything, pretty much, for years and years. Why do you each think it was such a big success?
Matthew, let's start with you.
I think it helps that they get their first party act together a bit better outside of Naughty Dog. Certainly, Naughty Dog had really, really come into their own in PS3, but you began to see other studios kind of doubling down on chunky single player experiences. Your studios start coming up with stuff which just really resonates and, you know, it's like easier to be a fan of Horizon in a way than it ever was Killzone, it feels to me, as an outsider to sort of both those franchises.
It helps that it's best place to play all console games, you know, in the same way that 360 played things best the generation before. That's just such an easy sort of win to have and draws people in. And once you've got numbers on your side, it becomes so much harder to win people over because everyone's playing multiplayer with their friends on the same machine and they're kind of locked into an ecosystem.
They spend X amount on games, you know, you see it over and over again. I don't know if this was just me and like how I was playing games and interacting with games or what the social situation was in the future. I didn't feel like the PS4 quite ever became like the place to be in the same way that 360 was the generation before.
Everyone was playing together. And I don't know if that was just the excitement, the sort of shock of the new, the fact that it was probably the first time that online multiplayer was just so accessible and so easy and smooth that by the time the PS4 came along, it wasn't as exciting. I don't really know because I wasn't playing a lot of multiplayer games that generation.
I know loads of people were playing destiny together and they probably say that was bullshit. But I felt like even though the numbers, obviously, don't like back this up at all. I know PS4 was absolutely massive.
I don't know if it certainly to, in my sphere, felt like the be all and end all. But that might just be growing up and changing. That's probably not indicative of anything on the machine itself.
Well, I think what is interesting about that is that what you're describing is basically like the first steps of when online play comes to console, and you have a console in 360 that is brilliant at doing everything you want it to do, straight out of the box basically, or give or take a Wi-Fi dongle, adapter thing or an Xbox Live subscription. But it was so exciting and fresh. You're right that by the time you get to PS4, online multiplayer is not necessarily a new thing.
Now, the PS4 is a much slicker of multiplayer delivery system than the PS3 ever was in terms of interface and things like that. But I do agree, I was never, I mean, I guess part of it for me was definitely working on PC Gamer. But I will admit I was never quite as engaged with the PS4 as I was with the 360 at its peak.
I just really adored the 360. I just thought it was an absolutely killer machine. And I never quite, even though I thought the exclusives were really good on PS4 and made it well worth owning a console for them, it never loved the PS4 like I loved the PS2 or the PS1 or even my PSP.
I just sort of, I don't know, there was some stuff. Yeah.
I just assumed that was an age thing, you know, like I kind of grow out just being like massively obsessed with a piece of hardware. Like I'd grown out of that hardware wars kind of mentality that I think, you know, you have when you're that little bit younger, like, because it usually it's, you know, financially driven for me, at least it was, it's like, well, I can only afford one thing. So I will defend it to the death.
So this is the console I've chosen. Therefore I will, you know, champion it and champion all of the games that I love on it and tell everyone I know to, you know, play with, you know, to buy this, play this with me. So I don't know if that was part of it for me.
I mean, when I look back at the PS4, you know, the way that they approached it from a marketing perspective, not to be a marketing, you know, sort of awful marketing guy. And only, you know, look at things through that viewpoint. But they kind of spend a lot of time validating player attitudes at the time.
You know, they were, you know, not just in terms of the response to what Xbox was announcing, you know, with the lack of, you know, the digital only sort of approach they're originally going to take, or the media platform, or the, you know, no sharing disks. I can't even remember how that worked on Xbox originally.
But it was like a code. I think you registered and then...
Yeah.
Yeah, it was very complex that you could... And then I think you could like, you could trade in, but then you may be able to get a new license for the code, or you had to transfer the license, or something like that. It was very, very intricate and complicated.
But Sony kind of was like, they had clear stances on all of that. They were playing to what gamers were interested in at the time. And on top of that, they were like, they moved away from the casual games market.
They didn't want to compete anymore with the Wii or the Wii U. They were sort of invested in more mature games. It felt like anyway, the games that they were sort of pulling out there were for a different kind of gamer than what they were sort of playing with towards the end of the PS3 genre, sorry, era.
And they're just letting people, and I don't know what, I can't even remember what the slogan was. Was it play with no limits? It was just like this idea of, this is a console for every type of gamer that's out there and we're just gonna essentially supply you with what you want out of a machine at this point in gaming.
Yeah, I think they did market it very well. It was just a very straightforward proposition at a time where both Microsoft and Nintendo were not offering straightforward propositions. The marketing was a bit sort of like fumbled on both sides.
Well, it wasn't the only slogan, but I remember one of the big slogans for Xbox One was all-in-one, input one. Right. I remember looking at that on like house adverts when I took over OXM thinking, what the fuck does that mean?
That doesn't say anything.
It was because you could just, they were like one HDMI cable into one port. So, you didn't need to have multiple leads. It's all on one lead.
Yeah, but you didn't before.
I know.
That's what I didn't get. I thought it was very confusing.
Yeah, it was like, I really recommend watching the 2021 20th anniversary documentary series Xbox did, because it has a really good reflection of this time. They interview Don Mattrick as well, who just becomes the focal point for all of this stuff. It was just quite messy on that side more generally, and Sony was there to jump in.
I think that the interesting thing there that you tap into, Matthew, is that the PS4 generation was a step up in terms of exclusives. They got that act together, like you say. They just had a much stronger lineup of titles.
The PS3 lineup would not really have made sense in the PS4 generation. A lot of first-person shooters very much tapping into the Halo Call of Duty thing. You have three resistance games, you have two Killzone games specifically on PS3, and obviously a Killzone game at launch as well, that doesn't really go anywhere or do anything.
Indeed, that whole studio basically pivots to make something that is more contemporary and exciting to a larger range of people. I was curious, Dave, starting with you, what do you think the lessons are that Sony learns from the PS3 generation in terms of software rather than hardware?
Maybe it goes back to what I was saying. Everyone was looking at what were the successful titles of PS3 and towards the end of it, it was stuff like The Last of Us, it was Uncharted. It was more embracing that more mature mindset and the action adventure mold as it were.
So it was having defining, these very clear iconic heroes in unique settings that played to a very, I guess, standardized template, right? I don't know, am I off base with saying that? It just felt like that whatever, everything that came on the PS4 following the PS3 fit a certain mold because it had proven successful on the PS3, those games like the chat.
Yeah.
Character driven games where you could have a third person character driven games, where you can have a very distinctive character in the key art. That felt like what they were mandated to make.
That perfectly summarized it, yeah, for sure. There were no rough edges on it. It was all very sanded down and neat, and it was something that felt very accessible to a broad market.
That sounds very cynical, but that's always how I've seen it.
I think that was just the sort of flavor of the month, because again, I remember around the midpoint on my time on OXM, they were desperate to push the idea of not mascots, but the hero characters of each games. Sort of why I think they put all that money behind getting Tomb Raider as an exclusive, because they wanted to say like Lara Croft, because she's like Nathan Drake. But the problem they had is they didn't really have anything new coming through.
They had Master Chief, they had Marcus Fenix, then they had Lara Croft. I don't know if you remember this adverts, it had all their faces in profile, but the fourth one was a car from Forza. It was like, you actually have another human here.
We had to do it on covers and do split runs where it was like, and the car, remember him? The car that we all love from Forza Horizon. People were so desperate to tap into that trend, I guess, that you would go to the lengths of one of them being a car.
But you couldn't imagine Sony going back to making a resistance game, in the way that they did in the PS3 era at least, where it was just this muddy, gritty environment with just a faceless protagonist. I remember all of the various box arts for the resistance franchise, and there was never a clear defining protagonist in that series, it's not the one that I remember. We've all played Astro Bot.
Is there a resistance character?
That's a good question. I didn't come across Nathan Hale, the protagonist of resistance 1 and 2, because he is just a bold guy. So Astro Bot is already Nathan Hale.
That's the thing, he's already bold.
I think there were some Killzone hell-gast in there.
Yeah, they're quite distinctive, to be fair.
That's exactly it. It became more about generating iChronography that they can lean into for years to come. I think they were very successful at that versus Xbox, which was still looking at its past to try and generate interest in its future.
Yeah, I think that is true. I think that it helps Sony that the Tomb Raider game they bag, it's pretty good rise of the Tomb Raider, but it's not really Uncharted 4 level in terms of-
Well, you obviously didn't read OXM. Move over Uncharted 4.
That's true.
Was it also a case of Xbox was trying to extend its franchises and continue their stories versus Sony, which was either rebooting their IPs, like in the case of God of War or just inventing all new characters, it felt less like they were interested in continuing the stories that were established either on the PS3 or PS2, and the PS4 being a platform where new stories could be told either with those characters or with brand new ones.
Yeah, I think that's true. The other thing is that I don't think that Sony was ever that great at exclusive games until I think there are signs of it in the PS3 generation. Gran Turismo aside, there's not loads in the back catalog of PS2 and PS1 that you attribute the most impactful games in the platform to Sony.
It's Metal Gear Solid, it's Final Fantasy, it's third party games. It's not games that they make and they own, but the lesson they seemed to take from the 360 era was, oh, we need to have something that is going to move the needle ourselves that we control. And yeah, so that was a huge point of differentiation.
My personal moment of, oh, I didn't realize quite how dominant this platform is. Aside from the 2015 year where they had the reveals I mentioned earlier, it was actually the 2016 year when they revealed the new God of War, God of War 2018, and the way the audience just went absolutely crazy for seeing Kratos again. That particular E3 conference is just like, it's a really confident, lean lineup of seven to eight games.
It's got everything from Days Gone to Horizon and Detroit, some games that are well regarded and retrospect and some that aren't, but it's just so many exclusive, exciting things. They were just so good at cultivating that and making it feel like there was always so much on the horizon.
They also had a great number of internal studios that established pedigree at that point as well. When you heard David Cage is making a new game back then, that was interesting. Sony Santa Monica making a new God Award, that was interesting.
these were internal studios that really did have a certain degree of investment from gamers, more so than potentially I think Xbox had at the time.
Matthew, we talked about this before, but when did the PS4 exclusives truly kick into high gear for you? When does that dominance become cemented?
Dominance, not until 2016 probably. But in terms of like Ratchet and Clank, Uncharted 4, No Man's Sky, just the games with the biggest buzz and Xbox just had like nothing. So it really did feel kind of completely unbalanced.
I mean, it obviously, the turning point is Bloodborne, March 2015, the first truly great game of the generation by all accounts. Up until then, it's a little bit infamous, it's a little bit Killzone Shadowfall, it's quite a bit The Order 1886. And that's kind of tough, but that isn't like, and the other guys were doing brilliantly, I thought it was kind of a horrible first year, I kind of resented both the consoles that I owned at that point.
And after Bloodborne, it's not like there's like an instant explosion, it's a little bit God of War 3 remastered, there's a lot of remasters in those first couple of years. Tearaway Unfolded, which was very sweet and cool, but kind of, you know, obviously was riffing on the more exciting Vita release until Dawn, was that 2015?
That was 2015, yeah.
Yeah, so that's, you know, I think the key thing is, like, things were happening, most of them, like, at worst were like 7 out of 10s, which was better than it had been. And then you're kind of like, tiering up for, you know, if a new thing isn't coming out immediately, at least you know what the next big thing is, you know, if you're not excited for the games you're playing in 2016, you're watching E3 in 2016 and seeing God of War, Days Gone, you're getting excited for Horizon, whatever. And so, it feels like you're locked into the ecosystem, it kind of has you, and that's when, like, PS4 was at its strongest, I thought, because it was just sort of like, you knew what your next four years looked like, and they looked pretty great, and that was really key, where very few other consoles have ever hit that kind of, like, cadence, you know, to be able to give you that kind of confidence in a platform.
Yeah, that's true. The most excited I ever was to own a PS4 was certainly not in 2014, when I got one to play destiny with my PC Gamer colleagues, and thought it was wildly overrated, and not nearly as interesting as I'd been led to believe it was. Just a lot of like, oh, now you're gonna play the same levels over and over again for no reason, because MMOs, I guess, I just didn't really...
600 hours.
Yeah, I just didn't really... I did eventually get destiny and get into it, but it just didn't happen straight away, and I did think I was a bit mixed on the PS4, even though I felt like I had to get one at the end of 2014. But I agree, it's when Bloodborne comes along that that's a game where it explodes, and everyone is playing it, everyone is talking about it, and then that really becomes the focal point for everyone who is playing and discussing games.
But actually Until Dawn is a really good example of another time that that started happening. That feels like a game that if it was on PS3, would never have got the same amount of attention that it did. But just by being a PS4 exclusive, it became this slow burn hit.
More and more people played it, and it became one of the essential games of the platform. Even though it's probably like a low eight, that game, it's not like a masterpiece. It's kind of like a really elaborate version of a Telltale adventure, right?
It's like a branching adventure game, but it looks really nice. It was a cool thing to play through in a weekend on your PS4. And it just felt like, yeah, the console become this hit maker.
So yeah, as the generation goes on, more and more, right up until the final year of the generation, 2020, that's a year that has Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us, Part 2, and Final Fantasy VII Remake in it. That's an absolutely stellar final year for a console. So yeah, I think it takes a bit of time to get going, but once it does, it never really stops.
Also, just to call back very quickly to the episode we did with Jay about japanese games. This is the generation where the kind of AA tier, maybe, if we're going to call them that, of japanese studios really begin to cook, and most of them are still making games for PS4 now, as well as the PS5 versions. This is the generation where you get Yakuza becoming quite as mainstream as it's ever going to be, and Monster Hunter World finally cracks the west, and NieR Automata, and all these things, so that feels it kicks in midway, too.
Mighty No. 9 as well, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's really true. That's a massive part of the narrative of this generation. I'm sure it'll be reflected in our picks to some extent as well, although not Dave, because Dave hates japanese games, but I'm only joking.
That's not true. That's not true. Just the watch you like.
Dave, you covered the launch of these consoles with me. Who had the better launch games at the end of 2013? Was it Sony or Microsoft?
I mean, they both weren't super great. I was looking through the list of launch games for the PS4. You had Killzone, which I actually liked.
I reviewed, I think I gave it a 7 out of 10. It's a deeply 7 out of 10 game, but by gosh, it looked incredible at that time. Visually, it was outstanding, but yeah, it was quite a dull experience, and I have very few memories of it.
You had Lego Marvel. Obviously, I loved that. Actually, I do think that was probably one of the highlights of the launch for both consoles.
It was a time where Lego games are reaching their apex, and that was a really fun license for them to grab hold of. Where they were able to juggle the various abilities of the superheroes in an open-world setting.
I loved that game, too. That was a good game.
Then you had NAC, you had Call of Duty GOES, you had Black Flag.
Had resogun.
resogun was great. Actually, Housemarque did an incredible job with that. We did a lot of coverage for that on gamestm, I remember.
But it wasn't outstanding. Xbox had Rise was the highlight for me. I had to cover both.
Was there a Forza? I can't remember.
Yeah, there was, I want to say five.
Yeah, there was Dead Rising 3. I actually thought Dead Rising 3 was the best game of that.
I would say so.
A bunch of launch stuff. I know that it's like that series by the fourth one, people are just done with it. But it was the shiniest thing that Xbox had for sure.
It was just, and it looked so, had this Walking Dead TV show color palette to it, and I gave it a seven for gamestm, but I thought it was actually like, as a launch game goes, it's a pretty good way to show off what the console can do. So yeah, I think like resogun is probably like the default winner, but I personally probably prefer the Xbox lineup because I think Rise is like not, you know, not considered a classic, but it's really like not that bad. I think it just had too much on its shoulders at the time to be like, yeah.
It was just super short. It was like five hours long, you know, which was held against it, but it was really compelling. Visually, it was breathtaking, and I reviewed it.
I can't remember what I gave it. I want to say I gave it an eight. But I found it compelling from start to finish.
It's hard to remember exact beats of it, but I remember it got pretty trippy at the end. It did some really interesting things narratively. So I rated that.
But yeah, there was nothing that really, however many years we are now, 10 years on, that we can look back on, say, was a Stone Cold classic, resogun probably being the closest. So as launches go, it was pretty underwhelming. Yeah.
But it was an exciting time to write about the consoles. I think there's probably, I mean, I think for me, I did free console launches technically during my time at GameCM. I did the Wii U, I did the PS4, and I did the Xbox One.
And I think as a journalist, that's probably one of the more exciting time periods that you can cover as a console launch. It's just like, there's just an energy, and you see it from the readership, you see it in the office, and it's just like, it's really invigorating to kind of, you know, not know what the next piece of news is gonna be, you know, get invited to try out these games and sort of see what the new technology has in store for the years ahead. It's just a really exciting time to be someone who gets to write about games during one of those launches.
Yeah, I think that's completely true, unless it's the pandemic, and you have to write about PS5 and Xbox series. That was bleak times, brother. That was not good.
It wasn't even that glabrous at the time. To do a PlayStation, to do a PS4 launch or a Wii launch, I don't know, Matthew, you may have had a much better experience than myself, but for both of those, you're taken to the office, the UK offices of either of those companies, and you're just sat in a boring room, like a tiny little room, and if you're lucky, you get a window, and you're just put in front of the console for seven hours. If you're lucky, they'll give you lunch, and you just have to play the games, and then you leave.
There's no theatrics to it. There's no razzmatazz. It's a pretty sort of mundane experience around it.
The games can be great, but you would expect on the outside, looking in, that there would be something, there'll be more of a show that the publishers or the hardware manufacturers have put on, but it's not really. It's a pretty uninteresting non-descript experience.
Yeah, sounds about right.
Matthew, can I also ask you what you thought the best launch lineup was of these games? I'm not saying that either of them are like classic lineups. They're definitely not.
They're like pretty flawed, and I actually don't really get, when you look at this, I guess like the Kinect thing and the Price thing and the Power thing, that was like all working against Xbox, but I really do think it takes until 2015 for there to be anything in it between these two consoles in terms of actual games. What do you think?
Yeah, I remember playing Assassin's Creed Black Flag on PS4 at Christmas. That was like my big Christmas game. So I have a bit more kind of affection for this early part of PS4.
I hear you on Rise and Dead Rising 3, though I do think they're both games that made a lot more sense for like Atena when they were inevitably pre-owned, like six months later. God, I mean, like in terms of actually a good game, Rezogun is not quite like a genre I'm in love with, but that is technically the best game in both these lineups. But it's an arcade score chaser, which appeals to like 1% of gamers probably.
So let's call it a tie.
I think that's fair. So my last question before we get to the draft is like, is this the playbook for a line up of console exclusives? Is this as good as it ever gets on PS4?
So if you're launching a console now, is this what you want? You've got a shiny open world game that really like shows what the hardware can do. A distinctive Souls-like game from literally the creators of that genre.
You got two naughty dog all-timers, a revival of a classic series that feels right for the moment. Even if some of us might mourn its more problematic elements being left to history. A kiddie platformer, Ratchet and Clank, a racing sim for Boars, that's Gran Turismo there, and a samurai lad slicing blokes up and bearing his ass in a hot tub.
That's not even to mention our guy Deacon St. John Matthew. these are just some of the amazing treats that emerged on PS4. Is this a playbook, do you think, for what a great lineup of exclusives is?
I'd say if it's a playbook, it's not one that anyone's particularly reading from anymore, which is a bit of a bummer. What excites me about this is it's so single-player focused and that was just the strength of the PS4 of this generation. For the considerable number of people who weren't interested in just playing Fortnite for 10 years or Call of Duty every year, it felt like it was harder to find your home and these exclusives really spoke to that.
And definitely the sentiment now is people wishing there was more of this and that people wouldn't forget this and like, where is this push for live service coming from? What in our behaviour told you that we were the right audience for loads of live service games? Because it's quite hard to see in this generation where that kind of leaning would come from.
So by the end of this generation, I think most of these things will have happened. It's easy to look at like Concord or wherever and go, but actually, I do think PlayStation are still kind of doing most of these things. Two naughty dog bangers, that ain't going to happen.
No, that feels like that live service hell has chewed that one up, unfortunately, that's a shame. I agree, yeah, the single-player focus was what was exciting about it, to invest this much in just single-player games was like, I don't know, just so, it felt like there was just intent behind it, there was like a strategy behind it, it wasn't just, and it wasn't just financial, it was like, it was like about positioning the brand, and which again, not very exciting, marketing speak, but it is exactly what they were doing, they were building like these, they were selling you iconic characters and these, and the worlds they belong to. And it was, yeah, it was, they managed to make huge moments out of all these games.
I think you're right, we'll get to the point, maybe where all of these things are on PS5 too, but the cadence of them has felt like much slower this generation. And we are, in theory, four years into the generation, like this over halfway or about halfway. So how many more of them we'll actually get is an open question, but you know, certainly I think at the time the cadence felt was really impressive.
Dave, what do you think? Is this like the best lineup of exclusives outside of a Nintendo platform ever?
I mean, yes, I think so. Like I'm looking through the games I've got noted down in my various categories on the spreadsheet I've prepped because I did prep. I came prepared for battle.
And it is phenomenal. As you say, that cadence just doesn't seem to exist anymore. Dev times have just gotten longer.
The budgets have inflated. It seems impossible to be able to sort of produce, you know, games of this quality, of this sort of high production values to like at the regularity that they once did. I'm not sure studios still had the capacity to have like big teams working on two titles at a time.
So you have more stuff coming. You know, I remember going, I went over to Guerrilla games to talk to them about Killzone in Amsterdam. And they were working on Horizon at the same time.
And they had the sort of like, they just had the studio sort of divided into two and you weren't allowed access to the other side. And I'm just not sure if there's that like, I'm sure that does happen. But like, I'm sure there's less of like, that the window isn't as narrow as it once was where they finished one project and the other projects just, you know, 12 to 18 months out.
It just seems like we've lost that momentum, which is a real shame because, as you say, looking back at the PS4, it was just great game. Like six months later, another great game. Six months later, it was another great game.
You know, and rarely did any of these sort of disappoint. I wouldn't say any of the exclusives were less than a 7 out of 10. I don't know.
You might. I might be forgetting.
What, The Order and fucking No Man's Sky at launch?
Okay, I would say The Order is a 7, personally. That is a fun game. Kind of the same.
Same deal as Rise, you know.
Nackstross.
That's still in the PS4 backlog, Dave.
It was good enough they made a Nack 2.
That's true. Who are the people who played Nack 2? I want to meet them.
All 10 of them, I want to meet them. Yeah.
Mark Cerny's family are lovely people and you shouldn't speak of them like this.
Yeah. He's a great guy. No doubt he's a great guy.
But yeah. So it's interesting. I do think that that's what makes this a good draft, is that there are so many big exclusives, but there are also games that are defining PlayStation 4 games that aren't necessarily Sony exclusives too.
So the mix of stuff is hugely competitive. I actually think if me and Matthew had just done this draft with the both of us, it would have been a really obvious set of picks of just, well, we grabbed all the cool exclusive things, and now the draft is over. Having three picks does make it harder, more competitive, and there is a deep lineup of stuff to choose from, and that's a credit to this console's amazing lineup of exclusives.
I'm just worried it's going to be a real knife fight over GTA Online in multiplayer again.
Or GTA 5:, should I say.
Yeah, and Metal Gear Solid V, that classic PC game, PC series. I'm sure that will come up again.
Did it come out on PS4? I wasn't aware.
So yes, we have those treats to look forward to. yes, the draft will begin shortly, and no doubt the vibe change in the podcast will be significant. So excited to hear Dave grab Call of Duty Black Ops 3, and probably nine other first-person shooters after the break.
Welcome back to the podcast. So time for the draft bit of the draft. How exciting.
So Matthew, first question, how much is Bloodborne going to fuck this draft? How much are drive-by Bloodborne assholes gonna just vote for whoever fucking picks Bloodborne?
There's a very good chance Bloodborne will win this draft for many people. I've also seen enough of our listeners go through their logic of like category by category to give me faith that actually you can swing it over the course of a draft. I mean, it's kind of amusing to me because I'm not a Bloodborne guy.
It kind of means nothing to me. So I'm kind of hoping I don't have to pick it and do a really half-assed defense of it because I really don't give a shit about it.
Yeah, it's by default the From game I've played the most. I was checking my stats. I've played it for 48 hours and still only beat two bosses.
Fucking pathetic. Dave, what do you think? Do you think Bloodborne's gonna fuck this draft?
You're more of a Bloodborne guy, aren't you?
I am. Although I probably have a similar experience with NAC that you have with Bloodborne, just hours upon hours into that one. But no, Bloodborne's a lot of fun.
I know you take the piss out of me for being a generalist COD guy, but I'm really into the Souls series and all those games. Bloodborne is just so distinctive. I think it's beloved for a very good reason, and so yeah, it's high on my list to grab.
But I'm an agent of chaos. I'm here just to disrupt you mostly, Sam, because we're both very competitive people and I love winding you up when we play competitive games.
Well, the thing is, it's actually going to be quite... There are so many angles of attack here. I think I thought the games that I would consider PS4 sort of native games, including third-party games, was a lot shallower than it actually is.
And I ended up looking at the Metacritic listings and just seeing that, oh no, there's loads of stuff that is tied to this, or maybe it's like some stuff that's best played here, or some stuff that's just synonymous with this platform, that I hadn't really thought about beyond the really obvious top-line five or six exclusives. So I think it's actually like, I don't know, you can sort of cut off one head, but then another one will go back. There's like, it's going to be a competitive draft right up until the last minute, I think.
I don't think we're going to run out of stuff.
There's only one category I actually struggled with, but there's still good choices in that category. The rest of them, I've got like three, four, five, six different options for each one, so I'll walk away happy. The question is, will you walk away happy?
And that's...
If we get a good podcast, I'm happy, genuinely. I don't know. I will admit to being more invested in wanting to win that PC gaming draft than this one.
This one, I just don't... Because I don't love PS4 quite as much as I guess, because I worked on PC Gamer during that period, I had a lot of pride tied up in it. Then I had to watch a load of listeners who didn't understand what PC gaming is vote for GTA V, which was really annoying.
I will admit, it was still annoying.
I had nine other games. I don't want to get into it, but I had nine other games. They may have liked those games also.
We can all get our excuses out now, Sam, if you want. You know, there's many... We can all have reasons for losing.
It doesn't matter to us.
The one listener I tweeted is just so pettily at was when someone said, Yeah, good games, but they're not GTA 5:, are they? Crying, laughing, emoji. And I responded with, Ah, you seem to have misunderstood.
This was a PC gaming draft. Grand Theft Auto V was first released in 2013 and later released on PC in 2015. So as you can see, it's not really a PC game, but that's as petty as I ever got.
And it was just like, you know what? There's too much energy going into this. And then I just thought, fine, I've lost.
The poll is broken. Who knows? votes lost in time like tears in the rain.
Tough stuff.
One of my burner account strikes again.
I agree. This one's all about bants for sure. It's going to be fun.
I think you should tell people, Sam, about what happened when we played Movie Grid. Like, how did that end? The last time we had a long run of competitive game going on.
The problem playing Movie Grid with you is that you'd have been playing it. You were like the deeply canceled james Franco first time, a Buster Scruggs gif. Because you kept picking all these bullshit.
There was this james Bond music celebration thing that had 0.1 percent of people voted. Therefore, you would score really highly every time you picked it because you knew what every fucking cheat code was to Movie Grid. I opted out because I felt like it was fundamentally unfair.
I needed a fucking time machine to beat you with that thing.
So the sound of 007 is a legitimate choice. It's a feature of documentary. I told Matthew about this before the pod.
I love that you brought it back up.
I love that you did not do a fucking audio test before I joined late. But you were talking about bloody Movie Grid. That is just so you.
I should explain that why I keep doing the barbs at Dave is that there was a chat I had with him and Ashley Day where Dave said that Call of Duty Black Ops 2 was one of his favorite games of all time. I was quite confused by that. However great you think that game is, I was like-
It was the first Black Ops, just to correct you.
Okay. Well, either way, I was quite confused when we were talking about Red Dead or fucking GTAs or Mario's or Zelda's. You were just like Cod Blobs and we were just a bit confused by it.
That's why those barbs, that's where those have come from.
It's generally one of the best online multiplayer experience that's ever been made. I'm just throwing it out there.
We've got 30 games to discuss. Let's fucking get on with it. So we've got 10 categories as usual, the rules then.
So you get the DLC of any game that you pick, so all the DLC for that game. Spin-off games obviously aren't DLC. I'm thinking you're miles morales' Spider-Man game or Uncharted Lost Legacy, which began life as a DLC.
Those are not DLCs. So keep that in mind when you're voting. less of an impact, I would say, on PS4 than it has on the PC gaming draft.
So we're going to try Twitter again for this one despite its lack of reliability. You just get more votes on there. So even when it fucking breaks, it's still worth it, I think, for the amount of drive-by traffic and making it into more of an event.
It's where the scarbs hive lives.
There's going to be the dual coin toss thing like last time. So whoever wins the first coin toss can go first or second. And the second and third picks get two picks each to balance it out.
I've got the spinning wheel of names ready.
You've got the machine. Yeah.
Nice.
I'm excited.
Let's do it then. Let's do it then, Matthew. Spin the wheel.
I'm going to spin the wheel. Oh, a lot of times we've played a song this time, Mr Speeps. Going first.
It's Dave.
Dave can decide whether to go first or second.
Okay. Okay.
Oh wait, no, that's not how it works, is it, Matthew? We've got to do it again. Yeah, that's true.
Should we do it again for second, third?
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is tough. I don't know. I don't know if I want to.
Going second is Samuel.
Oh, second might be the best place to be. That's the thing.
Yeah, that's tough.
I think it might be. It might be, but even when it comes to third, Matthew, there's still going to be loads to choose from. There are, yeah.
Right then. Okay, so the draft categories. Category one, exclusive one.
Category two, exclusive two. Category three, 90 plus on Metacritic. Category four, download game.
So download only game, but if it's released physically, it has to at least have the essence of a download game. You fucking get it. Category five, RPG.
Category six, open world. Category seven, remake or remaster. Category eight, wild card.
Category nine, multiplayer. Category 10, free pick. Those are the 10 categories.
Dave, you're up first. Go for it, mate.
I think there's only one game you can pick first in this draft, and I didn't know whether I wanted to go first to get this or go second and get two other ones that I think are equally great. But I can go blood-borne. Pick one.
It's the obvious choice.
Boo.
I love this game. I don't think there is another game that makes me feel so uneasy just on its atmosphere. It turns my stomach to walk around that game and just live in its world for hours at a time.
My stomach feels tighter when I turn the game off. Beyond that, the combat is just so satisfying. So it has a tightness and depth to it that is really unmatched in the genre, even out of all the Souls games.
I'm not too much of a lore guy when it comes to any of the Souls titles, but this one, you don't really need to read every bit of text you find. The atmosphere is just everything, and it just tells its own story, and I don't know what else to add that hasn't been said before about this. It's just an incredible game, and probably the best exclusive on PS4, and remains an exclusive on PS4.
So let's remember that. You cannot play this anywhere else.
It is highly coveted, for sure. It is a good choice. I definitely would have taken it as one of my two picks had it come round to me, because as part of two picks, I think it'd be fine.
As a first pick, I think it's just craven, frankly. But that's fine. Okay, good stuff, Dave.
We're off to the races then. Right then.
I'll just say, it's not 60 frames per second, so I'm not interested.
Who's you?
Right. My first pick is not actually going to be an exclusive game.
Oh, you bastard. I know what you're gonna do.
Category three, 90 plus on Metacritic. I'm taking Red Dead Redemption 2. We're talking like the highest rated game on the platform, so it feels like a great choice in that respect.
This is synonymous with PS4. comes out on PC later. Can't call that a fucking PC game.
Definitely a PS4 game. The richest simulation that Rockstar has ever made, like incredible amounts of detail. No, I have not finished it.
But it is a genuine step forward from what the original Red Dead and GTA 5: were able to achieve in terms of the world feel and, like I said, just that almost forensic level of detail and how the world is brought to life. It's still really unmatched, I think, as a next-gen feeling experience. It felt like a genuine step forward, but in all these granular ways that I think maybe make it a bit more of a challenging blockbuster than people used to do from a Rockstar game.
Matthew, what do you think of this pic? Your reaction was interesting.
I obviously love this game. Just incredible vibes. The most realistic-looking natural world with weather and fog.
Fog, like the fog in this game alone is like 10 out of 10. Fog and mud. Yeah, it's just a game of like incredible texture.
Slightly outstays its welcome, which you'd know if, you know, and you'll discover one day when you get to the end. But that's the nature of these Rockstar games. But this was definitely high up my list.
yes, annoying.
I mean, listen to what we're saying here. We're talking about fog. We're talking about mud, talking about horse muscles.
I mean, it just sounds boring to me. I don't know why you'd pick this first sound, but you do you.
Bloodborne also has fog and mud.
But also great gameplay. It doesn't get boring.
I mean, I would say the fucking 20th time you've fought Vic or Emilio, I'd say it really starts to outstay us welcome personally, but to each their own, David.
I was going to say this was on my list as well. This was on my list as well. It's a great pick.
It's just an all-encompassing open world game. Not exclusive, but it is defining. That's the thing.
It is defining. Okay. This is a really hard second choice.
There's two games that I had in shoulders above here. I'm going to punt it on exclusive one, category one, Uncharted 4.
Nice. Nice.
Tricky because, well, I'm sure the other game that I want to pick will come up pretty shortly. But it is the least contentious Naughty Dog game on PlayStation 4. It is just an absolutely joyous celebration of what this action-adventure series is able to accomplish, this kind of Indiana jones pastiche, but a contemporary version of it.
But it is also clearly the best game in this series. Like, if you play all four of these in sequence, arguably five games, I guess, or six, if you include the Vita one. The step up in terms of, like, combat, in terms of, like, the presentation, the many open worlds that they give you to explore, the grappling hook that you used for platforming.
It's just like a massive step up, and it really feels like it just crystallizes everything you felt about that series when you were playing on PS3, but just pushes it even further. And I was so uncertain about it at the time because of all of the Amy Hennig fallout stuff that was going on. But it was absolutely a masterpiece, and actually was one of the first moments where I was like, I'm really glad I bought this console so I could experience this.
Thoughts on this pick, David?
I love this game. If it wasn't for the fact that Bloodborne is such a universally beloved favorite, my actual heart would have gone with Uncharted 4 because I absolutely adore this game. I think it plays right into the type of games that I love.
Action, adventure, you know, quippy, lots of fast action, just beautiful to look at. I can just in my mind now see just some of those like when you come in on the Jeep into some of those sort of open world areas you were talking about when you come into the sunken city, there's just like beautiful, beautiful worlds that you enter or chapters that you enter in this game. And it's just such a huge improvement on free.
I remember reviewing free at the time, early days on games TM, which always felt it was kind of unable to grasp the highs of two. This, I think, in many, many places exceeds to. I think the story is just better told.
I think it's more, it's richer. It makes the characters deeper. It allows you to sort of love them all over again and find new ways to appreciate those characters.
And I think it has an incredible epilogue as well. I just love this game through and through.
Matthew, I know how you feel about the patting the yoke sequence at the end, but I'm assuming you believe this is a good pick too.
This is a good pick. It's definitely sort of swimming around in the top picks. Is it necessary the one I would have gone for?
You know, who knows.
We're about to find out as we come to your first pick.
So for exclusive one, I'll take The Last of Us Part II. Incredibly bleak game, which I actually took a while to warm up to. I know it was kind of replaying actually this year on PS5 that made me appreciate it a bit more.
I think maybe going into it knowing kind of what all the twists and turns are on the journey, it's going to kind of go on. Incredibly ambitious to pitch it as, you know, a Ellie-focused sequel to The Last of Us and then to have this sort of mid-game twist where there is a second campaign where you see the whole game from your enemy's perspective. I do think it's a little bit kind of obvious that, you know, if you walk a mile in both people's shoes, you can see their perspective and see how this toxic revenge mission is only ever going to end horribly for everyone.
As much as I love Naughty Dog applying their eye for detail and set pieces and rich characters, you know, in the more fun setting of Uncharted, there's no doubt that you can still enjoy all that amazing craft in The Last of Us Part II, from the tiniest environmental details to the disgustingly realistic thud of metal pipe on dog skull. I'm so sorry that this traumatized their staff, but it is a real piece of work, this one.
Yeah, it's great stuff. And yeah, I definitely would have picked it in the next round if you hadn't grabbed it here. So good choice.
I do think it's a great pick. I found it to be overlong personally, but there isn't necessarily anything I would cut. It just like has a few pacing issues.
It also has more so than the first one. It has some big jump scares. Like there's a point where you're using your workbench as you do throughout the game many, many, many times.
And then a character just jumps out from behind and grabs Ellie and it scared the living shit out of me. And I think it's a game packed full of moments like that, that more so than the most horror games just has this ability to really get under your skin.
A great choice, Matthew. And I think I could predict your second pick here.
Actually, no, I'm panicking.
No, come on. This is really obvious.
GTA, GTA.
You think it's obvious?
Really obvious. I know what I would have taken.
Oh my God. Why do you always say this stuff?
Because it fucks with you.
It confuses me.
But also I think it really is obvious. Like this one other exclusive that like is in that sort of est here. But, you know, I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I'm going to take for 90 plus on Metacritic, God of War.
That was the one.
Yeah. Yay.
I didn't write it down because I thought it was so fucking like on the gonna happen, basically.
God of War. I love the original God of War games. And I think some people kind of roll their eyes at them a little bit now.
And while I was initially sad to see them kind of reject those simpler times for this slightly more kind of hand wringing depiction of what happens to this psychopathic action hero once he gets a bit older and has a family, I do think it's a really, really elegant telling of that. I think the shift in that to that perspective, you know, it was possible to scoff at it at the time, you know, this cliché of every first party PlayStation game is an over the shoulder third person action game and oh what a shame they've done it to Kratos but actually kind of really putting you in the heart of those set pieces and you know everyone talks about the unbroken camera take but just the sort of virtuosity of all the camera work and putting you in those moments and never leaving that perspective. It is pretty amazing and I think you know when you play Ragnarok particularly you realise that the just how tight this first game is by comparison.
Truly spectacular, I've played it through a few times now and the journey and the the gradual kind of thawing of that character and the analysis of his past and what happens if a kind of a violent video games character grows a conscience what becomes of him and I do think that's that's quite a novel take and you know people love it.
People love it. It's true. Yeah, I think it's the best non Naughty Dog exclusive on the platform.
That's why I think it's like the pick for this category. It really does just jump out to you once it like gets its hooks into you of like, oh, they've really landed the play with this take on this character. I do agree that there's something about Ragnarok that just fumbles that.
It's just too, it softens the edges just too much.
Yeah.
And is too flabby. So yeah, good pick, Matthew. We come back around to Dave.
Dave, it's time to pick Spider-Man, so get on with it, yeah?
I'm not. I'm not going to pick it.
What?
I'm going to go. I will see if someone else does, but I'm going for something else.
You are fucking kidding me. Come on, Dave. Who are you kidding?
Are you trying to subvert your persona? I've got a game plan.
I know. I've got a game plan. Don't get all over me and in my head.
I'm going to pick something that's going to devastate you. I'm going to kneecap you right now. I'm going to go download.
I'm going to go PT.
Oh, OK. That was like my fourth wild card pick. Oh, no.
That's like...
Come on.
Oh, Dave. This always happens to me. I think I've got him and he pretends he doesn't give a shit.
If he does, he'll still pretend. I don't think he does from the tone.
No, I don't care because this is an incredible choice, right? Like, this is one of the defining games or experiences on that console. Everyone to this day talks about PT.
Just like the legacy of it lives on beyond many of these other games that are on this list. Even my beloved Spider-Man, right? This is an experience that just came out of nowhere.
I remember it was announced. I can't remember which conference, but it was an EFE conference and then dropped that same day.
It was an August gamescom conference 10 years ago.
Well, there we go. And it was just this enigma. No one knew quite what it was and then played for it.
And it's genuinely the most terrifying horror game that I've played. It is the layers to it, the secrets that people were finding. I had to end up playing it.
I was getting so freaked out. And I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to stuff. I had to end up having it stream to my PS Vita and I put Mrs Doubtfire on my television in the background just to sort of diffuse the tension.
I was experiencing it so I could look up and see Robbie Rims go from one monster to another one. Basically, I really couldn't cope with it. I actually never managed to unlock the actual ending.
I still don't know how you do it, how you get the Silent Hills trailer.
You say Jareth, you say Jareth into the microphone. Classic normal behaviour.
You pick up the phone and you say Mrs Doubtfire in a faux Scottish accent.
So I think this would be a good pick a bit later. No, it's just so early to take.
It's the moment now. There's many great exclusives left that I could go for.
I was expecting you to do this Samuel at some point. I was expecting PT to come early in your picks.
PT and Blood Board is a winning combo. That's a two hitter.
It's not even in my top three wild card picks. And that's the only category I had it down for. Bullshit.
No, I'm not lying, honestly. I just can't believe you left Spider-Man on the board for fucking Matthew to take. That's very annoying.
Yeah, I know, but I'm not taking it.
How do you know Matthew's going to take it then? I could still come around.
Well, because he'd be silly not to, I think.
You'd be silly not to then.
Okay. Well, look, I like PT. It is a singular curio and it is tied to PS4 quite literally because you can't play anywhere else.
Exactly.
If this was actually a product, buying a console to have PT would be a bit of a sell.
Yeah, that's true. That's true. And it's still the one thing I've told my dad, don't delete this from your PS4 because I want to play it at some point again.
It sounds like it's an essential game on the con- I mean, I don't know. It sounds like something that would be a good thing.
I certainly took a PS4 home from work to play at the time and I really like it and I've played it loads over the years. I feel like I've got PT out of my system a little bit. I'll be honest, just because I rinsed it.
I saw every single thing you could do in it. I really just went pretty deep into it. I probably played it for about 15 plus hours.
Very enjoyable experience. But yeah, I don't know. I just think there's beefier things to get off the board first, but we will see, won't we?
We will see. Okay. So my category two, exclusive two, I'm taking Ghost of Tsushima.
interesting.
I like Spider-Man fine. I wanted to pick something where it doesn't have a sequel that disappointed me slightly, and this one doesn't yet. I also wanted to pick an open world game from the Sony crop of open world games that I think actually nails it across the board in terms of, this is the best of those Assassin's Creed type experiences that I've played.
The atmosphere of it was so good. It's a great pandemic game to lose yourself in, just the way that grass and plants move in the wind, and how spectacular the views are. Then playing it with a framerate bump, admittedly not on PS4 and PS5, and just seeing it was a borderline next-gen experience at the time.
Really, really good. There is loads of it. It's a very long game, but I think it splits the difference between that super hardcore from approach to combat and the Assassin's Creed style.
There's a little bit too outmoded or a little bit too old school. Ghost of Tsushima just felt really fast and fresh and exciting. It was a great reinvention of that studio.
It took years, five years to make it after Infamous Second Son. But I think it's really, really good. Great, memorable characters.
It's like a bolted-on great pick, I think, with no real caveats. Matthew, what do you think of this?
I like Ghost of Tsushima a little less than you, and I think we've talked about this on the podcast before. I admire a studio getting so much right on their first big go at something like this. I think it suffers a little bit from the same thing as Horizon in that it comes at the end of a lot of open world gaming generation.
There is a bit of map clearing fatigue when it arrives that you can only disguise so much with the specific setting and the gorgeous art style and all that. I ran out of steam of this one on the second island. I've never finished it, but I do look fondly on it, and I know from, I see developers often talk about this on Twitter as an example of a studio that got a lot right when they made a big shift and that it is a real feat.
Yeah, I'm not going to knock it. I'm really excited for the new one, for sure.
The response to the sequel, I think, just shows how much it cut through despite the amount of open world fatigue that was kind of going down. So yeah, I think it was just, it felt like the right pick. Its own very specific thing hasn't been surpassed yet.
They haven't made an effort to surpass it yet. It feels like a kind of great draft pick with no real baggage to it. So that's kind of why I went for it.
But Matthew, it comes back to you.
Well, speaking of, you know, open world maps with fatigue for icon clearing, let's go Marvel's Spider-Man. Oh no. Up until this point, Insomniac weren't really like my studio, weren't really my guys.
I don't think much of Ratchet and Clank. And I like Sunset Overdrive enough actually. But this I thought was a kind of a huge, huge step up.
I don't think it is as good as any of the Batman games, but as I think we said on the Spider-Man episode, I think it is like the closest anyone's done to giving Spider-Man that Batman Arkham series kind of treatment in terms of like the wealth of villains and how they use the city and how they kind of weave all those different villains into the story. It feels really exciting, it just feels like a really busy comic book world plus just the technical feat of that city and that movement through it. I was thinking about picking this for Open World, but as an actual Open World, you know, you have a weird kind of relationship with that city, you are just sort of zipping through it with its speed and I think I do prefer this game when it kind of zooms in and gets a bit more granular in the missions or the set pieces or the fights rather than simple navigation.
But I think it puts Insomniac on the map a bit more as a serious contender and it was just way better than I thought it was going to be as well. Like I just, you know, Spider-Man, there's been so many of these games and it was like a step beyond those. So I think it's a good one.
Yeah. Yeah. Great game.
Really just gave me all the Spider-Man 2, as in the PS2 original sort of like vibes I wanted. Great. Nailed the web swinging.
That's what mattered the most. Really nice version of the character as well.
I think that, yeah, it's Yuri Lowenthal, I think. I think he's an outstanding Peter Parker Spider-Man as well. I think credit to the whole cast that I think elevated above what it potentially could have been, which was quite a sort of flat Spider-Man adventure game.
But yeah, like the storytelling and nailing those swinging mechanics, just make it just a superb experience.
No PT though, is it, Dave? Next pick.
Get lost, right? What am I going to go for now? Okay, I'm going to go, so I think this is going to get a tricky category.
I'm going to go 90 percent Metacritic, and I'm going to go Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.
Great game.
Again, I think this is one that Sam wants, but it's also one that I like. I don't want to take too many Souls-like games, but what I find really interesting is how From Software have taken the Dark Souls formula and adapted it in some really interesting ways across both Bloodborne and Sekiro. This is their most fast-paced in terms of those combat-driven RPG-like games that they do.
I think the setting is very unique. It came out, you guys will know better because you have way better memory than I do. It came out around the same time as Ghost of Tsushima, if I'm correct, right?
There wasn't too much time between.
It was about a year between them. It was like 2019 for Mid 2019 for Sekiro and then Mid 2020 for Ghost of Tsushima.
Okay. They seem closer to my memory.
The perception of time is all over the place.
That is true. But yeah, honestly, the combat in this, I think is the most challenging of all From's games. But it's also some of the most gratifying as well.
The place it takes you visually, it's stunning. Yeah, I think it's a really, really complex and rewarding game that challenges the player. I think beyond any of the Souls games and even potentially Bloodborne.
I know you love this game, Sam.
I love this game. It's interesting to see you sort of trying to 4D your chess, sorry, 4D chess your way around my picks. Because I really like, well, I really, I do love this game, but it's probably like it was going to be in my second half of picks.
But it wasn't, and so I was just like, but I really love this game. It is like, PS4 is, is fair. I played on PC, but PS4 is where most people played it.
It's just like really understood the whole from thing from playing this. So like embedded lore, the little kind of more source of information you get about the world and the different monsters you fight. My ex-girlfriend never forgave me for killing those folding screen monkeys.
Especially the one that's got little glasses on. She was livid about that. So fair criticism.
I love this game. I knew GamePlus did it. It's really good.
I think it's a strong pick. You got that and Bloodborne. So I can see you're going for a certain type of vote.
Yeah, I'm going with games that people like. What a shocker.
Well, our audience is quite specific.
Yeah. Let's see if they like this pick from me for Category 5: RPG, Persona 5: Royal.
Oh, you fucker.
I worked on this game. This is my game.
Yeah, you were the creative director, weren't you, Dave?
I sure was. Creative director of UKPR.
Lead character design. You exclusively drew the alternate outfits for Anne, if I recall, in this game. I don't think there's anything else you did in this game.
Look, I sent out a review code. That was a big cheat.
Yeah. So this is the pick for this category, I think. There's actually something else I really wanted.
I wonder if Matthew will grab it next, actually, just to make sure he's got something good for this category. Not a Final Fantasy game, I should say. Something else.
Persona 5:, this is like the apotheosis of the persona formula. It takes it to the next level in terms of presentation, that mix of exploring dungeons at night and doing life sim stuff in Tokyo, across Tokyo during the day. Basically, a really fresh feeling role-playing experience that finally had the presentation, the right platform for it, Royal is the extended version of the game.
Matthew could pick Persona 5: if he wants to, but a bit of a duff pick when you've got the fancy version.
No, no, that would be lame.
Exactly. It's amazing, memorable characters. It's really turned it to a franchise of its own.
Not sure how I feel about that because you get all the Persona 5: you need in this one game, I think, but just brilliant. Instantly top of the pile japanese RPG. Feels like a killer pick for this category and this draft.
What do you think, Matthew?
One of the coolest games ever made in Persona 5: and Royal. Royal definitely the superior version, just a bit faster moving. I felt so stylish, love the music, love the setting.
I'm really interested to see how the discussions go around, metaphor when it comes out, because from the prologue demo that I've played, I think it already feels like it's really missing a lot of the style of Persona 5:. So I think there's going to be extra nostalgia and love being felt for this game.
Yeah, interesting.
It was a weird thing as well from the publisher perspective, because I worked at Koch at the time who handled the UK marketing and distribution of it. The expectations of its sales were so low, but it was huge. This game outperformed even their wildest dreams outside of Japan, and it just broke out.
It had been so long since Persona 4. I think, again, you'll know better on dates, but the franchise had built up a following to the point where Persona 5: became almost a mainstream hit. It was just an incredible game anyway, which obviously helped.
But yeah, it was crazy looking back on it, just how little they thought of it, certainly from a UK perspective.
interesting. Yeah, and certainly it's become a massive phenomenon. The whole series now is basically a mainstream game, which seemed like it would never happen, like back in the PS3 to Persona 4 golden times.
So Matthew, your next pick.
There's lots of things here. I'm getting a little bit nervous around whatever that other RPG pick is, because I don't think it's super obvious what to go for next. I just want to make sure I've claimed something I really love.
That's really important. So for free pick, I'm going to take Hitman, World of Assassination. That's all of them in one.
Oh yeah, that is true.
That is what Hitman now is. So it's every single level of Hitman.
Really more of a PC game?
I mean, it was on both. Listen, when I went to gamescom and previewed Hitman 2, they showed it on PS4, not PC. It's a console-friendly game.
A marketing agreement with Sony, as my guess is.
Well, maybe so, but why would you make one of those deals if you didn't think people would think PS4 and being a Hitman-friendly platform? I've got no problem with this. I think people have played it on lots of different platforms.
I think it is a multi-format game. I'm not saying it's PlayStation as hell, although it does have a PSVR mode on it, if you want to play Hitman and be sick at the same time. But I just think, as a package, all three of these games brought up to the standard of Hitman 3.
I mean, that was a bigger jump from Hitman 1 to 2, admittedly. I felt sad about not having Hitman 1 and 2 on my PC draft, but I feel a bit better now that I've got Hitman 1, 2 and 3.
People, brackets on PS4, love it.
They love it on all platforms.
Yeah, like I say, I think I see Hitman's heritage as being in PC, but it is a platform game. I won't give you a hard time about that, Matthew. A great series of games, obviously, discussed many times this podcast.
All the levels in this have been ranked twice by this podcast. So obviously, we are big Hitman heads. Dave, your Hitman go?
Yeah, I like Hitman a lot. Yeah, this is a great pick. Is this, Matthew, what you talk about about getting under Samuel's skin?
Like this seems like...
No, not at all. I can't do it. I am really bad at the mind games.
Because I think there are ones that Sam wants and then he never does. He'll never give up. He's just very, very good at it.
He plays his cards close to his chest. He is better at the mind fuckery of the draft than I am.
But I always lose. You've won every single draft for the last year. I've not won one in like well over 12 months.
I don't know why that is. Maybe people are kind of reacting to my emotional openness.
He's the people's champion.
People love him.
It's pity.
All right, Dave, what's your next pick?
So in RPG, I'm going to go for The Witcher 3.
Okay, good choice.
Yeah.
Really more of a PC game, but... Is it though? Is it though?
30 FPS on PS4.
Look, I remember covering this for a long time when I was on games TM. It felt very orientated towards console players during its whole hype cycle. But this is the definitive RPG of the generation for short.
It was the scale of it, the breadth of it. There's so many memorable quests that people talk about to this day, the bloody baron.
They always say the bloody baron, name another one.
Yeah, name another one, Dave.
I can't, off the top of my head. That's because I haven't played it in years. But the point is that it's a memorable quest.
Gosh damn it, you two, you've been playing this game too long. You know how to disarm me.
We play to win, motherfucker.
The point is, it's on my list. It's a great game. There's no denying that.
It is a great game. And I'm very happy that it sits among other fantastic titles that are currently making up my PS4.
The reason I think it can be argued as a PC game is that the series begins on PC and the first two games are on PC. The second game is also on 360 later. But I just think that PC DNA is...
If I was only going to give you like one angle of attack, it's true that millions of people play this on PS4. So I don't resent it as a pick, Dave, but I'd rather you pick something that you actually like than trying to pick a Final Fantasy or something.
This is the only game that I've ever felt a bit PC Master racy about. Just because it looked so good on PC. It looked nice on PS4, but it looked so good on PC.
I've also got it on my Switch, and it looks okay on my Switch.
It's impressive that they made it work on Switch. I feel that way. I'm not trying to undermine.
I did think about this, so I thought, no, to me, I had a more PC time with it.
That's fine, but I feel like this is the logical RPG pick. It's probably a Final Fantasy that I'm not thinking of because I do not like Final Fantasy games, but do not hold that against me.
It's a tough generation for Final Fantasy, I think. It is.
It's a hard one. They were like my second and third choice picks for RPG. So yeah, it's tough.
All right then. So it comes back around to me. It does.
Yeah.
All right. So category six, open world game. I'm going to take Metal Gear Solid V, The Phantom Pain.
God damn it. Why didn't I do that last time?
I think this is a category that's in danger of running out of good games quite quickly. It's tricky because I was sort of getting to the point where I might have to take Arkham Knight, which has the Batmobile sections. That's such a big caveat, even if I think I should.
You're saying that, Sam, because you know that's what I'm going to pick. You're saying that to just undermine.
I'm saying it.
You're just being a dick.
This is another thing he does. It burned the other picks.
I'm saying it. I'm saying it because I reviewed it and gave it eight out of ten and said, if the Batmobile stuff was better, this game would be a nine and it wasn't. So I gave it an eight.
This is the guy who gave The Dark Knight rises five out of five. Can we trust his opinion on Batman media? I don't know.
For a fucking sci-fi magazine that 8,000 people read, I think that was the right audience for it anyway. So Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain, it is one of the greatest stealth games ever made. As an open-world game, it's basically like, what if loads and loads of Metal Gear Solid levels were jammed into two gigantic maps for you to explore, while also pottering around in like a, you can drive around in a jeep, you can go around on a horse.
There's a mech that I literally never ever called into battle and then loads of other fun ways to play with the different enemy NPCs that you come across with more and more tools unlocking even after the game, unlocking the hand of Jehuty from Zone of the Enders was a peak Samuel Roberts moment. Really, really good. Just encourages you to keep going back in and playing it and replaying it.
The ways in which you can augment the experience by calling in like a helicopter for support, calling in Quiet, Bikini, Sniper, Lady and for support. I don't know if I mentioned I'm seeing Stephanie Joosten at gamescom Matthew, the actress who played Quiet. I just made eye contact with that very brief flash of like, I can see you've identified who I am.
Please do nothing. That's kind of the vibe I got. But MGS5, yeah, it's just so, so good.
Not the only Metal Gear Solid V game on PlayStation 4 if you want to go for a really bold pick.
That's too much of a bad hang to inflict on people, I think. It's great, but it's miserable.
Yeah, people, there's some controversy around the ending of this game, but I feel like it's a very, very complete feeling stealth action experience. It is like the ultimate vision, really, of what Metal Gear Solid V as a stealth game should be. And it stood the test of time really well, runs at 60 FPS on PS4.
So the experience is not compromised. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, this is this is absolutely a PS4 game, so it makes perfect sense to pick it. I love Metal Gear Solid V. I think it is, you know, probably technically the best game Kojima's made in terms of systems and actually indulging in that stealth fantasy.
Maybe it doesn't deliver on the kind of Kojima lore that everyone's obsessed with. Probably one of the weaker Metal Gears in that in that regard. But it's so good.
I had so much fun covering this game at the time on this generation. So I love it.
Dave, you're a much with MGS5 guy?
I love this one too. I haven't actually played Metal... I know, this is sacrilegious.
I've not played Guns of Patriots. I skipped that, went straight to MGS5, and what Matthew said was...
You're not missing much.
Yeah. Sorry, here. But from what I understand, to Matthew saying this under delivers on the law, the law is always the thing that push me away from Guns of Patriots.
I find it all bobbins, to be honest. I don't rate Kojima much as a storyteller at all. I personally find it too knotty and self-important.
But because MGS5 is just purely a sort of stealth action, open-world experience, you can kind of forget all that and just enjoy the eccentricities and the moment-to-moment gameplay of it without the baggage of knowing your various snakes and clones and all that other shite. So I really love this. I remember very fondly as well that period of covering, up-to-release and playing Ground zeroes as well at a preview event before MGS5.
It's fantastic. And also, again, not to be a marketing dick, but that reveal trailer for this was just absolutely phenomenal, just in terms of setting the tone that was garbage. Yeah, I just loved it.
I don't think there's been a better game reveal since.
That trailer is better than the whole story of this game.
Yeah, exactly.
That's honestly true. The vibes of it are just immaculate, I agree. Yeah, it was fun to cover.
And then they're ending with, you've been asleep for nine years or whatever. That's so, so good. Yep, I love MGS5, absolute banger.
Matthew, your next pick.
For open world, I'm going to take Death Stranding.
Oh, good choice.
You know, having just said that Metal Gear Solid 5: is, you know, Kojima's probably most mechanically nuanced and sophisticated game. I think this has the most incredible vibes and what he's doing in it is maybe slightly smaller in scope than all those stealth systems in Metal Gear Solid 5:. You are a delivery man walking across America and trying to kind of reconnect what remains of humanity in a world kind of plagued by strange ghosty things.
You know, the mechanics of the actual hiking and capturing the arduousness of a journey, especially across rugged terrain, is completely captivating. It's a game where the journey not to the destination is very much the focus. On top of that, there is this strange asynchronous component to it where everyone's contributions to the rebuilding of America's infrastructure is playing out in everyone's game.
So as time progresses, the world becomes tamed by motorways for you to drive on or other people's constructions like zip lines and actually all these invisible sort of Samaritans are helping you and that is a really special feeling. It was very, very hard for them to talk about this game and I actually think it's quite like misunderstood and misrepresented by a lot of reviews that just think about it in terms of its incredibly baffling Kojima narrative. But I think if you if you actually ignore all that and focus on the hours and hours and hours of hiking you're going to be doing.
I think this is a very nuanced game about your relationship with travel and the world around you and I think it is one of his all time great games. So no quibbles picking this one.
Yeah I got to play this someday. I'm surprised it's stayed on the board for so long actually as a major PS5 exclusive.
I don't think the masses like it. That's the problem.
I've never played it.
It's more of an acquired taste game than it was maybe sold as. Which is fine because it really does have quite an enormous adoring fanbase. People seem pretty pumped about that second one.
But yes, it's less obvious a sell than Metal Gear is.
Yeah for sure.
The photo mode in the second one looks like a serial killer's basement. Like it's just really disturbing to me. But hey, that's just me.
Good pic Matthew.
Okay, Dave, it comes back around to you. What's your next pic buddy?
I'm trying to think of what you guys have taken because that would inform.
How about I recap so far?
Let's do a recap.
First up, Dave you picked Bloodborne. I picked Red Dead Redemption 2 Uncharted 4. Matthew picked The Last of Us Part 2 God of War 2018.
Dave you picked PT. I then picked Ghost of Tsushima. Matthew then picked Spider-Man.
Dave you picked Sekiro. I then picked Persona 5: Royal. Matthew then picked Hitman World of Assassination.
Dave you picked The Witcher 3. I picked Metal Gear Solid V. Matthew just picked Death Stranding.
Okay, I think I just need to get a second exclusive off the board to lock that category. And so you don't take anything that would essentially fuck me over. I'm going to take The Last Guardian, an exclusive too.
Oh, interesting.
I actually really love this game. I think it's very endearing. I don't think it's a shock to say it's not Team Ico's best, but I do think it sits alongside Ico and Shadow of the Colossus.
It's just so unique. I think the relationship between the little boy and his giant furry feathered winged dog is completely beguiling. And it's a game of just exquisite locations and tricky puzzles.
And playing that for 10, 15 plus hours, I just fell in love with it. Fell in love with the world, fell in love with... How do you say?
Trico?
Trico? Trico?
Trico? I don't know.
Yeah.
doesn't matter.
I just think it's just fiercely unique in a way that a lot of the other exclusives on PlayStation 4 aren't. They all kind of follow in the footsteps of The Last of Us and sort of being, you know, here's a sad dad looking after someone, you know, and this is about a sad bird looking after a little boy.
Slightly different.
But I think that distinction is important when the viewers come to decide something.
Yeah, I'm very fond of this game. I think it is like, I know all the reasons that some people find it frustrating, but I think it is singular and like a great sign that Sony was still prepared to make things that defined what it was during the PS2 days. The fact that they did ultimately get this over the line.
This is like the big sort of, if I like, sort of celebration moment for PlayStation to me, that they were able to get to bring this back, to showcase the muscle of the PS4 as a commercial enterprise. Matthew, what do you think of this pic?
I'm not crazy. I found it more frustrating than beguiling. I'm one of those sort of philistines who can't appreciate the art of it because I spent most of it shouting at that stupid dog thing to behave.
So that is my relationship with it. I think in terms of also a thing which only exists on PS4, it's got a lot of PS4 in it if you want it. Your console is turning into quite a good console for between Bloodborne, this, PT, things which are a little trickier to enjoy.
Yeah, for sure. Obviously, the low frame rate on The Witcher 3 also makes it hard to enjoy now. Oh, a bigger shit lord again, but that was quite funny.
So what can you do? Okay, that is a good pick, Dave. That was definitely one of the ones I wanted for A category, so good choice.
Okay, my next pick, Category 10 free pick, I'm taking Yakuza 0.
interesting.
Just the best of these games that is tied to PS4. Don't think you can really argue that there's a better Yakuza game that launches specifically on this generation that's this good. This is the one that got so many people into this series.
Just an amazing, sprawling, dense, story packed game of two characters sort of existing in parallel before they become sort of like lifelong frenemies, basically, rivals. Majima is this kind of like amazing sort of, I think they call it a gilded cage that he's in. He cannot leave this place.
He is trapped in this place. He's under duress in a situation he cannot get out of. And he's just a very severe guy with this very specific sense of morality.
And he's a really interesting character to unravel over the course of this game. And then by the end of the game just becomes a completely different character that apparently is the one that people actually like. But I found that that character's journey in this game really, really good.
It's also just great at exploring the friendship between Kiyo and Nishiki. It's just really better explored in this game than it ever was in the original Yakuza, where they just become enemies straight away and you don't really get that context. Here it's like, I think honestly, the original Yakuza is half the game this is.
I think this is an actual masterpiece and really maybe get why people were obsessed with this series. What do you think of this pic, Matthew, as a Yakuza guy?
It's definitely the one anyone can enjoy. It is the entry point to the series. Everyone always says that now.
If you start anywhere, start with this one. It arguably has the kind of template which the series has followed religiously since then. Great mix of games.
I love the game where you run the hostess clubs. As Majima, that is just excellent. I even quite like the real estate minigame as Kiryu, even though it's reasonably boring.
Yeah, I'm not going to argue with this. It probably is more fun than... I'd say the next best one probably is Like a Dragon, but it's already a bit more of an ass because of the whole JRPG thing.
Yeah, plus it's like a cross-gen game. It's on Game Pass.
Yeah, it's a little bit murky that way, for sure.
Yakuza 0 is just on PS4. I think it takes years to come to PC even. So yeah, I felt like...
I'm surprised it sat there for so long, actually. I thought you would take this for RPG. But is it an RPG?
I don't know. It's a tough one. Is it an open world game?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tricky. All right. It comes back around to you, Matthew.
For RPG, would we accept Nier Automata? It's an action RPG. It's got side quests.
It's got stats.
I'd accept it for open world game.
I've already got open world.
This thing is just not... It is an action game. It's kind of just got...
It's as much an RPG, really, as Ghost Tsushima is. Why don't you take it in wild card instead, Matthew?
I'm happy for you to take it where you want, Matthew. Don't let Sam dictate where you put your games.
That's okay. I don't want it in wild card.
I think it's more relevant in RPG than Alien Isolation was in shooter.
RIP, Jeremy, who really just got...
That's okay.
Tell you what, I'm just going to... Let's see what they've tagged it as on Steam. Do they call it RPG?
does Square call it an RPG? Elements of an RPG is the fourth point down. Do I allow it?
Is this where we bring in the bullshit token?
Well, the thing, I don't like the bullshit token. I feel like that isn't pushing the bullshit token too hard, where I feel like someone else could push it hard.
There's no bullshit in iDraft. Mine's pure of heart.
I'm just going to let you have it, Matthew.
I appreciate that. yes, I'm going to take Nier Autata, an action RPG. To me, it has RPG elements in that you are free to take a lot of that adventure at your own pace.
There are lots of side quests you can engage with it. There's lots of weird items to collect. You can shape your character.
You play an Android and by plugging different chips into their operating system, you change the nature of them as an action presence. Of course, you are fundamentally following this mad story that Yoko Taro has devised, a story which plays out over multiple playthroughs. In some cases, radically changing mechanics and ideas, which means that it simply doesn't end at the credits.
If anything, to end this game at the first credits is doing it a bit of a disservice, and instead you want to play the whole thing, discover this very soulful epic tale of androids questioning what it is to be human, playing out in some quite ugly post-apocalyptic environments. There's maybe a bit of abstract BT to them, but up close, this game is a little bit like, uh, but it still plays really nicely on PS4. Absolutely amazing soundtrack, real earworms.
Yeah, very strange sort of wailing and warbling and operatic stuff, which kind of wedges right in there. Truly a one of a kind. Well, I say that there's another near, which is quite like it.
And I hope that they make another one. But I feel like this was a much fuller realisation of what he was going for in the original near, which I didn't have as much fun with. You know, maybe that's the platinum touch, is that they just make it a bit more of a kind of legit action game around all Yoko Taro's oddness.
Yeah, I think this is a great game. I definitely would have picked this. So it was a good choice in that respect, Matthew.
Thank you for letting me have it in that light.
It's the first time in a while, actually, that someone's picked something that I actually wanted. No offense, though.
Well, that was very gracious of you. I appreciate that.
There you go. Yeah, that's fine. I think RPG is probably as accurate description as open world game is, and that's why I thought, yeah, that makes sense.
So good choice, Matthew. I do love that game. It's also probably still at its best on PS4 because it had all kinds of issues on PC.
So yes, Dave, we come back around to you. What's the next pick?
What's the next thing you're going to tell me is rubbish? I'm going to go for Remake Remaster, which was the trickiest category for me. I'm going to go for resident Evil 2 Remake, which was...
That was the pick, I think. Good choice.
So... Yeah, it's good.
I actually didn't think of that, but that is great. Yeah.
I mean, this is the best game in the franchise, in my opinion. And when you think about the sort of the remake industry, this set are very, very high bar. It just, it looks superb.
It refined the mechanics to such a degree that it feels modern. It feels, yeah, it feels very contemporary. And it made it essential, which I can't say for most remates that came out during this, during the PS4 era.
And I think this game, yeah, just it stands the test of time. What more could be said about it? I don't know what to say about resident Evil 2.
It hasn't really been said. It's just incredibly atmospheric. The survival gameplay has never been bettered.
I think, you know, that scarcity of resources, trying to balance your silly little briefcase so you've got the right stuff at the right time. Mr. X is terrifying. I think he's a better version of nemesis, which came later.
And just the set pieces, the puzzle design, the pacing of this game, and then you can obviously play it all over again. It's the best resident Evil game and I think possibly the best remake ever. But, you know, you decide.
Let the viewers decide.
Yeah, it's a great game. It really captures all of the things you remember about resi 2 while also obviously being a different genre of game, really. It's a third-person shooter that has survival horror elements as opposed to being a straight survival horror game.
But the settings, the color palette, they got it all right. This kind of kicked off the wave of horror remakes that we're still kind of living through, really, and it's still possibly the best one with maybe the resi 4 remake, sort of nipping at its heels. I think I probably slightly prefer this because of the distance between the game and the original game that it's based on.
Like you said, this changed the game. This changed the fundamental DNA of the game in the sense of taking a whole new perspective of it where resident Evil 4 was still very much how it was when it initially came out on the GameCube. It was just given a lick of paint.
But yeah, so I think this stands up as the better of the two.
Yeah, good pick. This was my number one pick for this category. So I think it's a good choice.
But I did have a lot of other things. Contending for a space here, including my next pick. Wait, is it my next pick?
It is, yes. Just checking before I do a Skyrim like last time. I'm going to take Uncharted, the Nathan Drake Collection for Category 7 Remake or Remaster.
This is three Uncharted games in one package. Bluepoint absolutely cooking with the increased frame rate and resolution. Looks so nice, arguably punts Uncharted 3 into looking like a PS4 game.
Just really just an amazing glow up and a great way to dive into these games. I imagine so many people just discovered the Uncharted series through this who just never had a PS3 because the PS3 was just so cursed. Loads of people got into it with this.
I went through them all again when this came out. I played it with a friend. It was just so enjoyable.
Yeah, loved it. Matthew, what do you think of this pick?
Yeah, I did exactly the same thing. I do think it's like tough break putting Uncharted 1 so close to 2 and 3 in this. I really don't rate it.
But 2 and 3 at these like crazy smooth frame rates, they just look astonishing. Like what they're throwing around is as complex as what happens in Uncharted 4 or The Last Star. So anything Naughty Dog have done since, you know, in terms of like ambition, it's just a slightly lower technical level.
But it's really, really good. Great collection of games. I'd say the best collection of three games after Hitman World of Assassination.
Agreed, agreed.
Second best remake you could have picked. So, you know, it's a strong choice.
But which one has more PlayStation DNA lads? I think you'll find it's Reds of the Evil.
Well, you know, it's available on all platforms, wasn't it? This wasn't. So, yes, that was my choice.
Matthew, what's your next pick?
For multiplayer, I'm going to take... I always struggle in multiplayer because I'm not a big multiplayer guy.
Here comes GTA V.
No, no.
People love it.
That's a PC game.
I'm going to take Monster Hunter World.
Oh, that's a good pick.
Monster Hunter kind of has two homes. You know, it sort of appears on Switch first, or it appears on PS4 or PS5 first. And World felt like one that really broke through.
I'm not going to say it's the one that, you know, definitely some of the Nintendo ones have done some amazing, amazing business for it. But I think Monster Hunter World was an attempt to make it as western-friendly as it's ever been. There's a much more kind of explicit story to it.
A few more kind of trappings of like a traditional western single-player game, but without ever getting in the way of trampling on, you know, what is at the heart of this game, which is that endless loop of going out into environment, finding a fucking huge monster, killing it, taking some bits, building some better equipment and then going out and killing the same monster for better equipment or a bigger monster. This one has a bit more flow to the environment. That's the kind of world of it.
It's kind of less sort of segmented in the old monster hunter way and leans into the kind of sense of the ecosystem, like rival monsters smashing into each other. It's really, really like spectacular and it's constantly edging towards the cinematic, but without giving up on the fact that at its heart, it is quite a hardcore co-op action game. And I think the way it navigates that kind of constant seesawing is really, really interesting.
Playing this will put you in good stead for Monster Hunter Worlds next year, but Worlds is really, really good fun. And it also gets you the expansion Iceborne. So you got fucking heaps of monsters.
You can play this for hundreds of hours.
Yeah, not really my sort of whole area, but I am determined to play this new one and get into it. Much as Dragon's Dogma 2, I managed to crack this year.
Yeah, I think the new one is even more so than Worlds has that sort of veneer of you can play this by yourself and enjoy it.
I'm in the same boat. It's just a franchise that's gone over my head for many years, but yeah, I see the appeal.
It's a good choice, Matthew. Thank you. And yeah, again, those kind of Capcom games do just feel slightly more at home on PS4 than they do on PC or anything else.
Dave, what's your next pick? Wait, is it me? No, it's you.
Sorry, it's Dave. Wait, yes. Sorry.
I'm so bad at this.
Yeah, your inability to deal with numbers of three is a...
Three people. It's tough out there.
I'm going to go multiplayer. I'm going to go Apex Legends. I don't know if you were going to go for this, Sam.
I know you were a big fan of it. We were kind of playing it around the same time, but you had different friends and I wasn't allowed to interact with them, so we never played together much.
It's a game of trios and I had two guys who I still play the game with, Phil and Tom Hatfield. It's not an anti-Dave thing.
Just to let you know how I feel about the situation. So I would matchmake with randoms because I didn't have any friends who wanted to play with me. But nevertheless, this is as thrilling as, I think, multiplayer shooters got during this generation.
I was a big COD guy as Sam kept calling out at the beginning of the pod. But that sort of fell by the wayside a little bit during the PS4 era. I felt they became a little too complex and more interested in the microtransactions marketplace than they were in the core gameplay themselves.
Whereas I think Apex felt like a bit of a breath of fresh air, especially as everyone was fighting over the Battle Royale space, had a unique spin on it. The world itself that it is set within had these various areas that you commit to memory and work out the various valleys and use the verticality in this spot or this spot to gain advantages. You work your way through different tiers of weapons.
Yeah, it was just the thrilling Battle Royale experience that I think is probably the best out of that sub-genre of shooters of the time, and the production values are off the charts. I never really got into the side titanfall lore of it all. That all seemed like nonsense to me, but the cast of characters was at least interesting.
Visually, they were very distinctive. Yeah, I love playing this for a good couple of years.
Yeah, Blorkos are us, the roster in this game, really. Absolutely, absolutely rammed with Blorkos. But a great game, a great first-person shooter.
You can play it for free on PlayStation without a PS Plus membership because it is a free-to-play game. It's given me a lot of joy over the years. This is my third choice out of three for a multiplayer game, so I had considered it, Dave.
It does continue to bring me a lot of joy even with the limited time modes that make no sense to me whatsoever. But what can you do? That is that.
Then back to me, it goes. Technical question, will you allow me to have Until Dawn for Wildcard?
Yeah.
Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, go on then.
Being reasonable helps sometimes, apparently. So category Wildcard, I'm taking Until Dawn. This is still, I think, the best of these super massive horror-based experiences.
A cast of people you might recognize, Hayden Pinnitier and Rami Malek, and many other actors you've seen on the telly, the Agents of SHIELD guy. Just a really great, past the pad game to experience with a friend. In the same way you might watch like three or four horror films in a row on a Saturday night or something.
It captures that in game form. And just is like one of the best kind of low key PS4 exclusives of this generation. The Shuhei Yoshida said that it came out and it sold well and it kept selling at like the same level.
It just kept finding new people. For a long time, I think it was a PS3, PS Move game. So when it came to PS4, there were no expectations for it whatsoever, really.
But I think it's like just such a blast. I reflect on certain moments in this game as just being so, just like great choices, like when you see the dog. And if you attack the dog, then it will attack you back.
But you can also befriend the dog and things like that. And it's actually like branching in a way that it sort of gives you, I think, what you want those David Cage games to give you, but actually sort of like in a sweeter form than those games, which are just hard work in their own way. This is just a soft, fun, popcorn version of that kind of experience.
Thoughts, Matthew?
You're absolutely right that what it gets that maybe the David Cage ones don't is that this is like lighter popcorn entertainment. Everyone understands the basic language of horror films of like, let's try and steer that guy into peril and let's try and keep this person alive and being able to kind of interact with it and actually have a say in how this horror film plays out is really neat. I also just like the way it weaves so many different flavours of horror film.
Where it ends up is not at all necessarily how you think it's going to go. There's lots of different genres of horror represented here. I still think it's the best thing Supermassive have done by quite a long way.
Yeah, somehow it never really got better. It's just because you just haven't really played anything like it before. So yeah, it's a quintessential PS4 experience, I think.
It was genuinely quite scary as well. It surprised me by how often I was very slowly pushing the the analog stick forward and sort of like squinting. So, you know, I wasn't like jumping out of my skin.
I thought it was very effective as, you know, as a pure horror experience.
Yeah, it definitely has its moments in that respect, for sure.
I'm a big wimp, though.
It helps. It's kind of like photoreal as well. It's just it's quite a graphical showcase really for the time.
There's a remake. Not sure why, but fair play. OK, next up, Matthew, what's your pick?
So here's a question. Is Tetris Effect a remake?
yes.
It's a spin on Tetris.
That's fine.
I'm fine with that.
I'm fine with that. Go for it.
OK.
Yeah.
In which? Well, Dave?
Yeah, that's fine. What if I just said no? No, fuck off.
Then I would have gone, I would have had to pretend that I like Shadow of the Colossus a bit more than I do.
I'll let you have Tetris Effect. It's fine. It's all good.
Thank you. That's what would have happened.
It's better than Sam's pick, so it's all good.
So for a remake or remaster, I'm taking Tetris Effect, which I'm calling a remake in that it takes the core game of Tetris, but just jazzes it up with the incredible music, those kind of trancey visuals you expect from Mitsuguchi. I absolutely love this game. It's just one of my go-to relaxation games.
Play a few rounds of one of the easiest stages in this. Just puts me in a really good mood. The whole thing about Tetris is trying to get you into the zone, and all the music and visuals are there to kind of aid you and kind of get you into that place.
And it has every variation of Tetris that you could possibly want to play. They updated it with some absolutely amazing multiplayer modes as well. Like the Connected, where three players suddenly joined together in a massive board.
I keep banging on about this. I don't think anyone who listens to this podcast has ever given it a try off the back of this podcast. One day it will break through.
That maybe speaks to it being a bad pick for this draft and why everyone allowed me to have it for this category. yes, I do see this now. But that is fine.
It is one of the ultimate heart picks. Tetris Effect is like a game I'm increasingly convinced is one of my 10 favourite games of all time. I absolutely love it.
Yeah, I love this. I love this too. I think playing this in VR was just an amazing experience.
However, you come across it. I mean, it's great without it, obviously. Tetris is Tetris.
But yeah, it's probably a quest to on with this. I was like, oh, fuck, if I had this in a pandemic, I think it would have cured all my mental illnesses. But alas, really, really good.
A very you pick, Matthew. I think this needs a bit of individual flavor to it.
I think I was going to say rightfully, it's a definitive VR experience. I agree with everything both of you have said. I think this is fantastic.
And yeah, just a great way to decompress, whereas other VR games sort of try and put you on edge. This does the exact opposite. It's wonderful.
Good stuff. Dave, we come back around to you.
Well, speaking of VR experiences that put you on edge, I'm going to go in Wildcard, Arkham VR.
Oh, okay. interesting.
That is a Wildcard.
This is a heart pick as well. I'm not sure how many people who listen to this podcast actually have a PSVR. This sort of touted, it's marketing slogan was, you get to be the bat.
And I did feel like it sort of let you embody that in such a unique way that you can, that you could possibly do it within a game, like from the moment where you're sort of in Wayne Manor and sort of wandering around and pressing various buttons to interact with doodads within his library and then descending down into the Batcave and armoring up. It was just this incredibly empowering experience that I felt very unique within a superhero game. I will say I'm probably the wimpiest Batman there's ever been.
I find VR to be a really intense experience, which is why I love Tetris effects so much, because I find sort of being enclosed in a VR headset, and I feel very vulnerable when I'm in sort of open spaces in VR games. And so I find myself sort of creeping around corners or sort of moving my head very slowly as Batman just in case something's going to jump out at me. And it's a game that sort of escalates the further it goes along in terms of putting you in a very intense situation without spoiling it.
The end becomes sort of like in the same manner that Arkham Knight used a lot of sort of like Batman, sort of Batman sort of hallucinating and seeing things that aren't there.
Nightwing's Dead, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.
There's like a whole bunch of very graphic and freaky visuals that sort of pop up in front of you during Arkham VR towards the end. And I found it very unsettling. But despite all that, I love this game.
It really focused on Batman being a detective. It was very short, had a pretty linear story, and it was an open world. But you got to interact with many of the rogues Gallery.
You got to explore different areas of Batman from this brand new perspective, or different areas of Gotham City, should I say, from this new perspective. And I felt it was a very unique experience within Rocksteady's world. And yeah, I really love it.
A true wild card. I can't doubt it. It was definitely one of the first VR things that really wowed me.
I played it at gamescom, the demo bit. I was meant to play the full thing. Maybe I will now.
I've got a new PC in quest 3. I might just pop it on the old Steam VR thing and remote play it. But yeah, it's definitely a good way to sell you one.
I know it's a shorter experience, but having a VR game in the mix is good. PS4 was like a big VR platform and it was a success on there genuinely.
So I have just to indulge me for a moment. I have a very fond memory of my dad who passed away a couple of years ago, him coming over and I was like, you got to try this and put in Batman VR for him, put him in the headset and him just being completely wowed. I could sort of replicate that experience with various guests who came to my house over that period, just putting them inside Arkham VR or them just being blown away by the interactivity and the fidelity of the experience.
It really is an incredible showcase of VR and what it offers to players.
Yeah, that's a nice note and one that I struggle to make fun of for the purposes of comedy in this podcast.
God damn it, it's bulletproof.
What are you going to do? You can't not vote for it now.
Okay, good stuff. That's the wrong words to use after that. Okay, moving on in the draft.
To me again, I've got two categories left, multiplayer and download game. I'm going to go for category four download game and I'm going to take Life is Strange. Loads you can pick for this category, obviously, but I was trying to pick something that felt like a real moment in time during this generation.
When the episodes of this were releasing, it was literally like a Telltale game. They're releasing the episodes every few months. It went for a game that I thought, oh, is this quite twee indie music, slightly twin-peaks-y time travel adventure, really going to find an audience from the studio that had made Remember Me a game that was not particularly well-liked.
It's a bit of a cult favorite, I think, but I didn't really have many expectations for it. It became this huge sensation. I think it spoke to a certain type of player in a way that a lot of games just weren't at the time, like just in terms of its themes and its characters and how vividly drawn they were, voice acting really, really good.
I just remember when it was coming out when you were reading, people were analyzing the different episodes on Eurogamer and stuff. I felt like a big phenomenon. It's just really well-done.
The writing is great in it, the acting is great in it. They pick an art style that's not too ambitious, so they have to do amazing face tech, yet the characters feel like real people. Yeah, I think this is really good.
And I struggled with Journey, which is kind of a PS3 game. I did think about what remains to be the Finch for this category, which I do like. But I think this has maybe got a little bit more staying power, just as evidenced by the series itself continuing, and never really been quite as good as it is in this first game.
So yeah. What do you think of this pick, Matthew?
I do like it. It took me a little while to kind of get into it. You had that bit of that hello fellow kids thing for a few episodes of the kind of slang I found quite off-putting.
It sounded like an adult desperately trying to sound like a teenager, but actually the scope of the story and where it goes and how it does use the episodes to keep you excited about what happens next, good cliffhangers and whatnot. Yeah, kind of earned its place as an episodic game and still probably my favourite of all those sort of episodic things don't not have done. I don't think they've ever quite kind of recaptured the spark of this one.
Yeah, I would agree with that. I think it's definitely singular in that respect. You always can't top it because the characters just so, they tower over everything so much and it's just been really hard for subsequent games to get out of its shadow.
So yeah, interesting to see them wrestle with that creatively because they did really have a hit on their hands out of nowhere. OK, good stuff then. So it's back around to you, Matthew.
Well, I'm going to follow this straight up with What Remains of Edith Finch for Download Game. You know, you said it didn't quite have the staying power. It is a self-contained piece and they fundamentally run out of relatives to die horribly for a sequel, which is like a tough break for them.
Second cousins in the sequel, you know?
Yeah. What Remains of Edith Finch Secret Family. This obviously came around at the time where there were quite a few of these walking simulators and there seemed to be constant sort of intellectual sort of argy-bargy over whether or not they were good, overrated, wanky, whatever.
What I liked about this one is that, you know, it had that journey through an environment which told its own story. But the fact that as you dipped into the lives of all these tragic demises of family members in this one grand house, the way it kind of mechanically shifted into different sort of mini games for each family member, I just think it gave it a sort of variety and a surprise that I didn't necessarily get from everybody's gone to the rapture or gone home and, you know, maybe it's a bit more superficial because of those things, that sort of pick and mix approach. But I just think that like the wit on display in each of those games, some of them are really substantial, some of them are, you know, like magical but incredibly bleak.
The kind of bathtub scene in this is a famous one. Some of them are just really, I think, quite funny. Like the guy gets kicked during a photograph.
I think they really know what they're doing. I kind of like the dark streak of humour in this. Probably my favourite example of this genre.
So have they done anything since?
I don't think they have. Have they? Like the Aspleek, isn't it?
Why has that not happened? I don't, yeah. I don't believe it.
Is it, what were they called again? The Studio? Can't remember.
Were they?
Funny name, didn't they?
Didn't they do the Unfinished Swan? That was them, right?
Yeah, that was them. Yeah, then they did this.
They weren't like swan games or something.
I will just look up what they were called again, because I've forgotten. They were called...
Giant Sparrow. It wasn't that far off.
Don't think they have made anything else, which is, how is that even possible? Like, this was such a huge indie game, I thought. Yeah.
You don't need to talk down any elements of this, Matthew. I think it's a great game. This is the peak of the genre.
It's like an amazing story to discover. Well, you don't know exactly what it is, other than the premise. It's like discovering what happened to these relatives.
It really has an amazing capacity to surprise you. I think it's a good choice. Dave, do you think it's a good choice?
I do too, yeah. I might slightly prefer Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, just because I have an affection for how it captures the English countryside. Right.
It's where I grew up.
You've not picked a download game yet, have you, Dave?
No, I have. I have. I've got PT.
Have you? What's your download game?
The best choice.
Oh, yeah.
But I can't quibble with this. It's a fantastic game. It's a shame it got bogged down in all of that walking simulator discourse at the time.
I don't think it did. It was after that a little bit. It was like the last gasp of the genre.
I feel like it got caught up in it, but even so, it's a fantastic game.
Yeah, good stuff. Dave, what's your next pick?
I've got two left. I've got free pick and open world. Maybe I shouldn't have divulged that because you might try and fuck me.
What with my one multiplayer pick?
I doubt I'll try and fuck you.
For free pick, I'm going to go with Titanfall 2. I know this is pretty mainstream hit, but I think this is my favorite shooter of this genre. It's earned its reputation over the years and for me, it was probably the best, most original FPS since Half-Life 2.
It's just constantly reinventing itself from moment to moment. It just has so many memorable chapters. You've got the time jumping, time stopping chapter where you jump around an environment through different points in time.
You have that big warehouse set piece where model homes are being built as you're trying to navigate through the conveyor belts and stuff. On top of that, it actually had a pretty solid multiplayer aspect to it too, which I really enjoy playing. It's a shame respawn haven't been able to make a Titanfall 3.
I do think this is really the peak of the genre over the last decade, but I'm glad we have it. I remember it very fondly and I've played it multiple times. It stands up.
Yeah. The art of the single-player first-person shooter. They are few and far between these days, but they are always appreciated when they come along and blow us away like this.
Good choice. Thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.
No worries, you bastard. Okay, my next pick then, my last pick is for Category 9 multiplayer. I'm taking Rocket League second time in two weeks, baby.
That's a PC game.
This was a-
PC game. You said it was.
It belongs to both. It belongs to both. It was a PS Plus sensation out of the gate.
PS Plus is a huge part of this generation as well. It's like a smaller thing on PS3 than on PS4. Everyone has it.
The new games coming along every month become like a huge moment, and I felt like one of the first times they launched a game using PS Plus. It was just a phenomenon out of the gates and really exciting to be a part of. I did split my time equally between this version and the version on PC.
I played loads of both. You could argue it belongs to either really, but loads of people discovered it on PS4. Totally valid pick, I think.
We played it together, if you remember. Many times.
Yeah, it was really enjoyable and still really has the stuff. It just has that enormous skill ceiling to it. Really fun.
Never gets old to see a giant football exploding that you drove a car into. That is just always exciting when the goal pops off. You can tell I don't play football or watch football.
But yeah, multiplayer pick. Kind of had to be this one. Hard to pick a quintessential PS, PlayStation-only multiplayer game, really.
Didn't want to resort to GTA Online, which are...
Four Guys?
Oh, that's a good choice, actually. That's a good choice. So yeah, maybe I should have thought about that.
That's on me. But this ultimately had more longevity than Four Guys, Rocket League. So it has that to it.
This isn't a very new pick.
Yeah, that's it. It just has to... I can't say that my PS4 experience is complete without picking this.
It just was the game I played the most. I think it's like the... I think I've got the second highest number of hours in this after Final Fantasy X remaster, I think.
So yeah, pretty huge for me. Loved it. Okay.
That was my last pick. And we come to Matthew's last pick.
Yeah. For Wildcard, it's the ultimate Castle Heart pick. It's 428 Shibuya Scramble.
The absolutely insane visual novel about intersecting lives in one very hectic day in Tokyo. I love this game for so many reasons. It is one of the funniest games I've ever played.
Beautifully written. It's all illustrated with photos of gurning actors around Tokyo hotspots. It's got that choose your own adventure thing, but instead of being a horror or a thriller…
Actually, it is a bit of a thriller. There are real comic elements to it, so some of the storylines just take you into some really zany situations where you're trying to sell a terrible diet product, toys, housewives. There's one of the characters, so a whole strand through this game is about a freelance journalist trying to stop his friend from killing himself because his magazine is going to go under by filling out all the missing copy in his magazine.
So he's got like one day to find like five killer stories in the centre of Tokyo. And it's just… There's so much brilliantly observed stuff about writing to Deadline and trying to spin something out of nothing.
I love this game. It's another one a bit like the other one that I said that I can never seem to get anyone to play. Tetris Effect, maybe.
Hopefully, every time I talk about it, maybe one person picks it up and that's enough to discover your new favourite game. One of the few games to get 40 out of 40 in Fumitsu when it first came out on the Wii. But you can now play it on PS4 and enjoy the madness.
Yep, very you pick. Not at all where I thought you'd go. I thought you would take your wild card for 13 Sentinels, actually.
I did have it on there. I did also wonder about trying to cram a bit of Persona 4 Golden, but I thought that's bullshit. Just because they did re-release it.
Yeah, it's probably worth mentioning a few things. I know Dave's got one pick left, but a few things that are left on the table. I almost picked Loco Rocco Remastered, I almost picked that Shadow of the Colossus redo, I almost picked Devil May Cry 5:, I almost picked.
That's a very PlayStation 5: game. Yeah, but it's just there wasn't space ultimately, so yeah, there's actually, and also I did have Arkham Knight as my backup pick at Open World, so even though I did Salt the Earth, so that nothing would ever grow again for that category, I did, in picking MGS5, I did think about it, so yes. Dave, your last pick.
I feel like you were extending an olive branch there as Open World is my final pick, so Arkham Knight potentially back on the board, but I'm not gonna take Arkham Knight because you did so rudely decimate the idea of anyone picking it. So I'm going to go with a bit of a cheeky pick, I think. I'm gonna go with miles morales for Open World, and here's why.
Imagine everything you love about the Open World of Spider-Man, but it's at Christmas. Yeah. There's a lot to love about that.
I've actually played this each Christmas since it's come out. I find it really does well to sort of emulate the sort of atmosphere you have in a big city around Christmas time, the way that the lighting is done, the snow on the sidewalk, the way people are walking around all huddled up in their scarves and big coats and stuff. I steam coming out of the greats.
I think it does an incredible job of recreating that feeling. I've been to New York around that time as well, and it does have that look and feel, that texture to it. On top of that, it's got a lot of other stuff that I really liked about it.
It sort of teases how Spider-Man 2 would sort of approach that NPC co-op aspect. You have that opening sequence where you're working with Peter Parker, Spider-Man, to stop the Rhino as he's sort of like stampeding through a busy shopping mall, which is just like this great opening set piece that really sets the tone for the rest of the game. It's a lot longer than you'd expect it to be too.
I think there's like a good 15 hours of game here, maybe more, especially if you want 100 percent it. And I think as well, miles has a way more interesting and fun power set than Peter does, certainly from the first Spider-Man game, obviously Spider-Man 2, when he gets the Venom powers, he has a lot more. But yeah, the electricity power is going invisible, all that stuff just brings new shades to the Spider-Man gameplay.
So in many ways, I think that it's a better game than Spider-Man. It's more...
Better game than Spider-Man 2 anyway.
Well, let's agree to disagree. But I think that it's worthy of its own entry and to be a standalone sequel to the original Spider-Man with a unique setting.
I like it, but I think it's a PS5 game, because it's a PS5 launch game. Personally, I think that's not unfair as a categorization. Matthew, what do you think?
I mean, I don't really want to get into that too much, because so many of these fucking games are now on PS5 with better versions. I've been trying to avoid that particular avenue, because it gets pretty ugly for all of us.
Yeah, it does, because everything gets a bump, doesn't it? Well, so yeah, apart from Bloodborne.
Apart from Bloodborne. Yeah, I will agree that is a bit cheeky because of the PS5 thing, but, you know.
It's a great game. I think it's the right length of game. It's very enjoyable.
It does show you a slightly different side of, you know, Spider-Man, I guess, because the character is just so distinctive.
Yeah, I would have picked Arkham Knight, to be honest, had you not said what you said. But here we are. We're with miles morales.
I personally think Arkham Knight is slightly stronger than that, but it is a competition, Dave.
So, oh, that's just he salts the earth and then goes, well, actually, no, it wasn't that salted.
This is where Dave goes. But when I showed my dying uncle the Christmas scenes with miles morales, he welled up and everyone voted remain in the post office. Sorry, that's a really dickish thing to joke about, Dave.
I think you're a great guy. I've just known you. I've known you too many years.
I'm too casual with you after all this time.
I barely know you at all and I take massive offense to everything you're saying. This is how you treat all your guests.
Yeah.
No, I do think the reason I would, miles morales edged out Arkham Knight is the Christmas setting. I really do love returning to New York at that time of year within the game. I think it really is special and I play with my kids as well, and they love that over the other two Spider-Man games weirdly enough.
Well, that is our final pick. I think we should just recap now and then we'll tell people where to vote. You can vote on Twitter, Backpage Pod, pinned tweet, the poll will be there for seven days.
It'll probably break three times during that, but let's see how it goes. Dave, thank you very much for coming on. It's been a fun draft with you.
