Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew, another special guest, has uh joined us for this episode. So Jeremy, would you like to introduce yourself?

Jeremy
00:22
Hello, I'm a freelance games journalist. I write for PC Gamer and Edge VG247, rock paper shotgun, places of that nature.

Samuel
00:32
Yes, Jeremy Peel to give him his full name is um Uh one of my favourite games writers in the UK does really good takes on mainstream games which is uh my sort of jam when it comes to games writing. Delighted you could join us, Jeremy. And I wanted to start a bit by asking about your career, so how did you get started in games media?

Jeremy
00:50
Yeah, so I I guess I feel a little bit like I was Born out of time in that I was a big sort of magazine person as a teenager, did a magazine journalism MA, which b at the time felt a bit mad because games magazines were were closing. Endgamer around that time and uh Official Neto magazine and and others. I've got a slightly depressing mausoleum of final issues for that period in my garage. But I kind of wanted a sort of um classical education in feature writing rather than um you know trying to d desperately keep up with a whatever Twitter or Twitter was kinda new then. You know, now I I imagine the online journalism tutors are kinda desperately trying to work out TikTok. and what have you. Um I wanted to learn how to write like like they did in the magazines I loved and then I didn't write for a magazine for seven or eight years I think after that. I got a job at PC Games N, which was set up by um Tim Edwards who'd been PC Gamer editor just prior to that. So that was pretty exciting for me. And that was just a really good sort of training ground for that kind of style. And yeah, much later I left. And since then I've just kind of b had a sort of frenzied approach to writing for all the magazines that I read as a teenager. It's been a sort of dream fulfilment for me for the last three years professionally almost.

Matthew
02:14
I've got a question about the magazine journalism course you did. Yeah. Was that like focused mainly on writing or did it also like have Like magazine craft, you know, like w working with designs and stuff. Like what what w what sort of marked it out specifically as magazine journalism?

Jeremy
02:32
It was sort of multidisciplinary. Like I I had to sort of muddle through InDesign. Right. Which for listeners is the software that most magazines are made with, I believe. And some kind of design stuff, although that was not really my my my skill. Um sort of the final dissertation bit was we had to we had to make a magazine like I conceived a what was it? It was it was a it was a men's magazine for grooms or something. It was it it was alright, it was fine. Grooms as in getting married. As in getting married. Um yeah. There was it wasn't conceptually that interesting really. But um but yeah we had to sort of do different different sort of segments of working on magazines but it was mainly writing and the there were all these sort of you know interesting exercises like Pick someone living and write an obituary for them. Which is something that journalists do, right? Like you have to for for a famous person they have to have the obituary pretty much ready to go. when that person goes. But yeah, I'd I'd I remember writing an obituary for Lee Mack, the comedian who is still happily with us.

Matthew
03:38
But I'd be just What a s sinister exercise.

Jeremy
03:42
I know it must be ho I hope he never hears. this be so horrible to know but um yeah I've been to see him recently I was like oh I've got some themes I can write about on Limax So I'll I'll pretend he's dead. I like I like the idea of like, oh I saw him recently, I could imagine him dead. I mean yeah, I mean he sweats a lot on stage but otherwise he appears to be a quite a healthy person. So I've got no had no reason to suspect.

Samuel
04:08
Amazing. Yeah, I mean maybe you should like do an article before that that just says uh Lee Mac is not dead, but he is a bit sweaty on stage. be your headline. So that's really cool. Um did you sneak any game stuff into the the Grooms magazine? Like uh is it just a quick review of Call of Duty 3 or something like that? Or um was it all pretty straight down the line?

Jeremy
04:26
'Cause I might have done I definitely reconfigured some of my game stuff from that time that I was doing, you know, on an amateur level to to get me marks on my degree. So there were there definitely were journalism tutors reading about uh Minecraft. You know, sort of like uh poor Kieran Gillen imitations of Minecraft New Games journalism, that sort of thing

Samuel
04:50
Okay, so um what are the games that get you into um the medium, Jeremy? What are the things that you're obsessed with as a younger man?

Jeremy
04:56
So uh I guess immersive Sims were very early for me. Some UK listeners will remember the five quid games that you could get, you know, in Asda or other kind of supermarkets. It would be on a tall stand and and I think the brands were Sold out. There's one called Explosive that started with an X. Yeah. Um and the PC Gamer Presents one, which was pretty cool because it had the review score on the front and you were guaranteed a sort of 80 plus.

Samuel
05:23
I always wondered is that I always wondered is that dodgy as a former editor of PC Gamer?

Jeremy
05:30
In those, I think in the sold-out ones, they had Deus Ex and they had Thief 2. So they I ended up playing those pretty early on in my sort of teenage years and we only had a PC in my house so that was that for me really. Yeah I remember playing Thief 2 The curtains drawn and the sound turned up a bit too high and jumping when the the guards shouted at me. Uh good stuff.

Matthew
05:57
I always think it's interesting when you talk to people who were like predominantly PC players or only PC players in their youth. Their perception and ideas about games are just slightly slightly different in terms of like I I wonder if it's kind of hard getting excited about the console scene. that like your peers are are mostly into because you've played something which was a bit more mechanically sophisticated for the time. I think there's less of that golf now, but definitely back then I felt like there was some Mm, not s I don't want to call it snobbery towards consoles, but I felt like th there was a clear divide between people who grew up exclusively PC.

Jeremy
06:35
Yeah, there there definitely was some snobbery and multi-platform wasn't a thing then, was it? You if you had a different platform, you were playing utterly different games with different kind of design principles. It does feel like coming from a slightly different starting point to some peers. You know, I I I played kind of Mario 64 and some PlayStation stuff. a friend's houses growing up but the one for me I can never get my head round is JRPGs. Just they're just so it it felt like an affront to me initially that they were called RPGs and they didn't really give you any choices. It's nothing like Baldur's Gate and the the stuff that I've grown up with. And I still feel like I wouldn't be qualified to review a JRPG.

Matthew
07:17
Do you s do you still feel that like when you see people getting like hyped For big console releases now, do you still have a bit of distance from those?

Jeremy
07:23
I don't know, because it feels like around the time I kind of went to uni and started working, that's when the big multi-platform boom happened and That's when a lot of the developers that I'd grown up with crossed over. You know, Irrational did Bioshock. And Bioware did Mass Effect. There's others that I now can't think of, but it it felt like PC became multi-platform at that time and still now. a lot of the big stuff and the stuff that it influenced on on consoles has has pulled in all those kind of things that I was familiar with. So it's It's rare now, I think, for me to see a big console game and be like, I just don't I don't know where this is coming from at all.

Matthew
08:05
So you weren't this you weren't sitting there on Thursday just shrugging through the PlayStation showcase

Jeremy
08:10
No, I I feel like like I was laughing at the idea of Knights of the Old Republic now being a PlayStation exclusive. Like that is nuts to me. Quintessentially PC and then I guess quintessentially Xbox. But and now for them to be on PlayStation And that's just everyone that makes sense to everyone. That would have been unfathomable when I was growing up.

Samuel
08:36
Yeah, for sure. So Jeremy, we've brought you on this episode because we're gonna talk about immersive Sims in um uh throughout and go quite deep into that genre in the second half of this episode. But we've also been playing uh Death Loop on this podcast. So basically we're gonna talk a bit about Arcane Stu game, PS5 exclusive Although it's out on PC as well, published by Bethesda, now owned by Xbox, which itself is a kind of bizarre thing. But we've got some like deep impressions of of of Deathloop coming up a little bit later. But Jeremy, before we go into what the kind of deal with Death Loop is, as a kind of freelancer, I wanted to ask a little bit about that. So How do you feel like you've made your mark in the world of freelancing?

Jeremy
09:13
Hmm. I guess one of the things that feels different about freelancing is you can really, really go deep on something. I I tend to kind of fixate in my tastes. I'll get into something again and I will just at the moment I'm reading the Witcher Books, playing Thronebreaker. and watching the series at once, which I think would be a bit much for sub. But I kind of I kinda like to go hard on a thing when I'm when I'm enjoying it and freelance really lets you do that. If you're working on stuff somewhere, you can't say, I've rediscovered the Driver games. I'm going to proceed to write about Driver for a full month. That's a really hard sell for an editor at the moment they're trying to cover the spectrum of games. But if you're freelanced, you can pitch things to various places. And I think I did end up writing a full month's worth of stuff about Driver because I was tired of not seeing anything written about Driver, and I got to just fill that gap myself So that's um I love that about freelancing.

Matthew
10:17
I was just gonna say I like that that comes from like sort of a genuine obsession with something rather than the sort of cynicism of like Oh I've played a bit of driver, I now need to hawk ten driver pieces to sort of justify this to myself.

Jeremy
10:29
Yeah. This is a thing, it's really I think um when I s first went freelance and a lot of people when they start writing freelance they think Okay, I've gotta get the big game. The one game purchase I regret or that I only got for professional reasons was Anthem. And I think I only got one one sort of commission out of it in the end, 'cause I didn't love it and I didn't have a lot to say about it. actually when you're freelance it makes sense to kind of furrow those peculiar, you know, areas that other people can't think about. You have the space to do that. And it makes sense. You then bring something to editors and they're like, oh I've not never thought about that because why why would I be thinking about driver three in twenty twenty-one? Why would I? And yet I was. Yeah. So that's cool.

Samuel
11:14
Yeah, so another eight years though, Jeremy, I reckon you can start doing your anthem retrospectives for um different outlets. Yeah, miserable depress Okay great. Well um should we take a short break there and then we'll come back and discuss definition directly. Okay, let's do it.

Samuel and/or Matthew
11:31
You thought I'm dead and done. You'll know for sure tonight. I'm rising from my shallow grave And I'm molding my switchblade tight Cuz You can blast me with dynamite But I won't rest in pieces I'm a revenant baby.

Samuel
11:55
Welcome back to the podcast. So me and Jeremy, we've both finished Arcane's Death Leap, which is just released on PS5 and PC at the time that you're listening to this. So we played an absolute bunch of the game. I think I'm nearing 30 hours in the game. Matthew, you've played a bit too, right?

Matthew
12:09
I've played like three hours.

Samuel
12:12
Yeah, so Matthew just got code, but As I mentioned in a previous episode, I've had the game for a little while now in my flat and I've been happily playing it this whole time. So Jeremy, let's just um kick off with it. So this is a game uh set in a time loop on an island called Black Reef in the 60s. You play a character called Colt who wakes up with a hangover. Doesn't really know what's going on, and over time you discover these targets across the island called visionaries, and your goal to try and break the time loop is to kill all eight of the visionaries in one loop in one day. So what were your what were your impressions of this?

Jeremy
12:45
So I love Arcane's games, but I again recently I've become sort of hyper aware of the sort of guilt that they put on you. I think a lot of us kinda like that about their games and about Immerse Sims they kind of hold you to account for your actions and they say, Y well, we know you just killed literally everyone on that bridge and you didn't need to do that. Um but they're also great action games and you can kind of end up feeling a little punished for indulging in the action because of that sort of guilt cocktail that comes afterwards. And Deathloop to me felt custom built to allow you to indulge in that stuff without feeling bad about it. Like there's um you know that premise the day repeats everybody comes back to life By definition, there are no consequences for killing somebody. At least, you know, in the course of a game generally. You know, what once you start thinking about breaking the loop, that maybe becomes another matter. But It's a perfect sort of combat sandbox for a developer that generally is whether they've meant to or not have pushed people towards stealth and kind of moving through these incredibly intricate spaces where lots of things can interact and create surprises without interacting with them very much at all, just trying to keep keep to yourself and not, you know, kind of staring the pot. So definitely to me felt really kind of freeing for me off to be able to go. I can Try things, really loud things, and just see what happens and and not worry about whether I'm gonna be frowned at by my mum who lives in a heart in my pocket So dishonored reference is gonna be very confusing for people that played Dishonored.

Matthew
14:35
That's just Jeremy being weird. Yeah, classic Jeremy.

Samuel
14:40
Yeah, so uh it definitely is is more of an action game than Dishonored was. I think what's interesting about this game is it very early on starts furnishing you with guns and powers. And like you say, enemies in the game have a disposable quality. They sort of look like crash test dummies or mannequins. They're quite odd looking. And um, you know, uh the day is going to repeat, so like you say, there's no consequence really to killing them. And um it certainly doesn't um because they don't really have faces, you don't really feel bad about killing them. It's just uh they're just there, you murder them, you move on. And I think that that does create a slightly different vibe. I think what I found really interesting about this game is that I don't know. If they exactly figured out what the right push and pull between stealth game and action game was, because when you enter a a a level in this game, it's um The the island is broken up into four areas across four times of day, and when you leave one of those areas, time moves forward. So it's broken up between morning, noon, afternoon, and night. And when you enter an environment, you're just in stealth. And then when you get caught, a bunch of exclamation marks come up on the screen to indicate that an enemy has seen you. And then you're suddenly in a firefight. So I personally found that the game struggled a little bit. To make you feel fully empowered to just kind of like go haywire and kill a load of dudes and indulge in your powers just because the UI. You may disagree with this, Jeremy. I think the UI in this game is telling you, or the HUD rather, is telling you that you have made a mistake by being caught by enemies. I was wondering what you thought of that.

Jeremy
16:16
Yeah, I know what you mean. I think those exclamation marks go a long way toward that feeling. It's it's that that thing isn't it, which is a classic arcane thing and immersive sim thing of your enemies aren't instantly in a fight with you. They're this sort of multi-stage AI which It's very familiar to people now, but you know, when you enter somewhere people don't know where you are and you see the process of them spotting you. And yeah, that can feel like, oh, that's something I've I've failed fundamentally. I guess I don't know if I've sort of recently playing these games as action games, sort of trained myself to to not feel bad when I see that happen, but I I do know exactly what you mean. Yeah, yeah.

Matthew
17:01
I will say from the the the little bit I've played, I was surprised by the the tone of that that when you enter the areas you are in a sort of stealth mode because the the messaging and the adverts have been so kind of zany and sort of action filled. I I I was actually struck by how much it did feel stealthy. Maybe more so like in like the early parts of the day where 'Cause the areas are naturally a bit quieter at the start and then they kind of uh they sort of change as you know, as the day goes on and things kind of ramp up a bit. Um but yeah, I was I was actually surprised at how At least in these first few hours, that you are kind of on the back foot and i having to take things. You know, a bit bit bit more quietly. Yeah. I mean maybe that seems daff 'cause you've both now played the whole game and you've amassed this action arsenal and you're really competent like action presences in that world now. But definitely at the outset. you know, you are very aware of not getting caught.

Jeremy
18:06
Yeah, I think it does have a natural arc in that way where in the beginning you're trying to make sense of these levels and find stuff and, you know, maybe find clever way to kind of clear a bunch of enemies and you know by triggering a trap or something like that and it does kind of more naturally lend itself to sneaking around. I feel like it the default there is a kind of action stealth in this one where you've got your sort of machete and your almost kind of Far Cry-esque thing of running around doing kind of death from above leaps onto people and um My my setup for a long time at the beginning of the game was to have a machete in my right hand and a silenced SMG obfound in my left hand. and try and kind of like use them in in combination. But I guess over time when you become familiar with the levels And you've got a specific goal in mind for one of them, you're not so fussed about you know I'm just gonna cleave through this bunch of enemies in combat to get the thing I need and get out again.

Samuel
19:08
Yeah, I think that's true. I think what's what's interesting in this game is there is you know, obviously it's set in a time loop, but it's not a roguelike. It doesn't reset your progress as such. The day resets, but because early on you get this resource called residuum or or Presidium, I don't know how you pronounce that, but um you use that to infuse the different guns and uh powers you find in the game which are called slabs, as well as um weapon trinkets and character trinkets which which offer you different perks. So for example if you want to double jump that's a character trinket you can equip four of those and whereas a weapon trinket is something like you know you can be ac more accurate over long distances with a short range gun that's that's an example of a weapon trinket and guns can have three of those each So over time you accumulate this vast arsenal and like Jeremy says you can uh go into a later area and clear people out and it's not like a big deal. I will say That the the idea that the game that maybe I felt like the game leans a bit too much towards making stealth feel like the right way to play it actually only crystallized for me when I got to the end game and I was revisiting areas and I was switching on some of my more powerful slabs like um uh Carnesis, which uh is like a a sort of telekinetic kind of tentacle whip attack you can like um suspend an enemy in midair and and Or like you can throw them into other enemies and it's just a it's a cool power and Havoc which lets you um uh absorb damage uh without losing health basically. and you can customize that to have a kind of like explosive uh sort of action at the end of at the end of using it, which is quite cool. And I was kind of storming into areas with my fancy shotgun, my fancy um Gun that you can fire uh while reload while it's still firing, that's a cool gun. And I was trying to make sense of like the game bombards you with so much information when you're caught. that even when you're that powerful, I think it's still maybe maybe it's just a failure of messaging a little bit, but it still makes it feel like stealth is the right way. How did you feel but once you reach the end game, Jeremy? Did you just not think about that at all

Jeremy
21:06
I sort of wonder how much of it is so this is a game where the order of events in the story and in the kind of arc of your weapons and the kind of powers you get is different for everyone I think. So what you end up with early on I think probably shapes how you approach it quite a lot. Like if I hadn't found that Scionst SMG early on. I don't think maybe I wouldn't have attempted that kind of action stealth approach that I had because I would have just been left with the nail gun, which I think you talked about on a previous episode. Which is quite tricky to to master as a stealth weapon. Yeah, it's it's a weird one.

Matthew
21:45
Uh yeah, I would say I it's interesting you sort of like the messaging of it. And, you know, I think a problem Arcane have had in the past or not a problem, but a thing they've run up against is that, you know, they have these very complex action systems but people kind of s you know, ignore them totally to play as stealth. And, you know, I feel like this game is like their best attempts at Trying to like loosen you up a bit. I mean there's some quite explicit messaging in the tutorial phases where it sort of says, you know, story-wise, you've kind of done what you need to do right here, right now. Like you can explore. Like there's loads here. But like honestly you'll find to kind of go on and come back later. And there's literally a box that pops up and says, It's okay to move on and come back later and I feel like they're trying to kind of teach you something. like bigger there and this is probably like a wider discussion later when we're talking more generally about immersive sims but there is a problem of of l with this particular genre I think of teaching people like how to play them or how to think about them. to maybe get the full extent of of what you can do in them.

Jeremy
22:55
Yeah, I think that's massive for this game actually. It's almost re retraining people at two ends of the spectrum. So you got people who played Dishonored as a straight action game and finished it in eight hours, just kind of went from A to B to the objective and didn't see all the kind of incredible side stuff that the Mercy Sim heads tends to bang on about. And then there are people like me who I it almost feels like an obligation for me to scour every level in Dishonored, even if I don't necessarily feel like it 'cause I want to make sure I've seen everything. And with the premise of Deathloop, as you say, you can you can do that kind of A-B run of a level and not worry about having missed stuff You you can end up with a really sort of frenetic pace for um for a mission. Well I'm I'm gonna see all of this eventually because I'm gonna be coming back. And equally if you're not someone who necessarily sees that in a level initially or expects to explore, it's gonna happen anyway because you're gonna be doing these different missions across it and you're gonna gradually build up this organic knowledge of a place which I wrote in my review of it it's a bit like uh you know moving to a new place and you sort of you know you you go to the I was gonna say go to the gym. I don't go to the gym. But you go to you go to the gym. What a bogus anecdote. You go to the office. I don't do that either. Listen, people go to places and they get to know the areas around those places. And then at certain point they go on a car journey and then they connect those two places up in their head. And that's how you get to know somewhere. And I feel that that's what a death loop level is like.

Samuel
24:41
Yeah, very eloquently put. I think what i it is interesting that one of the triumphs of this game is the structure. And while the time leap I think for me created a little bit of repetition later on, I think the objective system of this game means that you always feel like you you have a a goal that you're moving towards. You never feel like helpless in the time loop. It uses like a clue system to basically tell you, well, this person's gonna be at this place at this time, so you might want to go there and see what the deal is or Well, this person needs this item from this location, so maybe go check it out. And over time, you're kind of like following these strands of clues until you reach a key piece of information you need to break the fi to do the final loops, basically, and finish the game. And it's a very slow journey towards that, but it's an exciting one. As I mentioned on that previous episode, you feel like a detective a lot of the time. Jeremy, I was really curious what you made of this structure, because when we talked about it in the um in our DMs. You suggested that you come across some like uh a kind of something key before you were supposed to find it and I wondered how that shapes your your experience of the structure of this game.

Jeremy
25:44
Yeah, I happened to kind of come across a an area beneath one of the levels and realized it could open up. areas in in different levels. I was like, okay, I'm gonna dedicate a few of the in-game days to working this out. And it turned out to be kind of attached to what in another game you would imagine to be a third act uh revelation about the characters. But be because of the the fact that I decided to plow down in that specific area, I got that early Which is kind of amazing. Like the the the order of the plot is really sort of up for grabs in this game in a way that's quite unusual. I think it works because alongside that you have a sort of you know, your arc of your building powers. and whatever order you get the information in, your understanding is building over time. And that's explicitly what Colt is trying to do. He's like, come on, I've got to I've got to work this out if I'm gonna if I'm gonna fix it, then it's called fixing it is is breaking it. I think that's really interesting. And and the what they do to kind of uh make that bearable is really clearly and regularly kind of collate what you've got for you and order it all sort of in your menus and in your objectives and tell you what you've got and where you know what that means and where you can go with it. It's I don't know it's maybe maybe even a little too keen to do that and occasionally I was like, oh I hadn't actually quite put that together myself yet what I had, but the game just kind of told me.

Matthew
27:17
But so I I will say like in the very little bit I've played, I've already got a couple of bits of information where I'm like, do we know that? Like where did that come from? Like I I don't know if that's just a quirk of of you know maybe I just missed a bit of NPC dialogue that triggered it. But there's definitely been moments, you know, in that limited time where I've been walking through a room. And then a c and then like the the interface has popped up in the bottom corner saying, Oh, you now know that so and so does this thing. And I I don't know if I did actually discover that or if it if it if I did, it was it was slightly lost on me. And And maybe that's just like unluckiness. But I yeah.

Jeremy
27:58
I had a few moments like that. I think that's kind of if I have an issue with the storytelling, it's that. But if it I I feel like if that's necessary to kind of keep you on track. I'll let you know what you have, then I'll I'll take it. I feel like um I was talking to Matt Purzler of IGN. uh the other day about this. I feel like there's another version of this game where and maybe this is the game that some people are still expecting at this point, where you really have to work out the puzzle of how to get the visionaries together and how to use all the information you got. That could have been a lot harder. That could have been a huge chunk of the game. I think if that had been a huge chunk of the game, you would have too much to think about and it would be kind of overbearing. So I I kind of like where they've landed with it even if it's slightly I think I agree with you Matthew, it's slightly overkeen in that regard.

Matthew
28:55
Oh uh say without without s without spoiling it for me and our listeners, um like I'm assuming this isn't something you could you could in theory solve in your first loop outside of the tutorial because the tutorial is kind of a guided experience through the early hours. I'm assuming you can't like accidentally complete this really easily like That like I get the feeling that it's gonna gate certain stuff behind information that you have to have.

Samuel
29:23
Yeah, your instincts are correct there. You do need There there's like uh some bits where you just you need information from another place in order to open a certain door or Well that's good.

Matthew
29:46
Is the risk you always run is that some, you know, clever bastard like me can uh sneak in and Type. You have total freedom there to accidentally stumble onto like the big thing in the first word you type, if you were lucky. And uh that can be very sort of uh sort of disenheartening a sort of experience, you know?

Jeremy
30:13
Yeah. I think I think in this there are definitely s certain things you need to complete it that by necessity guide you through kind of revelations and and fun stuff. I reckon it having finished it, you could probably work out the shortest route to those things. You could probably skip some steps. I don't know how you feel about that Samuel, but it's probably possible. But realistically most people are going to hit most of the same beats just in different orders. Right.

Samuel
30:43
Yeah, I think that there is still I I feel like I got to the the bit that Jeremy mentioned earlier about finding out more about the the levels um as a sort of third act reveal. I did get to slightly later, but generally speaking there is uh a cadence of discovering information based on the clues that you're given and like going to places for the first or second time that just give you a sort of natural path. I reckon like Probably players' journey through the game is gonna be about 75% the same between different players. And this is the other thing, you are I don't think it's a spoiler really to say that There is only one way to kill all all the targets in one day. It's that's not to say there's not like, you know, big permutations uh to your approach as a kind of like uh you know as an immersive sim shooter stealth game. Like there definitely are. But it's not like Jeremy says it's not like it's not a free form tapestry you're piecing together and you're like, okay, go here it's a this exact time shoot this person in the head, leave, do this, this and this. It's like it's a it's it's a lot more guided than that. The game literally lays it out for you step by step. So, you know, maybe to some players that will be that may feel like a compromise, but I think, you know, it's a blockbuster game that's releasing exclusively on PS5. I think that that's not terribly surprising. And I think when it works well, it creates a breadcrumb trail in a really interesting way. Makes you feel like a detective. I really liked, you know, early on, there is uh in Carlsbay, one of the areas the um that's got like a dock area with a couple of hangers. There's a target there in the morning. Harriet, who I mentioned on a previous episode. And there is also a shed that's got a bunch of fireworks in it. And if you've been to Up Down, which is probably like the the most detailed location in the game at night. You know, there's a party there where fireworks go off. And all you know at that point is, there's must be a connection between these and that that I have to figure out. And like It took me about ten more hours to come back and have the solution to that. And I really enjoyed that journey as a player. So I think it is I think While it can be too guided, it's still good at creating a breadcrumb trail and making the payoff feel exciting. Is that how you felt, Jeremy?

Jeremy
32:48
Yeah, definitely. And and the like interconnectedness of those levels is really like a a major win for this game I think down to the fact that you can be standing in Updown and look down the cliff and you can see Carl's Bay and vice versa. Like you it there's something I I kinda think of Arcane as like the you know the last heroes of the the level as opposed to open world and what have you, like the masters of creating these very distinctly. spaces with our own characters but even within that they make sure that it's all it's all kind of linked inextricably and there's something really satisfying about seeing something in one level and going, I bet if I change that, it would change something else I spotted that may be related in another level.

Samuel
33:34
Yeah, for sure. I think it's fantastic at that. I think as well, Matthew, the thing you said earlier about how the game says you can always come back later. So one of the first things I did in Up Darm at Night was there is a visionary target there, before you even get the resource known as Residium that lets you carry weapons between levels. And I absolutely brute forced it through the front door, killing about 30 enemies until I murdered this target, doing it one by one. Very painfully and slowly. And then after I killed the target, Colt went, There's gotta be an easier way to do this. And I really like that as a touch.

Matthew
34:12
I would say from my early hours, uh the character of Colt and his voice actor, who I I don't know who's who's voicing him, is like a huge, huge win in this game. Oh, you're right. Like he's really charismatic and he really sells you on the whole situation and carries you through What are quite a confusing first couple of hours? Like I'd say this asks quite a lot of you from the off you you have to kinda go with it for a couple of hours to kinda get your footing, to even really get the concept of the game. And he re like his hi the fact that he isn't like some brainiac. Like he's just sort of constantly in disbelief at the whole thing. I think is is like a real crutch. Like it really c it ri you know, that is like an essential part. I don't think like it would work at all without him.

Jeremy
34:59
Yeah. I love that they lean into the what did I do last night hangover angle. It's like if Chris Nolan made a kind of like dumb teen drinking movie or something. And yeah the that they have for for Colt really sort of um he's got a brilliant goofiness to him and a very relatable also almost kind of Nathan Drake like he'll say what you're thinking. And go I I don't know what's happening here regularly. Good good swearing as well. A lot of swearing.

Matthew
35:29
I liked it. I like well I I I'm enjoying that element of it at the moment.

Jeremy
35:33
Yeah, it makes weirdly makes it feel more like it's in our world than um you know a classic arcane game in a dishonored or whatever they'd come up with an alternate swear wouldn't they I guess or Uh d people don't swear in those worlds or don't seem to. Yeah, it feels like although it's sort of removed and it's in the sixties, I think. Um and it's on this strange superma supernatural island, this is a a world we kinda know.

Samuel
35:59
Jason E. Kelly is the voice actor behind Colt, by the way. That's the one credit to him. Yeah, absolutely. So I have I I really want to talk about the story and style a bit more, but like the one thing I was going to note about the journey through this game that I really liked was There are some areas you go through in your effort to learn about how to kill all these visionaries at once. You will kill these visionaries multiple times. You'll have like a haphazard first go at it and then you'll get better at it over time. That's a really cool thing in this game. And there are some levels you'll only go to once, and they feel like sort of like proper arcane levels. So There's an area called Fristad Rock, I think it is. And in the morning there's this Krooner guy there called Frank. And to get into his recording studio. You have to basically leave your powers at the door. And that includes your ability to come back from the dead twice in a level. And that is a really like a self-contained arcane level within the game, basically. It's like you don't have a reason to go there when you're you're in the end game. I did go there yesterday just to kind of like potter about. But it's like you go there once and kind of do the level and then sort of move on. And I thought that was really cool, Jeremy. There's a couple of examples. that how did you feel about that stuff?

Jeremy
37:11
Yeah that one specifically it is it feels like yeah a a self-contained level and you it changes the rules. The things that you rely on like your reprise reprise ability which lets you effectively have three lives per day that's gone because all of your all of your powers uh powers are nulled by going into this paranoid old Krooners uh studio home. Um so you've got to play it completely differently. That's really feels like a kind of stealth first area. And yeah, and like you say, there's There are certain parts of chunks of the level which end up as really memorable set pieces which you don't really have a reason to go back to again. Another one is in Updam, which is on a a separate island which almost kind of Zelda or Metroidvania style, is just not open except at a particular time of day. There's a bridge which it just isn't there. Um so you know by definition that that is kind of its own level and it has its own style. It's almost a kind of um by a there's a game designer called Charlie Montague and he's um Would you say he's a sort of Peter Mono type?

Samuel
38:23
Uh well it definitely like uh sort of vocal creative director type, you know?

Jeremy
38:28
Yeah, very much so. And uh he's running effectively a live action among us. in in a building off to the side of Updown and you go in there as the invader. So that's a like a a real kind of set piece moment. It's unlike anything else in the game. And I have done it a few times, but you could do that only once, and you that's gonna, you know, it's it's not as if because this is a repeating looping game. that it all blurs into one, you do have those standout memories. Yeah for sure.

Samuel
38:58
The the the course through the game is um the structure of the game is is yeah very interesting and and well executed I think. It doesn't um I got a tiny bit of repetition later on where I was just looking to hoover up some of the last few clues, but generally speaking I think they've done that very well considering the time deep aspect of the game. So let's talk a bit more about the style and story a bit then. This is where it's very different to previous Arcane games. Obviously we know that, you know, Deathleap is um it is set in the sixties, it's got It's got like a matching color palette. It's got m music that's been original music that sort of fits the time period. Has like I don't know, slightly sort of it' TV show of the time sort of aesthetic to it. You know, sort of maybe like an Avengers-y aesthetic. It's a hard thing to pin down. Prisoner or something. Yeah, a bit of James Bond as well. And Yeah, I suppose Jeremy to ask you about that side of things, how did you feel about the um the style of this game versus other arcane games?

Jeremy
39:51
Yeah, it's very distinct and I think because it's closer to the real world it took a while for it to seep in with me. But by the end And there's a beautiful Elvis style ballad that plays in certain places in the game and as we as we taught the game's not quite out yet and I'm desperate to find out once once it's out what that song is because I I'm completely in love with it. The soundtrack is is stunning And yeah, all the kind of original songs that are in there really sort of they date the setting in quite a powerful way.

Samuel
40:23
Yeah, for sure. And I think that the uh the interplay between Colt and Juliana, who in the game is the target hunting you down. They're kind of like pitched as rivals basically. And they every time you enter an area, there is basically like a new exchange between them. Even after After you've uh finished the game and you're doing bits of the loop again, there'll still be n s new bits of dialogue you might not have heard before, which is really cool. Matthew, you're early on in the game, but I wondered how you felt about that dynamic.

Matthew
40:50
Yeah, I mean so Like the bit I've played is very sort of scripted. Like their relationship, like you get a lot of it. It's great though. I mean sh the she she's also like the voice acting on her is abs absolutely superb and the whole thing is like a lot more playful than I thought it was gonna be. Like I thought she was gonna be more of this like unknowable thing, but actually she's also quite kind of charismatic and slightly goofy in her own way, but also like you know, definitely sort of suitably sort of threatening. I've not had like any kind of um uh like organic encounter with her. I've I've had like a scripted encounter with her so far. But yeah, I like style wise, um I i I think it really, really delivers. I've I I must admit I found a lot of the trailers and advertising for this game like a a bit kind of hectic and a bit hard to kind of get a hold on in terms of like exactly what it was going for. And you know, from what I've seen the game can be that that version of the game. Like it can get, you know, spicy and all this stuff going on. But in between, you know, I like that it's still got like the the you know, the attention to detail and the kind of pace of exploration that you'd expect from from an arcane game, but it's it's a a lot of friendlier or funnier looking world. I like the kind of p spice pasty element of it. Um it's a little bit like No One Lives Forever. Um weirdly There's a lot in this game that reminds me of We Happy Few um from a couple of years ago, which must have come out while they were working on this. I'm not saying it was an influence, but I wondered if they felt Like the the the kind of um the sort of psychedelic kind of sinister kind of combo of it's so brightly coloured but everyone's like a maniac, kind of masks, face paint, quite uh uh that there's definit like there there's there's rooms and buildings in this where I thought this could like this could be we happy for you which yeah I think is is

Samuel
42:46
pure coincidence but Yeah, s same influences I would say.

Matthew
42:50
Yeah, absolut yeah, absolutely. But um yeah, look I'm I I I I'm just surprised at how massive the areas are as well. Like I I haven't begun to get a grasp of them in in in what I've played, but You kind of you know they're sort of sold as having like a centerpiece of like, oh, there's gonna be this big machine in this area, but there's actually like tons of stuff around it. Like they're the the individual areas definit f definitely feel bigger than like any individual area in a dishonored game or whatever and it's it's just kind of exciting 'cause you think, well, all of this is gonna kinda be that arcane quality to discover which is, you know I don't know. They they feel just full of potential whenever you whenever you enter a new space.

Jeremy
43:31
Yeah, yeah. And they're layered quite beautifully. You can you can see it in the art. It I think it kind of goes back to the The dishonored when Arkham were working with uh Victor Antonov, who's often kind of credited with designing the look of uh city seventeen in Half-Life 2 and his stuff had that kind of you know City seventeen is a kind of Eastern European city with a sort of totalian totalitarian alien thing layered on top and Dunwall is a kind of kind of Victorian Edinburgh slash London with again these sort of technological crushing aspects built onto it that tell a story. And we'd definitely you've got a kind of um It's apparent that, you know, you go to Up Dharm, it's like this was a fishing village at one point. Probably not a very profitable one. Also there was a sort of military installation across this island at one time that also doesn't seem to be operational anymore. And then on top of that you've got all these maniacs partying and painting the place in garish colours. And that feels like you can kind of pick away at over time.

Samuel
44:42
So, okay, let's um combine discussing the endgame a bit with discussing the multiplayer in this and the Juliana concept. So Matthew, as you point out, there is a scripted encounter with her at first, and then later on she'll pop up in your game. I imagine the vast majority of people will play this game. In single player mode. You can turn it on so it's just the AI Juliana who attacks you. She always knows where she you are where you are. She'll pop pop up. She'll usually have some kind of like novel power she's using. And then she'll like start a fight, and most of the time you'll be able to kill her and take a kind of slab from her or a slab upgrade and then move on. But the point I'm at now is I've got the final loop that I can repeat over and over again. And all I want to do is invade other players' games and have other players invade me. And it took me reaching the end of the game to realise that Juliana is the end game. And her interrupting that loop is what will keep you playing after the credits have rolled. Jeremy, do you agree with that?

Jeremy
45:42
I completely agree. And just because of the way the review process has been on this online has only just been unlocked so I played through the whole game with Juliana as uh uh an AI and didn't play ASA and now went away for a week on holiday, came back and now I dived into what feels like maybe a whole second half of the game as Juliana, even though there's no there's no sort of dual public story on that aspect. It feels it d really does feel like the end game where you your strongest weapon is a kind of gorilla knowledge of the maps because As Julia you only have one life and cult potentially has three in a level, so you don't have to get the drop on him just once. You have to do it. Three times unless he kills himself on some other, you know, part of the map and some NPCs. But it it really I guess this is really where the stealth unfolds in this game as well you really have to think about your sort of routes to attack and just kind of hold in your head everything you know about these levels if you're gonna have a chance of beating other players. I think it's weighted in the right way as well because you know the the single player or the the cult player has the most to lose because they're potentially, you know, the third or fourth level of their day and because of the roguelike element of the game they could lose stuff that they've built up over the last few hours. So it's it's they have an easier time in this dynamic. But It that feels right, um, that it's really it's really hard to win as due owner, but I feel like I'm sort of coming to to grips with it now, and it does feel like That's true mastery in this game is to be able to do that.

Samuel
47:32
Yeah. So let me tell you a bit about my encounters with Juliana. So okay, I mean they've all been really funny, first of all. Like um So like Jeremy says, having an intimate knowledge of the maps is just incredibly important to being able to do this properly because when I've played as Juliana, it's um zapped me into Up Darm at night, so there's obviously a party going on. And what's interesting is you're just looking for clues that Colt has been around. So you'll see some turrets That have been hacked by him. You know, you might see like an area that's meant to have NPCs no longer has NPCs, but you see some remains and you're like, okay, he's been around here. And then I did find one of his dead bodies at the side of a cliff. So obviously the player had fell down, which was funny. And then I got to the I I was going through the party looking for him, sort of skulking around. And he'd like he died in front of a turret in like the courtyard of the party. And I was like carefully looking at it, thinking, where might he have gone? And because he had like one more reprise, he popped up behind me and just shot me. And I was like, ah, fuck. Um But when I've been playing as Colt in Up Darm at Night, I had the funniest, the funniest experience yesterday, which was I had a player relentlessly pursuing me. And here's the thing, right? If Juliana opens the door in the map, then like you as Colts see that the door is open and you're like. I know that door's closed because I've been through this map many times. So I know that she was looking at this bit of the party for me because she thought, okay, well this is probably why Colt's here at night. He's trying to hear he's here to finish the loop and kill Alexis, the uh visionary at the party. And what happened was that um I I went back to where the uh you have to hack like a uh sort of like antenna in order to escape the level again. And um Giuliana, one of Giuliana's goals is to stop you from doing that basically. And I went back and like um hacked the antenna while that while the Giuliana was looking for me at the party. And then I think like that that made the player sense, okay, well if he's hacked that then I know he's in the other part of Up Dime, he's not here. And they they came after me and One of Juliana's like um powers, she's got like a power that Colt doesn't have, which is she can take the role of um any NPC in the game. But it's a dead giveaway when you see a crash test dummy doing the most rad fucking parkour across the rooftops of Up Done. You're like, that's subtle. I mean, oh look, that NPC appears. to be teleporting. And then you just get into like this sort of um this great firefight with them and then you know she killed me next to the antenna but when I did reprise I was on a a rooftop nearby and she was investigating my body and I just sniped her from the side and took her out. And that was such a satisfying encounter because uh that is the thing. Players can't help themselves. They can't behave like NPCs when they have that power activated. Um I d I went to another part of the the world. And Juliana appeared, swiping at me wildly with a machete. Um and this is before the game's actually like live. So I don't know what it's like to test in a live environment. And a little bit of lag playing as Juliana in the um pre-release phase, but they they did you know caution that it wasn't ready yet. But the potential is enormous, isn't it, Jeremy?

Jeremy
50:54
Yeah, I had a little bit of lag as well, but January had a fantastic time. Yeah, that with the masquerade skill that Giuliana's got, there is some um potential for social stealth for for the patient I guess. But that party really is something else as Giuliana for one thing because the NPCs are your mates. You get to wander around and hear all the bits dialogue that you wouldn't normally hear because you know you're shooting the place up or you're trying to sneak around. I had an amazing encounter with uh Oscar, the editor of play. magazine where um I was masquerading as someone in the party and he was effectively hunting me as Colt. There's a real sort of cat and mouse dynamic to that. Um and I was stuck behind a bar trying to blend in. And I saw when the other player's invisible, there's a sort of how would you describe it? A kind of shimmer, right? There's a slight tell, and I saw the shimmer coming round the side of the this cocktail bar at me and just suddenly Oscar must have seen this NPC just double jump over the bar and sprint away. Um kind of social stealth into online FPS moments.

Samuel
52:11
Yeah, that is exactly it. It's just so so funny. Like uh I I just could not stop laughing what I saw like uh a regular a regular ass enemy just like fucking sprinting for their life and stuff. I just It's so so entertaining. Yeah. Um and I don't think I even realized the what the comic potential of it was. I just thought because in the main game You get used to Juliana being a bit of a nuisance 'cause you're like, Well these encounters are pretty similar, you kill her and you move on and like she turns up and you're like, Oh not right now. But you When you're doing the loop again, the final on on the end game, you're waiting for her to turn up because you don't you know you've proven to the game that you can kill all the visionaries, so that part doesn't matter anymore. But you're just there thinking, come on, invade my game, let's just see what happens. And for them, it's just a massive like uh it's like a it's like a a game, you know, detective game and then an FPS, like you say, it just really, really wild and inventive. So I think that's got a lot of potential. Yeah. And it's got I'm pumped. I'm pumped to play it. You should have me invade your game before the end of the weekend, Matthew, that'd be fun.

Jeremy
53:10
Yeah, I'm I'm slightly jealous of um a view Matthew people who might get to feel that kind of terror of an invasion when you're actually midway through campaign and you have something to lose. And uh like Samuel says, it doesn't really come as a shock for us if if we're coming into the game like having completed it we're we're trying to trigger an invasion essentially. Um which is really fun but you don't get that sense of you know, one of the real strengths of an invasion mode is it kind of violates that sense of of safety that you Have in a single player game and you're like, oh god, there's there's another player in here with me, and that just kind of completely changes how you're looking at the environment you're in. I don't know how that's gonna feel in Death League.

Matthew
53:57
world now. Yes.

Jeremy
53:58
Yeah it does. Oh okay. So it makes it very clear. Yeah it's not as if she could just suddenly be shooting you uh and you have no chance. But it does have some of that kind of um in the early Watch Dogs games I think they have really strong invasion modes where, you know, as as the invader you're watching someone running around behaving as people do in a single player game and they they get distracted by stuff and you kind of wait for the ideal ambush point when they're, you know, maybe caught up off guard in a fight or what have you.

Samuel
54:31
The mastery in this game generally is um i is is exciting. Like I I I haven't really I haven't fully explored, I guess, what the potential of the different builds are, but I now have a a sort of turning invisible. And like um it's got a version of the um Dishonored Domino power in this, um called Nexus, where whatever happens to one enemy happens to a a bunch of enemies. One of the coolest things I did in this was I snuck into the party at night. There is a room that is like a like a a dance floor basically I cast Nexus onto all of the people below and with a single nail made an entire dance floor just drop. Um top dead. And it was like so bleak to watch but so fun. And without saying more, I also managed to kill two of the visionaries with a single bullet yesterday. Um, which I was pretty proud of. And I was just there thinking, I wish I'd fucking streamed this or recorded it or something. Now all I can do is say that it happened, but um Anyway. See I I guess before we get into some final um closing thoughts then Jeremy, is it is that how you feel about the um the mastery side of things? Do you think there's like a a real versatility to how you can shape your version of cult at the end of this game?

Jeremy
55:38
Yeah, and a lot of it comes from the uh the trinkets and the the sort of upgrades that you can swap about for your powers and Uh I don't play a lot of deck building roguelikes, but I imagine that's how mastery feels in those games as well. Like I I ended up with a few builds that I was really proud of. One time I kind of invaded the party and I had a trinket which meant that turrets that I'd turned to my side were incredibly powerful. And I was also using Nexus to group enemies together so that one thing that happens to one of them happens to all of them and a trinket which meant that enemies killed by Nexus healed me. So I ended up with this just insane full frontal assault where I was grouping these enemies together, one of them get hit by a turret, all my health would be topped up. And then equally I had another you kind of match them to the levels, right, in your goals. I had a sort of extreme stealth build where Um I had a trinket where if my power was drained it would drain my health for extra power and then I sort of souped that up with extra health regen and stuff to make sure I could survive that. But then I could become invisible for kind of several seconds longer than I would have been able to otherwise. If I'd been caught in combat, I would have been completely screwed, but you can create these really sort of um min-maxed builds and kind of think through like what's gonna make me the most powerful I can be for this situation.

Matthew
57:07
That's interesting. I I I must admit I always found the modifiers around the edge of Dishonored, like the the whalebone bits and all like the l probably like the least interesting Interesting bit of those games. Um but I never really felt the desire to connect with that with those systems in the past.

Jeremy
57:36
I think sometimes in Dishonored they were just kind of wary of um I don't know to read into intent too much but they weren't they weren't terribly powerful most of the the bone charms and stuff in the way that you could the extent to which you can modify how things play, and this some of them are quite extreme. You can, you know the It ha it has that thing, that sort of card game thing where you will get a certain trinket and look at it and go, I can build around that. Like there's There's gotta be a sort of overpowered thing that I can do with this and then sort of pick up more and experiment with with um you know pushing them together and see what happens.

Samuel
58:17
In which case then, like uh let's wrap up then by uh I guess I I guess Jeremy i you it gets a firm recommendation from you, right?

Jeremy
58:24
Yeah, yeah. I've uh when when does this go out? I'm trying to work up.

Samuel
58:28
This is going out about about three days after the game comes out

Jeremy
58:30
Okay, so imminently if not already, Play Magazine in the UK will be out with my ten out of ten recommendation of Deathloop, which I think sends it straight to the top of the mag's kind of hall of fame of what you should get on a PS five. Yeah. And you know, I have I have the odd reservation like this the slight lag, hopefully that doesn't persist. And you know, what Matthew's talking about with the sort of the plot being slightly ahead of you at times. That's really all there is. I I think could be the equal of Dishonored 2 for Arcane. It kind of pushes into, you know, a a sort of more friendlier, a sort of more accessible version of their strengths, but doesn't really compromise any of the stuff which makes their games incredible I I really think it's a game of the year contender.

Samuel
59:20
Yeah, for me I I'm reviewing of Tet Radar, I haven't settled on my score yet. I think like it it won't get a perfect score for me 'cause I'm still I'm not totally comfortable with where it falls as a stealth game versus a combat game. But I still think it's fantastic. I think that in a lot of ways I think this is being asked to do too much heavy lifting as the one big PS five exclusive that's out this holiday season because it's you know, it's a still an odd ball game. In a lot of ways. It's you know, it's made for a subset of people rather than everyone, like a lot of um Sony's exclusives are. And you know, that is a lot to ask of a game from Arcane. But I think that People who who like Dishonored will definitely dig this for sure. Matthew, do you have any thoughts before we wrap up?

Matthew
01:00:01
Uh I look forward to playing more of it and I hope that It has a bit more mainstream appeal. I hope it just reaches a few more people, which I think it probably could, just because tonally it's much funnier and much easier to like already after just a few hours I think than than dishonored. Um but uh yeah.

Samuel
01:00:21
Yeah, great stuff. Okay, let's take a short break then and we'll come back with some immersive sim chatter. Welcome back to the podcast. So in this section we're going to talk a bit about the history of the immersive sim genre, which is one of Jeremy's specialties. So, this genre essentially starts in the early 90s with Looking Glass Studios Ultima Underworld games, a spin-off from the Ultima series. These games are praised for their emergent gameplay, and Looking Glass Studios would go on to make similar types of games. System Shock and the Thief series following that. By the late 90s, they're experiencing some financial issues, and producer Warren Spector, his part of Looking Glass, essentially dissolves in order to keep the company afloat. And just as these Austin-based developers are out of a job, John Romero rocks up of Ironstorm and he struck a deal with Idols to make four games, I think. And essentially offers this group of developers to carry on making the kinds of games that they're good at. So out of this comes Deus Ex. And this studio Ironstorm Austin would go on to make. another Deus Ex game and then Thief Deadly Shadows, they would eventually go out of business. Looking Glass had previously gone out of business in 2000. So the genre experience is a slightly fallow few years, but it has modern successes in the likes of Arcane Studios in Lyon, in France. Who would go on to make the Dishonored series and be acquired by Bethesda? And Iidos Montreal would bring the Deus Ex games back in 2011 with Human Revolution and then Mankind Divided. The strange thing about the immersive sim is the fact that there's never really been a blockbuster success in this genre. Despite the fact that these games are incredibly influential, which is almost paradoxical in a way. So what is an immersive sim? For those listening at home who don't really know? I thought I'd just um find how Warren Specter defined it in a Gama Sutra article, which I will link with the um the show notes in the description because um I've stolen their content. So Uh it's an immersive simulation game in that you are made to feel you're exactly in the game world with as little as possible getting in the way of the experience of being there. Ideally, nothing reminds you that you're just playing a game, not interface, not your character's backstory or capabilities, not game systems, nothing. It's all about how you interact with a relatively complex environment in ways that you find interesting. Rather than in ways the developers think are interesting, and in ways that move you closer to accomplishing your goals, not the developers' goals. Jeremy, that statement. Warren Specter, the whole deal. Go. What's your what are your thoughts?

Jeremy
01:03:03
So um it just so happens in I think the current issue of PC gamer there's a feature in which I talked to Warren Spector about the influence of D D on uh Immersive Sims. I guess when we think about Dungeons and Dragons in games, it tends to think of the the kind of dice rolls and the goblins and stuff that you you tend to get in the direct adaptations. But um Quite early on, Warren Spector was in a DD group run by Bruce Sterling, who went on to be a very well-known cyberpunk author. um because nothing in Warren Spector's life could just be normal and low key. Um and he he kind of fell in love with the sort of shared authorship of it and the idea that, you know, Bruce was kind of Coming up with these obstacles and the you know the other players would be the ones who determine how they overcame those obstacles. And the DM's job was to You know, try and accommodate where ideas essentially. And that's where the immersive sim kind of came out of was the having all these kind of systems to support physics and how, you know, different elements of the world interacted with each other was all about making sure that If a player thought, well maybe I could try this, then they'd be rewarded for it and it it might work or if it didn't work then something interesting would happen at least.

Samuel
01:04:30
Is that basically why games journalists revere these games? Is that because that sort of possibility space is just more exciting to us than games that feel like they're more prescribed. Is that fundamentally what their appeal is?

Jeremy
01:04:43
I yeah, I think so. I think it's um You know, if you play as many games as games journalists do, I think they'll naturally you start to see the joins and get a bit jaded about some of the tricks that you tend to see And so I think it's natural for um you know to be excited when you try something and it and it does work, even though it's not what you've been told to do. I think UK games journalists especially and PC games journalists have a sort of natural inclination to You know, if if you're in a a a demo for a game with a developer looking over your shoulder and they say, Well now you could got turn right and um and get in the car you just instinctively want to turn left and and see what happens. And Mrs. SIMs are the games that reward you most for doing that. These are the games that the developers have gone out of their way to go. Somebody will turn left, so what's gonna be there and how can we make sure that they feel good, that they were recognized in trying something? that wasn't immediately obvious.

Samuel
01:05:47
Matthew, what's your relationship to this genre?

Matthew
01:05:49
Yeah, I mean uh well in my head this genre uh say from the start is like a lot bigger than I than I remember it. you know, like watching things for this this episode and, you know, just just you know, reading some interviews, reading some articles, most of which are written by Jeremy. Um uh so I don't wanna just parrot back his own thoughts at him. And You know, I was just surprised at how few kind of core texts there really are that define this alleged genre. Like it's almost so small that you think. Is it? Is it is it actually a genre or is it is it is it specifically the work of a particular group of people because there's so many connec you know so much connective tissue between the teams. Is it actually, you know, is it would it be better off calling them Spectra like? or something. But yeah, I mean yeah, on the allure of them, you know, I think for a lot of a lot of gamers, PC gamers of of of my age, you know, was sort of cemented you know, reading PC Gamer and famously Kieran Gillen's Deus Ex review, where it just sounded like, you know, the the entire world sort of simulated in a way. you know, the the the you know the way he structured that review where he just talked about the same scenario but coming at it completely differently and how the game reacted and supported it every time and that just felt like alive. Um, you know, we've mentioned this on the podcast before with sort of Zelda games, you know, this thing where developers who can kind of second guess everything you're gonna do or create systems that can second guess what you're gonna do or sort Or whatever you're gonna do, just just feel like sort of magic in a way that, you know, uh a baked-in reaction uh never can. I I do think it's weird actually that that quote you read from Spectre about developers getting out of the way. Because in my head, like they also you know, they're essential for creating fun tools. Like I I associate like interesting creative tools which come from somewhere which give you a a a you know a box of tricks to kind of play with. Which that that that quote maybe sort of undermines that a bit.

Samuel
01:07:59
Uh maybe. I mean I suppose the point is that once they've given you the tools they're not getting in your way. That's the kind of that's the point I suppose. What they've presented to you, they're not getting in the way of that, is kinda how I interpret it.

Matthew
01:08:09
Yeah, but they give you like crazy functions which are like beyond Yeah, I'd I'd I I I associate, I guess, crazy out there functions with these games and and you know, the ability to do certain things which just aren't in other games and their, you know, their abilities or weapons or equipment which have lots of multiple uses to them. But I guess that's probably still supported by that quote.

Jeremy
01:08:34
Yeah, I I know what you mean. There's a kind of um there's two ways of of kind of approaching it really, like there's this have It's probably not a genre that's been so heavily theorized and and talked about in this way, partly because I think looking glass was, you know, a lot of people from MIT and at one point they even talked about establishing like an internal lecture series like that. Ever that didn't take off, but I don't think there's really a kind of a set of developers who, you know, have publicly spoken about the craft so much. Um and in that way it can seem quite abstract. and kind of lofty I guess but at the other end of it there these are generally you can see these games you can recognize them by a bunch of tropes that they have as well. Like you generally if you there's a an action approach and there's some ways around that. Maybe you're crawling in some vents. There's probably turrets that you can turn to help you. Usually you're some kind of super spy with some kind of supernatural or cybernetic abilities. So even though like you know Warren Specter can say, you know, the designer's hand isn't so much in an immersive sim as in another genre. Actually, you can see the kind of the trends and the the taste of these this set of people which like you say many of them have kind of uh Arcane Austin for instance that's the same city that Ironstorm Austin was in and many of the stuff carried over from there and Ironstorm Austen, that was originally the thief team at Looking Glass. So it's an even smaller genre than it appears, really. It's very much built on the the taste of a quite a small pool of Americans and now French people. Ca Canadians, sorry, I just Montreal Canadian.

Samuel
01:10:28
So uh Jeremy, how has the genre changed over time? What are the corners generally cut to make it work in the modern age? For me, uh it's become like one of Sort of like sanding off some of the weirder edges a bit and making making them just a bit more playable. We talked about how um you know your tasting games, how when you start playing these, these were PC only uh games and you know you'd never see a you know a blockbuster just release on PC these days, it doesn't happen. It comes to console. So that means some shortcuts in terms of interface and And um even though I think the spirit of the games has been has been retained, there's something kind of like wild about some of those earlier games that and and challenging and specific that maybe you don't get in the modern age. What do you think about how it's changed over time?

Jeremy
01:11:10
Yeah, I guess the turning point for that was Bioshock, right? And that That was it's both the first enormous immersive sim hit and depending on who you ask not an immersive sim because it simplified a lot of stuff. I mean for me personally I I class it as one and I love that game. But um You know, it's it was made by the team, uh the key figures who'd made System Shock 2, but it was also a deliberate attempt to kind of Go, how do we make this a not just a PC thing, but something that takes on the kind of accessibility that something like you know GTA 3 had had where rather than pressing a button to walk up to the car and then open the door and then climb in and another button to close the door and then another to hold a gun to the guy's head or whatever, you do that all in one button press. Bioshock is like how do we how do we do this for the age of you know you put it sticking everything on a controller and making it less intimidating. It's weird though because I feel like That's been that approach has been somewhat rejected since. Like the games that studios like Arcane and um you know the more recent Deus Ex games, they've They've stepped back a little bit from some of that simplification, you would you say?

Matthew
01:12:27
Yeah, no, I d uh uh yeah, I I'd agree with that. I thought I think Ken Levine's like a weird figure. in in the in the genre, in terms of I I always see him like asso I associate him with being more of like a narrative guy and like a narrative sort of vision. Maybe that's wrong. Maybe I don't know his career well well enough But to me, that's always been the strange thing in that these games are like emergent and reactive mechanically. But also have these really incredible baked-in stories to discover which are very scripted and authored. And it's I I've never quite married those two things and I don't know if there is like a tension within the genre between those two things. And like Bioshock is definitely more of the, you know I'd say has puts narrative forwards for me like it's mechanically the least it's I would say it's almost not an immersive sin mechanically, but

Jeremy
01:13:21
Yeah, it still has that um another sort of key immersive thin thing which we haven't talked about so much yet is the the way exploration feels like a kind of archaeology and you're you're digging through a world maybe it's you know disturbing Maybe it's not quite there yet, but you're sort of reading notes or listening to audio diaries and stuff. That's kind of a cliche now, but that's that's where that stuff came from, is immersive sims.

Matthew
01:13:46
And Bioshock and So you think so you think it's then that narrative like Delivery method is is is that's the define that's the defining feature rather than the actual kind or depth of the narratives.

Jeremy
01:14:01
Like there are so many aspects to immersive sims and you can accent accentuate some and remove others and some people will say that's still an immersive sim and others will say well that's not it for me. Like I think for Ken Levine it seems as if you know, he came up through looking glass and he seems more willing to kind of compromise or throw aside uh some of that mechanical intricacy and focus more on the narrative intricacy and that sort of disordered story that you put a lot of it together in your head even though there are these, you know, kind of strong beats that come in at the same time for everybody. Yeah.

Samuel
01:14:38
I I think maybe a fork in the road, Jeremy, that follows System Shock is that the whole thing with um System Shock was they wanted to get out of just doing dungeon games basically. And At that point, the setting and the villain become like an enormous part of the experience of those games. And you wonder if maybe that is the part that Ken Levine. gravitates towards. That's the part he's interested in, that wor that world building side of it. Whereas the kind of like mechanical sophistication lives on another track, maybe. Do you think there's anything in that?

Jeremy
01:15:10
Yeah, and I think if I if I'm honest with myself about what got me into Thief Two originally, it was the atmosphere which Which I wouldn't want to call it oppressive, but it's not quite, it's sort of porridgey. Like it's it's just this incredibly thick, intense atmosphere, and the fact that you can pick up all these sort of objects in the world and it feels tactile and and as if you're there in a really sort of deep sense and that's what that's what Levine and Irrational really kind of leaned into. And I think you also get that in arcane games, but they've kind of continued a thread that was thrown away in the late naughties.

Samuel
01:15:50
In terms of how what happened to the immersive sim and how it's influenced modern games Jeremy, how do you measure its influence on modern games? I feel like you see it everywhere, but in more diluted forms. And there's some compromise there that's maybe a little sad, but also still speaks to how pervasive this genre has been

Jeremy
01:16:07
Yeah, it's it is everywhere. I mean the lead designer of uh Fallout 3 and 4, Emile Pugliarulo, is um He was at Looking Glass and he designed one of Thief Two's best level, the rooftop one, uh Life of the Party, I think it's called. Which is quite influential and dishonored, I think. But yeah, he went off to make Fallout 3 and his single biggest influence on that game was Deus Ex. And just just accounting for Fallout 3, that's an enormous influence on the entire industry. But I I I remember having a moment when Assassin's Creed was big in its kind of earlier um iteration of more kind of stealth focus. and it having this kind of you know, uh sandbox approach to tackling areas and um could stealth areas and you could fight your way through them and just so much stuff that had come from Immersive Sims and was then the the most mainstream, most popular series you could get. Um it w there was a really weird point where it felt like there were no immersive sims and yet they like a lot of the lessons were just kind of had seeped into everything else by designers who seemed to to admire them. At the same time, if you loved Immersive Sims and you play those games, you would get jarring moments where you'd reach a kind of edge of synchronization in a map in Assassin's Creed and you're like, oh I'm gonna go around the back of this fort and it says nope and you think oh well there's something that's been missed there a lesson that hasn't been carried forward. But yeah, I I do think, you know, Last of Us Part Two and all sorts of incredibly mainstream games have picked up stuff from immersive sense.

Samuel
01:17:54
Yeah, for sure. Why do you think the genre itself has kind of like been uh either neglected or not picked up on Is it just a commercial thing?

Jeremy
01:18:02
I think it's a commercial thing and because they are built around optional content fundamentally. Sorry for using the word content. I know there are some peers who will flinch uh as I say that but there's um it just gets naturally harder the more expensive triple A games get. suddenly building an extra room is a d really big deal and involves many people instead of one. on the lunch break essentially, like and so it becomes much more cost effective to make a game where everyone's gonna see all the good bits. Whereas immersive Sims are fundamentally about giving you moments that not every one has had. Like there's a there's a moment in Deus Ex where a character who's very significant to you is about to be captured or killed and they tell you to run, they tell you to go. And when I first played that as a teenager I took that at face value and I s and I ran and I thought, oh God, that was that was awful and it felt like a really sort of, you know, emotional kinda kind of authored moment and I later saw the body of that character and I and I felt the guilt for it. And only talking to other people did I find out that you kind can stay and have an enormous firefight and essentially a whole other level there that you're not told about like you just have you just kind of it's left to you to try I think stuff like that is um it's gotta be a hard sell. A lot of big studios to say, let's design an entire firefight through a hotel that we will then not tell the player about.

Samuel
01:19:37
Yeah, I think um one thing that emerges from reading your all history of Deus Ex that you published last year in Rock Paper Shotgun. I'll again um link that in the notes is is that this was created in a very specific kind of weird bubble where they were relatively untouched because, you know, uh John Romero and his studio were the kind of like sort of bizarre party attention grabbing studio. and Warren Spector and his sort of like team of um looking glass people and you know a bunch of new people they had come in well can I let Left to be wildly experimental. So it's a it's a really weird game, Deus X, like an everything game. Uh do you think that's like um that's part of why we don't see it as well is because Deus Ex just came to life under very specific circumstances.

Jeremy
01:20:22
Yeah. And I also think that you could set up those same circumstances. ten times and probably nine times out of those ten it would turn out like an absolute pile of dog shit. There's just the the development of that game was was insane. The As they kind of like uncovered in the oral history, Borin Spectre had two separate competing design teams and never really resolved that tension just kind of let it play out and I imagine there are many other games that have been developed in a similarly messy way that are just no fun to play because they don't have a distinct voice what ended up happening in Deus Ex is it has this incredible variety to it that even most immersive sims don't have where not only do you have incredible choice within a level about how you approach it, but the levels themselves are very different from each other. And you have incredible big city hubs like Hong Kong, which is one that you know the modern day sex developers, you can feel them still kind of working to match that now. But you also have this kind of you know like a hotel firefight or whatever or some which could also be a kind of intense stealth sequence and one level I totally forgot about until I was replaying it for the oral history is a kind of prototypical gone home where there's no combat. Harvey Smith, who's the creative director at Arcane, he he was kind of led led this level. And it's a you follow a sort of resistance leader around the home of her dead mother who was a an Illuminati leader. I just kind of hear her sort of like wistful reminiscences about their life, like it's a level about trauma of losing a parent, essentially. That's just that's just insane to me that this game has all of these different voices and constantly surprises you and yet you know, all these people or at least enough of them came from the same or similar backgrounds, baked in the same way of thinking as Warren Spector. that it all comes together.

Samuel
01:22:29
Yeah, for sure. So I definitely wanted to touch upon the different key strands of um the immersive simp before we wrap up. So Deus Ex though we discussed a bit, Jeremy. I I was curious because I know you've been playing Invisible War a bit recently, and I've actually been playing Deus Ex properly for the first time recently. And it's quite interesting to reverse engineer how How it changed over the years and how how it did get sandered down, the sort of weirdness of it and the vastness of it. Uh how do you what do you make of the way Deus X? kind of like um changed after that first game.

Jeremy
01:23:00
It's funny Matthew L you talked about sort of PC snobbiness and I think generally speaking Dumbing down for consoles was was kind of a myth. Datasex unfortunately was really I mean like generally speaking I think that that case was kind of over stated that you know PC games oh sorry console games were were dumbed down for an audience at the time. But Deus Ex Invisible War was one where Making it for Xbox as well as PC was a real sort of fundamentally painful decision for that team and that game. They ended up before the end of finishing it, slicing up all the levels to fit them into memory on Xbox and because of that it never quite feels fully like a a place. It's it's kind of upsetting because it it came at exactly the right time, like Knights of the Old Republican. come out, you know, what were the big games on Xbox the Time? Nights of the Old Republic and Halo. And Deus Ex Invisible War kind of sits in the middle of those. Like it it should have been perfect. But Rue struggled with that. In fact, that was probably the first attempt at a real simplification of immersive sim design and how they were presented, but unlike Bioshock, it it didn't work, it didn't succeed And I think that was a kind of real although I love a l a lot about that game, it feels very similar to me to play to the original Deus Ex in many respects, but it kind of put a full stop on what was the leading light of the genre at the time and I think you know that the genre kind of took a while to recover as a result of that.

Matthew
01:24:33
Yeah it's in it's interesting because Like some of the complaints people have about that game in terms of some of the simplify simplification it it had, I think now you might call like design elegance. Kind of like simplifying like some of the particular like resource management, like ammo and uh like I think they combine certain bits of equipment and stuff. And actually that was something I got from What little I've played of Death Loop is I was kind of impressed actually how little you're sort of dealing with like inventory wise. Like there's like three ammo types for the three gun classes, loads of variety within those gun classes, but quite kind of simplified. like a a kind of all in one hacking device that that does that can achieve an awful lot, you know, by itself and Uh you know, that's that's a good trend, I think. You know, that's that's like an edge I I'm happy to see sort of sanded off immersive sims. And it's just funny to see people react so negatively to that process in invisible world.

Jeremy
01:25:33
Yeah, definitely. I it was ahead of its time in in some respects and replaying it I you know, it has the same um game director as Dishonored too, Harvey Smith, and I can see stuff in Invisible War now that is is in Dishonored and is totally uncon controversial. But at the time, like you say, there was the the universal ammo system was a big controversy for you know PC players who are maybe a bit too stubborn at the time. But what that does is it groups all the kinds of ammo together Which means you run out of ammo more often, which means you're forced to make interesting choices and tackle things in ways you may maybe wouldn't have more often. Like that to me feels like a fantastic design decision, but at the time everyone practically universally thought it was terrible. Mm-hmm.

Samuel
01:26:25
Yeah. I think it's interesting as well, uh, Jeremy, because that stuff gets conflated with the Downgrade and scale as like examples of how they've con compromised it for console players. So when you make a good decision in the midst of something like that, all people are focused on is the fact that you know the levels feel tiny uh compared to the scale of the original game. And it's it's tough, you know, that's just how how reactions to these games work from from these types of player bases. Yeah. Okay, that's great. I mean Deus Ex as well. Like, um do you think that the IDOS Montreal games managed to get a bit closer to what the original games were going for? Um what were your thoughts on those ones?

Jeremy
01:26:59
Yeah, in many respects. I I think they made some sensible choices about sort of narrowing the themes of them. Like the original Deus Ex on Invisible Water. I just like the ramblings of several political theorists all forced into one game, which is kind of incredible to play. It's like a it's like a fun version of Twitter. But it's um I can see why they didn't quite go but you know, they sort of focused in on transhumanism rather than in Deus Ex you can just meet a guy in a bar and he just gives you a radical interpretation of the Declaration of Independence and why it's socialist theory or whatever. And you're like, Well that's this is a lot. This is great, but it's a lot. So yeah, I understand why they didn't go for that for a big triple A game in the you know, decades on. But I think it really nails that sense of surprise really. I think that's the fundamental thing. Like it can feel a little sort of highfalutin and a bit in the weeds to the way that immersive Sims are talked about. But fundamentally what it does is create moments of surprise for you because things interacted either in a way you didn't expect or you tried it and you didn't expect. And that's what they managed to carry across, and it was kind of amazing and unexpected to see that. happen in triple A at that time.

Samuel
01:28:29
Yeah. It's just where it's just a bummer they didn't get to uh finish that story. I think they still feel compromised in certain ways too, like the um again the the scale of the first ASX, those levels are just The Normous and so it's such a hard thing to follow up on because obviously they're all made with like the same sort of tile sets. There's not a huge amount of variety to the what they look like and making a modern level just feels much um is obviously a much bigger task. So yeah, but they get close enough I think that um the spirits are taken.

Matthew
01:28:56
Yeah. Uh I think I think uh the the second new one, whatever that was called. Is that Mankind Divided, yeah. You know, I think like pr Prague in that is still one of my favorite locations in the whole genre in terms of just the the fantasy of like going into houses and shops and seeing them look and be like houses and shops I think it really really delivers on that.

Samuel
01:29:20
Great Pony district as well, that uh that version of Prague. Great Pony district. Um okay, yeah, great stuff then. So Jeremy Moving on to Thief a little bit, this is a series I don't know as much about. I kind of like always see it as the more, I guess, um, stealthy part of the immersive sim spectrum. And I know that it's kind of like um horror tinged as well, but as someone who's uh experienced with this series, what's the significance of Thief as a series in the um the history of gaming?

Jeremy
01:29:47
I guess it's it's super significant for at a time when the stealth genre was only really happening. It also happened around the same time with Metal Gear Solid and uh Tenshu as well, but I wasn't you know, as a PC gamer I was totally unaware of those developments at the time. I only saw Thief and that was the th first game I'd seen which made you vulnerable. You felt really vulnerable unless you had the upper hand on your enemy in terms of, you know, you you could see them but they couldn't see you. So you were either a predator or you were prey depending on whatever state the AI was in. And that's something that we take for granted now. That's really sort of a uh fundamental building block of a lot of action and stealth games, but that wasn't really done at the time. I I don't know if I'd recommend it as a starting point for people getting into Immersive Sims because It has that narrow focus of you are a thief, you're not a fighter, you have a sword, you're not particularly good at using it. And so you don't have the same kind of freedom of approach as you do in a Deus Ex, which I think was the right decision for that game But you can't, there's probably not a very satisfying uh straight-ahead action experience to be had in a thief game. That would feel like just playing it wrong, I think. But just a an astonishing level of atmosphere as well. The sound design was almost kind of a a deafening you know, cave noise, right? When you're in a a cave for whatever reason. Yeah. And you can sort of you would You would s maybe say it's silent, but at the same time there's a deafening roar coming from somewhere beneath. That's what thief games sound like and the moment you kind of stick yeah earphones in to play one of those games, you're just completely engrossed in that deafening silence. And within that they have the really fantastic system for surfaces, which I think is something that hasn't really been carried forward. enough. Although weirdly in Bioshock Infinite, Burial at Sea Part Two, they did it. They had they had surfaces of glass and stuff that made different levels of noise. And you've got to be really aware in Thief about where you're walking and what that's gonna sound like to the enemies around you, which was not a thing in games before that point.

Matthew
01:32:10
I I always remember struggling with the concept or the silliness of is it moss or grass arrows?

Jeremy
01:32:17
Yes, moss, yeah.

Matthew
01:32:18
Uh the idea of like an arrow that is somehow full of moss and like putting all this moss down, surely someone would notice if that their regular patrol route suddenly has this a shitload of moss, they'd be like, well that's not right. Uh I would I would think that. Uh I always thought that was silly Uh not that that I'm not gonna say it wasn't like a deal breaker or anything. I I loved Thief too.

Jeremy
01:32:42
Yeah, if you've been a producer on Thieves you just killed the immerses in dead right there because the moss was too silly.

Matthew
01:32:48
It's just it's just a shame, you know, this this this is an example of one which does focus in on like, you know, one strand which is sort of stealth and but does it so fully and you can sort of express yourself within it. Like there's the tools are, you know, really kind of flexible. Um it's it's a shame that that's people haven't kind of applied this thinking to like other genres. Uh uh you know, uh I I I it's very hard to think of an of a of anything kind of like this in like the action space which has that same kind of sort of flexible approach but yeah it was thrilling. Fifth two is really good. I haven't played it since I played it originally, so no idea if it holds up.

Jeremy
01:33:31
I mean it does hold up but I think you know like the kind of discussion we just just had, you're sort of putting it into historical context. say this was really exciting then. It still is exciting to play. It's still deeply at atmospheric, but it's not you know it's not novel in the same way. A lot of what it does you can see in um In Dishonored. I'd still recommend people play it. The world building is incredible. I think that's another reason why games journalists love a Mercy Sim Samuel is that they're really writers' games even though there's not a lot of dialogue in them compared to uh you know many games but there's so much written and then kept behind the scenes and you can feel that a world has been fleshed out but hasn't been just given to you in a codex or exposition and that is just the most alluring thing for a certain kind of person. AKA games journalist.

Samuel
01:34:30
By people with exquisite taste as well. Yeah, that's that's like a big part of it. Just a complete side note by the way. The um the D D game you mentioned earlier that Warren Spectre had, like didn't that last for years and years as well? Isn't it like uh it wasn't like an epic that spanned like decades? I think it I remember reading that in Jason Schreier's book, is that right?

Jeremy
01:34:47
Yeah, he for many years like they yeah, I got some email answers back from Warren about this and he was talking about how his kind of gang of of friends kind of grew up from from little sort of urchins in this port town and eventually became sort of local legends and uh he told me that ever since he's just been trying to get back to the feeling of that D D game and to give that people to others. That's just been kind of been the defining trait of his career and and what he's passed on to countless other designers who've then spread out through the industry.

Matthew
01:35:20
It's mad that the only interaction I've had with this legendary figure, uh I was forced to talk to him about Epic Mickey.

Jeremy
01:35:28
That's a that's a claim Classic uh Nintendo Mag experience, isn't it? To have a legend in front of you and to go. So uh this this uh clas This thing I'd probably rather not talk to you about.

Matthew
01:35:40
He was really trying to sell it as having the qualities of those his earlier games though. He really believes that Epic Mickey is is the kind of child gateway drug to Death Sex.

Jeremy
01:35:51
Yeah. I think he intends to do that with everything he does, but it hasn't it hasn't quite happened since then for him.

Samuel
01:35:58
No. It's actually like a real bummer to hear about how hardy found it to get games made and to get like financial backing. You're like it that makes the industry look pretty terrible. And uh yeah, yeah. It's uh definitely worth reading that um that

Matthew
01:36:16
I mean he did literally manage to to get Disney to trade a real human for a cartoon rabbit.

Samuel
01:36:23
So that's pretty impressive.

Jeremy
01:36:24
What so that was an actor, right? What was the what's the deal?

Matthew
01:36:28
Uh I think it was a s it was a spn guy. It was a s yeah, it was an ESPN thing. Yeah. They swapped him for the the rights to Oswald the lucky rabbit. Wow, top rights. I if I was that dude I'd be like, oh come on Like that thing doesn't even exist. Just draw another rabbit.

Samuel
01:36:46
I suppose then Jeremy following on from Thief, Dishonored then, like um what are the kind of parts of Thief that pass down to Dishonored and what and what does it represent as a kind of like modern version of the immersive sim?

Jeremy
01:36:57
Immediately think of that rooftop thing, the the life of the party level from Thief Two. I remember starting to play Dishonored and walking across the tiles of some Victorian hovel. And just hearing the clink of them and think, oh my god, it's back. FIFA's back. And that sort of gentle but inexorable push towards stealth, right? The you play dishonored and nobody really tells you to sneak. explicitly at any point and yet it's just made overwhelmingly obvious to you that that's maybe what you should be doing. I think that's what most dishonored players end up doing. And You know, if you do stealth and dishonor, then it that's that's Thief, you know how Thief plays. It's it's slightly less about uh light and shadow, the kind of a more modern emphasis on line of sight And and I think if you're higher up in the world then you're less seen than if you're on the ground, which I think is true to life as well.

Matthew
01:37:56
But um yeah, all that sort of Is this from your w have you got uh ample experience of sneaking around rooftops then.

Jeremy
01:38:04
I do remember having played Dishonored, like Blink just changing the way I saw the world and just walking around outside my house and and just like mentally tracking where I would blink to on these rooftops just completely ruined my brain in a fantastic way. Pavement's not good enough for you anymore. But yeah, that that's sort of like Thief is baked in To dishonored in the way Stealth feels and the density of the the atmosphere of those games. And even some of the kind of factions in the way into play. You've got in Thief you have the hammerites who are sort of order and uh and literal hammering. They're into industry and stuff and then the Uh pagans I think they're called or paganites. It might be a knight on the end of the who um who sort of represent, you know chaos and artistic freedom and in the Sono games you have a very similar dynamic uh sort of fight between the the church in that game who are all about, you know, sort of work for idle hands, you know, to keep you from kind of losing your way. And then you have the witches and the outsider who are this sort of incredible force. I love that Delilah, the villain of Dishonored too, is a fantastic painter. It's like art and chaos are totally intertwined and you get to sort of from the sidelines which is another very thief like thing to be at the sidelines, not a hero. Not even necessarily an antihero, but just sort of observing and eventually being forced to get involved. And in Dishonored you the same way you see these kind of forces going at each other And eventually you maybe get a chance to kind of influence which ones come out on top to a degree. Yeah, that feels very thief-like to me.

Samuel
01:39:49
I think what's really interesting to read about with um Arcane is that they are almost like a kind of mirror. Of what happens to the Austin development group that came out of Ironstorm. There's a great documentary about this on the NoClip channel that Danny O'Dwyer runs. Really, really good documentary about their origins as a studio. And they kind of like had a sort of a similar track of we want to make these cool types of games. Um Raf uh Colantonio is really like super confident guy. They make it happen. And they get acquired by by Bethesda. Like, um, do you think they just have more fortune or do you think they're in the right place at the right time to to make the kind of stuff that they made?

Jeremy
01:40:30
I th I think they both sort of looked out with an initial well it wasn't initial for Arcane at all, they existed for a long time prior to Dishonored, but they they could have this benefactor who could kind of see what others couldn't and you know Initially it was for Ian Storm Austin it was John Romero and his yellow Humvee. And you know, for him to recognise what Warren Spectre could do at that time and just kinda give him carte blanche, she deserves enormous credit for that. And Bethesda, I think Yeah, so just backing Arcane the way they have, even when the results commercially haven't always been there, they just they just know what they have. They they know that Arcane do something that nobody else can do. And you know, they seem to have that conviction that it's gonna bear fruit and people on a wider scale will see what's special about them.

Matthew
01:41:17
The thing with the arcane is if If they ever do break through, I think they've got a bit of a timeless catalogue. Like I think you're you know, Dishonored the Dishonored and Prey are gr great and will always be great and are quite you know, are still modern feeling enough. that you know you can go back to them. I think if you discover Arcane at any point, you know, you're in for a good time and may you know I'm not gonna say that's why they keep betting on them, but But you know, you feel you can definitely see the path where someone maybe tries Death Leap 'cause it looks a bit more punchy and actiony than than their other stuff and then, you know, especially with Game Pass I guess go back and play all these these older things.

Jeremy
01:41:57
Yeah, it's a great fit for that. And um I really admire the way that Arcane and Bethesda have responded to the fact that Ye Dishonored too and the one following it, Death of the Outsider didn't sell as well. You know, Dishonored Dishonored sold pretty well, I believe. And since then they haven't quite managed to, you know, capitalize on that or or really break through in the way that say Bioshock did. But rather than get safer the response has been to kind of just experiment even more wildly. I'm going, okay, so we're gonna do an FPS then, I suppose, because that's potentially more mainstream. But the FPS they've come up with is Death Loop. which you know I can only think in in the FPS genre only maybe Hunt Showdown and Doom Eternal are as strange and out there in the mainstream as Death Leap is. And again the the vampire game they're making I have no idea what that is. It kind of looks from the initial trailer reminiscent of Fortnite in art style and also you know Left for Dead and sort of all the sort of co-op uh offshoots from that in the way it plays, and yet you sort of know that it's not that there's gonna be they've already said there's arcane baked into this. I suppose the genius of what they've done. I think Dinger, the director of Death Leaper said this, that he considers immersy Sims not to be so much a genre as a set of principles. So they've gone, okay, we can apply this. to something that may have more obvious mainstream appeal, but we can bring all of our ideals and quirks to bear on this and kind of sneak them into the mainstream hopefully.

Samuel
01:43:44
So I suppose then um Jeremy just to kind of like wrap up discussing these pillars, the um system shock bioshock arguably uh uh twenty seventeen Prey, sort of like branch of the Immersive Sim. We talked a bit about how um uh setting and villain are sort of like key in these strands of the um of the immersive sim. But I I wondered if you had any further thoughts on on what I suppose like system shock and bioshock combined represented within the um the course of the genre.

Jeremy
01:44:12
They I guess they are they're sort of dungeons by stealth, aren't they, that side of things. They um they they are what lead back to Ultima Underworld, I think. and Arts Vitalis, which was Arcane's verse game and intended to be a sequel to Underworld, in that rather than these discrete levels that Dishonored and Death Loot does so well, you have I think I mean I think there were there are well there are loading screens and stuff in Bioshock and System Shock but it's you have this sense in your head of a complete space that you can go back and forth between areas of and it's incredibly dense and you can bring aspects of it from one part to another and and kind of you know, see what you can make happen. I think there's maybe not a sort of I mean we'll see if there's a follow-up to Prey. There certainly isn't hasn't been immediately because that's the team that's working on uh Redfall the vampire game. But I don't know, I don't know if there is a sort of contemporary analogue to that side of the genre.

Samuel
01:45:16
Matthew, as uh from your experiences, how do you kind of like categorize um a Bioshock in its ilk versus um the likes of uh dishonored or thief.

Matthew
01:45:25
Yeah, I mean uh for me I I never thought Bioshock had the the same kind of um mechanical sophistication. You know, that you could Yeah, you know, it's expressive to to to a degree with like the different powers and stuff, but it it you know, it felt like I didn't feel like there were a l I found a lot of like alternate solutions, say, you know, I didn't feel like I particularly made my own way in that world and that wasn't a problem. Like I don't think I even thought of it as part of that. You know, I I wouldn't have f put it even put it in the genre when I played it. I mean you know, knowing more about the team now than I probably did then and you know you can sort of see the kind of connective tissue a bit bit more easily. I must admit I don't have any like experience with system shock. It's a big old sort of blind swat. It's uh a game I feel I've absorbed through Osmosis f just from reading like PC Gamer, which I imagine it like a lot of people have. Like with immersive service in general. Like when you read the sales figures of these games, you're like, oh wow, in my head this was just as big as anything. But a lot of them are like total disasters.

Samuel
01:46:33
Yeah. Basically like none of them are I mean Deus Ex was successful, but none of them are like by today's standards.

Matthew
01:46:45
Yeah, and uh you know uh they just s sold the hell out of the idea. I mean uh you know as I was saying earlier, I think You know, Ken Ken Levine's more of a narrative showman. I think it's quite telling that he set out to be a screenwriter and to get into films. uh you know, and sort of fell into games and has sort of straddled the line between development and games and film since then. Didn't wasn't he meant to be writing the Yeah, I don't know. Total recall or something like that. Ken Levine was writing Logan's Run. Logan's Run, that's it. had seemingly jumped shit to go into films, sort of showed where his heart was and, you know, he had a better kind of image of sort of selling that. And I'm maybe I'm maybe I'm I'm doing him a disservice with that and you know, like I say, I have I haven't heard him talk about those older games and his role in them but um yeah the kind of narrative sense and I must admit like for me personally I definitely connect more with this with these games and this genre on the like the narrative sophistication of them and the atmosphere and the setting. Like weirdly the The kind of experimental like play systems and the flexibility of mechanics, while I admire them, don't speak to me as a player. Like I'm not a very uh innovative player of immers immersive sims. Like I feel bad watching like what some people can do in Dishonored and it makes me feel very plodding. Like I I don't know if if just playing other games or just this is how my mind mind is wired but you know I am quite an efficient person when I play games you know I I I'm I'm not trying to express myself in a in a in a crazy way you know and so I I I'm constantly aware I'm only connecting with these on like quite a surface level. Uh I think I'm connecting them with with them more than most because you look at their sales figure and you're like, well they clearly speak to me in a way they don't speak to the you know, the average person on the street. Um but I also appreciate there's like there's stuff in here that I think only five percent that that I think there's a lot of stuff in these games that only like five percent of people or whatever are really kind of connecting with. Yeah. Which has kind of always been a weird tension in the thing for me. And and th they sense it themselves, like when they talk about the disappointment of you know people not engaging with like the action systems in Dishonored or you know there was a big focus when we were doing previews for Dishonored too and we did a cover feature on OXM. There was quite a lot in that about you know, how they want to push people or like, you know, tempt people or how to make people play with their more aggressive violence skills. And I've always that tension's just always been sort of super apparent to me that I'm just Like I literally couldn't tell you what some of the aggressive powers are in Dishonored, because I never even looked at the the unlock nodes for them. Like I just they're just not interesting to me.

Jeremy
01:49:42
Yeah, something Warren Spector said in this um feature I've been working on was that MS systems are work. They're fun work, but there's there's still work and they put a hell of a lot on you as a player mm to get to get the most out of them to experiment is to kinda like really push yourself out of, you know, sort of personal playstyles that you might have solidified for, you know, decades. That's pretty tough to do. For me it took playing um Arcane's Dark Messiah, which is a really weird sort of uh somewhere between an RPG and and Half-Life 2 is made in the source engine and that's a sort of really weird action first game it's got a kick mechanic which they brought back for Deathloot which was nice to see and there's stealth isn't particularly viable in that one and you've got to just sort of like push enemies into spikes off cliffs, sort of like have all these sort of crashing interactions in the environment and uh And also it comes at it from a sort of like the opposite of making you feel guilty for for uh doing bad things. You have a a demon living in your head I think he's sort of encouraging you to go off on one. And it took replay that for me to kind of get me in the right mindset to play stuff like Dishonored in an action way. Mm-hmm. And it's it's it's insane how different they feel as a result um to come out from that mindset. But it still feels like work. It still feels like, you know, in my current dishonored playthrough, I did uh Lady Ball's Mansion, which is maybe the most famous level. It's natural to do that in a completely stealthy way because you have a disguise.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:51:25
Mm-hmm.

Jeremy
01:51:26
And I ended up killing Lady Boyle stealthily when she nicked off to the bathroom or something. and it was only after I'd finished the level and was halfway through some hub conversation afterwards that I thought, No, I've worked out how I want to do this and then went back and reloaded a save and there's a storage cupboard in Lady Boyle's mansion. for whale oil which is highly volatile and I waited until she was passing that door in her kind of cycle around the party uh throws time, jumps into the body of a rat to get into the storage room without opening the door, fired at one of the whal oil containers Time still stopped so it didn't explode at that point and was able to get out again and be kind of away from the scene before that exploded through the door, killing Lady Boyle. And like I I'm s I'm so proud of that. But it was so kind of out there to think of that I didn't even think of it while I was in the level. So you can hardly blame people for not, you know, being able to get the most out of these systems and the way they interact.

Samuel
01:52:34
That's a really interesting tension at the heart of the genre for sure. Um okay that's uh that seems like a good place to wrap up then Jeremy, unless there's any other games you wanted to name check here while we're discussing immersive six.

Jeremy
01:52:43
I guess we should uh shout out some of the the indie entries which have again have been very welcome recently in such a sort of small genre. Some of the People who've worked on LiveShock games when those studios broke up, it spawned some really interesting games. There's a guy called David Pittman, I believe. He made a game called Eldritch, which was the first immersive sim roguelike, if you want to trace that back, which is really fun. And then also a game called Neon Struct, which isn't very well known. uh which feels a lot like the original Deus Ex. You know, it's not sort of narratively complex but it's it's got that feel to it which is really good. And then there's that game coming out called Gloomwood which is spookily thief like to look at. It's funny, it's it's almost an approach to nostalgia that I theoretically wouldn't like 'cause it's it's kind of nostalgia to a fault of really sort of mimicking very specific things from games in the 90s. Whereas generally I think you know a lot of the sort of quality of life and simplification that we talked about has been good over time. But those indies are really sort of tapping into um Tapping into some very specific things that have sort of been sounded away over the years. Yeah, there's another one called Call Decay, which I recommend any Deus Ex fans should watch the trailer for that because it it very deliberately taps into the intro for Deus Ex where the uh the villains sort of discuss their uh the plan in a very conspiratorial tone and in the Call Decay trailer it includes the line finalized within the week, which is totally bland, but is also in Deus X, so as soon as I heard that, a stupid part of my brain was just completely won over by this game

Samuel
01:54:30
Yeah. Um yeah, minor key games, the David Pittman's um outfit. Definitely worth uh spotlighting there, like you say. I think the Slayer Shock as well was a Another one of his that was like a quite rough around the edges, but um I think interesting as kind of mix of like Buffy basically and immersive Sims. I did play a bunch of that So yeah, great stuff. Um yeah, thank you so much for joining us, Jeremy. Is there anything else you wanted to add before we um before we wrap up here?

Jeremy
01:54:54
No, it's great. I guess I would just say to So people that like Matthew says you know in reality a an awful lot of people didn't play these older games when they happened at the time and I guess I would encourage people not to be too intimidated by that. You're not alone and Like Deathloop is a fantastic jumping in point for these kind of games. It's friendly, it's uncompromised. And if you like it, there is a whole trove of this stuff to go back to.

Samuel
01:55:23
Yeah. I would say that playing the original Deus Ex is still it's still legitimately amazing because you know the breadth of choices you make and the way the game reflects those. Modern games don't do that. They just don't. So yeah, it's um you It's amazing to come back from a mission and have UNACCO guards just commenting on very specific things you did. They're like, Oh a shame you couldn't get involved in the gunfight. A bunch of my friends died. And you're like, holy fuck, I didn't even realise that was a choice I was making by ignoring that. And yeah, I um and still very playable, I think. And um yeah, just uh doubt just make sure you install a mod that makes the brightness um correct on your screen and yeah, you'll have a good time. But um yeah otherwise um Jeremy where can people catch you on social media?

Jeremy
01:56:03
So I'm on Twitter as at Jeremy underscore peel. Yeah, that's uh that's Best and probably only place to go for me.

Samuel
01:56:11
Uh and people people can find your work on different outlets, right?

Jeremy
01:56:14
Yeah, generally I remember at some point to post it on Twitter. So um hopefully you'll uh you'll see stuff. come up there and uh yeah it's been uh it's been lovely to to be on here even though I forgot to make the JC Denton JC's kit kitchen pun that I was intending to make at some point during this podcast.

Samuel
01:56:35
I guess you just never had the window, did you?

Matthew
01:56:38
This amazing gag in your pocket. But I love that you shared it with us.

Samuel
01:56:42
Yeah, I love the you sort of reversed out of the joke instead of making the joke. That's very much uh um in the spirit of the podcast. But no, it's uh honestly Jeremy, it's been great to have your insight and there's a you know, the stuff we discussed there could have been like five different episodes and maybe there will be one day. So um yeah, we'll uh definitely have you on again if you fancy it. But um thank you very much. Um yeah. So I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter. Matthew where can people catch you? Mr. Basil underscore pesto. If you want to follow the podcast, it's Backpage Pod on Twitter. If you'd like to leave us a review on Apple Podcasts, that'd be greatly appreciated. Otherwise we'll be back next week with a new episode. Thank you very much. Bye for now.

Matthew
01:57:51
No, it's saying I've taken to watching YouTube on twice the speed, 'cause you could turn up the playback speed. I'm never watching an hour. But I might watch it on fast forward, but it just means that they took It turns everyone into like a chipmunk 'cause they're going super fast. Such a good idea. I wonder how long It's 'cause they it's all the American essays, they drone on so slowly, they're like and then in dying lie but if you turn them up

Jeremy
01:58:21
They're just like, yeah, and then I ran across the roof, so it was really exciting.

Matthew
01:58:25
Like this is fab.

Jeremy
01:58:26
I wonder who'll be the first craftkeeper to write. Offer an alternate version that's pitched down so that when you do it double speed it's the correct pitch.

Matthew
01:58:36
Oh that'd be amazing.

Jeremy
01:58:37
Maybe it'll be huge. We should do that. We should uh capitalise on this idea first.

Samuel
01:58:43
Yeah, we'll put out the pod at twice the speed, Matthew. And if people want they can listen to it at like half the speed and get the radio version. Um we should uh you should keep this as a kappa to the episode. Little post credits, uh MCU style sting. Uh Matthew's slagging off YouTubers for talking too slowly.

Matthew
01:58:58
Oh ones that do like two and a half hours, you're like, come on. Two and a half hours. Who's got that much time to watch someone drone on about fucking And they give you the whole like behind the scenes of how they thought about

Jeremy
01:59:12
when they were gonna do the video before right at the beginning. Awful
