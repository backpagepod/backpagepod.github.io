Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. How is it going? We're nearing the end of the year, the old tunnel of work before we see the light.
What are you up to these days?
What am I up to? Every day, I live in anticipation of my very elaborate chocolate calendar.
I thought you were going to say game of the year list, like top 10.
No, I mean, there is that, but Catherine got me this Belgian chocolate calendar, which has mannons, which are like my favourite chocolate. They're traditionally coffee buttercream in a kind of white chocolate shell. And so it's an advent calendar, but just with mannons in it, except there's other mannons, which I haven't heard of, like a caramel one.
This morning was a raspberry mannon, which was a bit of a shock at half seven.
Yeah, I mean, every now and then you radiate a tiny bit of Tory energy. And this is one of those times.
No!
I couldn't identify what a mannon is. I don't feel like we had those in Gospors circa 1998.
That's European. Tories would just be like, you know, oh, it's got to have a pork pie in it.
Get your mannons out of this country. The mannons are taking the jobs of regular chocolates.
It would all be British food stuffs. You don't do delicate chocolates here.
No, that's true.
Not since we drove Thorntons out of business.
Oh yeah, Thorntons did go away, didn't it? Do you think there was just, is it like everything else when the middle kind of disappeared? We only ended up with like the lowest grade stuff and you're sort of like ethical chocolate that's about 19 quid a bar.
But you know, it was it's like, OK, sort of like morally, you know what I mean? That's sort of, is that just what's happened to everything? I think it has.
Yeah, Thorntons are wrapped up with that. So, well, I'm sorry that you think I'm...
No, that was a bad faith, a bad faith reading. And I do apologize. It wasn't me trying to stir up shit before the draft begins.
That would be uncalled for. How is your Game of the Year prep going, though, Matthew? Because I know this has ruined at least like one weekend for you now, just trying to play everything.
So what's the latest on that?
Yeah, it's going OK. I've been trying to mop things up. I was going in with quite an aggressive, I'm going to play lots of games, and if they don't kind of grip me in the first hour, then I may return to them, but I won't consider them for this Game of the Year.
And that isn't always fair because some games don't reveal themselves until a bit later, but right now I'm just trying to be as kind of comprehensive as possible, which is daft. I feel like I played so many games this year for so long, and yet actually when I add it all up, the number of bigger things, particularly on the indie side that I've missed, is like absolutely vast. But I'm kind of getting there now.
Basically I've got 15 games I won in my top 10, which is a good place to be in, because it just means it's a case of organising and deciding the five victims from that list.
I think that's a pretty great position to be in. I've still got, I would say like 12 games in contention, but nine I'm super confident in. That's where it's at.
So it's always just so fucking elaborate trying to figure this out. It just ends up taking up a lot of headspace every year, and I don't really learn my lesson. I never really get so well prepped to just have like five short indie games I've played to pad out the list.
It always becomes a thing of like, what I'll do is I'll try and finish all the 20-hour plus games I've got sat in the hopper instead and then failing to do so. So there's a bit of tension of like one game where they'll actually get it finished in time for the end of the year. It's not the game that you're thinking it is, by the way, it's something else.
And I really think that will get into the list if I can just squeeze it in. But I think we have to record this episode next Wednesday. So I think we're going to run out of time, unfortunately.
But it is what it is, Matthew.
We'll make it work.
Yeah, it'll be a good episode no matter what, I'm sure. But this episode then is something I've been excited about for since we came up with it. I think live on the episode that we were recording about two months ago, maybe a month ago, something like that.
It is the sub 80 Metacritic draft, a draft where we can only pick games that have scored under 80 from metacritic.com. Metacritic, of course, is an aggregator of video game reviews, also does movie and TV shows, but let's face it, games are the reason that we find it interesting. It's certainly in our industry more important than it is to, I would say, TV and film.
Ron Tamayo is obviously being the big film one, and I don't really get TV reviews as a star rate related system. That's so arbitrary to me. What have they reviewed?
Is it one episode, the season? It's a mess. It's a mess on there.
It is. Sometimes they do one episode of Loki or something. That's not a review of a TV show, dog.
The difference is something like Vulture, where they do episode by episode star reviews. Those are of a very high quality, generally speaking, and that I can go for. But yeah, I agree.
It's eight reviews have decided that this new season of fucking, I don't know, what's like a lie, is it, tell me lies, lie to me? What's it called? That horny show that's on Disney Plus, like that, and it'll be like 76%.
That means nothing to me, Matthew. So in video games, it's more logical.
I'm so clued in on TV, but I have no idea what you're talking about. The horny show called Tell Me Lies.
Is it called, what's it called? It's got-
Your algorithm is serving you very different things to my algorithm.
No, I heard about it on a podcast, but what is it called? I'll just find the name, Tell Me Lies. Yeah, Tell Me Lies, that's it.
It's on Disney Plus. It's a Hulu show. And I heard about it on a podcast, and it's got the girl in it.
This is a really specific reference, but that Noah Bombach, Ben Stiller film that's on Netflix, which I really liked. Do you know what I mean?
Is that the Mayowitz?
The Mayowitz. Mayowitz stories. That's it.
Yeah. That's a really good film. She's in that film.
And then that was the only thing I've ever heard of this actress from, basically. So she's in this TV show. That's why it came up.
But anyway, what I'm saying is, it just ends up being a bit arbitrary, the way it aggregates. But with video games, obviously, it's much more comprehensive. You know, it becomes a big talking point, the Metacritic score, whenever it drops.
So the idea of only being able to pick games that critics have deemed, you know, not all critics, but certainly, the consensus is deemed to be, you know, not quite in that very upper tier of games, is an interesting premise for a draft, Matthew. So how are you feeling about it?
Yeah, it's been good. I mean, it's been quite rough researching it, which I'm sure we can get into. Deliberately going into that sphere and seeing the kind of games that live there and trying to kind of sift through them.
There's so many games that are dumped 70 and below, which are just, they're like nothing. They're like kind of nothing games. Like there's endless wrestling games, you know?
And like endless annual iterations of wrestling games on multiple platforms for the last 20 years. The number of those I had to sort of sift through was unreal. And Disney tie-ins.
It's just like a, I don't know, it's just like a real, there's a lot of junk down there. And it's just quite funny, like living down there for, you know, a few hours.
It truly does feel like the sort of, like Andy's room in Toy Story, no, Andy's room, Sid's room in Toy Story, where it's like all the fucked up weird toys live in like one place basically. Yeah, it was strange. It was like getting down in the dirt a little bit, you know?
But it's, you begin to, I mean, obviously the way that you look at Metacritic, if you arranged it the same way that I did, it kind of gives you like 20 at a time, and then you go down, you go forward a page, and it will go to the next scores down, and you're going that way. But eventually you begin to sort of zoom out and see all of Metacritic before you as like sedimentary rock. And you can see the individual layers of the kind of games where they live.
And there is a character to it. There is a character of like the 70s, the 60s, the 50s and the 40s.
Yeah.
And that's interesting in and of itself.
It is, but it's rough down there, man.
It's horrible.
You really see some shit. Also, you realize that it's like it's so random. There'll be some things that I think are diabolically shit that are down in like the 50 range next to stuff that I think was, was it quite as bad as people deemed it?
And it's weird to see them side by side as like, well, yeah, these are the same. These are like, you know, they have the same number, therefore they are the same. And it just seems like, because obviously of the way it's aggregated, there's no human intent to it.
But it just means you see, yeah, rancid nonsense next to stuff that's diamonds and they're rough, occasionally, you know what I mean? Yeah, an interesting one anyway. So yes, I echo Matthew's feeling that this was a fucking nightmare to research.
It was quite horrible. There's still one category where I've only got one pick. That's not ideal.
If Matthew takes that one pick, I'm fucked. So that's like attention that's in the air. We'll see.
I've been desperately trying to research more in the background here while we've been recording to have a backup. But alas.
I refuse to monologue then and give you that advantage. One word answers from now on.
I won't tell you which category it is though, will I? So take that, Matthew Castle. I wouldn't want it to be.
Yeah. Well, I will let you speculate on that. But in the meantime, we've got the classic preamble, which we do before every draft, a little bit of waffle around the subject in question.
This is obviously not a format, a console format, so there's not a history to be done here. I can't say I'm particularly interested in the history of Metacritic, but I can say that when it started becoming relevant, when me and Matthew really got into journalism. So definitely been a fixture since then.
So we all know that Metacritic is seen as this significant games industry metric. Matthew, how do you feel about it? My take is, it's not a good thing really, that the industry is so fixated on it and uses it as much as it does.
But without it, you only have something very similar in our data obsessed age. It adds a kind of like almost sports like quality to the way people talk about games reviews. And so that is kind of interesting.
But yeah, I've got no real problem with it as a thing, but the way it's used, maybe a few, you know?
I do get it. You know, particularly the obsession with gamers, because the idea of like games having a magic number is like a weird bit of gamification in itself. And I get why Metacritic would really speak to the gamer mentality.
I would definitely take it over the statistic, which seems to be sort of asserting Metacritic a little bit, or certainly appearing a lot more in headlines now, which is like the concurrent gamers on Steam. Which is like pure death, pure death. And like genuinely fuck anyone who writes those stories.
Like you're making the internet a worse place. So that, that, that sucks. So I take it over that.
Hard to remove our job from it all, really. Here's a weird thing which you contribute to. You know, I use it as a punter, certainly.
Like I like the simple idea of go to this place. There will be lots of reviews of these games, and it's probably the easiest place to find all those reviews grouped together. What with the internet becoming like SEO hellhole, anything which can sort of like speed my use of the internet up is welcome.
So, you know, as a punter, fine. As an actual like reviewer, it's kind of worn off on me. I think originally I had a more invested relationship in it.
I was kind of intrigued, not by my influence on it, but the fact that I was part of this ecosystem, seeing where my score sat along other people's scores, always interested me, seeing how they butchered my beautiful reviews and pulled out the worst fucking quotes. That's part of it as well. So often I'll go on to, even just doing this, I found some games which I reviewed and I clicked on them and sort of scrolled down to see, oh, what did I say about this?
And invariably, it would be a quote saying like, this has good graphics. And it's like, did I really write that? It's like you found the one bit of the review where I was at my most conservative in my phrasing and now you're using this to represent me.
While everyone else gets a juicy paragraph, they've really boiled down some like excellent edge reviews I've done to just absolute horseshit on Metacritic. I don't know whose job it is to actually take the quote, but that sucks. Yeah, sorry, I've gone all around the houses there.
No, that's fine. That's what the preamble is for, Matthew. It's a collection of thoughts that form section one of the podcast.
It is a collection of thoughts. I guess my main thought is there was once upon a time I was a lot more excited about it from a professional point of view because I felt like I was contributing to something which was focusing the internet on my words. As a print journalist, it felt like a good opportunity to get an opinion or a review out in front of a bigger audience was Metacritic.
No one read Metacritic and then went and bought a copy of NGamer, but I liked to be part of the conversation that way.
Yeah, it is interesting because I think that is what I would argue is one of the good things about it. It does give everyone equal weighting even if you are running quite a small site. You know, like not a hobbyist site as such, but something that is borderline a full-time job.
You have a shot of getting on Metacritic if they satisfy whatever criteria they have, which doesn't seem to necessarily be tied to audience sites. There are some quite small sites that are on there and indeed non-English speaking sites as well. And I quite like the idea that it gives weight to people who take game reviewing seriously, do it frequently enough to actually be worth featuring on there.
And yeah, they're right there next to IGN and GameSpot or whatever. I actually do quite like that about it. And being it from print media, yes, you do feel like you're shouting into the void a little bit sometimes.
So I don't know if I ever really thought about it that much personally though, when I was a journalist. I don't think I ever really thought. Yeah, because it's interesting because now being a PR, I'm very conscious of the idea that a score can pull a review.
It can pull the Metacritic average by the way, up or down. But when I was a journalist, I don't think I ever thought about it. I just thought, well, I just had no distractions.
I was just like, well, all the matters to me is the PC Gamer scoring criteria or the whatever ImagineMag I was working on.
Yeah, I'd agree with that. I don't want to feel like I've misrepresented myself saying I was writing or adapting what I was saying to try and fit Metacritic. Not at all.
I enjoyed seeing my words and score eventually end up on Metacritic in terms of actually thinking about it and factoring it into my process. Not at all. And, you know, there have been moments where, particularly when it came out over the years, that certain things were tied to Metacritic scores, bonuses or whatever, there would be a little wave of op-eds you'd get, saying, oh, games critics should actually take care, or they should be aware that what they're saying is actually having an impact.
Rather than it being a story about it's bullshit, the publisher pins a bonus on X score, it became about, oh, really, this is on the journalists, not to fuck the developers over. I never really had any truck with that. I always thought that was an incredibly dumb opinion when it surfaced every few months.
But I feel like we're way beyond that now. Metacritic, and maybe even the concept of reviews, just feel a little bit too old fashioned for anyone to really think about.
It's one of a myriad of factors that go into how a game is sold now. A review definitely has a huge impact, like how the reviews land for a game, creating word of mouth, that kind of thing. Still massively significant, but I agree.
It's a bit more of a quaint, early 2010s kind of conversation. Now I think Metacritic is just like the wind or the grass, it's just there, you don't really think about it. You know what I mean?
No one ever talks about it in the same way.
It's a generational thing. I currently do not listen to any, I don't watch any streams, I don't listen to any quote unquote influences. They do not shape my buying decisions, where reviews do.
You know, I am interested to see what my peers say. People have brought things to my attention through positive reviews in the past, but that's because I'm old as shit, you know, comparatively to most gamers. Yeah, so that's really where the reviews fit in.
Maybe they have a knock-on effect with those younger forms of information, I guess, where if you suddenly see a game getting like 90 or Metacritic and big buzz, and you weren't aware of it, you know, a streamer might then play it, for example, and it will have the knock-on effect that way. But generally, you know, it feels like a bit old-manish, and I'm okay with that. That's fine.
I actually keep thinking about, ever since Jay did that episode about the backlogs, and that stupid statistic about how few modern games anyone actually plays, it hasn't given me, like, an existential crisis as such. I do constantly think I am very much in the space which is competing for, like, the 2% of people that give a fuck about modern games.
Right.
And, like, reviews is a small part of that, and then print reviews, an even smaller part of that. Have I spent my whole career chasing, like, 0.01% of gamers?
No, it just changed around you. Like, the number of people playing changed around you. The audience changed around you.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, to reassure you. You know, like...
I haven't done anything wrong.
It's kids playing fucking Fortnite or Genshin Impact on phones or whatever it might be or whatever that last one was that seemed like it was about a dystopia and then people said it was actually quite dystopian itself, which really made me laugh as of course it was. It's a gacha RPG. I mean, what do you expect?
But anyway, yes. There's... Yeah, I sort of like...
I sort of read that number. I took all those numbers with a pinch of salt, to be honest, because proportionally, it feels like the conversation is still around whatever the big game is at the moment, right?
That's because we live so completely in the bubble of that one percent.
Yeah, I guess so. I guess that's like... I don't know.
It feels loud in there. It feels like the conversation is loud, but then actually does the bubble is very small. Yeah.
I mean, it's possible. But I guess I do think small in some ways, because to me, I was excited. I was like, oh, it's good that Andy Kelly is tweeting about my game.
That's a genuine thought I had today. And it's like, is Andy Kelly in our bubble, in fact? And it's like you say, it's like that universe inside the box Futurama thing, right?
Or is it Men in Black? Do they do that as well? Like the entire universe?
Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe that's what we are. We are like this pocket universe, basically.
And we just don't have the self-awareness to realise. Or it's happening right now on the podcast, like live, the existential crisis in motion.
A pocket universe where nothing is more important than whether a number is green, amber or red.
Exactly. So yeah, that is possible. But I don't know, it's sort of, I feel like when they came up with those percentages, that was, if you think about the amount of dads who are playing Microsoft Solitaire in the 90s, right?
If you say that the gamer audience includes all those dads at the time, you'd still probably find that with you and your mates playing GoldenEye, the amount of time that people are putting into quote unquote old games versus a game from, you know, versus like whatever the fucking new release was in like 2001. That's the kind of mass they're doing. But imagine everyone's got a device in their pockets that plays a ton of games, including the biggest games on the planet.
That's what that percentage means.
Yes, you are. And the number also, it's a percentage. It doesn't take into account the number of people playing games is so much bigger.
It's the difference between tens of millions and hundreds of millions, billions, probably. And so actually that percentage is still pretty healthy. That's what you keep telling yourself.
And the percentage was just for people playing old games. Yes, most of those old games are Fortnite. But in that mix, there's got to be someone playing like Max Payne 1 or Jedi Outcast.
I love those are the two go-to's. I love that naughty score.
So there's got to be one person in there who's playing like fucking Banjo-Kazooie.
I saw someone playing Jedi Outcast in our Discord, speaking of bubbles, just the other day. So I think that it's happening for sure. I love the thought of that.
But do you think that's true for every game? Is there someone right now playing Alpha Centauri? Or what about more obscure kind of like Empire Earth or fucking Supreme Commander?
To the concurrence.
Yeah, we could write a new story about this. Only one person is playing Supreme Commander.
That is a concurrence story I would hear. I would listen to. It's like one guy is playing fucking heads on the PC.
Okay, we've got our stance on that sort now. Went round the houses there Matthew, and we are no longer on topic, so that's good. How much, I suppose this relates to what we're talking about though.
How much does Metacritic cast a shadow overwriting a review view? Do you ever think about that at all?
Like I said, no, I don't think it's my job to worry about what other people are going to say. I mean, my dream scenario with all games is that I get to review it in isolation before any other scores or any other chats out there. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy or didn't enjoy playing the game back in the day of I'd put my score out completely au naturel, have no idea what anyone else had written, but I get a little bit of joy if it ended up being a Metacritic score, because then I'm like, well I kind of really nailed the average on that one.
I got it right, quote unquote. That's really not that different to what you do if you ever do game consulting. Mock reviews, part of that process, they ask you what you think it's going to score, or a bracket, you know, it's going to score 70 to 75 on Metacritic.
So actually being a good judge of scores like that for that particular job is very valuable, you know, and being able to land it clean on, like if your mock review score ends up being bang on what the Metacritic are, I would like to think that the publisher would be like, well that guy really knew what he was talking about. So that's kind of part of it too.
Yeah, even then though people get that stuff wrong all the time, and it's still always a form of guesswork, you know, there is no objective way to guess what everyone will give a game. It's just a little bit of a, you can narrow down the range based on your experience, right? Because you've been doing it for so fucking long.
But it is satisfyingly galaxy-brained to predict what 50 other people are going to do and get it right, and be like, yeah, I'm a pretty good judge of this, you know?
Yeah, I guess I...
Well, listen, I've not done many of these things. I've done like five mock reviews, say, and I'd say four of them, like one of them isn't out yet or might never come out. I think I was absolutely spot on with what people not only sort of scored it, but what they said about it.
I was pleased with that. I'm just saying this on the podcast in case any publishers are listening and want to kind of use my skills. They are available.
Well, that's a very fucking Saul Goodman s way to sell your mock review services, Matthew. By the way, I do this for a living.
I'm just saying.
It's got big Saul Goodman when he's got those two kids running around with him filming him, doing his little adverts. That was the energy of that there.
Well, that's good because I thought I was very much in my Saul Goodman working in that Cinnabon because it's all gone horribly wrong phase of my life. So I will take it.
At what point does every games journalist reach a point in their career where they add consultants to their Twitter bio? Everyone does it. It's a very real thing.
You only have to do it once and then you are technically a consultant.
That's true. I have done it once. So maybe I should go around now saying, I'm Samuel Roberts, PR manager, podcaster and consultant.
That's so, I mean, even more reasons to hate me to be honest. Anyway, to answer my own question about Metacritic casting a shadow over Ryga Review, like I say, no, not at all. I think in some ways maybe I'd be a bit more sensitive to what I'm scoring something, knowing it's going to be looked at on that scale, which I definitely wasn't conscious of that when I was on Play Magazine in the late noughties.
I was a bit more reviewing in a bubble and I thought, well, if I review this thing for half a page, and my editors only give me three hours to play it, and I give it 50 whatever percent. Them's the breaks. That's the process that's broken, not me.
So, which is exactly how I would have seen it in 2007. But obviously, that's not really fair on the games. But that's-
Them's the breaks.
Well, half page reviews were just a ridiculous concept. So we'll review roundups. They were like, you don't want to look nice this, but you know what we don't have?
The editorial resources to do this properly. That is what those spreads were like. Am I wrong, Matthew?
That's correct.
That is true.
It works for film reviews, because you can watch a film in two hours.
But the games that tended to be on those spreads were often garbage. They weren't things which were obviously destined for greatness. I'd like to think if you found a hidden gem in those pages, you could elevate it to something more if you wanted.
That is true. Like I say, in film reviews, they're kind of perfect. You can hit a lot at once, and that's not an onerous amount of work for people.
That in theory is about three hours work. It's not too hard, really. Or if it's Matthew, that would be a fucking 16-hour job, because everything he writes these days, he just drives himself completely mad, telling himself, I've lost it, I haven't got it anymore.
And then…
That is true, unless you're a publisher listening, in which case I'm incredibly efficient when I'm doing my consultancy work.
Yeah, or Edge magazine, who might want to get Matthew to review a Switch 2 launch title next year.
Actually, two things from what you just said there. One, when I was researching this, there was really no reason to go down into the 40s for this. There was nothing down there of any worth.
No.
In the 40s on DS&Wii, it was just flashbacks to our review Roundup page on NGamer, which was eight reviews and you're like, oh, this is where all those games ended up here getting 40 percent. So that kind of made me chuckle and also sort of sigh.
It's a proper sort of mega city one of tears with Metacritic, isn't it? Do you know what I mean? Like up in the green area, it's fine.
It's perfectly peaceful. All the rich people are there. And down in the red, you got judged red headshotting people because it's just so fucking dark down there, you know?
Except all the people. I mean, the chances are if you're down there, you probably are like a Disney character. So it's just judged red, sort of headshotting fucking Stitch from Lilo and Stitch and whoever else was in a game, Aladdin, DuckTales guy, Scrooge McDuck.
DuckTales guy, aka Scrooge McDuck.
Well, that's what it would say on his police report, aka also known as Scrooge McDuck.
Yeah, with the two headshots, like the front-facing one, the side, the beak pointing outwards. Perfect. A great image.
The other thing I wanted to say, though, actually, about where it maybe makes me think twice, is when sites have a five-star rating system, it's a tricky one because it gets translated in quite an unsatisfying way. Obviously, three stars become 60%, four stars becomes 80%, and so on. But in my mind, I think three stars means something different to 60%.
I don't think that 60% necessarily reflects what I meant. A three-star film, I think you'd watch 60-rated game, most people would be like, ugh, about. And I really felt it when I reviewed Splatoon 3 for VGC.
And I gave it three stars because I thought it was a very solid continuation of those previous two games, and three stars felt about right. But loads of people came after that review because they saw the 60 on Metacritic. And it just seems harsher in a way.
I know it's in the direct translation, and that may not make any sense, but I think there is a psychology in certain scoring systems. Yeah, that's like an unfortunate, I don't really know how to deal with it. I mean, other than just give everything fucking four and five stars, but that feels unsatisfying because then you're not using the scale.
But, hmm.
I'd be curious to know what reviewers who do work with that system, if given the option to not be on Metacritic, but you get to preserve your sanity of giving things a three and a three out of five means to you. You get to communicate to your audience what that three means, as opposed to your audience interpreting it from seeing a 60 next to a 90 from IGN or whatever. Like, whether they would prefer to be out of the conversation and own their own little review corner or be in the conversation, and everything is judged the same, which is the floor of Metacritic.
It doesn't allow for people having different scoring systems, or arguably it does, but the end result just reflects a lot of different ways of reviewing games at once, arguably, which is also kind of a bit of a headache, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
OK, well, I've got one more question for you, Matthew. How do you find using Metacritic as a tool? Do you think its utility outweighs the fact it's reductive towards the process of reviewing games?
And I ask this because I think it's really handy for cataloging games on different systems. When we've done the draft episodes, I found it pretty invaluable. You can sort by score.
Certainly, obviously, we couldn't do this episode if they didn't have a very good sort of like library and cataloging features. You can sort things by year, by format. And I do think that, you know, in the absence of something like Letterbox for games, and I know that Backlog exists, but doesn't quite have the stickiness of Letterbox for me or the presentation.
It's pretty good, but Letterbox, I think, is an immaculate app. It's a really great experience and a great community it's fostered. What do you think?
Do you think the utility outweighs the kind of reductive factor?
I think so, but that does come from someone who, like you say, is making a podcast where I need very easy access to all scores for all games ever, and platforms, and specific years. Yeah, I think it's pretty neat. I mean, weirdly, if you group and order an entire platform's library by score, you start working through the pages to go down the scale.
I found that the site begins to go a little bit do-lally the further down you go. Did you find that?
How do you mean?
Began to like chug, like it was doing something live that it didn't like going that low, like it was having to like, keep ever, I don't know about site design, I don't know how this thing was working, but I found that it would get slower and slower and slower. And I was just like, how is this actually doing this? Is there something mad in search function?
Because most people don't need to scroll through 80 pages to get down to the 50s.
Yeah, only idiots do that for a podcast.
It would just begin to like freeze up and get quite janky, I found.
No, I didn't have that, but I did most of my research on my fucking i9 14th gen new PC.
Oh, that might be it. But yeah, there was something going on there.
Yeah, you were just, I think it's because you were doing something unholy. You were like accessing information you shouldn't have, you know.
I kept thinking for myself as like a little submarine going like deeper into one of those trenches on the ocean seabed and just like feeling the strain of the metal and like all the bolts are beginning to ping in and water is coming in. Like you're not meant to go that deep into Metacritic. Like no one should be down in the 40s and 30s.
It isn't for human eyes. It's like that down there, that's where like there are creatures we've never seen before and have never been documented, but they are down there if you go down deep enough.
It's like, wow, they got a Avengers Wii U game down here or whatever. Yeah, very much the vibe. Forgotten PS2 party games and other cursed ephemera.
Yeah, that's, that is funny. I didn't have that, but I do like the idea that that's very similar to your, is my Wii trying to fuck me up while I play Fatal Frame Theory, Matthew? I just like, I like that idea.
That's good. The website is telling you no, but you keep going further and further.
Yeah. Well, I had, I can't remember if it was Green or Nick, or definitely one of my older editors talked about like going above 90 in scores, and every 1% above 90, it's like when the enterprise begins to strain because it's going too fast, and Scottie's just like, we can't do it. We can't go up to 95.
You can't go up to 96. We're fucked at 97.
We can't even do it, Captain.
Something had to be so watertight to exist at those high scores, and that image always stuck in my head. I think I even wrote about it in one of the reviews, the idea of this game as a spaceship, and it was beginning to like, can it get to 98?
It's funny you say that actually because when I was on PC Gamer, sometimes I'd be curious to know, so something that happened with PC Gamer is at some point they merged the UK and the US teams to make the same thing, but before that there were separate publications who gave things separate scores. So PC Gamer UK, I don't think gave a score above 96 ever. I think as high as it went was 96, and I think that was Half-Life 2, and I know that Phil, when I was on the site, gave it to Kerbal Space Program as well.
But in the US, I believe they gave 98 to Crisis, for example. And there was that tiny, tiny bit of judgment of, I don't feel you've taken the sanctity of this scoring system as seriously as we have.
Yeah, take their numbers away. You've got to take the nine key away from their keyboard, because they've not earned the right to use it, until they've calmed down a bit.
Which is to say, previous US editorial teams I didn't work with, not slagging off any of the people I worked with.
No, no, heaven forbid.
Yeah, but it was funny to see the contrast sometimes in the vast gulf that would often occur, and you realize that, oh, these were two different versions of PC Gamer, same publisher, future-owned both of them. But yeah, it would sometimes produce vastly different results. I think this is quite neatly illustrated by Duke Nukem Forever.
I think the US score for that is famously, infamously, quite high, and the UK one gave it what it deserved, basically. It was a terrible game. So yeah, it is what it is, really.
Did you find the process of picking games that's won a nightmare, Matthew, given the strict criteria?
It was more the amount of stuff we had to go through, because it was like drafting for every platform ever.
Yeah, that was the hard part.
And also not drafting just at the high end. You weren't just drafting in the top 30 games. You were drafting in like 500 games in the middle.
So that was hard. I've definitely missed some amazing stuff off this list. I kept discovering things.
As you'll see when we get to the draft, there are a few stipulations around what could and couldn't be used, which made there was an extra level of checking to make sure the scores were actually sound for the draft. Yeah, this one was quite a heavy lift. I'd say I probably did about five or six hours of research.
I didn't try that hard. I would say I put in about probably two and a half hours of research.
Normally, I'd research until I had enough picks.
Yeah.
But this one, I was like, no, I know there's something better than this, particularly for the sub-70 and the sub-70. Well, we'll get to the categories, but there's some even stiffer categories in here where I really had to go digging.
Yeah. Well, I don't think I got a good one for one of the categories. I think that was just maybe a pick of the garbage down there.
So maybe-
Grab any piece of shit and just take no one cares.
Yeah, basically. Okay, Matthew. Well, I enjoyed the process.
I did like the challenge of it and the feeling that every great game you'd find down there was like this major discovery of, oh wow, this suddenly makes it more competitive than I realized. Like you say, because it's a cross-platform draft, that does differentiate it from most of the drafts that we've done. Most of them have been format-based, so this really is like a massive spread of stuff, and the rush to secure certain things is going to be interesting, because I think we might approach it quite differently.
So yes, shall we take a quick break then, Matthew, and we'll come back with the draft?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, the sub 80 Metacritic draft can begin. We have a few rules to go through first, and some of this might take a tiny bit of clarification on the air because they're a little bit more complicated than our usual rules just due to the weird ways that Metacritic can work.
So, first of all, very obviously, the game has to have scored 79 or less on the site metacritic.com. And you have to pick the gift.
I think you said this just in case there was another Metacritic one of us might try and lean on.
Yeah, metacritic.gov.uk.
You have to pick the game when it first came out. So first initial release. You can't pick a port years down the line where critics might have gotten grumpy about it and changed their mind about the game or it's just aged a bit so they didn't score it quite as highly.
So let's call this the Hitman Blood Money Reprisal Rule. It was 79 on Switch, that game, but it got 80 plus originally. So you can't take Hitman Blood Money by picking the Switch port.
I think that makes sense, Matthew. For example, Bully Scholarship Edition on PC would not be allowed because even though that does qualify for sub-80, it scored 87 on PS2. So therefore that takes it off the table.
That's good because it means you just have to go by the immediate critical reception from the time. OK, next rule. On at least one of its initial release formats, the game had to have scored below 80.
If it's released on multiple formats and those formats score above 80, let's say a 360 version scores 81 but the PS3 version scores 79, the scores have to be within 10 points of each other between those initial format releases. Let me explain why. Let's say the PS3 port is a piece of shit, right?
And so it's like 62 for the PS3 port but 81 for the 360 version which is an exaggeration of what the early days of the PS3 were like but just for the you know just for the point of illustration you can't pick that game because it's you're only getting it because it's a bad port. The 10-point rule keeps them close enough together that it's basically parity and the differences are minor based on I guess probably the single format Xbox outlets who reviewed one version higher than the other if they're say like two points apart or whatever. So that generally speaking does cover us and doesn't really rule anything out.
It seems like a complicated rule but that's more of a guideline to stop that from happening basically. So does that make sense to you Matthew?
It basically stops you from going like Bayonetta because it scores sub 80 on PS3 but a 90 on Xbox.
But that's a great example, that's exactly what we're trying to avoid basically. But within 10 points of each other then it's fine and that covers most stuff. I tried 5 but 5 was too rigid, you still get a bit of variation there.
Okay, next rule, this is the last rule really. You can only pick games from the PS2 era onwards or 2000 onwards for PC and other formats because anything before that gets a little dicey score wise. Few reasons for this.
It's clear that Metacritic only started archiving this stuff properly once the new millennium started basically. And so from 2000 onwards you got a pretty good bank of pretty much everything that was releasing on different formats that time. But before then, if you look at the best PC games of 1998, for example, it's far from comprehensive, it's very top line.
So there is one exception to this though. We have a pre-2000 category which you can break as you see fit to get something tasty. That's what I wrote in the notes and then it turned out to be a fucking nightmare.
So that's another thing. Any thoughts on those rules?
There's not much tasty down there.
Nothing tasty at all. Just gruel, gruel from the past. Any thoughts on these rules, Matthew?
Have I made any of this too rigid?
No, I think this is fine. What I will say is you've just got to kind of trust me that I've done the work on this and I'm not going to try and get anything past you that doesn't adhere to these rules. I don't want to be justifying each individual pick and explaining the score differences.
For a lot of them, I've kind of forgotten what the formats necessarily were. I've got the game and the score. I hope that's not a problem.
No, that's fine. I've got the formats as well, but that's fine. I'll say what those formats are as I go.
There's another actually important rule to point out. There's something else to factor in actually with the upper limit of the score thing. This sounds arbitrary, but it does make sense.
I came across one example of a game where the highest rated version was still under 80, but it had a much lower rated version of the game on a different format that was extended beyond 10 points, so would break that rule. However, if the highest rated version is still under 80, that rule doesn't matter. I think that's a fair way of putting it.
I didn't come across anything like that, so I'm curious what that is.
Well, you know, maybe that will be a secret weapon of mine, we'll see. That seems strenuous, but it makes sense. Games are under 80, and don't take the piss with, like, picking ports and no remasters or re-releases.
It's as simple as that, really. So then, the 10 categories. I will now read these out.
Category 1, the last 10 years, so a game from 2014 onwards. Category 2, PS2 slash GameCube slash Xbox generation game. Category 3, 360 or PS3 generation game.
Category 4, PC game. Category 5, the critics properly fucked this award. The implication there being, we disagree with what the critics, in general, gave this as a consensus score.
Category 6, sub-70 score. So it has to be even lower than 70. So 80 is the criteria for the rest of the picks, but this one, under 70.
Category 7, sub-60 score. Even dicier. Category 8, pre-2000.
So a game from 1999 or earlier. Category 9, cult game. And Category 10, freak pick.
So that can be literally anything, as long as it scores under that 80 number. Any thoughts on those categories, Matthew, before we get started?
Yeah, I mean, it asked us to dig through 20 years, over 20 years of gaming. So that's why it had to be very comprehensive. I'm pleased we've got the sub 70 and sub 60.
I think that's where this really becomes even trickier, trying to find quality down there or really misrepresented things. Interested to see where we both land on critics properly fuck this. Yeah, I think this is good.
I think it's going to be fun, Matthew. So do you want to do the coin flip to decide who picks first? So we're going to do the old, whoever wins the coin toss can decide whether they go first or second.
If you go second, you get two picks. If you go first, you get one pick. After the second person picks their two picks, we go back to one pick apiece until the end of the draft.
And that's that.
So what do you want?
Heads.
Heads it is.
OK, I think I will go first.
OK, interesting.
Yeah, it's hard to know which category to go for first, though, because there's two categories, I think, where there are like a limited number of killer picks. Not like, oh, there's no category where there's like only one pick, viable pick, I would say. It's quite broad, but.
I mean, the very nature of this is that a lot of them, they're not middling games, but they're not your dream games. So it can't be like, yes, you know, I secretly found, well, there's maybe a couple of secret 90s, sub 80. But outside of that, though, it gets into the realms of, well, what do you make of this?
Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to take one thing I know looks good on the results sheet first.
Okay.
Category five, the critics properly fucked this award.
Okay, here we go.
I'm taking God Hand on PS2, 73 on Metacritic. The critics properly fucked this, Matthew. But this was actually like still a hard pick to make.
So I love God Hand. This is a brawler from Capcom made by Clovis Studio, Shinji Mikami, absolutely cooking in the post-Resi 4 days. This really intricate 3D brawler where you build your own combos out of basically little component moves that you pick up throughout the game and like, and buy throughout the game until you basically build a kind of like, you know, a version of this fighter gene that you're happy with where the exact pacing of each move, each kick, each punch, whatever it might be, flows together really nicely.
The closest I've come to another game like this is Obsolver, the game that Devolver published, or Sifu from a few years ago. Like they are developers who I know were inspired by God Hand when they worked on Obsolver. So a key influence on them, just all-timer melee combat, really funny game, just extremely ridiculous cutscenes, probably quite inappropriate to play now in some ways.
There's definitely a move where you can spank an enemy and send them flying into the distance. But you know what, it was the end of the PS2 days, Matthew, and it was a good old laugh. So that's my first pick.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's a great one. It was definitely in my pool for this category. I mean, particularly like…
I mean, it's a great game. You could have got it into multiple categories, but specifically for the critics, properly fuck this. I guess the question God Hand raises, and this general draft raises, is the idea of did people review things differently at different times?
And did that have an impact on some of these games? It's not just that they scored what they scored. It's like, why did they score this?
Like, what, you know, would God Hand score this now? Or would it score higher? Because we maybe have a better appreciation of, you know, Shinji Mikami or we're more open minded about systems.
Like, that's what I thought was interesting about this one. It's like, what did they miss that loads of people have subsequently found?
That is interesting. I think in the case of God Hand, I think it was just too much of a cure. It's too bizarre.
I think it just it was confrontationally weird to people. And it's funny, because if you look at the reception to Killer 7 from this time, it might be because the PS2 port was a little bit jank, but that was like around 70 on PS2, I think. And I think that sometimes, I know people would just had maybe, maybe even like in the UK where we didn't get like the biggest range of Japanese games compared to the US.
Maybe people would just a little bit more milk toast in their taste, you know? Maybe it's a little bit of that. But yes, it does raise that question for sure.
But yeah, there's another game I was dying to pick and I'm wondering if Matthew is going to grab it now. We'll find out. But God hand for the critics to properly fuck this.
I mean, this is the ultimate. This and Alien Isolation. I like the games where you're like, why did you do this basically?
So yeah, Matthew, what's your first pick?
Let's stick with that theme because I think it is, is the right second pick for this and I don't want to lose it elsewhere. Alien Isolation 79 for the critics properly fuck this award.
Yeah, good choice.
I mean, 79 is still quite a high score and maybe there's a couple of specific scores that stick in the mind with this one where you're like, what was that person on when they gave it this? But, you know, to take, for me, this is, this is the kind of genre defining horror survival experience and those genre defining games are the games you tend to find in the 90s. I think the amount of like love and effort and thought that clearly went into this and how well it translates, you know, I do think 79 is like quite a rude score for it.
I definitely think this is the second strongest pick for this category.
Yeah, that's like to those that is the story of like when critics get it wrong and the effects that has on Metacritic and the the chain reaction of that and it taking 10 years for a sequel to be, you know, to come to fruition, I mean, glad really glad it is. That's great. Yeah, that's very exciting that that's in the works.
But yeah, good pick, Matthew. What's your next pick?
That was the one I was most worried about. Like I knew I had to get one of those two just to get it off the board because this is my second thinnest list. I'm going to go pre-2000.
Yeah, I'm going to take Super Smash Brothers with 79.
Ah, fuck. Yeah, that was that was one of the ones I had for that.
We've had this before. Super Smash Brothers has come up in our drafts before this era of it. And it is obviously so much thinner than Melee, Brawl and Ultimate.
You know, like it hadn't quite become the the all encompassing thing it was going to be. But I don't think that should overwrite the fact that it was absolutely a multiplayer favourite of mine, a multiplayer classic, I would say, on the N64. You know, and it had like fucking eight characters or whatever, but me and my brother played the shit out of it.
Probably played that more than any other Smash Brothers, maybe. I think it became less and less with each iteration, just due to changing lifestyle. But, you know, being in those locations, being in those characters, chucking the lightsabers at each other, Donkey Kong picking up people and walking off the map, always hilarious.
I'll always have time for this. I think it maybe scored this, I say this low, 79 again, still pretty high. You know, in that it did feel quite like threadbare as a package, which tended to be quite a black mark against games in like the 90s and early noughties.
People weren't great on like, it does this one thing brilliantly and you can play this one thing forever, and we're a bit more hung up on, has it got loads of modes I can play forever? I think there's like a mentality shift over time. I think people are a little bit more open to things that are like mechanically pure, which maybe didn't exist.
That is a generalization, but I think there's some truth in it.
The other thing is that subsequent Smash Bros entries would feel less like a tech demo, and would be absolutely rammed with stuff. Over time, the volume of content has defined what Smash Bros is, I think.
Yeah, but the core idea of all these people from different games who would never normally meet are suddenly together, kicking the shit out of each other, with movesets that really reflect their powers and specific gameplay ideas. That is here. It is magic.
I couldn't wait to play it. When I played it, I was obsessed with it. I think 79 is pretty tough.
I mean, I think N64 magazine gave this like 90 plus. So for the real heads, we knew where it was at.
Yeah, I suppose as well. Like it was probably they're probably thinking about it next to things like Mario Party from the time or Mario Kart, where you don't know it's going to go on to be this big thing. It's like a first first draft.
And so people were just, you know, reviewing it fresh. I was surprised to see us got 79. I thought this would have been like 80 plus, but it's true.
This might also just be like what Metacritic is pulling from for this. It isn't necessarily the most comprehensive. Like you said, things get a little bit hazy, you know, pre 2000s.
They sure do. They sure do, pal. Nonetheless, that is a good pick, Matthew.
Two good picks there to kick us off. So it comes back around to me. My next pick is going to be category six, sub 70 score.
And I'm taking Mad Max, which scored 69 on PS4, which is a fucking abomination. That game is extremely enjoyable. I was shocked to see this down there.
And I thought this was like the absolute winner of the games that were in this score bracket. I couldn't believe this was down here. Like one of the better, more enduring recent open world games.
I think people have come to regard this as something quite specific in a very homogenous genre. And I played through it last year on Xbox and I thought it was still great. I would definitely say this is like a low eight to this game.
I don't think it's... You could argue it's like one of those sevens, but I think it probably is like a low eight. In the timeline of open world games and the fact that it does car combat really well, it has a slightly rudimentary version of the Arkham combat system, but also just the experience of driving across a desert in this game and how it feels to be in Max's world and when there's a storm and it all starts kicking off.
It really has its own particular feel and I think it's quite a special game. What do you think of this pick, Matthew?
Yeah, I thought this was strong. This is definitely on my long list. I didn't see the 69.
I thought I had this on my long list for the game from the last 10 years. In a similar way, actually, that you're seeing with what people are writing about Indiana Jones, it's just a game that really understands the whole Mad Max deal and what matters to that character and what makes sense and to give you moments that feel like the films. In a way, I don't think it's quite as good as those games, but, you know, Mad Max is in the same circle as Indiana Jones, Batman Arkham, Spider-Man.
In terms of like, oh, they just got it. But I feel like at the time, maybe people were already beginning to feel like open world fatigue and that's what they reviewed, where actually if you have a bit of distance, you begin to appreciate what it does differently to other open world games, how important the car is at the heart of that game, you know, in the way that it is at the heart of Max's existence. Yeah, that one's rightfully reassessed, I think.
Yeah, 69. 69!
What a heartbreaker.
Releasing that on the same day as MGS5, all time stinker of a decision made by an executive, that one. That's tough. Yep.
Okay, good. I'm glad to have got that one then. I thought you would have gone, it's not quite, it's more of a seven, isn't it?
But you didn't. So I appreciate that.
No, no, I think, I think that is, that is definitely one of the things that people have like reappraised as more of an eight in the last few years.
I think so. Okay. Well then Matthew, we come on to your next pick.
I've got to get Sub-60 off the table because, and this is just like stinkeroony sitting this place. And the things I've got, I mean, I'll definitely go through them at the end. I was so bad.
I was just like, which of these, which of these fucking awful things I'm going to pick.
I've only got one game for this. So if you pick this one game, I'm fucked. I have to literally find a new one live on the podcast because I thought he won't pick this.
But what if you do? Let's find out.
So I really, I went through every platform, the 50 bracket to see if anything caught my eye. And there was one thing where I thought, you know what, this wasn't successful, but I thought it had more than its score would suggest.
Oh no, I know it's going to be the same game.
So I think I'm going to take Anthem with 54.
No, it's the same fucking game.
Yes, I knew it was the diamond.
Fuck's sake. Oh my god. What are the chances of that?
I saw it, I was like, I can't believe that's down here.
Fucking 54 for Anthem. I mean, the thing is, right? I agree with you.
I mean, I think this is secretly an Anthem Stan podcast because the mechanics of this are too good for it to be a 54 game on PS4. That's so low. Like it doesn't have enough content because it clearly took too long in fucking pre-production before they started making this game, so it's got no content in it.
That's like the problem. But Anthem was pretty fun.
Anthem was okay, and it just got like… It snowballed into internet bullshit, I think. This was like the very first wave of we're not having any more games of service.
It's happened a lot since then. There's lots of other games like it that live down here. I'm probably not going to pick it, but Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League, sitting at about 60.
There's a lot of craft in that game for it to get 60, I think. I would say this is an internet throwing its toys out the pram score. I think it's not like an 8 or anything, but it ain't a 54.
When I saw that, it was like being at a car boot sale and discovering a translated copy of a Japanese mystery that I'd never heard of. Clouds parted and a beam fell into a particular table and I was just like, yes, there it is, there it is. That's the one.
I really thought, until I discovered that, that I was going to have to try and sell you on Indiana Jones Staff of Kings with 55 and I was like, that ain't going to cut it.
That's so funny. I can't believe we both came up with Anthem. I thought he's bound to pick something else.
Of course, he fucking didn't, did you? Here we are.
That stuff to put in the time and it paid off.
I'm going to have to pick fucking murdered soul suspects. The thing is, I can't technically have the bad port rule stop Cyberpunk 2077 from being picked because it got 86 on PC, but 57 on PS4 and 61 on... That's wild.
So, can't be doing that. So, it looks like it's going to be a tough break for Big Sammy. That's on me to figure out as the podcast goes on, Matthew.
Good stuff. What a great time to be alive. I can't believe you picked fucking Anthem.
I mean, if it gets to the end and you're really struggling, I can read out my... I had a list of seven for this and I can just read them out and you can pick one.
Yeah. I have the real, real back pocket one. I did have.
If I really have to, I'll do this, but I have a feeling that whatever is picked for this probably isn't going to win the draft anyway.
No, it isn't, but I want it to be the least sort of damaging it could be.
Yeah, that does make sense, in which case it's my next pick. Another tricky category I'm going to get out of the way here. Category four, PC game.
I'm going to take Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is 79 on PC and one of the most successful PC games of the past decade plus. It is very much a kind of a vibes-based game that people love the relaxing, cosy simulation vibes of, of just driving some shit around some cities in London and between countriesides and stuff. An Andy Kelly favourite, yeah, like a good time, a great version of what it is, the ultimate of those kind of like, we've stuck simulator on the end kind of games.
But even when they released American Truck Simulator, people still agreed this was the best one. Loads of fucking expansions. If you want to have a more detailed trip through Europe.
It still sells really well all the time on Steam. I just saw it in the top five this past weekend. It has remained kind of like Evergreen as a Steam favourite.
And so as a PC game that was a little bit underestimated by critics, this feels like the perfect fit. This is a monstrously successful game. Everyone has this in their Steam library, even if they've never played it.
Thoughts, Matthew?
I don't have it in my Steam library, but that's because I'm not really Mr. PC. So I'm not trying to cast shade on it, or what you just said. I understand that these are sacred key texts of PC gamers, but it's just a little bit too PC for me, dog.
So, no, thank you.
But 616,000 reviews on Steam this.
I mean, I wish it well, but it really isn't for me. People clearly love it, I should say.
There was a few other bits of PC, but I couldn't find anything I was really excited about, like I saw Vermintide down there. That was the other one I thought about for this.
Yeah, I mean, I've got one. I don't know if you're going to deem it PC enough. I guess we'll see when we get to it.
Is it Metal Gear Solid V?
No, it isn't.
Is it Grand Theft Auto V? Okay. All right.
Well, Matthew's not impressed, but I know that the real heads know. The real heads will know. Yep.
So for PC game, that feels like the right fit. What's your next pick, Matthew?
I feel like I've removed my pressure points, the things I was really stressed about.
Yeah.
And now I can just cruise around on vibes and things that I like. For 360 PS3 generation game, I'm going to take Binary Domain with 74.
Interesting.
A hot pick, but also one which I seriously think is underrated. I think a game which got a bit hammered at the time because it was a cover shooter. When there were a lot of cover shooters, this was very post Gears of War.
Lots of people were doing this. I think people dismissed it a bit out of hand, like, oh, the Yûki's team are making a weird robot first person shooter. But crucially, the thing it really gets right is the robots are sensationally fun to shoot.
They're slightly ceramic in nature, so the way they come apart and then carry on crawling I think is a real distinct hook of this game. Also has some pretty awesome scaled boss fights. I think it really goes to places and has some of the best supporting characters ever, like that French robot Kane.
Is it necessarily a big hitter? No, but I think it deserves better than 74.
Yeah, I've never played this. I know that it is beloved by about 800 men who had Xbox 360s, and they are all on the Internet. So in that respect, a great pick.
They all listen to this podcast.
I'm just describing our list of shit basically. Yeah, I should play this at some point. I feel like I'll probably like this if I played it.
It's just really entertaining. It moves really quickly. Like it just has a bit of that.
I'm not going to say it's like McCarmy tier as a third-person action experience, but it has some of that energy, some of that momentum, like throwing in different set pieces. Not all of it lands in a way that I don't think like McCarmy would let through the rougher parts of this game. But given that all they've been doing elsewhere was just endless Yakuza after Yakuza, it's amazing this landed as well as it did.
Yeah, absolutely. I think that makes sense. I should play at some point.
I know it's backwards compatible. I think I have it on 360 via Xbox Series X. So one day Matthew, no doubts.
Maybe you'll go into a poll one day for the XL episodes. Something to think about there.
Oh yeah, that would be good.
Yeah, that actually might be a spot on for those polls to come second place.
I think it's got quite a good back compatible upgrade on Xbox as well.
Yeah, 60 FPS. Tasty. Okay, next up then for me.
I'm going to take category 2 PS2 gamecube slash Xbox generation game and I'm going to take res on PS2, which has 78. I think this is a good choice for this category. This is a genuine classic.
I imagine that how short it is, this is very arcadey experience, just I think it's like five or six levels in total, is why it didn't score necessarily as highly as it could do. But it's a true has transcended time, is considered a classic, is considered a really, basically every Mizuguchi game, I feel like has this kind of immortal reputation, these visually distinctive rhythm action games with incredible music. And this is a shooter where the music plays in time to, the beat plays in time to you popping off loads of lasers inside this computer, basically.
It's got this great Y2K visual aesthetic of what it looks like inside a computer.
It's quite normal, man.
Yeah, very much so. And it only really escalates the vision of it as you go deeper into it. It has since been ported to modern formats, was later put on Xbox 360 to much fanfare and res HD, but it did originally release on PS2, Matthew.
So 78. That is low for a game that has really stood the test of time, I think. What do you think of this pick?
Yeah, again, I think this is a classic example of, oh, it's only like an hour long. So you can only give it a limited score at the time. This is just how magazines were.
It just meant like games like this and like all treasure games were just doomed to be underrated. Where I think now people would go be like, that's a nine out of 10 loop, so a nine out of 10 it should get. I think that's how, I think things have come on a little bit.
We're a bit more open to games like this.
Yeah, I think as well that games now just live on forever is like 66 percent off in a Steam sale. So you do review things for the score to last as opposed to the score for the moment. So yeah, I think that's definitely part of how review patterns change as you're alluding to earlier.
So there it is. What's your next pick, Matthew?
Last 10 years, so 2014 onwards, I didn't struggle with this one. I think there are loads of great 70s in this. A little bit of a hard pick this one, but I think it is right.
Well, like I said, I don't think there's one that wins outright. I'm going to take the Evil Within for this one. At 79, lots of people will be like, well, that's what it deserves.
And that's fine. I think the Evil Within is quite underappreciated, particularly the first one. I think the second one is actually a little overrated.
But the first one for me is so nasty and puts you in such a pressured place that I think the whole survival horror genre only really makes sense if you feel enough pressure. It's one of the reasons alien isolation is so good. It's one of the reasons I think this is really great is that truly it feels like every bullet counts and you are often breathless and desperate to get through each fight.
And when you hit those save rooms with Claire de Lune playing in the background, you're just overcome with such a sense of relief. I think I think you really roller coaster rides such a cliche, but in terms of like your heart rate up and down, I think he really plays you like a fiddle in this game. I think it's great even if it looks a little bit like NAF and it's kind of, I think people look at it and just think it's like some like Resident Evil with like a sore aesthetic, but I think it's pacing and tortsness are second to none.
Definitely a game I've heard you celebrate a few times as part of Matthew.
Yeah, it's a big one for me. I really, really rate it.
I found in general that Xbox One and PS4 had a lot of pretty, I would say like, if not quite A tier, definitely like B tier and above sort of games that are in this score bracket. I was quite surprised by it. This is definitely one of those.
I was amazed that was on the board, but I found it was quite easy to pick something for the last 10 years. It was some real surprises in there. Yeah.
Okay. Good choice, Matthew. Then my next pick.
Do I just do something to annoy Matthew? I think I'm going to. I'm going to take category nine cult game.
I'm going to take Hotel Dusk, Room 215, 78 on Nintendo DS. It's a hotel of bad hangs. But you know what?
It's a compelling little mystery. You turn your DS sideways, and it's still much loved and discussed on the Internet these days. A Matthew Castle favorite.
Also on the board for this, I had something else that was quite tasty. I wonder if Matthew will take it. I'm not going to tip him off in case he didn't realize.
It was actually under 80, the other game I was thinking of. But for something that really ticks the box of cult game, this does suit, I think, it's the developer, the profile of it. It's spot on really for this category.
I didn't want to sit here and try and pretend that Space Marine is a cult game. It's just not true. But Hotel Dusk, I think, is Matthew.
Thoughts?
I obviously love Hotel Dusk. I'm sorry that you've had to put such a language game in your draft collection, but it's out there. Listen, I think the listeners are quietly fond of this game just because I've done such a good job of promoting it over the years.
So I'm obviously not going to talk it down. 78, I mean, I think I gave it 84, which I think is right. I think I gave it the right score.
Very much the wrong review, if you remember, I've written entirely as a very confusing extended metaphor where the game was a dame in my office.
I turned her over like a, what was the thing?
Who got turned onto her side and read like a book, which makes no sense whatsoever. I have to live with that, but I also get to live with Hotel Dusk, which is a game I really like.
Episode 100, if you'd like to hear that review in full, by the way, and also my Niko Bellic fan fiction. So, yes, go check that out.
Why didn't the subhead just go, no, don't do that.
The DS is really interesting, actually, because I found there were a few games that were like pretty good in this bracket, but the Phoenix Wright games all hover just above this. They all have 80 or above, which is the right order to have, like, Hotel Dusk below those, I think.
Yeah, apart from Justice for All.
Oh, that's, oh, Justice for All, okay.
That slips in at like 79, but, you know, it's got a banger of a final case, but the rest of it.
Yeah, it's a bit weak. Okay, well, what's your next pick, Matthew?
You're not going to pick it, so I don't know why I'm trying to get off the board, but just so I can feel better about the category. For PC game, will you accept Kingdom Come Deliverance?
Yes, because I did have this for another category.
Oh, okay.
Well, I had this for sub-70 because it was 69 on fucking PS4, but yeah.
Oh, PC is 76, so it just about makes the cut. Yeah. Kingdom Come Deliverance.
Yeah, I was quite fond of this. A first-person medieval adventure, kind of like medieval Europe Skyrim, I guess, but quite low-key and it was in that low-key-ness, I think a lot of its magic lay in that you're just like this sort of squire, no one, like a peasant really, going around climbing the ranks by befriending various barons and lords. I actually like the story never really takes off, it plays out between a handful of villages.
It's got the best forests I've ever seen in a game in terms of like tree variety, moss textures, feels like very organic, you can just wander around the forests and get lost, lots of irritating mushroom picking quests and whatnot that play out in them. But I kind of like that sort of low-key peasant sin element of it. There are some unsavoury things that sort of hover above this game in terms of things that were said by the developers at the time.
This is secretly a kind of problematic fay for quite a few people.
Is the game itself problematic? That's the question.
Not really. I think for those reasons it is rarely openly celebrated. It feels slightly tarnished in some way, which is a shame because I think most of what it does is very, very solid.
And yeah, like I say, just great atmosphere and it isn't like high fantasy or anything like that. It's sort of like the sort of muddy war bits of The Witcher without all the monsters. And that's always a part of The Witcher I've really liked.
I feel like there's a lot of buzz for the sequel. So quite a few people are like rediscovering this one again, like it's always like five quid on Steam sales and whatnot.
I hear it also runs like way better on PC than it does on console as well. It's a proper play this on a beefy PC if you can kind of game. So yeah, I'm kind of curious about the sequel, I will admit, because I always got told this had a bit of a immersive sim in its bones.
And that always seemed kind of interesting to me. But yeah, it's also just the choice of the choice of setting was kind of cool. I don't know, I think it's a good pick, Matthew.
I think it had the Elder Scrolls thing of like, the more you do something, the better you level up in that particular skill. He was so useless to begin with, that actually you did feel him beginning to master certain crafts. But even like lockpicking in this game was like nightmarishly hard for hours and hours and hours, as this like basic idiot peasant sort of stuck like twigs in locks and things.
And I always quite liked that element of it. Like it was quite an unsympathetic view of like an unintelligent medieval man for the first ten hours.
Yeah, that's funny. I like that. Okay, well good stuff.
That was your PC game pick then. Back to me. It's time to take the pick I'm probably the most excited about for category 3, 360 or PS3 generation game.
It's The Mighty Mirror's Edge, 79 on 360. They weren't ready for it in 2008, Matthew. First person platforming game, very complex.
Asked a lot from you as a player, clearly all the critics who played Assassin's Creed the year before liked it when the platforming was done for them and didn't want to have to engage their brains, which this game makes you do. But this game is, I think, really has done the test of time thanks to its incredible art direction, the very stark dystopian, like White City and very strong colors that contrast that, and the bits of red that guide you on where to go throughout the environment because it's quite a complex game to play if you don't really have any idea of where you're actually heading. It's asked a lot from you in terms of navigation, and also just the sound design of how Faith breathes and the sound she make when she climbs, slides, all that stuff.
It's just such an immersive, in the truer sense of the word, first-person game. I think I last picked it for the 360 draft. I think people didn't quite know what to make of Barry's Edge at the time, but the fact they did make a sequel that I didn't think was quite as good, but I still really like the sequel, just shows that it did have staying power.
Still, you'll see threads over now and then of four screenshots from different levels of this game, and people being like, wow, this game still looks fucking amazing all these years later. I think its complexity has aged very well. I think that asking more from the player has only become increasingly acceptable since the 360 age.
We like games now, I think, that stimulate us in different ways. And I think this game was ahead of the curve on that as well. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, one night I saw as I was going through and thought, oh, I bet Sam will pick that. It feels like a Sam pick. Did a little thing go through my mind going, should we pick that just to upset Sam?
Maybe for the briefest of moment, but then I was back to sort of trawling through the misery minds of Metacritic, so that thought didn't linger. But yes, you see, for me, like 79 feels about right for Mirror's Edge, but then I didn't really kind of commit myself to it fully. I am one of those idiots that likes holding a trigger and watching a well animated man do all my climbing for me easily.
Wowed as I was back then. It seemed more impressive back then, things like Assassin's Creed. But yes, you are right.
Maybe this is one I need to go back to and like re-evaluate.
Yeah, on PC it was quite nicely future proofed, I would say. Like it looks a bit sharper than the 360 version does playing on an Xbox Series X. But yeah, this has Assassin's Creed 2007, 81 on Metacritic, Mirror's Edge 79.
They were on the wrong side of history, Matthew. So what can I say? I love Mirror's Edge.
I think it's a great game. So what's your next pick?
My next pick, for sub 70 score, I'm going to go for Nier with 67.
Oh, okay. That's an interesting choice.
I don't think we've got loads of Nier heads, who I'm going to win over with this.
Nier Automata heads we've got, but not Nier heads.
Yeah, Nier Automata heads. But I think that a lot of the Nier Automata heads were also, Nier was secretly great and it was underscored at the time. I maybe pick this one because I feel partially responsible.
I think I gave it a 60 in Xbox World 360. Which was a bit of a like, oh, this game doesn't really know what it wants to be. It keeps reinventing itself every half an hour.
And, you know, that's kind of hard for any of it to really bed in. Where actually now, you know, I go back and play it and I'm like, it's rad that it reinvents itself. Actually, that's something that really speaks to me.
And I don't know why that didn't speak to me back then. I don't feel like I misunderstood the game necessarily. And I don't feel like I'm just going back and re-evaluating it through the lens of Automata being a great game.
But there was, for whatever reason, it didn't quite register at the time. I think my review did wrestle with like, I don't really know what to make of this strange game, where now I'm actually a lot more comfortable being in that space and celebrate it when I am in those spaces. Near, I apologize, you deserve better than being sub-70.
Yeah, I gave it 66, so I think we put it in Game Review scores we got wrong right at the start of the podcast lifespan. And certainly its enduring reputation would suggest we did miss the magic about it. But we punished it because it had bad third-person combat, Matthew.
And you know what, you know what fixed that? Near Automata, Platinum Games fixed that, so.
That is true, but I'd say there's a big gulf between the 67 and the scores Near Automata got, where this could happily still exist without nipping at the heels of Automata. Like, just give it a 75, you know?
Haha, yeah, that's so, I definitely didn't have the patience for it at the time. Here's a question though, if you could swap it for Mad Max in this category, would you do it?
Oh, yeah, bruh, babe, listen, I'm not going to give you that kind of ammunition in the vote, but I mean, I've acknowledged Mad Max is a good pick. My other sub-70 scores I was looking at, PN03 on the GameCube.
That's a good one.
63, people didn't understand it. Too short, didn't understand the mechanics. Classic, like, res but worse thing.
Ghost Squad, 69, fuckers.
69?
Yeah, Ghost Squad's heavenly.
They should, someone should be in jail for that.
I think the Ghost Squad should be sent to murder all the reviewers who dragged that down to 69. The reviewers should, like, slide out from under their beds, a la the Ghost Squad terrorists. That's what I want.
They should all be on the fucking Interpol most wanted list.
Yeah, 60. Maybe I should have picked that, but I feel like Ghost Squad's something that we've repeatedly praised, but doesn't get much purchase with the with the listeners for whatever reason.
Well, no, I think the other thing is, it kind of is a poor, isn't it, Ghost Squad? Like, it's a bit, it would be a tiny bit cheating as a pick anyway, I think.
Resident Evil 6, 67?
Oh, that would have been, that would have been, I think the listeners might have liked that one, but, you know.
Yeah, well, it would have been true to, true to my character. One that annoyingly got nobbled because of the, the porting or the remake rule is Fable Anniversary with 68.
Right.
That's a rough score for Fable Anniversary, which I think is a really great version of Fable. Like, if you want to play Fable, you play Fable 1, you play Fable Anniversary, brings it in line with Fable 2 and 3. I mean, 68's like, that's the one when I looked at it, I was like, oh, that's definitely the pick.
But then I thought, well, Fable was like a 85 or something on Xbox, so it felt like cheating a bit.
Yeah, OK, that's fair enough. I think that's a good pick. Yes, some of these categories are a little bit much of a muchness, and it's just about picking your angle of attack, and there's a lot on the table.
It's certainly different to other drafts in that respect, Matthew. OK, well then, I might get some of my dud categories out of the way, because I think there's still a lot left on the board for some of the other categories. So, dud number one, sub-60 score, category seven.
Let's take Murdered Soul Suspect, a game where you're dead and investigating how you died. Published by Square Enix, I think it got something like 59. It was on PS4 and Xbox One.
I think it became a bit of a meme game. Look, I wanted Anthem. I couldn't get Anthem.
I don't think this category will win the draft either way, but fuck it, I don't want to end on Murdered Soul Suspect, so I'm picking it here. Thoughts, Matthew?
That's perfectly playable, probably a bit harsh, that low, putting it that low. That's probably like a 6 out of 10. If you pick it up for a 5, which most people do these days, do a quick rundown of the other things I had sub 60.
Absolutely.
Flower Sun Rain on the DS, 54.
Kind of deserves that, I think.
Yeah, well, it's a love it. It's a problem I might gain that.
Oh, yeah.
Ninja Gaiden III, 58.
Yeah, playable, you know.
It's pretty, yeah. In Yeah Jones, Staff of Kings, 55.
No comment.
Metal Gear Survive, 54, PC.
Oh, that's actually a better pick than Murdered Soul Suspect. Oh, well, I didn't pick it. So that's on me.
And people have come around on that game a little bit, I think.
I also thought Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint at 54 was a little harsh.
That is harsh because it still, it works. You know, I think they've also patched it quite a lot since that.
Yeah, and it's like mostly the same as Wildlands, which people didn't seem to have a problem with. That was one that I reviewed it on YouTube for RPS, and the angle of attack was, this isn't as shit as everyone else says it is, because it had been properly like dragged through the mud by, you know, the usual YouTube hate preachers who just said, all this game is is wall to wall microtransactions. And there's someone who played like 20 hours of that for review and didn't have that experience at all.
You know, I felt like someone should say, I need to defend this to the tune of 6 out of 10.
Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, Wildlands, people went nuts for that. That was like a big seller and yeah.
Yeah, it's sort of like MGS5, but not quite as good.
But yeah, I think Breakpoint definitely suffered from similar thing to Anthem, Suicide Squad. It was just, let's punish games of service just on principle. And by all means, if you want to do that, that's fine.
But it's, you know, it's childish.
It sounds dumb, but to me, Anthem really is the one that got away in this draft. Like I just, I really want, Anthem was pretty good. Like that robot combat and playing it in COD, that actually worked.
They got that feeling good, looking good. It was, the bones were there, Matthew. It just needed like a year for them to make some stuff for it, basically.
But I love that the one that got away was a sub 50, was a sub 60 game.
Yeah, which is ridiculous. But there's a lot that's above, there's a lot that's sub 80, but very few interesting things at sub 60. That's why it's a good category to have here.
And I've got fucking Murdered Soul Suspect.
Hey, I played it. I played it all the way through. I think I got a thousand gamers score on it.
What, Murdered Soul Suspect?
Yeah.
Do you have a lot going on at the time? Is this before you met Catherine?
No, I think I played that whatever Christmas it was down at my parents' house. Yeah, maybe Catherine wasn't there. Maybe we had Christmas.
It was like a Christmas apart for some reason.
Yeah, thousand G for Murdered Soul Suspect. I'm learning things about you all the time, Matthew.
I've got to get them sweet, sweet G's. What can I say?
What's next for you?
PS2 Gamecube Xbox Generation game. REZ is a really good one. You've got a really good one there.
Yeah, there's a lot of quite good stuff, but REZ felt like the only slam dunk I saw, probably. R-Type Final, that was the other one I saw.
I'm going to throw a little bone to the Nintendo fans with Luigi's Mansion at 78.
It was on my short list.
Again, I understand this score. It's quite a short game, and this was very much like an era of pocket money purchases, so things like that really, really mattered. I think now where games just feel more available through sales or other nefarious means or whatever, people can just enjoy Luigi's Mansion for the incredible production values, the huge amount of character in all the ghosts that you're clearing out of this mansion as Luigi.
I mean, it never really goes to places, and I feel like Luigi's Mansion 2 and 3 make more of a game of it and sort of grow that idea out in the way that it needed to. But if you could afford it, it was a real treat on GameCube. It looked amazing.
It just felt like just a very steep price for what it was. Just spent all this money on a GameCube, you know, where are you going to get this? Where are you going to play hours and hours and hours of Rogue Leader, you know?
Yeah, I mean, this does look fantastic still. Like I got the 3DS port of this and it's still a pretty good little game, I think. It is quite simple.
It is over quite quickly. But yes, it's like a neat little idea. You can see it's the, you know, it's bones of something for Nintendo to build upon.
Very similar to Smash Bros in that respect, I guess. Like they do the first pass at it. They get the the basics feeling good and then they layer stuff on top of it.
And that's why the second and third ones are so good. Like, you know, this sets the template. So I don't think it's a bad pick at all, Matthew.
This is, yeah.
I weighed up Red Dead Revolver for this, which I really like. But I just I don't really know how it sits in, you know, the general sort of mind, you know.
Manhunt, did you think about that?
Oh, fuck, that was on my long list.
76 Manhunt.
Oh, that was on my long list. And I just didn't transfer it across. I took the documents.
Yes.
Oh, that's what I love to hear. That's so funny.
Oh, that's really annoying. That is what I was going to go for. Because I think Manhunt's like genuinely brilliant.
Like, that's annoying. Anyway, Luigi's Mansion.
You can get it for free pick. Yeah, maybe. Do that instead.
Okay. That's still a good pick. That's really funny.
I knew you'd forgotten about Manhunt. I just had it. And the back of my head, I thought, he played the shit out of Manhunt.
He'll have some like, I know he thinks it's at least interesting. So, yeah. Okay.
Good stuff.
I would have picked that if I'd written it down again. Fucking useless. Anyway, whatever.
That's fine. Okay. All right.
So, Duff category number two, category eight, which is pre-2000, I'm going to take Pokemon Snap on N64.
Oh, that was my second one, in case you took Smash Brothers.
Got 77, but has endured as a favorite of people, to the point where they got a sequel made eventually, and then I think people kind of shrugged at the sequel, weren't that bothered? I'd actually think that the N64 aesthetic of this game, where you go around taking nice pictures of Pokemon on this very kind of like on rails way, as they kind of like pop out of different areas and you chuck fruit at them. Is it fruit you chuck at them, Matthew?
I've not played this for a few years now. I think it's fruit.
I think you chuck all kinds of shit at them, anything to get them to pay attention.
Yeah, so they behave in different ways based on how you interact with them. In some ways, I think it's the kind of like slightly cozier kind of game that has become pretty huge in recent years, but at the time there wasn't really much to compare it to. I think that's why it's like remained special to a lot of people.
Any thoughts on this, Peck Matthew?
I think it remains special to a lot of people who are just a couple of years younger than I am. This didn't ever appeal to me, the Pokemon thing. I watched Catherine play a fair amount of the Switch one and that didn't really do it for me either.
The best thing to ever have come of Pokemon Snap was the minigame that riffed on it in Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth where instead of Pokemon you're taking pictures of half naked perverts jumping out from bushes. That's the true legacy of Pokemon Snap. So thank you Pikachu for giving me Pervert Snap or whatever it's called in Infinite Wealth.
I definitely remember being 11 and reading the Nintendo official magazine at the time and envying people who had this, just thinking that looks like my dream game right now, as an SMTV watching Pokemon fan who was just 11 months from growing out of it forever. That was me with Pokemon Snap in 99 slash 2000. So yes.
What's your next pick, Matthew?
Cult Game. This is a battle between two of the greatest castle heart picks. There's Infinite Space with 75.
And there's The Centennial Case with 69. Neither of them mean anything in the grand scheme of things. Neither of them are vote winners.
Would you have taken Hotel Dusk for this if I didn't grab it?
Yeah, that was at the top of my list. I also had Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearers, which only got 66 because the motherfuckers like you scoring it down.
I didn't score it down. Oh yeah, I did, didn't I?
Yes.
Games TM, I think, gave it a 6 or a 5, I don't remember. But I don't know, man. I wouldn't say.
I don't think I was necessarily wrong there.
Let's tap with 70, the box-tapping masterpiece.
Sonic and the Black Knight, of course.
I'm in a Centennial Case kind of mood today, so I'm going to take the Centennial Case, the I think brilliant FMV detective game, which is like a trip through Japanese mystery writing tradition. Obviously, this is going to speak to me. They could not have made a game which is more to my taste if they tried.
This year is poorer for them not being a Centennial Case standing. That part of Square Enix seems to be dead now, but I like that they briefly went mad and spent loads of money on quite a substantial game. It's about 12 hours long, so it's like 12 hours of FMV sequences.
It's like filming six back to back movies and it's pretty high quality. I would comfortably watch this as a TV show. It's got only limited detective work in it, but that's fine.
I think it's just a really, really good hang. 69. Assists.
Idiots.
That's preposterously low. Yeah, I think it's actually quite a stacked category. There's a lot of ways you can approach it.
Matthew had some good, two good picks there, but there's stuff like, you could argue that OutRun 2 on Xbox is a kind of a cult game, certainly in the UK. Silent Hill Shattered Memories, 79 on Wii. I thought about that as well.
Yeah, there's a few different ones, but like, I think that's a very you pick. And in some ways, I think it's good to approach some parts of the draft as if you're just picking for yourself, because then it's more, more sincere, you know?
Yeah, I think so. And, you know, I still have, like, this Centennial Case often appears massively slashed in Steam sales. I really think it's worth picking up.
Pick up 4-2-8 Shibuya Scramble first, and then pick up the Centennial Case, and you will have a good time, I promise.
Well, good stuff, Matthew. We're approaching the end of the draft. I've got two picks left.
I think you also have two picks.
I have one.
Oh, you have one, okay. We definitely done this correctly? I think we have.
Yeah, we must have done. Yeah, that makes sense, because you've had two picks. Yeah, okay, sorry, can't do maths.
Okay, I can end on a high, which is good. Category 10, free pick. I'm going to take Dragon Age 2, Xbox 360, 79.
No longer the most maligned Dragon Age game. There is another one that has become more contentious somehow. All set in one city over 10 years, the city of Kirkwall, all-timer, cast of supporting characters, party members, who you form very complex friendships slash relationships with.
Some who are just friends, some who become lovers, some who become enemies. It was a game where they had 18 months to make it, and so to compensate for that, they focused on writing. The fact that they didn't have loads of assets was a way to force them to be creative.
As such, I think it's a game that's got an evergreen reputation. I think it's very much loved these days. At the time, it was hated for being so different to Dragon Age Origins.
Yes, there are still people who bang on about how, well, this game isn't like Dragon Age Origins. It's like, well, no, it's not, because that was 15 years ago, bro. So I got bad news for you, like, time has moved on and there have been two more Dragon Age games since then.
Anyway, I ranted about this in the summer. Dragon Age 2, love it. The story of Hawk and all of his unfortunate family members who get bumped off one by one.
And then he turns up again in Dragon Age Inquisition. So that is that pick, Matthew. What do you think?
A very new pick. Yeah, and I think actually one of the strengths of the Dragon Age games as individual picks, because they are so different and sort of contained. It's like a weird RPG series where I think you can play them and enjoy them.
Yes, there's like lore that builds up over all the games, but I think that does work. And it's very new as a free pick. I can't believe you got 79 with PC Gamer giving it.
What did PC Gamer give it?
94. Yeah, it was definitely a contentious one for the time. Who knows why EA wanted this made in 18 months?
Who can really weigh up what the hell was going on when that decision was made? But it was a long time ago, so hey ho. What's your final pick, Matthew?
So my final pick is free pick, for which I will take Wonderful 101, which got 78. Very underrated game, I think, because it's quite a radically new combat system in that you were controlling a swarm of 100 people and drawing symbols onto the screen to form them into different weapons. And it asked a lot of you, I think, if you read negative reviews of this game, it's really, really clear who put the time in to kind of get their head around it and who didn't.
Now, could you say it's unacceptable that a game requires you to put in that time to understand it in the first place? Perhaps, maybe those low scores were deserved because this game didn't on-board people in the right way. But I feel like it was so obvious that there was a lot of interesting stuff going on in this game.
And I just think it had an inherent quality to it that was so clear that I just kept chipping away at it until I got it. And that's where I think the 90 rated platinum action experiences, you know, it has everything that makes Kamiya Games fantastic. A great combat system, just the incredible excess, mad set pieces, huge bosses, ends with one of the greatest quicktime events in the history of games.
Just so different to Bayonetta and everything else he's made in terms of its Saturday morning cartoon tone. I was heartbroken that this game didn't get the adoration it deserved. That is sort of on the game, and maybe it's unacceptable that you probably have to watch a couple of YouTube videos to understand the combat system before you play.
But if you can't trust game critics to put in a bit of time and guide people through that experience and talk people to how they got there and how to take those steps to find that game, who else is going to do it? Yeah, I found those reviews fucking lazy. There was a lot of people to this day where I see their byline and I'm like, fuck that person because they didn't give this a fair go.
There's been a lot of airing of grievances with invisible critics on this. Critics who are unnamed.
It's all I've got.
It's all I've got.
I don't know. It's a bad habit of mine, I know, to like, rate people on their gaming opinions. But when that's your fucking job, I think you should be good at it.
The funniest one was last week when we talked about those lists of that fan theories that we hated. That was, we both just went weapons free on the same bad list features that we found. Never named what they were, but anyone who searches them will be able to figure out quite easily what we were talking about.
Yes. So I do enjoy it, Matthew, when you are a massive bitch. It's great fun.
So all good. Okay. Well, on that sour note, that ends your 10 picks.
Hooray. I like to end on a high.
I've got one pick left and that is category one last 10 years, 2014 onwards. I've got to take the mighty prey. First person immersive sim, 79 on PS4, criminally low.
Just an all-timer environment to explore in a game, mimic enemies who take on the properties of different objects around the world. And then in classic immersive sim fashion, you find ways to deal with them in terms of your weaponry and also gun emplacements, things like that. Different ways to deal with escalating types of mimics, bigger and bigger threats.
It has really emerged as a kind of cult game. I think in the sort of like absence of any bioshocks in recent years or things like that, they're very glossy, big immersive sim adjacent first person shooter games. Prey seems extremely special.
So I'm taking that for this category, Matthew, thoughts?
Yes, good contender for the one the critics got wrong this. I do have my problems with it. Like it isn't dishonored tier for me.
I don't find the later alien enemies as interesting. I think the mimics, absolutely all-timer, gold, the execution of them brilliantly done. But I think outside of the mimics, it's instantly a bit more unsteady for me and I don't like it when I have to actually fight with stuff.
But the environment, the learning the fiction of the world through its pickups and books and gleaning its history from the environmental storytelling, you know, absolutely arcane doing what they do best. Yeah, I'm not going to question this one. I swear that it stayed on the board this long.
It was one of the ones I wrote down before I started researching it because I remembered it as a bad score that will definitely come up in this draft.
Yeah, it ended up being the most slam dunk for this category. It was this or Jedi Fallen Order for me, which was again, 79 on PS4. I mean, fair play to them, it got that and then went on to sell like 12 million copies or something.
Like people really wanted a good Star Wars game at the time. I think that's low-balling it a bit on Jedi Fallen Order, even if Survivor's a lot better. But so that I did think about.
But yeah, it's I don't know, Prey is sort of like it's a real one of one in the like modern age of games, I think. So I, yeah, I'm really happy to end on that. It feels like a strong way to go out.
Yeah, absolutely. Interestingly, you mentioned Fallen Order because Jedi Survivor does get 79 on PC.
Oh, yeah. But I guess is it like 10 points higher on?
It's not.
Oh, you could have taken that, then.
Yeah, but it also felt like, I don't know, something felt a bit off about that. I know it got marked down because it's like the PC version is still quite fucked.
Oh, right. And the performance issues was just so bad.
And then it felt like we were getting too much into the realms of like, we can have Jedi Survivor, but you've got to make clear it's the PC version. And that felt messy to me.
Yeah, I did want to do this without any kind of port like nonsense.
We'll let that one go.
Yeah, that's all good. I didn't pick it anyway, so it's all good, Matthew. Okay, that was a fun draft.
That was good. Took some little bits from you. Probably wasn't quite as fiery and competitive as the last two drafts we did with three people, but good news.
We've got a four-person draft with Ashley Day and Dave Scarborough for the redraft of the PS2 coming in January, so you'll get a lot of fiery takes in that and petty shots from pathetic men at each other. So lots to look forward to there. In the meantime, Matthew, let's recap what we've got here and I'll tell people how to vote as well.
So, category one, last ten years, 2014 onwards, I've got Prey.
I've got The Evil Within.
Category two, PS2, Gamecube, Xbox generation game, I've got Rez.
I've got Luigi's Mansion.
Category three, 360 slash PS3 generation game, I've got Mirror's Edge.
Binary Domain.
Category four, PC game, I've got Euro Truck Simulator 2.
Kingdom Come Deliverance.
Category five, the critics probably fucked this award, I've got God Hand.
I've got Alien Isolation.
Category six, sub-seventy score, I've got Mad Max.
I've got Nier.
Category seven, sub-sixty score, I've got Murdered Soul Suspect.
I've got the brilliant Anthem.
Category eight, pre-2000, I've got Pokemon Snap.
I've got Super Smash Brothers.
Category nine, cult game, I've got my favourite game of all time, Hotel Dusk, Room 215.
I've got my second favourite game of all time, The Centennial Case.
Category ten, free pick, I've got Dragon Age 2.
And I've got the wonderful 101.
Cool. I will post that with their respective Metacritic scores when we put the image up. And so Matthew, do share your document with me after this so that I can chase you in Discord.
That'd be good. And if you can vote in the podcast Discord, which you can find in our Twitter account at BackpagePod, also our Blue Sky account at BackpagePod, there's a link there to join. We realise that is onerous, but it's still the best version of a vote we've got because people are leaving Twitter in drives and the poll function keeps breaking.
So go to the Announcements channel in there. It's at the very top. And then you can vote for myself or Matthew as the winner.
We'll discuss the winner in a future episode, no doubt. Matthew, that was a lot of fun.
That was fun. I think the real winners were all the great games we saved from Metacritic Oblivion.
Indeed. And there's still loads of great games I didn't pick. So like Lost Odyssey, Metro 2033.
How did that get under eight? That's such a great game. Mafia 2, Amped 3.
Yeah, for sub-70, I briefly considered Marvel's Avengers and then decided against it. Metroid Other M. I'm surprised you didn't take that, actually, Matthew.
That was in the mix for my free pick, but I just, that's a lift. I know people just won't go with me on that journey. They're just too stubborn.
Shit, there was that one cut scene I didn't like. And it's like, as I blow a hole in your skull with my fucking laser on.
Oh, good stuff. Matthew on great form tonight. Good stuff.
Star Wars Republic Commando, I thought about that. That's a very me pick, but all good. I don't have to talk about Star Wars all the time.
And Dynasty Warriors 3, the game that made me fail my A levels, that was 79. I almost picked that as well.
You failed it for a 79.
Do you have any that you didn't pick that you regret, Matthew, or you wanted to pick that you just didn't get around to? Stranglehold, I missed that one as well, actually.
I think I got most of them, you know, apart from the ones that I wanted that you nabbed. I can share in my Megadoc so you can see all the things that were in circulation at one point.
The dystopian results of, the grim results of six hours of research, that document, I'm sure.
We should have done sub 50 as well. That would have got really wild.
Oh God, no, it got bad enough.
Yûki Hayashi, can I take it?
I had exactly the same thing with Anthem, of like the clouds parting. I was like, there it is. Just like finding fucking like a future pop star in some club in Barnsley or something.
That's what Anthem felt like in this draft. My apologies to Barnsley. Yeah, car boot analogy probably more elegant actually.
So we'll just pretend that never happened. Okay, vote on Discord then. This is a fun draft.
We'll be back next week with our Alternative Game of the Year Awards, slash The Back Page Holiday Special. I'm looking forward to that. Matthew, you should be good.
Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and at MrBazzle underscore Pesto on Twitter.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both those platforms, the podcast Back Page Pod on both those platforms. That's all the stuff.
Wait, no, Patreon. You can support us on Patreon. Do you think this was good?
Was this good content? If you agree that it's good content, there are two tiers, a one-pound tier for a tip jar. Just to say thank you for the free feed.
Then there's a four-pound 50 XL tier for two additional podcasts a month. This month, that will get you two giant men fill a video games. Wait, fill an Xmas panto with video game characters.
How will that go? We don't know. We haven't recorded it yet.
Looking forward to that being a fucking nightmare, no doubt. That's coming very soon. Then the best movies and TV shows of the year.
That will come at the very end of the year as well. So that's what you get. Matthew, let's get out of here.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
