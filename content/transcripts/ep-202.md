Hey, this is Matthew, and a quick note before the episode begins. Throughout this episode, I refer to The Case of the Golden Idol as The Curse of the Golden Idol, because I'm an idiot. So apologies for that, and also please don't get frustrated trying to look for Curse of the Golden Idol on Steam.
It is Case of the Golden Idol. Thanks for listening, and enjoy the episode.
Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Whoa, that was a very energetic intro. I feel like you were faking that enjoyment.
Possibly, yes. Are you saying that my energy switched on a dime from our prior conversation about you being tired after the pub, but you had to talk to people, and it was knackering for you?
Yes, that's true. I was gonna say it was a bit like that episode of Father Ted with Eurovision, where there's the drunk guy, and the second he steps on stage, he's suddenly transformed into an amazing host.
Well, it's a bit like that. I imagine that whenever they do those noir-ish Ed Brubaker style stories about journalists or newsreaders on the edge, and they're off air, they're all drugs and chaos, and then on the air, they're really put together. I wish I had a more specific reference to mention there, but I don't, unfortunately.
So yes, that is me, I suppose, turning it on and off. But Matthew, I am excited about this episode. It's one of the What We've Been Playing we've been doing throughout the year.
I think they've gone down pretty well overall. Been a nice way to keep track of what's going on in games. I now have more than 10 games I can put in my top 10 list this year, which is good, as a result of doing these episodes.
So that's reassuring.
Yeah, mission success.
Indeed, big old chunk of stuff to discuss this week. So we've got Dragon Age The Veilguard, which Matthew has been playing. Thank you to Listener Kurt for sorting us out with the code for that one.
Much appreciated. I've got Call of Duty Black Ops 6 to discuss, the campaign more specifically. Matthew has the latest Mario & Luigi game to discuss, as well as Rise of the Golden Idol sequel to a game from a couple of years ago that he was a big fan of.
And I've also got Batman Arkham Shadow to discuss a little bit on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and a tiny bit on Apex Legends as well, which I know Matthew loves, a live service game update. So a beefy episode. We're going to kick off, I think, with Dragon Age The Veilguard, Matthew.
So this series, a really interesting one. We did originally want to do an episode on Dragon Age, but ran out of time, annoyingly, to get prepared for it. But probably the most contentious RPG series there is, because it's changed so much since its inception in 2009, entered as very much a kind of like classic RPG in the more, in the lineage of Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate.
And by Dragon Age 2, it transformed into more of a console-friendly action RPG kind of game, but still with a lot of variance in how you could affect the story. And then Dragon Age Inquisition was an attempt to increase the canvas again after Dragon Age 2 controversially boxed people into one little city, Kirkwall, over a 10-year period. Inquisition threw things wide open, larger maps, open world activities to go and do, some of a dubious quality in some cases but also some interesting stuff in there.
One thing that the series has always had that's common across every single entry is that they have very very good companion characters. And in this game, which seems to be even closer to the action sort of genre than ever, it seems like they've really doubled down on that companion side, Matthew. So why don't you pick us up from there?
Yeah, so given what you've just said, the kind of interesting thing or the thing I imagine most people are curious about, who haven't already dived in, is exactly what kind of game this is. You know, is it going to be a kind of trad Baldur's Gate alike? Is it going to be the open world thing that they're doing?
I would say it's very much continuing down the path of being a console friendly RPG, shifting more towards action RPG. It is not quite Inquisition open. It is, I'll tell you what it reminds me of.
It kind of reminds me of like Fable a bit, in that it's basically a load of like paths nested in like fabulous fantasy art. So you can see a huge fantasy world, but you're not like technically part of a huge fantasy world. And how much that illusion will kind of land for you, I think will kind of define like how you get on with this game.
Like whether you feel it's very penned in like the most sort of cynical take on it that I saw doing the rounds. And I don't know which review this came from, but someone described it as like being stuck in a load of Overwatch maps, which, you know, in terms of-
That is cynical. That is very cynical.
Yes, yes. I would say the thing it probably is like most like in- and the thing you wonder probably did have a big impact on this is God of War.
There is room for exploration, but you would never describe God of War as an open world game. The new God of War that is. In the way things loop back round and paths join up, it has a bit of that kind of Metroidvania or Dark Souls thing going on that God of War also had.
But I don't mind it. I think they whip you through, at least in the opening hours. I've only played about 12, 13 hours of this.
But they whip you through lots of different locations, places we haven't necessarily been in Dragon Age before. It introduces companions pretty quickly. With those companions come, again, slightly gear-gaty, metroid-y powers that then open up all those respective maps.
The different companions have a unique skill each, and those skills can be used to, you know, magic platforms across gaps or blow up certain walls or whatever. So I wouldn't say it feels very organic. It definitely feels like very gamey as a world.
But I don't think it's miles away from the direction some of Inquisition was going in anyway. Like, it feels kind of weirdly closer to Inquisition than I thought it would in terms of returning to areas and pushing deeper into them. And Inquisition, you know, I don't want to get too deep into it, but Inquisition had a lot of tricks where they could kind of like maintain authorial control over what you saw and when within those levels.
And this also has that, which, you know, is kind of important when they're telling stories and they've got all these fixed missions. So you know, most of what I played so far has been about like getting my head around that and just going, oh, okay, this is this is what Dragon Age is now, which I think there is that like bedding in period with every Dragon Age, because like you say, they change so much. So I don't know if I've necessarily had the time to kind of properly fall in love with the characters or the kind of combat system, you know, it's been like a, oh, oh, okay, they're doing this is kind of my vibe.
So maybe not the most helpful feedback. I can't give it a certified Castle Seal of approval or not.
Much thought after across the games industry.
Yes, yes, it's next to the Edge 10. But I just, I feel like there's been so much noise around this game. It's been pulled into all the kind of obnoxious conversations that so many games get pulled into online, that it's actually masked like necessarily what it is, or it hasn't been explained particularly well, you know, whether that's Bioware not wanting to talk explicitly about it, because they thought it would put people off, or if it's bad actors emphasising certain things because they do want to put you off, you know, you come out of it going, well, I don't really know what this is.
So it's been, you know, it's just been a bit of an eye opening sort of, okay, this is what we're dealing with. In terms of the companions, very briefly, I've only got four of them so far. I'd actually agree with Bertie's review over at Eurogamer in that it stacks quite twee characters up front, which gives you like, not bad impression, but like, oh, have they actually like, biffed some of the characters in this?
You know, it's like that dwarf Harding character from Inquisition. Apparently a fan favourite I didn't really give a fuck about. She's in the mix.
I'd forgotten about her until I started Inquisition again, actually. Wasn't really someone who stuck in my memory, Harding.
No, so that was, yeah, well, it's kind of that again. And a slightly stern detective with slightly wooden dialogue delivery. All right, which is a bit of a bad hang, especially for a detective, you know, I should be into.
And I can't remember her name. She's like a Veil, she's like a called a Veil jumper. She's like an elf who sort of hops between, you know, different dimensions and whatnot.
I've just got a guy who is like a, like an assassin who is possessed by a demon who has, he feels instantly like a step up and a bit more like classic Bioware in that he's really cool and you really like him, but he's also got this quite like fun villain in him. And I think Bioware, you know, not to talk about them as a massive rise, because I know the writing staff has changed massively over the years, but as a studio, I think they've always been on quite like firm ground when doing like lovable villains or, you know, villains that you're sort of attracted to or you kind of see the appeal of in the party, you know, like those sort of shades of grey characters. And this guy, Lycaris, feels like he's going to be quite a great, a good example of that.
So, yeah, I'm still kind of getting my head around it, sort of dipping into it, getting used to these characters, kind of getting my head around the world. You know, I'm going to plough on with it because I feel like from what other people have said, it's a game that you really have to kind of get into the second and third act to see, like, the strength of its, like, just branching decisions and whatnot. There hasn't really been a lot of that.
It's all been kind of laying the table for that.
Dragon Age has always done that, I think, though, as well. Like, it's, I don't think the first 10 hours of Inquisition were anything to write home about until-
Well, there was no Inquisition, for one.
Well, that's it. It's only really until you meet the Corypheus and then you get the Stronghold, whatever it's called. And then, from there, so the game really starts.
And I think even, like, 2 only really got super spicy once family members of Hawke started popping off, and Origins is the longest game of all time, so, not new to the series, that.
One thing I would say for it, I saw some people slagging it off in the wake of Bordersgate 3 going, oh, it's so bare bones, and is this even an RPG? Because it's, you know, really, the RPG elements it has are no more complicated than, say, God of War, you know, it's basically character, skill tree, customisation and equipment. But I think there's still something to be said for like a very console-friendly, console-accessible RPG.
You know, Bordersgate, as incredible as it is, I do find to be a very different experience. Quite, like, so much more complex, it requires such a sort of heavy lift from my brain to kind of keep up with it. It isn't a game I would put on for like, oh, let's just make an hour's progress in Bordersgate 3.
It's like, right, Saturday, I'm going to sit at my PC and I'm going to kind of commit to this. And I kind of want both flavors of game in my life. You know, I love that Larian have just gone all in on this super nerdy thing, but I also want a game which is designed to feel nice on a pad, which Bordersgate 3 simply isn't.
And this is. And so I definitely don't think this is redundant in the light of what's being done elsewhere, which is probably the most important takeaway so far.
Yeah, I think that's a good way of looking at it. I'm glad you've come out on the side of like, you know, let's sort of see what this is about. This has been caught at the intersection of every tedious fucking online games debate going.
Yeah. And it's quite tiring to watch, actually. The thing I was most curious about, and you alluded to this with the Overwatch maps, the one kind of like discourse where I was like, well, that's intriguing.
Do you think there are any telltale signs of this being retrofitted from a live service multiplayer something? Because I think that people think the map design and the different ways in which characters interact with the maps to unlock progress is maybe a scar of a previous version of the game. But like, do you think that that's something you have to go looking for if you're playing the game as opposed to something you would just know, a normal person would notice?
I don't think it's a thing a normal person would notice. I think that maybe the only, like, telltale signs of something else that once was is it feels like, for various reasons, when you go to tackle a mission, you are going to tackle that specific mission, it feels like you're going to a place to do a mission and it's recalibrated that area in some way for that mission, which feels sort of self-contained and you could kind of see the destiny in that. The idea of like a squad of three going to a place, it's dealing with a little task which takes 30 to 45 minutes rather than…
and this might just be where I'm at in the game, it doesn't ever feel like, oh, you're in a map and there are five different things you can go and do at any given time. It feels like you are committing to certain tasks. But if that was once its roots, I'd say it's been so buried.
It really feels to me very calibrated for a single player definitely, you know, in terms of like the combat, the level of control you have over your partners, the fact that there are like lots of puzzles and the environments. They have kind of hidden depths to them in terms of little side pockets you can discover and little platforming bits. You can kind of climb up and discover things.
And those aren't necessarily characteristics I associate with moving between arenas for fights, which is in this game. But it's not just that. I think you'd have to be a bit of a fucking know-it-all and be out for the game a bit to like really stick with that reading.
Yeah, the out for the game thing is interesting because to play, does it feel like it's particularly softened around the edges as a kind of like fantasy story experience so far? Dragon Age has traditionally been quite gnarly, but I was curious to see where you fell on this after 10 plus hours.
I would say like I'm not exactly missed the Dragon Age, so I'm not like tied to that world. Like to my ear, it doesn't sound like Worlds Apart from Inquisition.
Right, right.
Which is probably like the best way I can judge it. Definitely the fact that it gives you kind of softer, kinder, simpler characters up front, maybe gives you that, could give you that impression. You know, there's not a cynical voice in the mix to kind of like drag things down.
You've also, like, there's not really any kind of like, I don't really know what Dragon Age's equivalent of Paragon and Renegade is, if it ever really had them. I, you know, thinking back.
It kind of did. It kind of did in Inquisition. Like, you had options.
Like, the little symbols came up next to your choices that were like, I think, like, there was like a little blue one for when it was good, and red for when it was a little bit more.
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely no kind of good or evil here. I mean, there's, there's, like, tone, and tone can affect relationship with different characters. You know, like, if you're really kind of pissy, all the kind of soft companions at the start went like it.
There's never a kind of, shall we give this nug five carrots, or shall we burn the nug hive? You know, there's none of that. It doesn't seem to be that kind of game.
Thank you for putting it in terms I can understand.
Yeah, I just want to... The last special I did involved in Mug, so, you know, sort of give it a bit of colour.
Fresh in the brain, yeah.
Yeah, so, yeah, I don't know. Like, I want to play more. It's definitely, it's quite blockbuster-y.
It's quite fast moving. Despite being an entry which hinges on quite a lot of prior knowledge, it isn't just for the Dragon Age fans. You know, it feels like it's probably keeping it simple and a bit streamlined at the start in order to get newcomers on board.
Because it's been quite a while since the last one.
Yeah, ten years.
Yeah, so it's got, it's kind of, kind of have those problems. So, you know, if it does feel a little basic in terms of, hey, this guy's bad and we're good and we're trying to stop this guy, that's just establishing stakes. I think you can forgive it that.
But like I say, if it kind of gets to the end and it's still in this slightly, can't we all just be kind? That might feel a bit basic, but let's see where it goes.
Yeah, that's fair. I think that's a fair balanced way of looking at it. Interesting.
Yeah, I'll check in with you again in a month or so to see how it's going, Matthew, see if it's getting the blood pumping more as you get another 10 or so.
I'll burn so many Nug Hives.
They call him the Nug Killer. Yeah, okay. Good stuff, Matthew.
All right. In which case, once I get through Inquisition, I will finally play Veilguard. That might be a Christmas thing I try and attempt, but I don't want to get too...
Oh, that's a long Inquisition to get through.
It is a fucking long game. I just didn't want to pick up my save from 10 years ago and try and go from there. It just seemed like it was too much had been forgotten.
Yeah, I think so. I find that with all these games, you want to get in there and it asks you some questions at the start about what you did in Inquisition. So it's worth having answers, I think.
Yeah, exactly. Why didn't I just fucking finish Inquisition in 2014? I had nothing better to do.
I was so single in 2014 as well. I had nothing but time for RPGs. What was I doing?
You selected the red option.
I edited PC Gamer. That's what I did.
That's the ultimate red option.
Yeah, exactly. Okay. Good stuff, Matthew.
Then my first game is Call of Duty Black Ops 6. What business does Samuel Roberts have playing a Call of Duty game in 2024, you might be asking. It's a good question.
I've not played one since Black Ops 2, which I have a memory of Sam Worthington getting on horseback and then me turning it off. That's all I really remember about that. That was near the start of the game.
I felt like I got Call of Duty out of my system a bit with the Modern Warfare trilogy, which I think a lot of maybe people my age feel that way. If you're not primarily a Call of Duty multiplayer person, and I played a little bit of Warzone during the pandemic, thought it was very good for what it was. Obviously, I'm more of an Apex guy, but I could see why it was enticing to people.
I think maybe your experience with COD was probably quite similar. Maybe you've dipped in and out over the years. I played a little bit of COD World War II to experience the beach landing in that.
Yeah, I did Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare. I did the Xbox One generation.
That's good. You kept up on it a little bit more than me. I came back to this because this campaign did get a little bit of buzz from people.
I saw some people saying that this is maybe closer to that sort of buzz that the Modern Warfare Games gave you or something like Titanfall 2, where the campaign is held in very high esteem. And I thought, okay, well, I'll give it a go based on that. And I have actually been pleasantly surprised by how much I'm clicking with it.
I think that this game sets a stall out early when it's like, okay, it's the Gulf War, late 80s. You know, okay, well, that's pretty serious stuff. And then the first thing you do is basically send a little exploding RC remote control toy car to blow up some guys.
And I was like, okay, that's what this game is then. I felt like a statement of intent to be like up front of like, well, this is the real world, but also not really. So I was like, okay, well, I will take that as a kind of like invitation to experience the rest of the game.
And in a lot of ways, I think the opening is the most conventional Call of Duty bit I've played. Like it's a tunnel of dudes you blow up and then a guy gets shot in the head and then the story kind of kicks off. And I wasn't one over totally straight away, but I'm now more than halfway through it.
And I think it is pretty outstanding as a FPS campaign goes. I would say like it stops short of that really, really high level of like Titanfall 2 and stuff, where it definitely has a few big swing levels that get close to that, but don't quite touch it for me personally. However, I would say it exceeds my expectations and that every level has a little twist to make it something special and not something you've necessarily seen before in one of these games.
So there's a few examples of this. I would say that probably the most cited example is the one that I probably wouldn't spoil the most. It's, I heard about a control level basically, something very theme, very FBC adjacent.
If you play control, kind of like government officers and weird stuff going on. That level, that's like where it swings the hardest to get to that Titanfall 2 level, style of level, I would say, something very high concept. They're trying with it.
It's got like a grapple hook that is specific to that level. But it also has other stuff going on, that's all I'll say, that is a break in form from Call of Duty for sure in terms of tone and content. And I really respected it as a big swing.
I thought it mostly delivered, was very impressed by it.
Treaking.
Yeah, it's well worth playing. Like it's about, I think it's like the sixth level, before the fifth level, but it's a really long level. And I thought it was just bold.
It feels like, if Call of Duty has like a certain prescribed sort of like military flavor to it, this is feels to me like people who have sort of like sci-fi genre sensibilities, like pushing against the boundaries of that in terms of what they can achieve with it. And I really respected that as a kind of something a bit fresh and new, I thought it was a delight to play through. Yeah, I played through it yesterday evening, I thought it was really, really good.
My personal favorite thing that it does is it has a level that I would describe as kind of like, I don't want to over-hype it, but like a micro Metal Gear Solid V, the Phantom Pain open world thing, where basically you have like, you start from this SAS base, you meet all these British guys and they're like, oh, if you want us to help you Americans, you basically have to go do a bunch of jobs for us. And so you have three of these like SAM site things you have to blow up, these like big missile things that are like dotted around this desert. You have a bunch of areas of interest as well, that you don't necessarily know what they are, but you can go check them out.
And then you have like a massive armory of stuff at this SAS base you can choose from, vehicles you can go drive off and do all these things in the order you want. To basically go investigate how, you know, what's out there. And then like, the idea is that what you're doing will in some way inform what the next mission will be, which is going to be like this, basically this palace that you need to get to.
That was this nearby. And so, you've got the missiles on your radar. If you want to like do the bare minimum, go blow those up, go to the next mission, go for it.
Job's a gun. If you want to play it to its fullest potential, and I recommend you do, there's like a bunch of different bases around. So, in the game, you have this fictional organization called Pantheon, are basically what you're up against.
And they're like this classic Call of Duty, sort of transnational, not particularly kind of like, political, politically minded, but like, you know, slot into the real world. It's kind of like this vague kind of PMC faction, who have other stuff going on. They're out there, but so too are like, basically your normal enemy forces, historically accurate enemy forces you can go and fight as well.
And so you have a mix of like fighting Iraqi people out there, but also like fighting Pantheon out there. So you'll come across these like really hard bases that give you these like higher rewards if you are able to take them down and provide more of a challenge. But if you just clear out the Iraqis, you can finish the basic objectives and go from there.
However, the interesting twist is, there are also these little like one-off, there's like a downed airplane in the middle of the desert and these guys asking for help, help them out. And they'll give you an airplane that will come in and do airstrikes for you, where you can like guide the missiles down to the ground. And so if you do that first, you have that capability to draw upon for the rest of the mission.
So well worth doing. The same applies to, there's like a mortar out there. If you can go find the relevant people who control that, you can call in mortar fire or an airstrike, you can alternate between them to help you clear out the rest of the bases around this map.
So it's you and your pals going around in this little jeep, ticking off all of these areas of interest. There are even SAS scouts out there, so if you want a bit of sniper fire to help you clearing out a base, you go and meet the dude before you raid the base, they'll help you out, you can play it. Stealth or action if you really want to.
Stealth is so hard in these desert levels, but that is an option that's available to you. And this is basically like this micro open world with these extra abilities for you to unlock to help make it a little bit more fun, a little bit breezier, but also just give it that little extra spectacle. And I really thought that was a great mission.
And how it pays off in the next mission is that once you go into this, this palace, it's basically like everything you've been doing in the open world bit pays off in the next bit because it's like, right, remember that mortar and that airstrike you unlocked? Well, you've got that as you have to go clear out this absolutely rammed base of enemies, like big Saddam Hussein statue, loads and loads of dudes on these walls up, like shooting at you. And you're like, well, no problem, because guess what?
I went and like rescued, I've got airstrike guy on my side. So you're like, OK, well, I'll bomb this roof, I'll mortify these guys, and I'll storm this palace. It's just like probably like 15 minute max mission.
But it's like the payoff to everything you did in the last mission. You got like a helicopter guy who comes in, you take control of the helicopter turret, blasting all these guys, and then like control reverts back to you as you continue storming the palace. It's like this like little brace of missions, the big open world one that gives you all the fun tools for the next one.
And I thought it was fucking great. That was like a great two and a half hours of my Sunday morning, Matthew.
That's super interesting because I know they've kind of dabbled with this stuff in the last Modern Warfare 3, the remake of one or whatever, the redo, the reboot. The reason its campaign was so panned is it basically took chunks of of like Warzone and served them up as levels going, well, you know, the sandbox you love from Warzone. Well, it's just like that.
But in a narrative setting, except it was, you know, it felt like nothing had been done to like tailor it to the single player experience. This sounds like they've tapped into the freedom of exploration and all the equipment and the potential, but they've done it in like a bespoke space, which makes all the difference.
Yeah, yeah. So I actually consulted Back Page consultant, COD head Jeremy Peel for this, for knowledge on this. And this is the first time they've done anything open in this vein, apparently.
It's genuinely like a little bit of innovation for the series. Apparently, Raven software like the, can be depended upon for a little bit pushing the COD formula a little bit further in each of their games. I would say it feels like a no expense to spared campaign to me.
Like it very, that's not even like, I've described some of the high concept missions there. Like, all I'll say is the Bill Clinton one has like a tiny bit of like scripted social stealth in there that is quite delightful, like highly scripted. Like there's only three ways it can go.
But, really fun idea for a level. And it seems like every level I've played has got some kind of twist in there. Jeremy tells me I've still got two high concept levels to go and like more delights ahead.
I'm really impressed by it. And like, you realize now that these kinds of like 10, 8 to 10 hours scripted thrill kind of campaigns, you know, few and far between. COD is kind of like one of the last series really doing it.
In this vein, this year, I enjoyed Space Marine 2 the same way. But if you haven't played a COD for a long time, this is on Game Pass, just go, you can just go play through the campaign if you want to. On Xbox, you can install the campaign separately.
Yes, please. Yes, yes, I did.
Yeah, exactly. And like, I'm just so far just really impressed by it. Keen to see where the rest of it goes, but it's been well worth playing based on what I've played so far anyway.
What have you made from what you've played, Matthew?
Well, one, there's a really handsome dude who looks like Robert Redford.
Oh yeah, Adler is it? Is that the guy?
Yeah. He turns up at the start. I was like, fucking hell, it's Robert Redford.
Well, why did they get him in this? And I don't think it is based on him.
But spy games era Robert Redford ass character.
Yeah, that was good. I am curious about what the rights are with putting real life historic figures in these levels. So do you think they signed off on it?
Do you think Clinton's like go for it? I don't know.
I imagine that it's public domain because he was a politician and he's just not copyrighted or something.
It's just a guy who really looks like Clinton. Yeah, so I've only played the first three levels. So I haven't hit any of the really, really juicy stuff.
I must admit I struggled a little bit with there was a stealthy shooting a guy on a boat in a church thing. It hasn't got precise stealth systems, but I don't think that is like what it's going for.
I thought the stealth was pretty like, like I didn't get caught in that session.
I thought it was fine, rather than this is joyful and I could see myself doing this again and again.
Do you think that's deliberate though, because it's like COD, so it has to be like mainstream stealth?
Yeah, well the thing is I quite liked the absolutely on a leash scripted stealth of the earlier games. They were the only people who did that, you know. I know it got a bit hackneyed and everyone got a bit sick of it.
You know, you shoot the guy on the left, I'll shoot the guy on the right. But I am like an idiot who enjoys that shit. I would have happily had one of those moments rather than an attempt at a genuine stealth level.
But that's really my only observation I have so far. I miss the opulence of the scripted COD campaign. And I hope there is a bit of that in there.
Because everything that you've said and what I've heard other people said hints towards where it innovates is that it is a bit more freeform. And that's cool and definitely interesting in the shooter space. But I like a little bit of that, just wow, the expense on these bespoke animations up close and all that kind of shit.
So I want a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B.
Yeah, well I would say that where it succeeds is it does give you both. That's the only open world bit I've played so far. And then the Palace bit afterwards is pure scripted COD stuff.
And so I think it is delivering on both fronts simultaneously. What I really like is I feel like there's a master level designer. I feel like the senior person who's making the calls on what these levels should be is my guy.
I've just got that feeling. Yeah I just think they see games the way I like to experience games. They go, right, well this level does this.
These levels are going to be a pair and this will be like the slower open world level with still lots of exciting moments in it but it will pay off in this level. This is a really high concept punt level. This is going to be a more conventional level but a really good one.
This is going to be the level that's got Bill Clinton in it, a little bit of like some like really fun scripted stuff for you to go and like enjoy as a player. If you want to do it two more times to see every route you can do that too. I just feel like the creative management is very strong on the level design front.
I know what you mean and I get that. I think it's the presence of that person in Titanfall 2, who was probably that person in Modern Warfare also, that you really sense of like someone here really knows what they're doing.
Yeah. Is it like, is it Mohammed Alavi? Was that the guy who the Titanfall 2 guy?
Yeah, I think so. I think he's the Gillies in the Mist chap.
Yeah. I did actually like, again, hit up Jeremy for like some steer on who the COD person might be, and he did tell me who was it. Dan Von Drac is apparently like the master raven dude, who certainly Jeremy's got a lot of respect for.
But in any case, I just think, I don't know, I'm glad someone's out there doing this. Because if you're experienced with COD this year is like mine, you install it on Game Pass, you blast through this campaign. That's like an all-timer Game Pass edition to me.
Like you just get this COD campaign, you enjoy it. It doesn't take up too much of your time. It shows you many delights and fireworks along the way.
So far, so good, Matthew. And I'm quite fond of the weird little house that you go to in between levels. And the comical stealing money from levels bit also takes any kind of like political edge off to me.
Because while you're in the level, don't forget to steal a bunch of cash from Saddam Hussein's basement or whatever.
I think that was the other thing that did jump out at me. Just the few I've played is that there's a kind of cartoonishness about it, which seems to divorce it from reality, where these games definitely run into trouble when they skew too close to reality or take real life atrocities as sandpits for their dumb levels. Where this is a little bit like, it's Robert Redford guy and Bill Clinton.
The building blocks are recognisably real. What they've built with them is definitely silly.
Yeah, it's wild how far back this story goes as well, because this starts with Call of Duty World at War. This is in the Treyarch sort of chain of pod games that, like, you know, Reznov in Rush, in Stalingrad, in World of War. Yeah, links to, is in Black Ops.
Yeah. And then links to Alec Mason, who is apparently dead by this point in Black Ops, but in Black Ops also has Woods, who's the guy in the wheelchair and this. And then, but it's crazy because I was thinking about it.
And that's like a 16 year story, which is like almost a length of time of like between like Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid V. Like that's how long this has been going on. That's quite wild, but I will say if you've played none of those games, you'll find to play this.
There's a tiny bit of background, but you won't be lost. It's pretty straightforward what's going on. And Lou Diamond Phillips is in it for some reason.
But yeah, so far so good, Matthew. Yeah, it's good. I sort of, I did not think I would like even vaguely connect with this game this year, but it was very easy to sync most of my weekend into it.
So all good. And now we change to the equally geopolitical Mario & Luigi Brothership. So Matthew, you've been playing this one.
It seems like it's got a slightly more lukewarm reaction. It's definitely got some really good reviews, but not everyone has been besotted with this and going, you must play it now. And it's also brought up some questions of, have we had too many Mario RPGs back to back?
But what did you make of it?
Yeah. I mean, for people who haven't been paying attention, this is the third Mario RPG in basically 12 months. Super Mario RPG, the remake, Paper Mario, Thousand Year Door remake, and then this sort of second strand of the Mario RPG.
If you've got Paper Mario, which is traditionally the kind of home console games, you have Mario & Luigi, who have traditionally well always been on handheld and made great hay from those platforms, starting with Superstar Saga on the Game Boy Advance, Brothers in Time on DS, Bowser's Inside Story, and it goes on. They make quite a lot of these games by developer AlphaDream, who shut in 2019 or 2018, and so as kind of custodians of this series, I think a lot of people thought Mario & Luigi was dead. So it's back, which I think is exciting that it is back.
I was curious what Mario & Luigi would mean in a home console setting, given that it's always had this kind of divide and quite clear identity as a slightly like bittier, smaller feeling RPG. Quite elegantly tailored to handheld and handheld playing habits. So like short bursts of activity rather than, oh, I'm going to sit down and play seven straight hours of Mario & Luigi.
I don't think anyone ever said that, but maybe there is more of that mentality with a home console game. This, it turns out, is made by a choir who made Octopath Traveler kind of in collaboration with Nintendo. I always find these relationships a little bit dubious to kind of pass any kind of judgment on until you really know the balance of it.
And is it just like a third party making Nintendo's plans or is it, you know, are they, you know, let off the leash to do their thing? So hopefully interviews will cast a light on this. But whatever it is, I think it's a pretty good impression of a traditional alpha dream Mario & Luigi game.
The thing that kind of defines those is that you always have Mario & Luigi, there are lots of puzzles which hinge around the two of them doing things in tandem. The combat system is, I would say, a more cartoony, playful version of what you had in Paper Mario in that it's driven by quick time events, so hitting buttons to make your moves more powerful when they land, but also when you're defending from enemies, it's a bit more involved because there are loads of quite complex animations and you have to work out whether to use your hammer or to jump and whether they're going to attack Mario & Luigi and it's all about reading these little visual tells. It's a very characterful combat system which always worked really well with the sprite art on the handheld games and I think is the thing, they've most successfully transferred here.
As long as the game is serving you up new enemy types, you're kind of learning all these like weird things that are coming at you and some of the attacks as the game goes on become so elaborate that it's almost like playing a mini game. Like the stone hidden under three cups, like enemies will vanish under things and they'll shift around and you have to work out where the enemies are before they attack you or there's ones where like a little shy guy waves a little semaphore flag saying which brother he's got to attack and you've got to kind of read the flags and then remember it and parrot it back and all this kind of stuff. So all that is great, you know, the kind of nuts and bolts of what I associate it with.
Where I think it comes a bit more unstuck and they've sort of struggled is working out what a kind of a bigger Mario & Luigi game looks like on a home console. And what they've kind of landed on is this idea that you're in this ocean of islands and you're sailing between these different islands. Each island has kind of a little adventure on it when you land.
You do maybe spend an hour, an hour and a half there to kind of solve its local problem. And then that island is tethered to your main base, which is this this sort of ship. It's not actually called the brother ship.
It's the ship shape. These little islands, they have the feel of something which is quite handheld friendly, because each one is like a small little adventure. And that I could see being in a DS game or something.
That feels very familiar and sensible to me. But I think because it's a home console game, they've made it quite long compared to the others. It's about 40 hours long compared to some of the others.
They feel more like 20, so it feels like much bigger. They've put in a lot of the busy work of RPGs, I think, to justify that extra size. So there's a lot of site or justify it.
And, you know, they're the reason it is bigger. There are loads of side quests and things. And the to and from of the traditional home RPG, it doesn't really suit these, like, bittier islands that they've built.
I think my big problem with this game is that everything's really fun the first time you discover it, but then every other time you go back there, you just hate it because you've already been there. There wasn't much there to begin there with. You've done it, you've beaten the enemies, and you're just, like, retracing your steps.
You're literally going over, like, what is often just a linear corridor to get to a new thing that they've added for a side quest. And almost half the game is quite a bad hang because of that. You're just going back to these places which I don't think were ever built to sustain like a big adventure.
And I don't think that's a mistake the earlier games would've made. They had a little bit of backtracking, but they were far more kind of forward momentum. They were just like, let's just get through it, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
And yeah, this one here, it's never bad, but I feel like there's a really great Mario & Luigi in there, drowning in all this kind of excess fat around the outside. As long as you are making new progress and discovering things for the first time, I think it really works. But the more you engage with other stuff, which is optional I should say, it is up to you, so maybe it's on me that it feels this way, but I've got a bit of a completionist brain and I want to do it, especially when I'm reviewing something.
Too much of it didn't really land for me, so I came out of it with quite mixed feelings. Good it's back, it's still got the juice, like where it counts, but it's too much juice. And now I've got a heartburn.
Powerful analogy there. Yeah, I don't really understand why they structured it that way, but yeah, I can't say I ever really enjoy that sort of like, I don't understand why they don't let you just zip back to where the side quests are in these areas rather than making you go through it. Is it just to artificially prolong how long it is?
Or that if they always had the idea that you were going to be going back to these places, they shouldn't have to, like most of them are very linear, like most of them are like it's one path from where you land to like, that each island has like a big plug socket you're trying to reach.
Right, right.
And so going back over that old ground is very rarely interesting. And also by that point, you know, it doesn't refresh the enemies there. They're the same enemies who are there to begin with.
So now they're really easy to kill because you've probably leveled up quite a lot. But you still have to go through the rigmarole of fighting them, which is a little bit more drawn out because of this comedy back and forth, which is it's kind of a combat system that is like an absolute delight. The first time you fight everything, maybe like three or four times.
But after that, you just have nothing but contempt for them. The problem is some of these things, you're going to be fighting like 50 times. By the fiftieth time you've seen a load of boos do their little attack animation, you're like, oh, just fuck these boos.
I don't want to be doing this. I've proven that I know everything they're going to do and we're just eating up time here.
But I think that's a problem with that quick time event system in this and Paper Mario. It's a system which just outstays its welcome once you've mastered it. It's too involved for you just to sort of button mash through like in any other turn-based RPG.
And that involvement is what energises it for the opening stretch. But cleaning up in this game is just really, really hard work and it's just a bummer. Because there's plenty of good stuff here.
Each island is fun to discover, there's great music, there's some amazing boss fights, there's some quite funny… Luigi has this power to imagine special takedowns for the bosses. So most of the bosses have a quite complicated mini-game embedded in them that you have to be able to do to weaken the boss further.
And all that stuff I really like. I don't know, I just feel like Alpha Dream had a better kind of grip on this and wouldn't have made these mistakes. It does feel like another team having a go at it and not quite understanding the mix of ingredients quite right.
Okay, interesting. Right, well that's good to know. I do agree that that is the perils of the QTE-based system.
Yeah. In some ways you kind of want it to be like, well you've done this enough times so you can just sort of like mash one button and then they're instantly dead. Or like the game just auto resolves the combat, which I know some RPGs have done as well.
Yeah, and that's because like a dragon, Infinite Wealth and Yakuza Like a Dragon, they obviously have a lot of this quick time stuff. And when you are suitably overleveled, they're just like instantly just smash them with one attack and it will kill everyone. And that's kind of what this needs.
But then I guess they also fear that you'll, I don't know, grind for XP and it's not a difficult game. So the idea of people gaming it that way and farming for XP is, I don't really understand the mindset of anyone who treats this like it's a serious endeavor. Because it isn't, and Mario RPGs, they're like baby's first RPG, like all of them.
And the idea that you can talk about them in a serious RPG way is, I find daft.
Yeah, I don't think that's unfair. Yeah, it's just a shame that they couldn't have optimized the experience to be as good as it can be. In some ways, I think it makes it like a weird one to buy when I've already got the Thousand Year Door to play.
Oh no, that's the RPG of choice this year.
Well, that's interesting. Because this is the new one they made. Okay, well, an odd little exponent then of the dog days of the Switch's final years.
But they're not really dog days, they're plenty of good stuff. But still, it's just sort of like, yeah, it just sounds fundamentally flawed to me. But yeah, thank you for putting the time in anyway, Matthew.
Well, that's all right.
I got paid to do it.
Oh, that's good. Well, that's ideal, isn't it? Okay, well, my next game then is Batman Arkham Shadow, an exclusive game made for the Oculus Quest 3.
I think you're meant to call it MetaQuest now, but I'm never doing that. Sorry.
Nice. Stick it to the man.
Yeah, by citing an old corporate name instead. So yes, this is the standalone VR headset basically. So you can also play this on the 3S, I believe it's called, which is a slightly better priced version of it, 299, something like that.
It has a lot of the functionality of the Quest 3, which by the way is still one of my favorite hardware purchasers of the last few years. It's like the fact that you can just have your living room in full color in the background, where you're browsing this is really good, like the display is so crisp. I've been told that the experience of watching Netflix on this in 1080p, but within the headset itself is really good.
It's a nice way to have a home cinema feel. So I would consider doing that for a film. I've thought about doing that the last week or so.
Just there with the fucking Speak No Evil. Having the worst fucking time of your life.
Threads in that, yeah. I'm blown up. I totally unnecessary.
Yeah, so it's had an interesting little life so far. They had a game called Asgard's Wrath 2 out last year, which was like the first killer app they made. Not specifically for it.
This is different in the sense that they've only made it for the Quest 3. You can't play the Quest 2, which you could with Asgard's Wrath. And so it is sort of like an integral, like a sequel to Arkham Origins of sorts in the Batman Arkham Games by Rocksteady and Origins by Warner Brothers Montreal, I believe, made by Camouflage, the studio that developed that game Republique.
It was like a Kickstarter game years ago. But more notably in recent years, Iron Man VR. They made that and then they were acquired by Facebook.
And so now they've made this exclusively for this platform. That's the background there. And so what it is is a second Batman Arkham VR game.
It's a little bit different to that game. It tries to transfer pretty much all of the different Arkham bits and pieces to this game, which seems to be set in one night or about that, where the city is under siege by a naff Batman villain called the Rat King. Really a character I know nothing about.
Did not appear in fucking Tom King's run of the character, or Scott Snyder's, like, the two defining runs of the character in the last few years. So God knows which comics this character's been in. I'm not, like, too into, like, the Rat King sort of element of it, but I would say, like, as a fundamental translation of, like, the free-flow combat and the Predator, what's it called, like, the Predator stealth stuff in it, and also just the basics of, like, gliding around, that sort of thing, and, like, the aesthetic of the Arkham games, like, the very specific color palette of the city and things like that.
It's a pretty good translation of it. It's not an open-world game by any means. It seems to be completely linear from what I've played so far.
There's a few optional bits and pieces to find around the environment when you're there. Weirdly, you can scan these phone numbers that are on the walls, and then pick up the phone and then call them, which you'd never do if you're, like, scanning, like, pubs in, like, the UK, I would say. Like, that's, like, a recipe for disaster.
Why would Batman just call randos from graffiti?
It's a bit weird, isn't it?
What does he hope to achieve? What does Steve think he's gonna get at the end of the line?
Well, that's it. So, it's a bit like, I think...
It's your dad. I'm actually alive.
So, it's like, there's one for, like, Jonathan Crane's, kind of like, when he used to work at the university, Gotham. He's like, well, I've now moved to Blackgate Prison, so you can no longer participate in my human trials.
Very droll.
Well, there's a little bit of, like, world building in there, but some of them are just like, it's like some bloke you've called up, and it's like, all right, this is Steve, or whatever, and you're like, okay, I don't really know why we're doing this. But I assumed it's because you can hold, like, the phone using the controller to your head, so you can hear a phone call in that novel, No More Heroes. Oh, my hot girlfriend's calling me to tell me about the next guy I've got a kill thing, which is what happens in No More Heroes in 2008.
And, you know, in VR, I guess it's still novel in VR in 2024. So, they've done an interesting job of translating little bits and pieces of it. They've like, it's all here, but like, you do it all in VR.
And it's quite intensive. You can play it in a few different ways. It's like a low intensity version of it, but I've picked like the middle ground that's like, I'm not as physically fit as Batman, but I'd like to have a punching it guy, which I feel like is basically the setting I've picked.
And so you get this thing where like, it's all in first person, obviously, but to your side, you'll see like a blue flash and that would be like your classic counter in an Arkham game. And to counter you just basically while holding a controller, put your arm up and then like Batman will auto like counter the attack. It's basically your equivalent of like tapping Y as you would in the Arkham games.
And then like, and then from there, you just punch with your left and right hands and then like the game will recognize that. It will try and like box you into these tiny little combos of like, oh, you have to punch right and then left and then right. And I find a couple of the UI prompts a bit confusing for that.
They don't always just go like left, right. Sometimes it's like a circle with a dot heading off in a different direction. I'm like, well, what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Some of the UI I don't quite get. And sometimes I'm failing combos. But in general, it means you're like punching guys.
I unlock this ability that lets you, if you punch harder with your fist, then the game will recognize that and it will be like an extra hard punch that the game will recognize. And I like that because I'm a pretty beefy dude. I've got big arms.
I like to like throw punches in mid air. That's quite fun to me. And then in the Predator stealth bits, I find this a tiny bit less elegant, but it's still well done.
You've got the classic Batman grappling hook, which you can aim in first person, tap the A button and then zoom up there. That is really cool to do in VR. Like, don't get me wrong, really cool.
You can do the hanging from a gargoyle thing like you would do in those games. Really good.
Oh, that would make me puke. I'd just be puking all over my living room.
Well, that's the thing. A lot of this depends on your stomach for this stuff. I find it's actually perfectly fine and really nicely done.
It helps that the visuals are just so crisp as well. You're like, it feels like you're looking at sort of early PS4 visuals, but in VR. So like the resolution is super high.
So that's the kind of trade-off of it. Like you got Jim Gordon, you can see like fucking lattice effect on his hair when he's close up. But also it's actually like, I think considering you've basically got like a mobile phones graphics set straps to your head.
Pretty impressive. So yeah. And so when you do like an attack, like when you jump out from a grate and like grab a guy, right?
You have to like literally put your two hands forward as if you're grabbing him. And then do this choke motion like left, right, left to like take them out. And that's like a bit silly to do, I would say, over and over again.
Yeah.
But if you get caught, you throw a smoke bomb down and you're like zap out of there. And like I understand it's got, I'm about two hours into it so far. I think it's like a 10 hour game, maybe like a bit longer with some optional stuff.
I understand it's got like some scarecrow and Joker related stuff in there as well. So intrigued about that. But pretty good.
It's like out of the box. This is what a lot of people would buy a VR headset for kind of game.
How much of a sweat do you break out in? Is it like enough to get you going? Does it feel like a workout?
It does, I would say, yeah. I did it after eating some KFC last night. And that was like...
Just like Batman.
Yeah, exactly. I felt very Batman-esque.
Alfred, get me the singer burger.
Sweating popcorn chicken out of my paws, basically. Not ideal.
Just leaning on the Batmobile with one hand. Just the other hand up going, guys, thugs, just give me two minutes.
I timed it. I timed it last night. I played for 30 minutes and then had a 45 minute break before I played it again.
It's like reasonably intensive, but pretty good. I don't know if, I think by now you probably know if VR is for you or not, and whether you'd go all in to play something like this. I'm the kind of person who's curious enough about new gaming tech that I would.
You might not be, but if you've thought about buying a Quest, I would say it's probably going to be on the list of five things you should play on it, from what I've played so far.
I was surprised that you were saying how kind of Arkhamy it is. Does it have that good hoodlum banter?
Yeah, it does. It has like, it's the bat style. You can sort of listen in.
Oh yeah, you can put Detective Vision on, Detective Modo. That works really well actually in first-person as you might expect. Yeah, and it's got some puzzles for you to solve as well.
It's not got loads of riddler bullshit, but there's like, you have to figure out the codes, like a safe code from these clues around this apartment. Quite simple stuff, but like a nice application of Detective Mode, so curious to see if that deepens as we get deeper into it. And then yeah, it's even had an interesting thing where it like asked me a question.
It went, okay, so from the clues you've got so far, which of these three locations should we go to next? And then like, I think the game can fail you twice and you got to pick the right one based on the clues you've had. Again, not that hard, but an interesting little wrinkle.
And quite a lot of first person narrative bits that play out.
How would you say it? Like, I think it's obviously what you've described is very different to the one Rocksteady made themselves. But like, how do they compare, you know, like, is there any area where it's like weaker or that much stronger or?
I would say that it's sort of like, I would say that if I was being really picky, I wish there was a little bit more simulation in the first person combat. In the sense that like, I would just, I think because some of the movies that Batman does in those games are just so kind of like exotic and like ridiculous, like just bounding around. So I'm not saying that like, I want to be like doing somersaults around my living room or anything.
But it's also that thing of like, the game will, the game does sort of like just puts you, it wants you to do certain moves at certain times. Like it'll ask you to slam two fists down on a guy and then it'll do the right kind of animation for it. It will do like, you'll do a certain hand motion and then he'll like kick someone, but it's the game asking you to do it.
I almost wish there was a bit more of a simulated like, I punch this guy in the stomach, then I punch him in the face and then like, the game kind of corresponds accordingly. I realize that's probably a bit more involved than they want to do with a game like this, but-
You just want like a Batman brutalization sim, where you just go around just absolutely shattering individual guys as Batman.
Well, that is the appeal, isn't it? I kind of almost want it to be like-
Who's the bad that he takes over from, who's like bad Batman? He comes in when his back's broken.
John Paul Valley.
Yeah, you've got more that energy.
Asriel, that's a great deep cut, that is. Enjoyed that 90s Batman reference. Yeah, well, I just sort of-
Well, I think it's just because I could almost see a version of that game working really well, because the Quest 3 is so responsive in terms of like where your hands are and stuff. I'll seem to do very specific motions and reach to certain places in order to get a Batarang and things like that. It's very precise on the whole.
I think they could do it. But yeah, I would like to play the game where you grab someone by the scruff and then just punch them in the chin or whatever, and they respond accordingly. Because I've played boxing games in Quest that do that.
So again, that's not really something that Rocksteady were doing to answer your question. But I think it feels like it's getting 75 percent of the way to what that experience was, which is fine for a VR game. But I almost wish it could just go a little bit harder on the simulation side of things.
I also wonder if it will get to the point where you'd have the really complex encounters of like, you know, because you get like 20 guys like baying for blood in like some of those Arkham Knight challenge rooms, for example. I don't know if it will ever get to that point. And so far, all of the Predator sections have been like three or four dudes at max.
And I wonder if it will get to that really complex level, which is what I'd like to see. But I don't know.
That is a bit of a VR thing. Like even Half-Life Alyx, it never gets that much more complicated because there's just a limit to what a human can do, I guess. But likewise, I played a preview of that behemoth ages ago, which is the one being made by the team who did the quite good Walking Dead VR game, Saints of Sinners.
And that had a similar thing. The combat was really, really involved and simulated and interesting. But there was something about there only being like three zombies in the room, where you were like, you were being constantly reminded that you were in VR and that there is a limit to it.
Like, it can't give you the scale, probably for good reason, but you'd like, I don't know, you almost want to have that up front just to show that you can't do it. You almost want them to give you 20 hoodlums, so you get your ass handed to you and you go, okay, I appreciate we're not going to be doing that again. Just so you can do like I told you so, like tutorial.
Yeah, I can see that. It may be that it gets to that point and it does also have challenge rooms like the Arkham Games did. In general, I think the thing that I think it does as well as the Arkham Games is, it made me realize that there is an Arkham aesthetic in my head.
I'm like, oh yeah, it's just like a bunch of streets with some trash in it and some fires going or whatever. But this has that kind of like orangey, grimy Gotham City palette. It's actually like very nicely rendered and made me realize, oh no, there was a very specific look to Arkham City and Arkham Knight.
I've just not played them in so long that I've forgotten what it is that they look like. And so I really salute them for capturing that. I also find it, I played the Quest port of Iron Man VR, and I find it way more successful than that in general as a VR experience.
I think it's just the production values and like the, just like, just as an undertaking, I feel like they've really treated this like it's their big blockbuster for this system. And they've pushed it hard. And I just, I salute them for, again, burning buckets of cash on VR and making cool shit for it.
Because they've, I think they've achieved that here. Even if I think it's like not necessary, like an all-time great, it's probably like an eight out of ten on the VR game scale, you know?
Yeah. That's good enough.
Yeah, I'm enjoying it. It's well worth it so far. So yeah, good stuff, Matthew.
We come to your last game of the episode, Rise of the Golden Idol.
Yes. So first of all, thank you very much to name them at PlayStack, who sent us some early codes for this. I've already played and finished this, Samuel.
Wow.
So I'm actually squeezing about 13 hours of this on top of Dragon Age.
That's why Matthew didn't get into Dragon Age as much as he wanted. He was playing and then the truth comes out.
If I have the choice between chipping away at something I know is going to be 80 hours and playing like a sequel to a detective game that I really liked, I'm obviously going to go with the detective game. So yeah, this is Rise of the Golden Idol by Colour Grey Games, published by PlayStack. Sequel to Curse of the Golden Idol, which was notable when it came out for being, I'd say, the first, maybe the only, of the Obra Dina likes, in that Obra Dina came out and I thought, oh great, we're going to have this Golden Age of Detective games, and then they must be very difficult to make.
But this team, two Latvian brothers, I think, made Curse of the Golden Idol. The way it works and the way this game works is that each level presents you with an animated diorama. You click on it to collect all the nouns, all the kind of building blocks, all the kind of words associated with the scene, and then you try and solve what's going on by putting those words into gaps in a kind of an account.
So where Obradin did it with, you know, you just assigned this person died by bleeding because of a spear or whatever, this has slightly more involved in counts. So it's like when so-and-so entered the blah, he saw a blah and it made him blah and so he blared. And your job is to deduce the blars by looking at the scene, by parsing all the information which can come to you in all kinds of ways.
So when you click on characters, you often get to see their possessions, you might get a driver's license or a letter in their pocket which has some information. And really the game is about just cross-referencing all this information it gives you via various means to deduce what's going on. It's changed a little bit between Curse and Rise.
Rise, like it's streamlined it a little bit. So there's less kind of clicking on individual items to collect individual words. When you click on things, it kind of harvests all the important words for you.
So that's a little faster moving. It also allows you to… It's kind of hard to explain.
I don't want to get too lost in the weeds of like interface because it's never a very exciting thing to talk about. But where before you'd switch between the crime scene and the solving screen, here the solving screens are presented in smaller windows so they can kind of coexist. You can kind of drag and drop them around it so you can still see the thing you're looking at while you're also looking at these words.
So you can kind of create a workspace, I guess, which is like more pleasing for you, which is probably like the big mechanical development. But I think it's one that works really well, just because you can just see a lot more information. Along with the kind of main account of what happened in the scene, you get sort of smaller asides which you also have to solve.
They might just be, can you name everyone in the scene? So it'll just be a wall of pictures and you have to assign names to them. But sometimes it'll be cracking this code or other things which seem sort of extra or to the side of the murder, but actually by getting your thoughts in order, they often help you kind of clarify your thinking on the main crime.
It's quite elegantly done. You just have to trust me on this. That stuff works really well.
The other big shift apart from this streamlining is where the original was set kind of in the 1700s and you know, was about this Golden Idol causing havoc as it kind of passed between members of this family back in history. This is sort of set in the 70s, has much more of like a paranoid sort of thriller vibe. Like it's kind of tapping into all the president's men and other films like that that escape my mind at this point.
Uh, something Condor, what's that one called?
Uh, like, yeah, it's like that. Three Days at Condor, that's it. What's the one with Warren Beatty?
Is it the Parallax View? Yeah, yeah. Things like, so it's kind of, like it instantly shifts.
And that's kind of interesting because, you know, it gives you vastly different scenarios, vastly different technology. It's not just sort of Georgians or go away. It's, pardon me for my lack of historical specificity.
Whatever was going on in the original, they're all like poisoning and stabbing each other. In the 70s, we had a stuff going on. It also tells like a much bigger story, a much kind of weirder story.
It doesn't always hinge on murder. Like a surprising number of the cases aren't deaths. There are always things, bad things have happened, but there's a lot of like accidents and like one of them, you've just got to work out like who punched someone in the eye rather than murdered anyone.
And because of that, I just think it gives them like a lot more variety of scenarios to kind of play with and just getting out of like straight murders lets them mix it up in some really fun ways. And I don't really want to spoil what the scenarios are, like the thrill of this is stepping into each scene and going like what the fuck is going on here? Because they're often like pretty wild because either someone's dead and everyone's losing their minds or accidents have happened or it's all kicked off in some ways.
There's something involving a television show which when I first saw it you were just like oh my god what is all this? This is mad. You know that's something I liked about the original game and Obra Dinn as well is that sense of sudden overload but then you gradually kind of unpick it all.
I just thought this was really really good. You know I really like the original. I thought it was a really interesting way of doing that very deduction heavy Obra Dinn style game but the fact that it did it with like static scenes rather than a very complex 3D model of a ship that you walked around you know they'd obviously adjusted it and scaled it to something that they could do and deliver.
This game steps up the production values a little bit. Like everything's a little bit more animated. Character models are incredibly ugly in a deliberate way.
Like this is a game about like really ugly people getting murdered often. It's like not since like Professor Layton have there been this many like ugly people in one story. Just real fucking potato faced horrors.
But and they keep coming back. The story it paints with them over several years. All these people keep coming back and re-entering the story in weird ways.
And I really like that overarching mystery. And you know, it took Lucas Pope, whatever, it felt like ten years or something to put together Obra Dinn and make that all work. And you know, I think the thing I like the most about Golden Idol is that we had this one a couple of years ago, the first game.
They then came out with two quite substantial bits of DLC. We've now got this in 2024. They've announced what sounds basically like another game's worth of DLC for this game.
Like another, like four chunks of DLC with like three or four cases each. You know, however, whatever they've, all the decisions they've made have allowed them to make a lot of their game. And it's a really pleasing fun game, particularly in, in like the crime space.
When you get something regularly, you know, you begin to think of like TV shows that you get, you know, like your Midsommar's Murders, it becomes like comfort food. And this game like has already kind of hit that volume of releases. These people just seem good for it.
They seem very reliable. They're going to make loads of this game. They've made loads of this game.
I really enjoy it whenever it turns up. The scenarios and the writing and the logic gets a little bit more sophisticated with every chunk of DLC or new release they make. It's got a really like positive arc to it in terms of like, it's just getting better and better.
I just thought this was absolutely fantastic. I felt terrible to devour it so quickly, but I couldn't resist it. I was just like, nom, nom, nom, just chewing through each scenario.
Because the scenarios are self-contained, it's really, really snackable, but also has this overarching cleverness to it and the way it all comes together. I guarantee you'll go into the final act going, how the fuck is this going to connect with the first act? You will have no idea.
And then the way it does it, I just thought was so smart. Really, just what a thing, what a winner they've got.
Damn, sounds good. I mean, I guess a really basic question to ask, because I think a lot of people did play this game. Certainly in our Discord, people are quite vocal about checking this out.
I think probably off the back of your recommendation, Matthew. Probably. It's become a bit of a hit in its own right as well.
It's on Netflix. It's, if you've got like an Android phone, you can just download it. It's on Game Pass as well, so you can play it on there.
And yeah, it's got like 6,000 reviews on Steam, which seems pretty solid to me for the type of game it is. It's like, do you go straight into this if you didn't play the first one? Or do you need some kind of grounding of the first one to appreciate this one?
Not really. I'd say it's quite self-contained. Like, there's lots of winks to it.
I was worried that it was going to hinge on you having the knowledge of the first one, and that I wouldn't have remembered it all too clearly. It's definitely more rewarding if you have played the first. The first is like ten hours or whatever.
I think you should play it all. The difficulty curve starts afresh. It assumes you haven't played.
By the end, it's reasonably fierce. I actually thought the first game, I thought the DLC was probably harder than anything in this game. I don't know if that means the DLC will be harder for this game too, if that's where they plan to put the really gnarly stuff.
I thought the DLC for the first game was actually pretty brutal in places. I got really, really stuck on it. And I didn't with this.
I don't know if that answers the question. I think it does.
Yeah, I think it does.
I think, like, basically, yeah. Just get in on Golden Idol, like, it's an interesting thing. Yeah, you definitely come out of it, like, there are some loose ends.
I didn't know about the DLC when I played it, and then they announced the DLC, and I was like, oh, fantastic. That's obviously going to deal with X, Y and Z, because there's some quite big things that happen in the plot which aren't resolved. So I'm quite pleased that they are.
It's interesting as well, I looked at the end credits, and they work with some podcasters who make murder mystery and escape room podcasts. What?
So you can, as in, the murder mystery is solved while you listen to the podcast?
Well I think there's a podcast where it's like, they seem to be a husband and wife, and they kind of devise murder mysteries for the other person to solve, like, in the episode.
Fuck. Episode 300?
Yeah.
I do want to kill off Matthew in episode 300, by the way. I've still figured out.
Yeah, the death of Matthew Castle, the curse of Golden Matthew.
Only Detective Jeremy Peele can solve the mystery.
Yeah, but I just thought it was interesting, the credits seem to imply that they've turned to people with, like, mystery-making experience to help them get the volume of mysteries, I guess.
Interesting.
Yeah, it is a really interesting one. I'm just, like, all in on this now. A bit like, it really does remind me of, like, what I had with Layton, where I'd be like, I can't wait for next year's Layton.
Or, like, The Room. That's another thing, you know, like, oh, I hope they make another room game. It's kind of got that sort of flavour to it, of like, yeah, I'll play, like, ten of these.
It's the Slow Horses video games.
So, by that logic, the fourth one will be the weakest one. Yes! So, I hear, I've not seen it yet.
No, definitely. And it'll have people go weaving in it. Who isn't potato-faced?
I will say, in the history of this podcast, it's been the best time we've ever been perceived is when Naaman set over the keys for this originally, and like, for the first one in 2022, and was like, I've listened to podcasts, Matthew Castle will like this, and then he did, and here you are playing the sequel. That was nice, so.
Yeah, I mean, what are you here for then? Bellatro, like, PlayStack, they've got the juice.
Yeah, and that, the game that's like half-life, but a survival game, that was, that's been pretty big as well, hasn't it? I can't remember what it's called now, but yeah.
It's not about poker or murders, ain't it?
He's out, yeah. No jokers, I'm done. Okay, good stuff, Matthew.
So, my final two games then. I thought I'd give you an update on how FF7 Rebirth's going.
Yeah, I'm excited about this. Yeah.
So, when Dragon Age came out, I realized I've already got an RPG I started and got 10 hours into and abandoned in like March or April, and that game was FF7 Rebirth, and didn't totally click with me straight away. I didn't really get far enough of into it to see some of the really good stuff in this, and it turns out the really good stuff in this is the game kind of like going out of its way, all singing, all dancing to delight you in like several moments throughout. One of those moments is when you go to Junun and you do the parade in Junun.
Which you had alluded to being like a good moment, but then that was where it finally like clicked with me, because I've done like the lower Junun part of the game. That's a bad hang that area. You've got to get out of the shade and into the sun.
I think that's the kind of like the key thing with Junun. Upper Junun, absolutely fine. And then some cool stuff that transpires on the boat afterwards as well.
So I've done that section too, and I've done the Costa del Sol section that follows that as well, which had a lot of, I would say, like busy work in it, but nonetheless was a good hang. And put the, I think, frankly irresponsible choice in the hands of players to decide which swimsuit, Tifa and Aerith wear. Like that is a power that should not be given to the people who enjoy Final Fantasy games.
That is too much power, frankly. But yeah, enjoying it. I think it's actually like clicked a little bit more.
And I think that's just because I've tuned into its frequency more, which is a bit like, I'm a bit less wary of like, what is the fan service angle of this? Like, what sort of Kingdom Hearts-y nonsense is the story going to do? And a bit more like, oh, this just wants me to enjoy the ride.
You know, this is actually like, this is not a game that's like, the main thing in its back pocket is nostalgia. This is a thing where it's like, well, actually, we just want you to have a great time along the way. And here's some like really cool stuff that will happen at each of these locations to make you feel that way.
Locations that might even have just been a bit nondescript, your memory of this game. Or like places you just don't really remember that well. And I think, yeah, I think that's kind of, that's why I think it's clicked.
But go on, Matthew, go on.
Yeah, no, I was going to say that's, I think one of the things I like about it the most is it, it takes something which actually is like a couple of screens you maybe spend five minutes at. And yes, it bloats it up into maybe like a two or three hour thing. But whichever bit of Final Fantasy 7 you do remember, it's all treated as lavishly, you know?
And it's given like an amazing music cover or a weird boss fight is added, or they've laced it with loads of minigames of like varying quality, definitely. How did you get on with fucking Dog Rocket League?
Oh, that was the worst minigame I've maybe ever played, by the way. Yes, that's my raw, like how I felt about it opinion. Like some of them are all right, for sure.
Like I've actually, I've started to understand the secret with Queen's Gambit, not Queen's Gambit, that's the fucking Netflix show, but then you say Queen's Blood. Is that it's like, you've just basically got to get the, a one deck that works for you, then just keep spanning it over and over again, really? Or like, and then, and then I think you start to enjoy it more and throw fewer tantrums at it.
So that was the, the trajectory I've been on with that. It does sort of force you to play it as well, Queen's Blood, it doesn't really allow you to opt out of it, I will say, so you sort of have to, at least so far in the game, it does make you go a little bit of the way with it. But yeah, the mini games are like, well, well done on having a go.
That's kind of how I feel about them. Like they come and go, and like, yes, I didn't think that Red 13 Rocket League was good, but certainly there was an attempt. And I have noted that, you know?
So yeah. Yeah.
But anyway, I just, I don't know. I think they take the idea of like, Costa del Sol and they turn it into like, quite a luxury place to look around. And that's the fun of it.
I'll be really intrigued what you make of, you've got to get to, oh, the fuck is this called? What's the big arcade party place? The flying place.
Gold Saucer.
Gold Saucer. Cause that's like another huge dose of all that kind of bullshit.
That's where the mini-games really come out. But I'm glad that it's kind of getting there. I was, you know, while I don't think we're quite on the same page yet, I was dreading another Tears of the Kingdoms style kind of rupture come Game of the Year time.
So, you know, we can, you're putting in the hours and I appreciate that.
Yeah, we can, these wounds can heal, certainly. And yeah, I will absolutely persist until it's done. I will try and finish it before the Game of the Year episode.
So I can have a, if it goes in, I can have a take on it. But certainly at this point, which I imagine is probably slightly under halfway in the game, something like that, I would guess, because I know it's a chunky old beast of a game. The word maximalist, I like.
I've seen it used a few times with games this year, and I think it's a good word to describe what this is. It is the maximalist vision of what a Final Fantasy VII remake could and should be. So good stuff, Matthew.
Last thing I was going to mention very briefly.
Finally, this is what I've been waiting for all episodes.
This is going to be super brief, but Apex Legends, right? They've done, so it's been around since 2019, this game, and they've done a mode now where it's like the WoW Classic mode, where you can play the game as it was in 2019. What that means is, except me and my little posse of people I play with, Phil and Tom, we were quite excited about this because some of the more recent maps we're not into, some we do like from Apex Legends, but Broken Moon, we described to think is like basically ash.
It's like a whole map of ash, and then there's one purple bit on it, and then that's about it. There's nothing really of note in that map. The more recent one, the city one they've done, that's slightly more interesting, but this lets you to go back to the original map as it was, and it really is like the FPS devs making their first Battle Royale map.
It's like, here's a COD4 map over here, here's a COD4 map over here, here's a bit that's just brown, there's some mud, and that's a whole area, and you're like, oh, this isn't actually that interesting, and you realize that quite quickly they understood what was good about their game, and started deleting bits of the map and dropping new stuff in there. It's quite interesting as a little experiment, but our hope is that they cycle around to the pandemic glory days and get to the train going again, which is obviously my dream as someone who plays this game. I love the train that used to be in World's Edge in Apex Legends was an all-time great bit of multiplayer map design that was taken out because it was too fun, I believe.
It was taken out because it was too fun.
It was because apparently too many people were dropping on it. They always tend to like nuke bits that are like, this city is drawing too many people, so you have to knock it down a little bit and so there's fewer areas to land on. They just don't want people dropping in one air of the map too much.
People always landed on the train, so train had hot loot on it. Guess what? It's fun to land on a train.
That's just a good interaction. So I hope they'll cycle back around to that. But I thought it was really interesting because to me, it may be said that they're acknowledging that any live service game is going to struggle to bring in new players after a while.
But maybe you get to the point where you're like, well, maybe we can bring back in some old players by running a nostalgia focus mode, which feels like the play here. But yeah, I think it was a little bit of a care for what you wish for thing, where you realize the first iteration of this was not the best version of this. It really had ups and downs, but it definitely wasn't the best at the start.
But just to give you an update from what's out there, man. I know you're not a really live service guy, but little dispatchers from the battlefields of Apex Legends.
Well, thank you very much. I'm glad to know about the train. I don't often think about the train, but when I think here, Apex Legends, I always think, oh, I wonder if the train's in it.
Sam likes the train. That's all I really know about it.
Again, I just like being perceived on that level, so I appreciate it, pal. So that's what's going on with that. But yeah, lots playing in the run-up to the end of the year.
The top 10 list is taking shape, Matthew. I don't know about you, but it's sort of like, what's going on there has been narrowed down a little bit.
Yeah, I'm still working it out, because I'll be honest, as it currently is, I don't know if Dragon Age quite has the stuff.
Yeah.
And I'm like, and that could be like 70 hours. Like, am I going to play this for 70 hours to discover that it really doesn't have the stuff? Or that's a tricky one.
But I also want to get through it because I can't restart these things. I have it's like, it's like dining in one or not at all with a game of that size. So, you know, should I be using this time to sniff out something a little weirder?
I don't know.
Play Slitterhead. I've got Slitterhead downloaded.
That's the thing. I mean, you know, the right people think it's good.
You know, if we don't go to bat for a PS3 ass game, who will, Matthew? It's us or no one. I liked it.
But, you know, it's us and not many other people, you know?
Yeah, it's tough. It's tough.
Yeah. So that'll be an interesting little journey. We've got just over a month until we record the episode.
But yeah, it's definitely been a good year for games. Like no doubt I've had stuff to play all year. Still got loads I want to play from this year.
But yeah, that was a fun little episode, Matthew. I think we covered a lot of ground in a short space of time, relatively speaking. Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzle underscore pesto on Twitter, if you're still there. And on Blue Sky, I'm MrBazzle pesto no underscore.
The Blue Sky has got the stuff now, Matthew. It feels like it's stuck.
It has. I haven't followed enough people, so my feed is like dying. Yeah.
Well, you know, most of my main people from Twitter are over there now.
I just can't find anyone. I can't remember anyone.
I don't know. I find it's a nice opportunity to jump off from like some people I didn't want to follow and have muted for 10 years. Sorry.
Big Bilbo Baggins. Like less than half of you, half as much of you deserve energy to that. Plenty of people I like, of course.
But yeah. Okay. Good.
Well, that's where Matthew is. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on all those platforms.
Back PagePod on Twitter and BlueSky too. And there's also a Discord which is linked in the profile of both of those. And of course, patreon.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com Yeah, that was a good episode that.
It did make me wonder, should we do MGS2 again as well? Because you don't remember it, and you can actually play it this time? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah?
Maybe in a while, give us a few months though.
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, well thank you so much for listening, and goodbye.
