Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, the podcast turns five years old this week, so that happened. This has been going somehow for all that time. And our returning guest is Phil Savage, Global Editor-in-Chief of PC Gamer.
As we discuss every other part of making a games magazine across the five years of this podcast, we've roped Phil back in to discuss the very last part of a games magazine, the thing that gave this podcast its name, The Back Page. So I'm going to call this the podcast that eats itself basically, because after this point, there's no way left to go really. It's really very much an Ouroboros sort of diagram over those five years.
But delighted to have you back, Phil. How's it going? You good?
I'm good, yeah. And happy fifth anniversary to you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Did you get us gifts?
No.
Oh, so rude. I can't believe it.
Well, it's definitely a parallel reality, Phil, where we made a podcast at some point. Like, I think, you know, you and I, not to say that's my preference, Matthew, just merely floating the idea of a...
I can't believe you're bringing this conflict in for the anniversary.
For the anniversary. Yeah, it's unnecessarily dramatic. Just back in the day, you and I, you know, we recorded the PC Gamer podcast.
We were sort of the two mainstays of that podcast, and everyone else was sort of orbiting it. You know, I think it could have happened, but had you not been, you know, driving yourself mad making video game websites. So I did want to ask, how is running a website in 2025 going?
It's good at the moment in that we have things to talk about and write about. It could be the emerging popularity of games like ARC Raiders and steady performance of something like Battlefield kind of makes it quite an exciting time, just because it always feels good when there's that kind of emerging breakout game and a lot of the team are playing it and they're kind of bouncing ideas around and they're always talking about it. And that's when it's sort of the most exciting.
I definitely prefer that to when like the highest traffic articles are always about executives who have things to say about AI, which is when you look at the numbers and think, oh god, is this just PC gaming now? Luckily, it isn't.
I'm glad to hear that. And yeah, I can see why ARC Raiders to give you plenty of material. We'll talk a little bit about it on this podcast as well, actually, because we have a regular trio sort of co-op thing going on, myself, you and Tom Hatfield.
So we do that probably like once a week, but sometimes twice a week and taking us to some interesting places.
We made the mistake of trying to get a second session in this week. And based on the performance, the first one was definitely the highlight, the second.
Yeah. So we had a game of ARC Raiders. Like when we played on Friday, we just made so much headway, got so much stuff, had so many good runs.
We were like, man, we're having such a great experience with this game, so much progression. And the next night, we lost literally all of it and only extracted once and all of our stuff was gone. And we really just learned our lesson, really.
You should always space these things out by at least a few days. So yes, we're in Game of the Year, sort of like time on the calendar. I wanted to know how the Game of the Year chat for PC Gamer was going.
I think it's been a good year for games or a bad year?
I think it's been unexpected in a lot of ways. If you'd asked me at the start of the year, it seems that we were primed for Monster Hunter Wilds to be like the biggest thing. I remember Gamescom the year before, the lines for that game were like around the conference hall multiple times.
People would turn up and queue to play that game and then get back in the queue and play it and then leave. And then, I mean, it had a lot of performance issues when it released, but I remember I bounced off it pretty hard as well. And so actually it was a lot of weird and unexpected things that took over.
I think you get a sense of it with like, we've just had the golden joysticks, like Claire Obscure sweeping the awards, which I imagine it will be set to continue to do throughout the industry. I think that just sort of shows there's a hunger for that kind of maybe lower production value but like passionate kind of experience, more so than what we're getting out of bigger studios and like the big franchises at the moment.
That's interesting. I mean, Monster Hunter Worlds right now is 18 pounds on Amazon in the Black Friday sale, which tells its own story. Yeah, it tells its own story of how the year went really.
Yeah, it's interesting. You played a bunch of Claire Obscure. I was curious how you felt about that sort of domination, because I know you weren't like 100 percent of the game.
Yeah, I think I came out of it thinking this is a very good Final Fantasy X. And I've not played one of those for a while, so I'm very happy with this. And then you see some of the discussion around it, and people are really into it.
Like they're really into the characters, the story, like the effusive praise. And I'm sat here thinking it was good. But I have like these handful of problems, especially with like the third act and what it does with the story there.
That kind of stopped me from loving it unconditionally. And so seeing all that praise around, it does alienate me a bit, which is it's a weird thing where it's not the game's fault. And I'm happy to let people enjoy things.
But part of me is also like, I just don't feel like I'm on the train riding along with everybody to all of the awards in the world.
Welcome to me and Astro Bot in 2024.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's a classic case of the audience has spoiled the game ever so slightly, I think, which it does happen.
It feels so bad to say.
Yeah, I mean, I know that all they're doing is enjoying the game, but they've, like, over engaged with it. And it's sort of over indexing for, like, the year. Like, it would make you feel like there were no other games this year to just sort of look at the responses got.
But it's, yeah, and it's nothing to do with the game, but it got me thinking about how, you know, Final Fantasy X obviously is like a key inspiration for it. When I played that game, that game just sat in my head for, like, festering for, like, 10 years. And I sort of thought about it.
And it's sort of like, I couldn't really make it my whole personality because no one in my life would engage with me about it. But in the online age, something like Claire Obscure, it's quite a strange game in some ways. It's like there's a lot of, like, themes of grief in it, and the sort of vibes of it are very particular.
And so the idea of this quite peculiar game becoming like, you know, going from being an underdog to immediately becoming the big game of the year. I feel like Final Fantasy X, like, it should have been allowed to sit in the heads of the audience who sort of like played it for like 10 years before anyone is allowed to make memes about it. But now we sort of like fast forward to the end point of like, oh god, now it's like, it only came out about seven months ago and I'm already sick of hearing about it.
Just another way the online age is destroying all of our minds.
Yes, it's true. I've just got to log off really. Yeah, so, I mean, the other thing that, you know, we had you on the podcast to talk about besides Destiny, of course, was the Yakuza games.
And, you know, you are an authority on the subject. And I'd love to know if your rankings have changed since you first appeared on the podcast almost five years ago. I think you put Yakuza 5 as your number one.
I think that's right.
That is correct. I went back and checked. So I did a top five and I put Yakuza 5 at the top.
I guess that was my wild card controversial opinion. It's one I think I can still justify. It's, I mean, it's demonstrably the wrong answer.
Yakuza 0 is probably all things considered the more competent game. But yeah, that's the one that I feel I can justify just because of how out there it is. But it is interesting comparing the reasons I love that with the reasons I really didn't get on board with this year's Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.
Oh, which if I look at what's good about the series, it really is how opposed certain elements are, like how central to it working, the fact that they play it incredibly straight when it comes to the main story, like it's melodramatic, it's a crime drama first. Yakuza 0's big hook is about a land deal that different gangs are vying for control over. So it starts with that small scale gritty premise, and then the absurdity hangs around the sides and it acts as a nice counterbalance to that.
Whereas Pirate Yakuza is just all from the off. Its opening is Majima has an anesia and is rescued by a child who has a pet tiger, but he doesn't know he's a tiger. He thinks he's just a large cat.
And through a series of events gets embroiled in, I guess, a community of people who cosplay as swashbuckling pirates, but also sometimes are just swashbuckling pirates. Yeah. And it's, it's sort of, there's no, there's nothing to ground you in the world.
It's, it's just from the off absurdity. And then the side stories are absurd. Every, every bit of it is just, we're going to try and wring comedy out of this in a way that I, I found quite a slog by the end of it.
You don't think they were sort of justifying that because it is Majima and, you know, he is, you know, that is just a, that is what a Majima game would look like. It's just like the most unhinged bit of, of that, of that whole universe.
I mean, to an extent they are, but they're also, they're very weird in how they treat Majima. I mean, to an extent, like, a lot of his appearances, especially in, in more modern stuff, especially in something like Yakuza Kiwami 1, he's kind of been flanderized to the point of absurdity already. Which can be hard to deal with.
It's really weird in Kiwami 1 because you have like the original Majima cut scenes where he's just a brutal gang leader who mistreats his crew. And is absurdly violent. And then the silly man wearing the traffic cone on his head, who just wants to beat you into being a better person and fighter.
And in this one, it feels like I don't think they really have a good idea of how to do a Majima game, which is why they gave him amnesia. Because I guess they've decided that like him as a character doesn't work as a protagonist for some reason. Which I think I don't necessarily agree with in the first place.
I think you could do it. I just think they went about it a very strange way. I would have to say like, it was fine during Infinite Wealth as a setting, but during Pirate of the Yakuza, I found Hawaii increasingly charmless as a location.
Right, right. I was definitely done with Hawaii by the end of Infinite Wealth. I loved Infinite Wealth, but I just found it like, well, it's the difference between an urban entertainment zone and a very clean-cut holiday resort, and it's just very sterile, very bleached and clean.
I think it worked for the purpose of what Infinite Wealth was doing.
Yeah.
But I don't begrudge that team for getting the most out of these huge cities that they build.
Yeah.
Absolutely reuse it. I just think Hawaii just didn't land with me in the way that past locations have.
Well, at some point we may do a re-ranking of these games, Phil, because they have released something like five of them since we recorded that episode. They are basically annual. So yes, that might be something we do either around the time that Kiwami 3 comes out or the next mainline entry comes out.
So we'll definitely hit you up when that happens because, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely hoping with Kiwami 3 that like the changes they're making to things like the combat system, which was always a bit awkward in Yakuza 3 proper, and this Dark Tides side story thing they've got going on. Hopefully, that'll kick it up the rankings because there are a lot of interesting things in that. It's just it has a place as the most skippable of the mainline games for sure.
So it'll be nice to see if they can make that feel more essential as a package.
Well, at the time we're recording this, Phil, as mentioned, we're reeling from a catastrophic series of ARC Raiders losses. And my question is, is ARC Raiders good, Phil? It's a big question.
I think it might be.
I think it is, yeah.
Yeah, it was interesting. Like the first extraction shooter we played together was the Marathon beta test thing. I might have even been an alpha test.
I can't remember exactly how it was badged, but I did not really understand that game and I didn't really understand the genre. And it really felt like, you know, we'd go on a run, we'd get some loot and we'd either extract or we'd get in a big fight and get killed. And it felt like, it was like if we were playing Apex and losing felt just as bad as it did, but winning didn't feel anywhere near as good as it did, because ultimately you just got like a handful of junk and maybe one weapon that you'd probably lose in the future.
And so I didn't, it just didn't feel like there was the same, you know, emotional peaks and troughs that you'd get with different multiplayer genres. And I didn't get why people were into it. And I tried to get Tarkov fans to explain and bless them, they struggled.
But now playing ARC Raiders, it is, I think that, I mean, part of the problem with Marathon, I think, was just because it was a beta, they didn't have all like the quest stuff and that kind of progression system baked in yet. There was little hints of it, but it wasn't central to the experience because it was just a test. And I think that's the thing that I've really hooked onto in ARC Raiders is like, you know, we've sat and talked about, okay, what are we doing next?
Like, let's go to this map because maybe we can get this and this and make some progress towards this quest. And it has quite this nice smooth progression through quests and upgrades and things that kind of give you lots of little goals that feel quite satisfying to work towards in a way where actually winning or losing a specific round or I guess extracting or losing everything is less important because it's about that kind of steady persistent progression that you're making kind of back at base.
Yeah, that's absolutely true. I think that a few things that are good about the way that objectives work in the game. It's really good at giving you breadcrumb trails of things to do.
So this key unlocks this door and it might be in a place that you've not been to before. But you can very easily identify it on a map of one of the locations where you have to go to unlock this door and you know you'll get something for doing it. And it's also really good at ticking off objectives if one player does it out of the three in your party.
So you're all making progression simultaneously. And that is really satisfying as well because it just lowers the bar in terms of what you need to do to just keep feeling like you're moving through the game. And yeah, it definitely felt like Marathon was like a series of dead ends really.
Where it'd be like we'd lose a fight, we'd lose everything and then we'd start again from the bottom. And yeah, the progression here is very well thought out. And I will admit that at first I was a bit worried that the maps were a bit too flat to make the game interesting.
Like I'm not big into that. I don't mind the spaceport level, but what's the damn one? That's pretty boring.
Damn basher grounds.
I mean, that is just like a... Here is kind of a drab, a sort of foresty shooter level.
Yeah, exactly. Where it's like, is it Blue Gate? That map is so good.
It's like, is it one they've rolled out fairly recently, but just much more atmospheric?
Blue Gate was the last map of the launch set. And then there's a new map they've added that's in like this science center or something that I can't remember the name of.
Something like that.
Yeah, Blue Gate is really cool. I think once we were exploring the village, we stumbled upon that and a bunch of other points of interest that there was a really interesting flow to it. It's also, because tucked away in a corner is this place, the Olive Garden, where you can go and forage for olives, which you need to hand to your chickens so they can give you more metal each run.
Matthew, I feel like I need to give you more context on everything we're discussing.
I don't know. Context doesn't really help.
Probably not. The chicken gathers basic resources for you while you're out in the field, so you'll come back and he's got you some plastic or metal or whatever.
Is it a chicken chicken or a different kind of chicken?
Yeah, it's a real chicken and it feels like they're attempting something that's a bit meme-able, which I get because the rest of the game is otherwise quite cold. It's like a silo style underground settlement, and you're popping out to get things and coming back, and the world is dominated by all of these robots, and you just try to survive day to day. So chickens are a little bit of light relief in the midst of that really.
Nice. Yes, but the chicken demands very specific things. So went to this absolutely fucking deadly zone surrounded by giant robots just to get at some lemons and what the other thing, Phil?
Apricots.
Apricots, yeah. And just like the sort of danger we risked doing that was unbelievable. But the chicken is worth the investment.
But it's like what Phil is saying, it gives you enough of a variety of objectives that you can go to a map. You've probably got something you need to do that's in that map. And you can just have a good time unpicking that.
And even if you fail, you can just come back and try again. You can try with a free loadout, which means you have to take your actual stuff there and lose your stuff in the field. And in general, the kind of magic of it is creating those sort of like Walking Dead style moments of, you know, you encounter other players in the wild, use the voice commands, or you can just turn on your mic and you just like don't shoot.
And then you might not shoot, you might have a fragile alliance or whatever. When you're playing three players like we do, you generally are getting into firefights. But when you don't, it's actually quite thrilling when you decide to all leave the map at the same time.
Or, you know, that guy was like, we're not going to have any trouble, are we, when we were playing on Friday? And you were like, no, no, all good, mate. And see you later kind of thing.
And so it's good at like creating those moments in sort of like microcosm form, which is sort of what the promise of the genre is really, is to generate stories, you know?
So yeah, the mentality of the player base is really interesting. Like I would say in trios, maybe 85% of our encounters with other players have gone hostile, or just been immediately like shoot first, ask no questions. But there's definitely been the occasional moment, especially when, you know, people are looking to extract, maybe they've got into a few fights beforehand and everyone's just like, maybe we won't this time, maybe it'll be better.
But it's completely the opposite in solo. Like most people you meet are just there to complete some objectives or get some junk for whatever progression they're working on and kind of don't go in for a fight a lot of the time. I would say most of my encounters, certainly the new map, which is actually quite small and has some very valuable loot.
There was one point where there were maybe like seven or eight of us running around this one particular lobby in it. Everyone just spamming the don't shoot emote and just going about their business. It was quite quite weird to see, especially as that was directly after the night we had of being repeatedly killed.
Yeah, there have I've now met a couple of people who use the don't shoot the don't shoot prompt as a way to lure you into a false sense of security. And if you respond with don't shoot, the weight to your back is turned and then gun you down. And those people will never see the light of heaven.
I have no problem with people who are just like, I see a person, I want to kill them. Like you live your best life. But just lying to your fellow man, that's beyond the pale.
But yeah, it's definitely interesting to see how that philosophy kind of progresses and changes over the course of the game's life.
Yeah, for sure. Because my worry with it is that once all the casuals clear out, it basically becomes like you load into a map full of like Negan from The Walking Dead, like eight times, and then just the most horrific shit happens every single time you play it. I mean, it's good that it's become such a huge hit.
It sold like seven million copies, I think. But it kind of needs that because, like you say, you got the impression from the people who were playing it solo and saying, some people kind of exaggerate and be like, I don't think people should be allowed to shoot at all playing it solo or whatever. That maybe it's reached outside the usual multiplayer crowd because that sort of discourse doesn't really smack of people who play online games a lot.
Then you realize why because you play it in single player, like you say, and you can almost treat it like Animal Crossing. You're just surrounded by these other villagers who are basically foraging for stuff like you are. Then you just go back to your house and then build the things that you're building.
People are treating the game like that. Whereas in 3v3, even though it's the same maps, the same stuff, it's like a parallel reality where all kinds of awful shit happens. So it's an interesting game for sure.
Except in Animal Crossing, I never force fed Brewster olives so you get me metal.
That is true. That is a difference. I know you'll never play it Matthew, but I thought you'd enjoy a little sample of it.
Yeah. Amazing. I've not even seen a second of this game running.
I have no idea what it looks like. I've just been imagining it from you saying, it's like Animal Crossing and thinking, what that means.
Well, that was me being reductive about that particular way to play it. Did you ever play the whatever zoned stuff in The Division, where you go into it and everyone's like a rogue agent and trying to get their own stuff and get out? It's like that basically, like a game of that.
But the whole game is that. So every map you go into, you're trying to get stuff and leave. You're not using a helicopter to extract things like you were in that game, but you do have to pick an exit and use it, and your exits might close off, and you'll encounter other players at random, and you'll encounter loot at random, and it might go well and it might not, but the effects are permanent, whatever happens, basically.
And so within that little sandbox, a bunch of stories can happen, and like we're talking about, the Blue Gate map in particular, the reason I really like it is, has a high-tier loot zone that is patrolled by so many robots, and it's got a freeway with loads of abandoned cars, and the vibe changes when you're there. Maybe it's an audio design thing, but I think it was raining when we went there, and it's a slightly Mediterranean-looking countryside setting with big old town-style structures in the middle of it, and it just felt like a very considered location in terms of the things that were attractive about it and that sort of stuff, and it was the first time I was really impressed by the map design in the game.
But Blue Gate is the place where we've had, even in trios, we've had the most friendly encounters or the most sort of tense kind of ceasefires, just I think because there are so many dangerous robots about patrolling it, that it's kind of like anywhere in there that you decide to have a fight with another set of players, you're also risking attracting all the robots to you. It's very likely that nobody comes out of it alive. So I think it's very interesting from that perspective as well.
It's just like the actual design of the map kind of prompts people to be a bit more pacifist than they would otherwise. Even that olive zone, it's regularly guarded by one of the giant leaping robots that will absolutely mess you up if you're not careful.
Yeah, the leapers, if you saw them Matthew, I think you'd be very impressed by the spectacle of this game. Like these giant drones that fire rockets in the sky. There's this enormous like kaiju-sized thing called the Matriarch that I've only seen once.
We sort of awkwardly circumnavigated on one map. But the leapers, as the name suggests, they just cross patches of map at once basically, then just land on you and start attacking you. They've got a little bit of a, I would say, Yoshi Shinkawa energy to the design of them, a little bit Metal Gear-ish.
I think there's quite a lot of imagination that's gone into those parts. It just feels very well thought out as a version of its type of thing. So yeah, I would love to hear what you think of it.
I mean, yeah, so if you do have a fancy dropping 30 quid on it, which is very unlikely Matthew, let me know. I will play some duos. But yes.
Yeah, cool. Glad to have your thoughts on the record there, Phil. Reminded me of doing a PC Gamer podcast.
So we named this podcast The Back Page, Phil, motivated by the fact that multiple games magazines used to have funny back pages. And now there's just PC Gamer. There are no others.
So what does All Over, which is the name of the back page in PC Gamer, represents to the magazine specifically?
I often think about the flow of the magazine and what each section is there to achieve. And like All Over, I mean, as the name suggests, it's just a sort of little mental break outro that kind of at its best sort of summarizes the philosophy of the magazine and the sort of things we set out to do, I guess would be my high minded way of thinking about it. But yeah, it's, I mean, ultimately, it's just, you know, leave them wanting a bit more, give them a little joke to go out on.
So that they think a little better of you as they turn to the last page and think, oh, what a creative and funny team you've got there.
You've got so the right attitude, because when I started working on PC Gamer, my immediate thought was, my jokes can't be worse than my predecessor's jokes. That was how I kind of approached The Back Page. It's like the Graham Smith era, the Samuel Roberts era has to measure up to it, at least in terms of quality of gags, but go on to The Back Page.
So yes, that makes total sense, the idea of leaving them wanting more. Matthew, you have some experience of this kind of humour as well. What's your experience of coming up with Back Page jokes?
Weirdly, even though I worked on NGamer, which I think is considered a relatively funny magazine, we certainly tried to make it a funny magazine, its Back Page wasn't really a traditional Back Page. It had a lot of clutter on it. So for the longest time, it had like, at best, two-thirds of the page were dedicated to a gag.
But then there was like a side column with like five last things, and I think there was some like legal sort of gump at the bottom of the page. And as a result, I never really felt like we had a proper Back Page in the way that N64 and NGC had had Back Pages in the past. I mean, N64 was definitely the one I grew up reading and had some tremendous stuff.
But I guess our thinking was, well, there's loads of nonsense throughout this. Page 89 in NGamer was always a one-page joke page, which was kind of like a Back Page. And it wasn't until Nintendo Gamer where we had the regular Iwata Asks parody, which ran across all of them, where we sort of finally had something which felt like, oh, there's just an out-and-out gag to finish this thing.
And like Phil said, it's a nice sort of mental break at the end of it. I think it also just, I like that the last note of a magazine is something quite dumb, as if to say, don't forget, all this is nonsense fundamentally at the end of the day. Let's not end on anything too profound here.
Let's remember why we're all here and it's to have a little joke about something. But I'd say weirdly, the time where I had a Back Page which was closer to what you guys were doing with All Over was probably official Nintendo magazine, where for a particular period of time we did just do bespoke back pages, you know, a weird joke riffing on something that happened in the month, often working on them with Joe Scribble who was a staff writer on O&M at the time. I think they're pretty good.
I think in a way they're better than the back pages of NGamer. There's very few bits of official Nintendo which I preferred to NGamer but I think what we got into with those back pages was pretty decent. Saying that I was just flicking through my old O&M's just before this to remind myself and I forgot that they ran a not a funny page but they ran a quite sincere obituary for NGamer when it closed which was weird because obviously I was working on it at a time.
I don't think I wrote it. I think Chandra wrote it of all people.
It would be weird if you left an obituary to your old bag when you started at a new bag. That's a really funny idea.
Yeah, that is slightly psychotic. But then after the obituary, which I would say very laugh free zone, as obituaries tend to be, we had a run of some quite good stuff. There was one which there was like a countdown to Wii U.
This was like a month and a half before the Wii U was due to come out and we'd just done a calendar and on each day it kind of said what you should do to prepare and it starts off, it feels like it's going to be quite genuine like remember to get your pre-order in or like let's clear some space under the TV for the Wii U but as it goes on it got more and more demented and there was this great long stretch where it talked about trying to force yourself to wet the bed with excitement by drinking loads of fizzy drinks and then all the subsequent days were about trying to get rid of this piss stained mattress that you've made and this little narrative emerged that had to be Scribbles that can't have been me I don't think because I was looking at thinking my brain was never that nimble but yeah it was just this like little returning thing and this it built this whole little world out and I think after this long and rambling answer I think my favourite back pages were the ones where you could explore a joke you could have a little bit of space and you could take sort of various sort of runs at it and I think that's that's true of some of the things you've picked for us to talk about in the second section where you know there's like 10 goes at the same joke but I kind of like how that layers up across the page and yeah I just think we did some alright stuff.
I definitely agree with you. I love that kind of progression that you can have over mimicking some sort of format and then just slowly warping it and playing in that space. Samuel was definitely more of the instant gratification visual back page.
I think the one when I remember because we used to do little roundups of the year in back page for the site just to try and get some of that chaotic energy represented online. I remember the one when I took over the magazine and Sam dropped in to offer critiques. His consistent feedback was, there's a lot of words in this one.
Sam, it's a magazine, mate.
I didn't realize quite how egregious that was. I read back the commentaries for this episode. The next year, you and the team are like, well, after Samuel's commentary last year, or they were all too word heavy, the entire year of back pages, we tried to make us much more word-free than we did before.
Then I was like, God, maybe I was a toxic manager. This completely will change their thinking for a year, for quite a difficult part of the magazine to make. You are right though.
But do you know who put that in me? That was Tony Ellis who put that in me, Phil, where I think he thought the joke should be apparent, and that was the best style of it. So I think I just take all my cues about what best to do with PC Gamer from Tony.
So that's-
I mean, it's probably not wrong. I definitely got a bit too self-indulgent with some of The Back Pages, which is partly because I'm not Joe Scribbles, who I imagine is a delight to have working for that kind of space. He's got exactly the right mind for it.
I was surprised actually how spicy some of the O&M ones were. I mean, not spicy by most people's standards, but by an official Nintendo magazine, which had a new section that was checked and signed off by Nintendo. It had a very close tie with Nintendo.
Again, this countdown to Wii U, one of the days the event plotted in for that day, just told you to go and spit on an iPad. There was a thing about grafting touchscreens to dogs and it was really odd.
That sounds like Joe.
There was a bit about queuing too early for the Wii U and then you gradually got stinkier and stinkier and then he described someone trying to disguise their stink using a chapstick as a roll on deodorant. That really made me laugh as well. It had some good stuff in there.
I will say, Countdown to Wii U. I'm rereading Watchmen at the moment and that has big Countdown to Nuclear Midnight energy to it. The time is five to midnight.
Just the idea of, I imagine if you're doing a monthly Countdown to Wii U and it gets closer, it starts to dawn on you that the console is not going to be very good or successful, and then it becomes a little bit more like psychic damage each time you have to do it. But yeah, there was a bit of that. Yeah, so I do think as well that a really key part of this is that the output can be very wildly, like you can have some that are just a total bust.
And the heartbreaking thing, when I read back the commentary on the different back pages that we did, the first year we did it, I think being forced to do those online articles, commentating on it, forced me to do better jokes. Or like, because I just thought, oh, if they're all in one place, and they're all bad, then it will actually be like a big problem. Or like if only one a year is good.
So that really sort of like dawned on me when I was, you know, at the time. And so I did each year just think, think about the article at the end of the year. And like, let's make sure there's at least like four gags I can sort of hang my hat on.
So it's not a total...
That really was additional pressure we gave to ourselves that we absolutely didn't need in the moment.
Yeah, that no one would reward us for. Like there was no value to doing it whatsoever.
How did they actually work on PC Gamer? Like I'm curious, so who's responsible and where in the production they fall?
Phil, I'd love to hear your take on this because I know how things ran when I was editor of the magazine. But I was... I mean, famously, a lot of the magazine lived in my head and not on like paper.
And you were much better at telling people what was going on. So how did it go when you did it?
I mean, I had some... I was better at some things. I wasn't better at making back pages happen in the sense that I got...
I think my worst magazine habit was assuming that it was impossible to write the joke pages. I include the spy in this as well. Like before...
I persuaded myself that desperation was the thing that made the magic happen. And so they would always happen the week of deadline. And so, you know, the last week of magazine production rolls around and I've still got both the spy and an all over on my plate.
And I mean, sometimes that worked out, but it was... it turns out as subsequent editors have come along and have just done them like a normal time in the production cycle so that they're not a thing they have to worry about. And I'm like, oh, you can just do that, okay.
Yeah, I can't think of a single issue where I went into it thinking, I know what the gag is. Like, that never ever happened. No, as far as I can remember.
I absolutely found that in any time that I tried to do it earlier, by the time it came to like actually submit it to our art editor, I taught myself out of the joke being funny. I think maybe that's why I needed it to be deadline week because at a certain point I couldn't like second guess myself or try and re-engineer it or sit on it. It was just like, this has to be done, whether it's good or bad, it's going out the door today.
The thing is, I think it adds this almost SNL style pressure to it, where it has to be done at a certain time and therefore, like you say, I think I subscribed to the same thing you did, where it's like this is a key part of how it gets made. Then as a result, that would be why these things were wildly inconsistent because it's like five o'clock and everyone wants to go home, and the mag was supposed to go to press. Four hours ago, and it hasn't, and yeah.
90% of the time, if you ever look at a PC Gamer Back Page from that era, and certainly under my tenure, it's because I hadn't done a good enough job of explaining what the joke was meant to be to the art editor when I submitted it, and now there's not enough time for him to fix it.
Yes, that was a huge part of it. I think in some ways as well, you would realize that in explaining the joke, it would actually feel like you were speaking a different language to what the art editor speaks, because there's a joke living in your head and you're trying to articulate how it's supposed to look, but also what the joke is, and if they don't get the joke, that's almost deflating in itself, because you're like, but we're fucked from the off here because you're unamused by even the prospect of this. But then yeah, then it just has to go through the filter of, now it's been designed and it's on the page.
And in your head, it can seem funnier than somehow you're looking at it with typography, a man who's paid money has designed it for you, and you're not happy with it, but it still has to go to press. So that's the fact really. Yeah.
So I did want to ask a bit about along these lines really, I think Back Page is good for PC Gamer, because I think it's very much in-joke territory. It says a lot about what the humour of the team is. And I wondered why you think, Phil, that magazines are good at creating in-jokes, and that type of humour.
How easily could you replicate it online? Because it feels like something that you're invested in on PC Gamer is centering your editor's personalities as much as possible. I was wondering if you ever thought about this sort of thing.
I mean, yeah. And I think you're right, like where we can, it's great to have that sort of thing online. But I mean, magazines are so perfectly suited to it because there's no, you're not buying a specific article.
You might buy a magazine for a specific article, but then you're sort of on the hook and you're kind of at the whims of the editorial team who to sort of curate the experience that you have and then, you know, it's your choice to read through it all or not. And that gives you more space to sort of play with and it gives you space to sort of joke around and make your editorial mission statement, which at PC Gamer did involve like, we don't want to take this too seriously. Like we want to be able to lampoon ourselves and the industry and be silly and serious as the kind of article demand.
And so you can lay things out and you can have that flow and the readers on the hook and if they're enjoying what you do, they're going to read through and they're going to be interested in like, okay, well, what is the next page going to bring? And just the entire delivery method of online is very different. I think part of the reason you have things like podcasts do so well and they are a much better way of having a similar personality driven kind of delivery platform for someone's curated thoughts about lots of different games and you know, while still having the space for jokes.
Whereas on a website, you know, you'll see a, hey, here's a recommended link for another article and it's a joke article and someone's just like, oh, what's that about? I'm not going to click on that. I'm off to the next thing that Twitter recommends.
Yeah. It's a different world. Like your entry point to it is so different.
Whereas a magazine feels like a kind of closed off little club, which is what's great about it for sure.
And I was always careful. Like I didn't want to be get so in-jokey that it would be like off putting to somebody picking up the magazine for the first time. Like, you know, it would feel like there was years worth of magazine lore they had to catch up with to enjoy an issue.
I think one of the things that Chris Thurston said to me when I took over writing The Spy from him was, the spy should never have lore. Each one has to be standalone. You know, I decided to take that to as I guess, extreme conclusion as I could and really play off the fact that it was just like this different entity was created specifically for the magazine, each issue.
So yeah, you're allowed to be a bit self-indulgent, but it's still important to like, you can't be alienating with it. You can't assume that there's so much that you people can't jump on. I mean, there are still things we can do on the website as well.
Like I look at, we have Robin and Chris Livingston, who are kind of in charge and leading the quizzes that we've been experimenting with recently. And they've really taken to it as a kind of a way to have lots of jokes and off-the-wall ideas just within this very specific format that lives on the website.
Yeah, for sure. Like it's well worth doing because I think it just rewards our loyalty to readers who read the site every day. And, you know, there are loads of those people.
And I think those kind of readers have never really been more valuable than they are now. So that makes total sense. Yeah.
So I did want to ask whether you thought that the all-over gags were funnier before we each got involved with PC Gamer, because I would often look at past ones to reassure myself that, oh, no, they had plenty of off months as well. But then I would also look at some that were like really funny, but also the kind of joke I could never come up with. And then I'd be like, oh, God, and all I've got is my, like, dumb balls.
Then I'd look at my No Man's Sky one that has a planet named Your Mom. I'd be like, I'm a fucking, I'm a fucking buffoon, basically. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on this, Phil?
Like, looking at how previous editors did it when thinking about the mag on your terms?
I mean, I think it's not that. Some, some areas definitely have jokes that, like, if I look at a back page, I can kind of pinpoint, oh, I bet that was written by, like, Kieran Gillan or Jim Rossignol, someone like that. There's a voice to it that you think, I think I know who probably came up with that one.
But I was, I did go back and check. So I was like, oh, this is an interesting question. Like, how, how good were the ones before I even turned up?
And, you know, there was still a lot of here's a fake game box cover and here's a hastily Photoshopped picture because we didn't have anything else going on. I think time immemorial, the back page has always been inconsistent, if nothing else. Moments of genius and just clear cries for help, both.
Definitely, definitely a mix of both in there. The Mag still does funny back pages, I know Rob edits the magazine now and does a great job. Magazines, you know, it feels basically like the same as it did when I was running it in terms of like the quality level, design, all the rest of it, very impressive.
What is the process of making those back page gags now? Is he left to himself to do it?
Rob is a one-man army. Yeah, he is a machine. I will say this.
And he does it in a way that it almost infuriates me how healthy, mentally healthy it is. Like he is not a, I'm going to leave this for the day of deadline kind of person. Like it is all, it is all done in good time.
Like, you know, we used to have like production meetings and like somebody higher up would lay out what they actually thought the magazine production cycle should look like, you know, oh, you should have this much content in on Week Zero. And you're like, yeah, sure. I don't even know what the cover is going to be on Week Zero, let alone.
And meanwhile, it turns out it was actually possible all along. I now have proof and it's quite humbling, but the way the magazine works now is it is largely driven by Rob, but we have, you know, essentially the 30 plus person PC Gamer editorial team as kind of contributors for the magazine that are suggesting things and are pulling things in. So if he ever needs help, it is there in the form of, you know, 30, many, many of them, very funny people that he can draw on for a good back page.
But he's also doing a good job, like you say. I think the last one I saw was a Battlefield 6 reveal of the new class editor, which feels very much like that classic back page. I think back to, we did one with you as the new Hitman elusive target.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, it's a very time-honored. Rob has been like a mag reader forever as well. Like he's well-versed in the history of PC Gamer.
So I think he has a good grounding in lots of different eras of back page jokes specifically and other things that we do. So he's got a real eye for that history and respect for it.
Yeah, for sure. Matthew, I wanted to ask what your back page triumph was. Did you have one Iwata Ross where you were like, that was fucking gold, that was like as good as it ever got kind of thing?
Well, the Iwata Ross as a series was popular to the point where I felt pressure to make them good because people were looking forward to them or saying, that's the thing I turned to first or just peers. I remember going to a couple of press events and seeing writers I really admired on a couple of websites say, oh, we really love Nintendo Gamer. The Iwata Ross especially is good.
And I'd be like, ah, shit. So that was a weird one because you'd go into every issue. You knew what The Back Page was.
It would be another Iwata Ross parody. But it was a question of picking the right person and having the right jokes. And it wasn't all done right at the end.
But I would sort of stew on it all month long, trying to work out what the best person was. Some of them are bafflingly of their time.
There's one with Gangnam Style. I want to believe like a boost.
No, there's one with... Oh, God. I should have checked this before we did this.
It was like a banker, a British banker. I think he'd got like bailed out after the financial crisis. He had like one of those nicknames like Tricky Dicky.
It wasn't that, but it was like a tabloid nickname. Just a person I haven't thought by like 10 years. But at the time was obviously like the villain of the week, so that ended up being one.
Kotaku started, they reported on like a couple of them. And that's when it was like, oh shit, we've like, we've broken the boundaries of, we've broken the containment of print. And someone online is writing about something we're doing in print, which just never happened.
And yeah, they were, yeah, they were just basically repeating the Spielberg when I did, and just repeating all the jokes. And that felt pretty great. You know, all hearing, you know, like, I think they talked about one on an episode of like Giant Bomb back in the day, like it had made to them and you're like, oh, I've impressed the cool kids finally.
But yeah, they were, they were stressful. And I sometimes worry that they were like, disrespectful for one time, because they sort of played on his quite idiosyncratic interview style. But it was done with such love.
And anyone who listens to this podcast would know, like, you know, there's no one I admired more. And the Watarasu are hugely important to me as a sort of cultural resource. So, yeah, I'm pleased we got to do them.
I didn't do the last one. The last one, I think, was Alex Dayle when Nintendo Gamer closed and it was the Watarasu interviewing the two future executives who shut Nintendo Gamer. And they were called like Mr. Beige and Mr. Grey.
And it was just loads of evil jokes. I don't think the publishers actually liked that page at all, that particular issue. It was quite a spicy goodbye to print for NGamer.
I'm sure that they only lasted a couple more years, given the sort of carnage going down at that time. Yeah, it's funny because I can only really think of one time that a PC Gamer all over broke containment and got online. I feel like you might remember this.
It's actually my first year on the magazine. It wasn't my idea, The Back Page, but it was like the postcard that said, I'm writing in to complain about your top 100, the omission of, and then there was a space really outraged me. You should have selected, and there was another space to write in your own instead.
That went to the top of like reddit, a PC gaming subreddit, I think. Do you remember that happening, Phil? Or can you think of any other times that these things got any kind of traction online?
The only other times it really seemed to happen was when a page got shared around because it had broken the context it lived in. People didn't realize that it was a joke. I remember there was one, I can't remember what the joke actually was, but it was like a lift panel.
Yeah, for Valve, right?
For Valve, yeah. People used it as like, oh, next month PC game is going to reveal Half-Life 3. This must have been 2015, 2016, so we all know how that turned out.
But yeah, people were convinced that we had like some exclusive that we were going to drop.
Yeah, I remember seeing that back page through the news stories on it, going PC Gamer are telling us all that Half-Life 3 is coming. And it was because like the number 3 button was lit up or something. It was a subtle nod to it.
Yeah. So there have been a couple like that where people have mistaken the joke for, hey, because it says, you know, it's all over until next month. People are like, oh, you're announcing something next month.
No, I'm afraid not.
The only other time NGamer ever got talked about, particularly by US Online, it wasn't for a back page. I think this was either like a line from a news story or it might have been a cover line, but they hadn't been given all the... they weren't localizing Xenoblade for the US.
And there was a big hoo-ha about this. And they were campaigning to get Xenoblade brought over. And I think we had the cover line reviewed, reviewed the game that's too good for America.
And people were like, Oh, these fucking Brits are making fun of us over here and all this jazz. And that I really liked. That was good.
Yeah, I can only ever think of other times where there's two of them actually that we'll talk about that are related, that I did tweet out and did actually get a bit of traction on Twitter at the time. But that was just because I was like, I've done one good joke in like five years of running this magazine. And I just desperately crave validation.
That's absolutely why I would have tweeted that out. And I do at least have enough self-awareness to admit that. Phil, I was wondering if you ever attempted to go back to doing the commentaries on the different all over gags.
I'm going to link these in the episode description. Because they're so good. Even if you don't know the magazine.
It's like, it's a proper like someone's turned all the lights up. And it's like, okay, let's judge you before you go into heaven kind of thing. It's all these gags going through this review process.
You know, obviously it's Rob doing it by himself now. So the idea of like loads of stuff weighing in may seem a little bit less balanced. And back in the day, it was all of us trying to come up with jokes.
But I was curious, have you ever talked about this doing this again?
Yeah, I talked about it a bit when Robin was editor. And we discussed like, oh, is this something that we should bring back? And we did have plans for it.
But I think ultimately for me, it was like, because we shifted like just the production process, and so it's no longer a separate mag team and a separate web team, because so much of the actual joke page now is like, just the editors whim specifically, it kind of felt a bit like, yes, it would be good to show off the work. The commentary element of it, it probably doesn't hit the same. Like, when we were doing those, it was because we were all in it together in terms of actually making the thing.
And so if a joke didn't land, it was like, well, we're sort of ribbing ourselves for the fact that something had gone wrong in the production process, or we just didn't like one in retrospect. And so yeah, I think it just wouldn't land the same. It doesn't have the same therapy vibe.
It would sound like you were putting one man's sense of humour on trial.
Yeah, that's very much what it would be like.
Like, is this one person funny, the team decides?
Yeah, 29 people decide whether their one colleague is funny or not.
I would actually click on that article so fast.
No, I think that makes sense, Phil. It was actually quite a peculiar setup in retrospect, the magazine website thing we had at the time. Like, it was, you know, we still have stuff sort of blur between them in a way that I don't know if any other games publication really did that in the same way.
But maybe Game Informer a little bit, but otherwise it's quite, yeah, it was quite particular to us. So, yeah, even if you weren't directly involved in the magazine, you still had some kind of stake in it being on the UK team because it was a thing that we made over here primarily. Yeah, so that totally makes sense.
Yeah. Okay, go on, sorry, yeah, go for it.
The other differentiator is just being like, we're not as office-based anymore as well. So, I mean, that really did have a very different team dynamic when we were doing that because, you know, it would just be shouting across each other in the office trying to be funny and trying to brainstorm a thing. And everybody could just pitch into that.
It didn't really matter what bit of PC Gamer you worked at. Which is, you know, people are still funny over Slack, but it's not quite the same in terms of feeling like ownership over, oh, I can see my ideas in here.
That makes sense. Yeah, it just is different. And yeah, it makes sense to me.
Okay, well, let's take a quick break and then we're going to revisit some PC Gamer Back Pages of the past and Judge Castle is going to decide whether they were good or not. So I look forward to that.
Welcome back to the podcast. So in this second section, we're gonna revisit some PC Gamer Back Pages of the past, just like I said before the break really, but now it's happening in this half of the podcast. So I know that explaining pictures on a podcast isn't fun, okay?
And I'm gonna make this as simple as possible for you, the listener. We'll have eight exhibits here, so not too many. They will be in the corresponding Patreon post that goes along with this episode for ease.
You don't have to sign up, or even log in to read it. I'm gonna make it a free publicly available post, and that will give you exhibit A, B, D, E, F, G, et cetera. I missed C there, fuck me, I missed the bulky alphabet.
That's how well it's going so far.
Once you see exhibit C, you might want to skip it.
So yes, we're just gonna, I want to discuss the creation of these back pages. They're all from an era where either Phil or myself or both of us were working on the magazine. So we had some hand in the creation of all of these.
And I've definitely cherry picked some interesting ones or notable ones for a few different reasons. Like it might be tied to the significance of a certain issue or just something key that was going on in the editorial calendar. But I kind of want to get Matthew to decide whether they were good or not.
Because, you know, just kind of curious, you've got the inside knowledge of running a magazine, what these things are like. And we can just talk about the process a little bit.
Is it me or is it Judge Castle?
Does it make a difference? Is the Judge Castle thing like a bit? Is that misselling what the process is really going to be?
Yeah, I'd say this is more me, Matthew Castle, who worked on magazines. I don't think Judge Castle did.
No, fair enough. Judge Castle is a fictional entity, in which case, yes, this is just Matthew Castle, I'm afraid. That tease before the break was not accurate, it turns out.
So Phil, I wanted to know how does it feel looking back on old all-overs? What's the sort of first taste test from looking at these things again?
Well, I mean, going through the exhibits, I'm glad you picked the ones that you did. I think you could have been much more unkind to us. Like, I'm not saying the XCOM lightbulb joke, so.
Oh, yeah, but I didn't want to have a go at that one because that wasn't actually my joke, so I definitely wouldn't...
What was that one? Can you explain?
There's like a... So, Chris Thurston came up with this when we were on The Mag when I was editor and he was deputy editor, and it was like... When the guy in the shadows would say, we will be in touch, Commander, that guy in XCOM, enemy unknown, he's always in the dark, and I think he asked something to the...
In the text, it says, just one thing, Commander, can you get me a lightbulb or something like that? Because it was like... Because he's always sat in the dark?
And that was the joke. That was the joke. And like, it was sort of...
And when you look back at these, the commentary on The Back Page, it's mentioned at least two of these articles, the XCOM lightbulb gag.
I think it's mentioned in every one.
Yeah.
Because I'm fine with it. Like, in reality, outside of the kind of... The version of me I might have put on a little bit for those discussion articles.
I'm fine with it. But Andy really liked it, Andy Kelly. And I liked to play off that because I didn't think it was as good as I think, because I think it was originally mentioned as one he really enjoyed.
Yeah, I guess that does kind of beg the question of how badly Canon all over go, Phil. Like, you looked at some of these articles kind of going back to it. Like, what is the sort of feeling of looking at one where you're like, well, that just didn't work?
Is it sort of shame? What is it like we could have done better? What's the sort of response that you have?
It's sort of the disappointment of knowing, like, what was in your head versus what landed on the page.
Yeah.
And like some of it is just like, some of it is definitely, okay, we asked for impossible things. Like, I think there is one that really doesn't work that is a joke around the Mass Effect conversation wheel.
Oh, God, I wrote that one. Fuck me, it's so bad.
And like the joke itself, it was like, it was a joke that was funny in a Google doc, but that just didn't translate to like, once everything had been rendered onto the page, it was like the very format of a Mass Effect conversation wheel worked against the progression of how a joke should have gone. And so you just don't get the same, like if we listed it out, the obvious progression makes sense in the bullet points on the page. But none of us connected that, oh yeah, no, that has to that has to then translate to this other thing.
And it's not going to land the same way. And so that's what I get in my head about, like, is just like, oh, I remember what this should have been. Or I remember the version of this that was very funny, like in a conversation between two people who were maybe very stressed and doing their best.
And so it's one of those, like, you know, the magazine has and will survive a bad joke occasionally. So I don't get too, too bent out of shape about it. But there is definitely a kind of like, all of these kind of transport me back to the very specific circumstances they were made under, for good and ill.
Yeah, there was one you did on Ghost Recon Wildlands, where it's like a parody, like, leaflet, Taurus leaflet of Bolivia. And then I think, like, in the commentary you say, I hope it's very clear that we're making fun of, like, the Ghost Recon version of Bolivia and not actual Bolivia. Which I guess is similar to Matthew's, the water arse or concern of, like, is it definitely okay that I did this?
But yeah, the funny thing is that so many of them actually just land in the middle somewhere. Like, they're not all terrible. They're just like, they leave no impression, really.
They're not a great win. But like, we live to fight another day, basically.
So, yeah. I mean, ultimately, a lot of the time, what we're aiming for is sort of just like a little chuckle, just a little chuckle.
Exactly, yeah, exactly. Just, yeah, leave on a high kind of thing.
Yeah, if it goes beyond that, great. Like, we've really over delivered. But, you know, these are essentially just, yeah, at their best, they're sort of like a little image or just a little thing to see you out.
I'm not putting everything on Matthew liking all of these. It's fine.
Yeah, the kind of like, the thing is, I think people like the in-jokes we have on this podcast, but most of them only last for the episode in which they are created basically. And the thing is that as much as people enjoy those jokes, if you and I, Matthew, had to take our podcast in-jokes and translate them into like a print gag, I think all of them would be total dog shit. I just don't think it would work at all.
Like a few weeks ago when that listener asked, can you expand on your joke about the next Persona game being set in Bath? And you just went, no, I can't because the joke is over. I think that is key sometimes.
Like it's the translation thing. A joke has to go through, it has to survive a lot to come out the other side and still be funny with these things.
I'd say the closest thing we have to a magazine style joke that would have worked in a magazine is the lore around Castle Island and the stupid lawyer speeches. Just a repeatable format which you can layer up. That's what magazines give you, is the opportunity to return to the thing again and again.
So you're saying we collect all those in a hardcover book?
I don't think we should be going to Lost in Cult with that idea. I think we've got one chance to talk to Lost in Cult about maybe doing a good book at some point and that is not it.
Damn. All my lawyer speeches could have been in one place, never mind. Okay.
So let's start with Exhibit A then Matthew, and you can let us know how this goes, and we'll talk about the creation of these back pages. So the first one is a parody of the back cover of a Tom Clancy book, Tom Clancy the dead author of a bunch of right-wing classics. I described them as military thrillers basically.
Yeah, dad fodder very much so. So we thought we'd do a parody of that and that is what this is. I could just read this out because it's all text-based this.
It is actually a very nicely rendered fake back book cover. John did a good job here. It's a parody of if Tom Clancy actually did have to write a book of the live service game The Division, what would it turn out like?
Again, I'm explaining the joke in far too much detail, but here's the text. One city, one retiree, one million dollars of disease. It finally happened, Jack, he said, nuzzling his cheek against the smooth metal of his single-action semi-automatic M1-911, gently caressing his fingers against the grooves of its custom grip, the money has turned against us.
Jack Ryan was in the Navy, then he was in the CIA, after that he was the president for a bit, then he quietly retired on a solid pension, his only companion a stout manly dog, like a German shepherd or a boxer, definitely not a poodle. Now he faces his most dangerous assignment yet, shopping in New York on the day the money went bad. Terrorists have capitalism in a chokehold, and Wall Street's too dead to sell.
Only Jack Ryan can dropkick Black Friday into next Thursday. And then there's like a series of fake kind of like praise for the book. And then the suggestion is it was ghost written, not written by Clancy himself.
And then apparently at the end it says from the author of Tom Clancy's Hawks, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Ultra HD Texture Pack. Phil, what do you remember about the creation of this one?
Oh, he didn't read out the quotes.
Oh, I guess maybe Phil should read out the quotes actually.
Okay, praise for the writer pretending to be Tom Clancy. Literary Review calls it a gorgeous disgrace. The Global Mail.
It's not that you can't afford to have this military thriller in your life. It's that you can't, can't afford to have this military thriller in your life. YouTube.
Various. So explosive you will think armed men have forced dynamite into your pants. Dynamite made of human poo.
And PC Gamer says this is not, it has to be said, a suitable dance floor on which to get down, which I think was a quote from elsewhere in that issue.
Yeah, it might be maybe a reference to like the fact you, is there a dance remote in the game or something? I don't remember.
I'm sure we just pulled that out. Like, hey, it was a pull quote on a different article. But now, absolutely, is now so far removed, having come from a magazine to an online commentary roundup to a podcast.
Nine years later. Yeah. It was never supposed to be under this much scrutiny.
It's true. So the only thing I remember about the creation of this one, Phil, is that I had Daily Mail instead of Global Mail, but then I had one of my panics about being sued and changed out at the last minute.
The classic one was panic.
It was. Do you remember anything else about this one, Phil? Like, the money thing is, that's the premise of the game, right?
That Black Friday, all the cash. Remember cash? Back when people had cash?
Yeah, I vaguely remember the, I guess teaser trailer or mood trailer for one of the E3s, where there's like money falling down and it's all like some sort of implication that the disease was cash-borne or something. And I think I just found like the quote I latched on to was just the money went bad as a thing that we could build as like the hook for a book review. Any actual jokes, you know, Tom Clancy is not involved in the Tom Clancy series of video games.
It's not much deeper than that, but I think we had some fun with it. I definitely remember, there are certain lines I remember who wrote which bit.
Which of you and me wrote Only Jack Ryan Can Dropkick Black Friday Into Next Thursday?
Because I'm pretty sure that was you.
I don't really remember, but I think that's like one of the best bits of the page.
I hard agree. That's the best line on there. That paragraph.
I just like Wall Street's Too Dead To Sell.
I think Phil came up with that. And therein lies the magic of our editor of Deputy Editors to Partnership at the time.
I would say it then loses me with dynamite made of human poo.
I would say that doesn't stand up to scrutiny.
Come on. That's just desperate.
That's, well, I don't know. That feels like, credited to YouTube various. I think that is just like an attempt to dig, I don't know, the popular YouTubers of the time.
The hype cycle that they got.
I get what you're trying to do.
Yeah. It doesn't work laid out like this, for sure.
Yeah. I think you came up with the day the money went bad, Phil, because that sounds like something you would say. Yeah.
I definitely came up with a gorgeous disgrace, which is not funny, but I don't know. I just like that combination of words. That really is all there is to say about it, but Tom Clancy, he's right for parody really, isn't he?
So it makes sense conceptually to do this one. But Matthew Castle, what do you think? Is this good or bad?
Thumbs up or thumbs down?
I feel like this one means a lot to you. This one, when you're talking about Back Pages, you often go to the Tom Clancy's The Division. So this is clearly a happy memory for you.
And I'm not going to do anything to damage that happy memory. I do like it. It's got some good laugh lines in there for sure.
I quite like after that he was the president for a bit. I think that's dumb as well. It's really only the human poo bit I don't like.
I think that's fishing for a laugh.
Okay, well fair enough.
You sound so wounded by that.
No, I'm fine. I don't have loads of stock in this. I just don't think it's unfair commentary to be honest.
I think actually that maybe speaks to my sort of overall thing on Back Pages, which is the more text you have, it opens the margin for error grows. But because if you have more and more jokes that don't work, then more and more pressure is put on the one or two jokes that do work. And I think this is that sort of like in play basically.
You're seeing it right here on the page. So thumb middle Matthew?
No, I would say thumbs up. This is good.
Exactly. If you have like 10 to 12 jokes on a page, if only two or three of them land, that's still a funny page.
Yeah, I guess so. And also like the bad ones are doing their, they're sort of being bad. So when you get to the good ones, pacing wise, it works out, you're like, oh, that's a proper laugh because I really suffered to get here kind of thing.
It's why they keep the bounties in the celebration tin. You have a horrible bounty, but then like the ecstatic explosion of a, you know, Malteser or a Milky Way.
Yeah, it's very good, Matthew. Definitely, yeah, the Revels theory at work there.
Oh yeah, sorry. To give it a scientific name.
Okay, moving on to exhibit B. Okay, this is from the game Stardew Valley, very popular at this time when we did this in May 2016. It was just launched on PC and yeah, just sort of, it was immediately a big hit and then just kind of kept growing and growing and it's still, I presume, making tens of millions of pounds for Eric Brone every year.
It's a quote from, a fictional quote from Linus, one of the characters in this. This used to be a quaint, friendly community. Then you started selling kale and now Pierre only stocks 10 pound craft beers.
Haley's ordering salted caramel pastips from Deliveroo and I can barely afford the rent on this tent. The font's very well done, I would say. It looks pretty spot on with what the game's font looks like.
And Phil, I remember you writing this, but I feel like we at the time were maybe big on the idea of gentrification being a source of humor. What do you remember about this one?
Well, I mean, we live in the city of Bath, so... True. It was clearly on our minds, you know, underpaid games journalists in the mid 2010s.
So yeah, I think this was a rich vein of being irritated at the proliferation of salted caramel in literally everything.
Which hasn't ceased in the year since.
It just changes what the thing is each year. We're on a real matcha kick at the moment, it feels like.
Last year, it was Lotus Biscoff.
Oh, it really was, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Fucking everywhere. I couldn't move for that stuff.
Have either of you had the burger that Magu does in Bath that has Biscoff on it?
I haven't. My girlfriend has as she took a bite of it and she said, I think this burger is too good for me.
That's got big like we've flown too close to the sun energy, that burger. But very perceptive, yeah, it is definitely matcha this year. Yeah, it's true.
Like at pulled pork was like the year before this, I think, when we did this Back Page. So yeah, it sort of began. But Matthew, I was curious if any of the gentrification context makes sense when you just look at this.
Like, do you understand what the joke is to look at it?
Yeah, but then I also knowing that it came from you guys, I think I use that to sort of unlock it, you know? I can pass it because I get that that's the jokes you're making. Yeah, I think this makes sense.
Yeah, okay. And so more importantly, thumbs up or thumbs down? Yeah.
Thumb middle?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Where do you go with thumb middle for that one?
I might go with thumb middle for that. I'm not too familiar with the character of Linus, I'm assuming the picture of him here is just how he appears in game.
Any further context on... Because you were playing the game Phil and I think you pitched Linus.
You haven't like given him a particular hipster... You haven't redesigned him to look hipster-y.
I think I have absolutely no memory of this game or anything particular in it. I think we definitely made sure that the main character had the most hipster beard possible.
Yeah, I think though that what might have happened here is that because Linus is... He's like, is he the only character who doesn't live in a house and lives in a tent?
I would assume so, yeah. I mean, the joke is that we've priced him out of the village. My overriding memory here is us having to research what Deliveroo alternatives existed in the US for when we did the American version of the Mag.
Did we do Uber Eats? Is that what we did?
I think we must have done Uber Eats, yeah. I remember us asking the UST, what do you have that does this? Because they didn't have Deliveroo and it's like, okay, we've got to localise this, otherwise it definitely won't land.
Yeah. Well, I've learned from Jeff Keighley that Door Dash is a thing. Door Dash is a thing.
Yeah.
Yeah. I like the level I thought that went into it. I'd say this is, for me, this is better observed than it is necessarily like an out-and-out rib tickler.
I'm going to put that down as thumb middle. I think that's a fair boiling down of it. Okay.
Good stuff. We move on to Exhibit C then. This ties into the annual PC Gamer Top 100.
So every year, a list of the 100 best games. These days, users are very complex mathematics. I think you need only the 1% smartest people in the population can understand the formulae that goes into coming up with that.
It's a very complicated spreadsheet.
Yeah.
I bet it is, but it's always very fun to read. So this one basically allows you to cut out and paste in all of the games that were omitted. I would say this has got a bit of me energy.
Yeah.
And the types of audience that annoy me. So for example, one is like every 80s RPG, and another one is any hero shooter that is an Overwatch. That's definitely.
Sequel you ironically think is better. Average flight sim you bought a hot ass for. That might be you, Finn, actually.
That sounds a bit more like you. Hardcore strategy game you pretend to enjoy. That's definitely me.
Cult classic that needs 14 mods just so it doesn't crash. The sexy 90s point and click game your dad hid in the loft. That might have a bit.
That might be you, Phil. No, I think that one was you. Maybe it was.
And then Dragon Age 2 is one, which was the Dragon Age 2 was a running joke in the magazine, really. But yes, it was basically like allows people to just paste over the bits of the top 100 they don't like with other game archetypes. And again, I am explaining the joke, which I realize is not funny, but you can look at this on the Patreon page.
And there's quite a lot of text. We wrote little text entries for each one, which kind of gives you context. Phil, I don't, I wonder if you remember the creation of this one because I think this is when you were running the magazine or at least like maybe it's a handover issue to when I gave you the magazine?
Yeah, it might have been 2017, so that sort of lines up. I mean, the thing with this and most top 100 Back Pages is I think the one you mentioned earlier, that sort of form letter that you could fill in. I think that broke us because every year we were like, how the fuck are we going to top that?
Oh yeah, yeah, big time.
That did happen. For some reason we got into head. Okay, the smart thing to do would have just not been to do back pages based on the top 100, but we sort of kept going with inconsistent results.
I think the year after we did a bingo card that landed pretty well. But I remember that only came out of us having quite a fraught lunch at Grillstock, where we were trying to brainstorm ideas for what we were going to do this year to top the form letter.
Yeah, Grillstock, a hugely important location for the PC Gamer team of that particular era. We went there more than anywhere else.
May she rest in peace.
Yeah, exactly. Those brisket burn-ins, they were real good. It was only you and I who ever ordered the brisket burn-ins, but they were phenomenal.
I'm sure I'll probably shorten my lifespan by about five years, but worth it at the time. So you're right, we did torment ourselves to try and top that one, and we should have just picked a different battle really. But the top 100 just always felt like it was our thing, and therefore making jokes made sense.
Conceptually, I like this. I do think reading it back now, it's a lot more, it reads a lot more bitter than maybe is healthy for your joke page. I think this is probably around the time when you can probably track down an old PC Gamer podcast of us sort of going through the top 100 and not sounding super impressed by all the picks.
I think this may have been before we retooled things quite a bit. I think there's just some of my lingering dissatisfaction with the list that year that has seeped into a Back Page joke in a way that I'd not do that today.
No, I think we are equally responsible for that vibe here. We probably fed each other's attitudes over this kind of thing. But I can just see all the types of internet commenter that would annoy me or the people who would only ever say, only ever bang on about like New Vegas being the only good Fallout game, or just paradox fans who were upset that we didn't play the same games they did, or I think just basically these very vocal subsets of online audience and reacting to those and it does come across I think as more bitter than maybe celebratory.
In the top 100 was a cool thing that we did. And you still do. It's like a fucking massive undertaking, but it's a thing you can hang your hat on.
It's an editorial event that you make. But yeah, I guess the key thing is, Matthew Castle, what did you think of this Back Page?
So I really like this one. In fact, I'd say this is my favourite of all the exhibits.
Wow, okay, interesting.
But what I like about it is, I think the specificity of each joke really speaks to the truth of them, at least that's how you felt about them. And obviously, the Top 100 was really important to you, and you spent a lot of time working on it and talking about it and thinking about it and joking about it. And that's, rather than the bitterness, even though there is a bit of bitterness in this, it's, what I see more is just the sort of how completely kind of you know consumed you are by the Top 100, which in itself is a sort of act of love.
So I see it as quite a positive thing. I don't think you can get to these jokes without like caring about it. Also like, I can hear echoes of this in some of our like Discord beefs with the listeners occasionally, you know, like some of these categories, you know, will come up and it's like, yeah, you know, I know, I know what we're talking about.
Also, I think the category which didn't name there, which was Weird Game Only Weirdos, like I think that's quite a big part of like what this podcast is. And I like that it's, each of these has like a, it's written up like an entry in the Top 100, so accredited to different writers. And Andy Kelly writes under Weird Game Only Weirdos, like, so many haven't played or even heard of this weird game I love.
That's what makes it special in my eyes. To me, a weirdo, this weird game is the epitome of PC gaming. I like the phrase, to me a weirdo.
That's one of my favorite bits of any of these back pages. And also like Weird Game Only Weirdos, like that is just so much of what we champion. Like that's a 7 out of 10.
So that really struck a chord with me. I really like this back page. I think this is great.
I don't think I came up with Weird Game Only Weirdos. Like Phil, was that you or Andy who came up with that?
It would have been me or Andy, I think.
Can you identify the ones you came up with, Phil?
I think cult classic that needs 14 mods just so it doesn't crash feels like me.
Last position, a Twitter thread is good with that one.
All of these have a little last position which was where it appeared in last year's thing, but they're all just like your Discord or a WordPress blog post here. Some nice old jokes around there.
It's interesting not to get too deep into it as well, but this happened on, I saw this happening on RPS when I was on it, which was that a newer generation of writers had probably come up through console gaming rather than PC gaming, and we're now on this incredibly hardcore PC gaming site, and I think it's definitely true of you and Andy Kelly on PC Gamer as well. As a result, there is a bit of tension there that new people are coming in and bringing in their favorites and maybe a little bit of their console sensibility. I recognize a lot of that in this from doing any list feature on RPS and having the old god kick off that it wasn't like anything post 1999 made it in.
Yeah. Actually, if I could ask you a bit about that, Phil, actually. Yeah.
Because I feel like at this time, we were just... I feel like the first major game to do this was... I guess it was probably MGS5 came to PC at the same time it came to console.
So that seems significant, Phantom Pain. But it was when they ported Valkyria Chronicles to PC, that there was this building avalanche of console ports. Then we get to the moment we're in now where you have a top 100 that has to accommodate Deus Ex and also the Persona games.
So these games that had console identity back in the PS3 days, are now also PC games. How do you reckon with that when you're thinking about the top 100?
It's tricky. One of the games in the current top 100, I think it debuted in last year's list is Metal Gear Solid 3. Not Metal Gear Solid Delta, Metal Gear Solid 3 just because that HD collection pack came over to PC.
They're just PC games now. They are eligible for voting on, and if they get enough votes, they go in the list. Because of the size of the editorial team, and I think some of our youngest writers are in their 20s, I am now over 40.
We have people from different ages, different backgrounds, people who grew up with console games, people who grew up with really hardcore PC games. One of our news writers, Josh, who is one of the younger ones, and yet is fully a sicko for hardcore old CRPGs, and turned up to a meeting we have before the vote to try and advocate for your favorite games, dressed as a pirate so that he could do a presentation slide on why Pillars of Eternity 2 is good.
I'll have to release the tapes one day. It was hilarious stuff and worked. He got it in the list.
That's the dedication you need if you're going to get a game like that in the list. So we were quite deliberate when building out the formula and stuff and the rules around it. It's like we want everything to be eligible.
Like whether it was a launch game for PC or whether it is traditionally a console title and maybe 10, 20 years later they finally release it on PC. It's like, okay, you're here now, come on in. You are allowed on the list.
And so it's more about, okay, let's build this up in a way that the votes do what we want and they reward the things we want, which is just like, okay, some of it is like, okay, is this just like an important canon PC game that everyone's going to be talking about for decades to come, so you should probably play it? Or is it just like, hey, this still holds up really well and you should play it? And so that's kind of why the complicated formula exists, is to A, to kind of replicate that and B, because I've been running those top 100 meetings for a decade now and I'm just very tired.
But you're very good at that. They've always been better than they were before you were in that process, like we would end up with lists we weren't happy with, but it just got better and better from that. And I know that you suffered to make that happen, but I think it was worth it.
Sometimes you've got to suffer for a list that people will instantly call you wrong about forever.
It's funny though because I definitely think that something I thought about a lot running PC Gamer was the idea of gatekeeping versus not gatekeeping, because where celebrating traditional PC games matters versus acknowledging that PC gaming is something much broader than it was in 1998, for example, and it is tough to figure that out because there's a lot of older readers who have a very strong perception of what these things are, and I don't necessarily disagree that these things should be factored in, and those games are important to me, too, you know?
There are definitely like, we're getting very off track from looking at the funny pictures.
Sorry, sorry.
No, no, it's fine. It's a subject I like talking about. Like there are definitely like, I think, underserved genres in the list, which is just a factor of like the sort of things that we as a team play.
Like we don't have many racing fans on the team, and so like, that's definitely a genre. I'm like, yeah, and we don't have, I think one of the big ones that's often missed is like, that legacy of older LucasArts and other adventure games. Like, you know, those are important PC games that just don't really get a look in.
And part of it is just like, if you look at how many games release on Steam every year, like trying to divine a hundred PC games out of like everything that is available from all the platforms these days is just, all the stores on PC these days is just incredibly difficult. Like things will absolutely get missed. But I think to me, I was very passionate about the idea that like, the console holders, you know, some of them do good jobs with things like backward compatibility and that.
Some of them very much, they don't. And so it becomes an issue of preservation. And it's like the more stuff that we can get on PC where it's like, there will be some sicko out there who will keep it running and who will do, move heaven and earth to make sure that you can, there will be tweaks available so you can play pretty much anything.
And it's like, we should celebrate that. And that means, yeah, all the console games eventually become PC games on a long enough timeline.
It's so true. A couple of years ago, I just thought to myself one very slow Sunday, I really want to own John Woo's Stranglehold. And the only place I could do it was GOG.
And I went and bought it for like six quid. And now it's mine forever. And there's probably a man somewhere in Eastern Europe who has that on a hard drive that when all of the infrastructure of the world goes down, Stranglehold will still be there.
And it won't be there on Xbox, but it will be or PlayStation 3, but it will be there on PC. So that's a very good point. Yeah, very well articulated and interesting to hear about.
So yeah, great little diversion there. And I guess I'll swerve us back towards the exhibits, just because I respect your time, Phil, and they consider it valuable. So exhibit D is about Destiny 2, some Christmas 2017.
I did not work on a magazine at this time. I picked this one out because I think it's like, you know, the secret source of these things, and also secret really is that John Strike is an incredible designer. And I think this one is absolutely brilliant.
It's three rejected designs for Destiny 2, exotic weapons. There's a Lovebringer Zeta, which fires out love hearts from this little kind of like gun blade-ish type head. A grenade launcher designed by the legendary romantic Lord Zorgog.
Launcher grenades filled with pheromones, charming enemies and making them want to kiss instead of kill you. Used with caution, especially around the Cabal. There's Morning Bane, which is like a pistol that has an I Heart Tea mug sort of built into it with a handle and the trigger is.
And then a tea bag sticking out the end. This Solar-type hand cannon has a chance to dispense a lovely cup of tea with every round fired. Excellent for guardians who have trouble getting up in the mornings.
And then the final one is Vainglorious Disco Tech. Which is like a sort of gun with a disco ball on the end, basically. Vomits out pink and blue neon beams everywhere, drawing in the ir of every nearby enemy.
Ideal for a blaze of glory or for trolling your raid team during a jumping puzzle. So Phil, what's the making of this one? Because I feel like Destiny was at this time a huge part of the lives of the PC Gamer team.
And the exotics were like a great talking point for that game. Is that roughly where these ones came from?
Yeah, I mean, so I guess the disappointing answer here is I think I came up with the idea for this one and then I left and other people made it. I'm sure this was Andy and it would have been Pip who brought it all together. And then John obviously for doing the designs.
I absolutely love the Ace of Space and with just like a cup of tea just bolted crudely onto it. So yeah, I think I didn't come up with any of the individuals, just the base idea and then left others to deal with it, which is for me, the ideal back page is just you please deal with this for me. I have a meeting to go to or this other thing I need to get done because it was the Christmas issue as well.
So I imagine done on an incredibly tight timeline. But yeah, Destiny was a big thing for the team at that point. I think a bunch of us were playing it either together or just solo.
So yeah, I think they really, really got the spirit of the idea there.
Yeah, I mean the names are like perfect.
Vainglorious Disco Tech.
That's so good. Like that could easily be a Destiny gun. Like no, no question.
That's a touch of Andy to it. I don't think he ever played Destiny loads, but definitely was a lover of some of the names to come out of it. I think I remember him mentioning Hebridean Thoughtcrime, which was one of Destiny 1's exotic ships quite a lot.
He talked about that. I'll tweet about that loads. Like you're right.
He was-
Is that real?
That's real. Yeah.
Hebridean Thoughtcrime. That happened.
So good.
It was good. But it just speaks to that moment as well, where Destiny was at the center of games in this way that it just hasn't been now for a few years. But they were just great to talk about, think about.
I did the quiz that was Craft Beer or Destiny Exotic on the website as well. It's something we talked about loads. Phil, Matthew, what do you think of this one?
Yeah, this is great. You're right. That art is great.
But like all the little jokes and how spot on and how sort of lived in all that lore is. My only thing, and this is getting a thumbs up, so don't worry about it. But Vainglorious Discotheque, that is a ratcheting clank ask them.
It is almost exactly in that series really.
But yeah, that's the only one which I like. While I like the Photoshop, I just can't imagine that in Destiny.
Well, I mean, I don't think the one with the mug and the tea bag out the end would be Destiny either, to be honest.
I could see that gun barrel extending from the bottom of the screen. I could see that. But if I look down and see a big fucking disco ball, I'm like, no, this isn't Destiny.
That one is based off of Warcliffe Coil. I think it's like 80% of the model from the Warcliffe Coil rocket launcher. So it's close.
It's just less Technicolor.
It shows how little I know the man who has not played much Destiny. Yeah, but okay, in which case it's a thumbs up through and through.
I wonder if I ever got this gun. It does ring a bell looking at it, but it's all wrapped up in COVID memories now, which who knows if they're memories at all really, or if they're all kind of weird dreams that may not have happened.
It was one of those rocket launchers where it was like, maybe one raid encounter out of all of them that existed would be like, okay, we crack out Warcliffe Coil for this one. For some reason, it's the perfect tool for the job.
That rings a bell, yeah. Okay, so thumbs up from that one, Matthew. Good stuff.
Exhibit E then, October 2018. This is for the game Hypnospace Outlaw, which was a fictional internet basically, a depiction of the internet as it was in the 90s, very GeoCities coded. I'm sure people are familiar with the game.
Sadly, a sequel to it was canceled this year, maybe. I actually can't remember, but definitely in recent history, which was sad. I think the game is considered a bit of a modern classic.
I mean, old internet, perfect, right for parody, PC Gamer. And I think this is really good because it's basically like a fake PC Gamer home page with like sort of cover lines on it. There's like Overwatch tips, No Man's Sky interview, Sean Murray Speaks, Join PC Gamer Club, which gave me flashbacks to the thing that made me leave PC Gamer, managing that.
And yeah, it's just a really charming depiction of old internet. I didn't work on this one at all, Phil. Do you remember anything about this one?
There was another one that was pitched by Philippa Waugh, former Dephead, while I was there, just for the magazine. And Pip basically both pitched it and then just went into Hypnospace itself and used that game's editor to just mock this up. And then the classic will just stick some funny annotations on it and boom, job done.
Damn, I didn't know you could actually do that in that game. That's something for us to consider, Matthew, when we start trying to translate our gags into visual form and give up halfway through. We can give that some thought.
Okay, alright, well, I think that's really cool. But Matthew Castle, what do you think?
Yeah, I like this one. I think it trades a little bit too much on just what's funny about Hypnospace Outlaw. I don't know if it's just too good a parody of it.
It just looks like what all the pages look like in Hypnospace Outlaw. So yeah, I think it's okay.
Thumb middle? Should I go thumb middle?
Yeah, I'd say thumb middle. I like join PC Gamer Club Cool. That's good.
It just feels like someone who was there on the internet back then made it.
It does, but then that, I don't know, I just played Hypnospace Outlaw. It's got so much stuff like this in it that maybe I'm burnt out on that gag.
I can see why that would be the case, I guess.
No shade on it. I don't know why. I feel terrible.
I should be giving all these a thumbs up.
That's fine. It's like two thumb middles and three thumbs up, which is okay.
Which is a good hit, right?
Yeah, absolutely. Exhibit F. Christmas 2018.
Matthew, I picked this one knowing who you are and what you like, and that is often torturous mystery games. That's one of your deals. No, I know this is considered a modern classic.
This is like a parody of the log that you put together in Obidin, where you recount the sequence of events. It says, return of the PC Gamer Party Boat. It's very much visually stylized to look like the game.
Very nicely done, I think. A catalog of revelry and tragedy, 2018. In the cargo hold, Lara Croft was speared, exploded and eaten by a terrible beast.
The caption says, oh bugger, not again. Part 3, on the gun deck, Geralt of Rivia drowned in the bathtub. Then the caption says, have you seen my rubber duck?
There's a very famous meme that PC Gamer really created of Geralt in the bath. This was such an influential meme that they eventually replicated it in the TV show. So Henry Cavill got in a bath because of PC Gamer.
That happened at one point. Part 4, in the sea, Anti-Mage was killed by teammates who didn't ward the jungle according to his idiotic whims. Anti-Mage is disconnected from the boat.
Please wait for them to reconnect. Thou art a devil, pure and simple, says the caption. Phil, what do you remember about this one?
This was, I remember how much of a hold Obradin had over, I mean both me and Pip at the time, like we'd come into work and sort of compare notes about our ongoing investigation. Finding ourselves delighted by the fact that we were, we were sort of going about things and arriving at the same conclusion in different ways. It sort of really unlocked like how much depth there is and how much craft there is in that game.
And so yeah, we wanted to do a quick homage of that. I think the original version we wanted to do was just going to be members of the PC Gamer team, which is kind of the stock in trade, whole what-if game, but we replaced them with the editorial staff. I can't remember what reason.
I think it was just like too much work at the time to get the pictures all done up as they needed to be. So we switched it to some game characters instead, and thus allowed us to revisit some, I think, ongoing jokes of the time. Like the anti-mage one, that reeks of PIPs specific beefs against MOBA players.
I didn't even know what that was.
It's so particular, that one, that it does.
Yes.
Yeah. I'm surprised that there wasn't a version where it was like members of the PC Gamer team and like things that before them. That feels like something that would have happened probably when I was running the mag.
But this is a bit more accessible because people know who Geralt is. They might not know who Anti-Mage is, but they know who Geralt and Lara Croft are.
Hey, those mobas, they're pretty popular.
It's very true. Just to- I hear.
Yeah, allegedly. Okay, Matthew, what's your verdict on this one?
This one isn't really for me. Sorry to be a party pooper on the PC Gamer Party Boat. I would have loved to have seen one with editorial stuff where the accidents were maybe truer to what can happen in an office environment.
Right, right.
I look at it and I'm a bit like, yeah, I guess that could happen to Lara Croft.
Okay. Well, look, fair enough. Again, the Back Page experience is you have a go at these things.
It was seven years ago.
I don't feel like you should have given me the power of thumbs down if you didn't want me to give any of these a thumbs down.
That is completely fair. Okay, fine.
I'm sorry. It's a game that's really precious to me. Yeah, it's fine.
It looks nice.
I guess with the editorial thing, the funny thing is that there are loads of blokes in that game who look like they could work on magazines because they're just rough white blokes working on a boat, not all of them, but a lot of them. I could see why you might think that Matthew, but alas. Okay, we move on to Exhibit G, which is the rare sequel back page to a previous back page.
So we returned to the idea that we did for The Division 1 when Ubisoft put out The Division 2 three years later. This was right near the end of my time at PC Gamer in Germany, actually. I didn't work on the magazine at this point.
I worked on the website.
Yeah, didn't you come back specifically for this back page? We drafted you in for one more go and all over.
I know I would have drafted myself in. The most self-serving motherfucker. Just like I've got one good gag and I'm going to wheel out again.
It's got that energy to it. I did sort of weirdly took it upon myself to become like the Division guy on PC Gamer a little bit. Like I forced myself to get into that first game.
I have so many memories of going through the snowy streets of New York while listening to the You Must Remember This Podcast, which I just crunched through as I tried to race through all the content in The Division 1 before The Division 2 came out. Of course Matthew, we were both on that press trip in the very cold garage in Paris.
Where I ate an onion pie.
You did eat an onion pie. That did happen. So yeah, we did a sequel to that Division cover for like a back cover, basically a fake book written by Tom Clancy.
Now with different jokes, but the layout is the same. So I'll just read out the synopsis and I'll get Phil to read out some of the other bits. Um, one capital city, one missing president.
No story. Bad men are in the National Air and Space Museum, asked Jack Ryan. Say no more.
No, really stop. I don't need a reason to kick ass in what was, in 2016, the third most visited museum in the world. With that, Ryan strode out of the White House, not stopping for a moment to consider the potential symbolism.
Subtext? Jack Ryan does even know the meaning of the word subtext. He never went to college.
Are you an American or an Ameri-cant? yelled the faction leader, holding Ryan hostage while having no discernible political views of his own. A surprise robot bee suddenly tear into the guy's flesh.
Ryan effortlessly breaks his handcuffs, tears the 450 rated knee pads of his captor and stands triumphant. That answer your question, you ideologically ambiguous sicko? Capitol Hills become Capitol Kill, Air Force One has become Air Force Gone, brackets it crashed.
Only Jack Ryan can stop DC from being blown back to BC. And then there's like another bit here, Phil, do you want to read this out?
Yeah, praise for the writer who once spilled coffee on Tom Clancy. A story so nebulous even Jack Ryan doesn't seem to know what's going on. The Guardian.
At last, a book that gets my world. Deep Web Forum Boy. Finally, a story that offends no one by being irrelevant to everyone.
Columnist denied for their Twitter verification. From the author of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Helix credits XXL pack, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Cobalt Weapon Skin.
I mean, so yes, you're right. I was wrote back into this one, Phil. But I feel like we enjoyed putting this together.
Like it wasn't hard and it came together quite quickly. Is that what you remember about this one?
Yeah, both of these I remember being incredibly easy to write. Different memories of us just both in that Google Doc giggling as we just added extra lines and tweaked things around the various paragraphs. Like this one definitely feels to me, I think we had more of a point when we did this because I think we were kind of disappointed at just like this would have been around the time that Ubisoft really pushed some of its like, oh, we're just making apolitical games here, we're not trying to say anything and it's like, look at the world you've crafted, surely you could say something here, like you're primed to have an opinion about all this political imagery.
I think there is a bit more bite to this one in terms of actually criticizing the publisher.
Yeah, for sure. I think our real feelings on it are like summed up by finally a story that offends no one by being irrelevant to everyone, but that's very much us kind of coming through there. And yeah, it was like, it is weird.
I couldn't tell you what really happens in The Division 2 other than Washington DC clears out and then you're fighting all these guys, but I can't remember any of the context, but it's a game I played for 60 hours for review and really enjoyed. Otherwise, a great shooter and a really cool open world to explore, one of my, probably one of the best.
Very much of it.
Yeah, it was good.
Were there surprise robot bees?
I think there were. I think, like, I believe that one of the factions had, like, little robot lads they brought into battle with them. I think that's right.
Yeah, definitely remember robot dogs.
Yeah. So I think that was the thing, like, when they added some of the end game content, it was like you got your regular army guys, but then you got your bee guys and your robot guys. So yeah, that rings a bell.
There's definitely some lines in here I can identify as, like, Phil lines. This is recent enough that I do remember coming up with, Only Jack Ryan Can Stop DC From Being Blown Back to BC, which sadly is the best thing I've ever in.
That is a classic Roberts sign off there.
Do you recognize bits of that you came up with, Phil? I feel like the 450 rated knee pads thing was you.
That could be me. I think definitely Air Force One has become Air Force Gone brackets it crashed. Explaining the joke in brackets in an absurd way is absolutely something I would have found hilarious at the time.
Very good. Yeah, I think this is my favourite one that we worked on for sure. Both of us worked on.
But Matthew, what do you think?
Yeah, this one's really good. And it doesn't have the dynamite made of poo or whatever it was to throw me out of it. It's I'm just completely in start to finish.
Yeah, I like I like the Capitol Hill's become capital kill, the Air Force gone and the blown back to BC. Those are all killer. I really like the the the bit about him having no discernible political views of his own.
Yeah, this is, like you say, a little bit more bite to it. And, you know, very true to the Division Two experience. Yeah, it's a good.
That's a that's a banger. Yeah, all is forgiven after they are over a din hour.
Fair enough. Well, then we come to the final one, which I picked because it's just quite interesting that it even happened. So this is basically a parody of a Japanese RPG, specifically Octopath Traveler.
And I remember there being a Square Enix component to like how this came together. And there's like a PC Gamer cover. And there's a bunch of commands, as you'd have in a Japanese RPG.
The top one says, banter. And then just under that, it says, cast last-minute back page joke on one of the other commands. And you see the name of the different team members down the side there.
And I mean, it's got, what can I say, original pixel art by Square Enix's artists. So, and the disappointing thing is, I'm the least distinctive looking one there. I think it's based on one photo that was, I put on Facebook of me at a wedding, like years earlier, and it has me holding a beer, which I think is a reference to me being a big craft beer guy, which was true when I was on PC Gamer.
Phil, you're on a little balloon being carried away, which was a great back page gag that we did when we were both on the Mac as well. So, yes, what are your memories of this one coming together?
Yeah, this was a weird one around the PR cycle for Octopath Traveler. Square Enix rep got in touch and said, Oh, our artist can create some little pixel guys for you. Would you like if we did this and you could use them for the bio pictures that are in the front of the mag?
And I was wary of doing that just because it was like, okay, I mean, that is, you know, a very, there are little jokes in the intro and stuff, but it's largely informational. I didn't want to hitch it to a marketing thing, really. And so instead, I sort of counteroffered, it's like, this sounds fun.
Can we do it for our joke page instead? And I guess they were like, yeah, sure, I guess.
Yeah, it's crazy, though, that like, those artists, like, they made, they made Tom Senior out of pixels. They did a great job.
They did a really good job with Tom. And Andy's one is really good as well. I don't, I can't remember why he's covered in pets.
Yeah, he's got loads of little animals, but there's, there's a foot, I remember that exact blue shirt that it's based on.
Yes.
And the little like prey post, it's from like one photo that went in the mag like years earlier. And then there's Melindi in the corner with a stack of books as well. And it's just very like, very thoughtfully done.
The slightly confusing element is the grainy PC Gamer cover in the center of it, which I suppose like was trying to adapt the art style, but how's that weird feeling of like an InDesign file is missing?
Yeah, I think that's one that's gonna put the fear into anybody who's worked on magazines specifically. Yeah. Because that is what an InDesign, that kind of pixelation is what InDesign looks like when it doesn't have the images to actually work from.
So it just uses like a placeholder version that are incredibly grainy and pixelated. So you get very used to, as an editor, like writing around that version of the magazine before the art editor then like puts it back into its proper place and all the images are loaded in when it actually goes into the FlatBlan software. And so, yeah, it does give me a little bit of the fear every time I look at that page and every time I looked at it in the, because it just looks like an in-design error.
I'm like, oh God, did we fuck it? Oh no, that was meant to be.
Yeah, I totally get that anxiety. The sort of thing that this really dialed home for me is like, what a generic white man I am. Like when I saw the, whenever I see that wall of like PS3 character faces, where it's like, can you name all of these characters?
And it's like one bloke from LucasArts Fracture or whatever. And then like that bloke from Resistance. I'm like, I'm just one of those, man.
Like I'm just another of these PS3 jacket potatoes. I wasn't even distinctive enough for the Square Enix artist to pull out like one distinguishing detail about me. So that's kind of what I remember this one for.
But Matthew, what do you think of this one?
Well, I like that you have this mad drama associated with this sprite of you.
What would say Trauber? Just you know, sort of like, it's just as a general kind of like learning, you know?
Yeah, I'm just really jealous when stuff like this happens. It reminds me of a Fisherman Teno magazine when I was on NGamer. I think they did like a My Sims cover and they designed like all the teamers My Sims and they just look really legit.
They look like character models from the game and we never got that treatment. So, but if I can look past my jealousy, I mean, yeah, it's cool. It's a cool flex to have Square make you a sprites and put you on there.
Though, yeah, my eye is always drawn to that pixelated, weird PC Gamer magazine cover for the same reasons you laid out. But yes, this is a good one. This is a thumbs up.
It's the text that really doesn't... If I was to go back, if I could offer some feedback to me of six years ago, it's like, just use a subs cover with no text on it instead.
Great call.
It will look less weird.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's a great call, actually. But no, I think it's cool that it happened.
These days, Phil, me and Matthew are kind of like hoping that the golden idol devs turn us into their kind of like warped little potato man.
That would be the dream, yeah.
That would be good. So we hope one day that that will happen.
They don't even have to do anything to me. I just look like one of those fucked up characters.
Do you know what the terrible tragedy that will have led to your collective murders and or murdering of the scene would be?
I mean, I can't offer that because it will make my criticism of your Obra Dinn page suddenly look very frenzy if I can't come up with something better.
Yeah, I'm sure some kind of print media related incident, no doubt, would be thematically appropriate. But again, much like the missing InDesign file, joke not found, Matthew. So we'll simply wrap up there and say thank you to Phil for his time.
Really appreciate it, Phil. Thank you. I know it's been a pleasure.
Two hours of your evening, but some really thoughtful discussion there. And nice to chat about ARC Raiders if you're on the record, actually. That was cool.
Where can people get you on social media? They basically can't anymore. Theoretically, I am on BlueSky at Oktader, but I'll be damned if I ever check in on either of them anymore.
PCGamer then, pcgamer.com is the best. That's where you can find me. You can chow at me at the comment sections and I might even read it.
Nice. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on BlueSky and Letterboxd.
Nice. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both those platforms, The Podcasts, The Back PagePod.
patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support the creation of the podcast financially. And that's it. Catch you later.
Thanks for coming on again, Phil, and yeah, see you later. Bye bye. Goodbye.
