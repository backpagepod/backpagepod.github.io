Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's your toe doing this morning? For the listeners' benefit, I went around Matthew's house last night. We were playing a game that's under embargo.
Yeah, that's all I'll say for now. Don't get too excited. It's fine.
But anyway, I went around there, started playing with Matthew and Catherine, and Matthew went into his kitchen, turned out of a doorway, smacked his toe straight into a radiator. I wouldn't say it overshadowed the evening, but I would say it was like a fixture of the evening. So how's it going today?
It's quite bruised and still hurts quite a lot. Hopefully, I've not done anything serious to it. It felt like the Gamescom knee, but in miniature.
Yeah, nice callback that really, isn't it? A physical injury, comedy callback. That's good.
Yeah, it became like a nice center point for the evening that everyone could joke about. And when we were having a bad time playing redacted game, we could at least laugh at my increasingly swelling toe.
Indeed, that very much gave the evening a bit of color.
And that color was the dark, dark purple of a horrible bruise.
Indeed, Matthew. So this episode is of What We've Been Playing. Last week, of course, was a PS4 draft.
Last time I looked at Matthew, he was slightly ahead in the voting. It was fairly close between me, you and Dave. So Bloodborne did ruin the draft as anticipated.
Some people in the Discord were like, I only voted for Bloodborne, hee hee hee. And obviously, we enjoyed that a lot. That was good.
So generous impression.
Yeah, absolutely. I think I gave them the respect they deserved there. So that's good.
But yeah, that was a fun one. I think we did have three very strong sets of picks, so the split is not too surprising there. I don't think anyone really biffed it.
So that is ongoing. The three-way drafts have gone down very well, Matthew. I think we'll be doing more of those.
What do you think?
Yeah, we've just got to find the right people, because they do require quite a lot of prep, and, you know, shout out to both Jeremy and Dave for, you know, having, you know, bringing the stuff for a good draft, because the nightmare scenario is that you bring, like, one game for each category, and then when those games disappear, you know, you're insta-fucked and then have to desperately scramble to make it work. But they, yeah, I felt like they were both really, really well prepared for it.
Yeah, you've got to take it quite seriously in some ways. And so, yeah, Jeremy and Dave, they really met us halfway on that. That's when I've been thinking about who we get for PS2 redraft, et cetera.
I'm worried, will they get it in the way that we get it? You know, there's that, there's always that concern. So, yeah, we'll give that some more thought, but definitely three-way drafts.
I feel like a rich new vein for this podcast. It's definitely had a layer of competition or competitiveness that it didn't have before, so that's going to be fun, Matthew. So, three really good games to talk about in this episode.
Well, actually, I don't mean in terms of the get quality of the games. I mean in terms of the, you know, the scale of blockbusters we're getting. We are in silly season, so plenty of new games coming out all the time.
We're going to start off with Metaphor Re-Fantasio, the new Atlus RPG, and then we've got the newer Zelda game to discuss, and also the Silent Hill 2 remake, the critical reception to which has been universally positive, and much to everyone's surprise after we all had to read about nine million op-eds saying this is going to be shit a few years ago. So, you know, that's a nice surprise, a pleasant surprise. So Matthew, you're the one who's been playing Metaphor.
You're very much carrying this episode. As of last night, you played 40 hours of this game, a lot, not insignificant amount. And I think people, I think your perspective on this will be really interesting to people because by the time they're listening to this, the game will be out.
The review embargo would have lifted. And I'm imagining this is going to get a pretty glowing critical reception across the board. I imagine this will get a lot of like nines, probably, you know, probably mostly nines, maybe even a couple of tens.
But you and your take on this, I mean, it's very intriguing. So why don't you get into it?
Yeah, so just for to catch people up who haven't necessarily been following this metaphor refantasio is basically what Mr. Persona did next. So Katsura Hoshino, who directed Persona's 3, 4 and 5, he left Pea Studio, which makes the Persona games in 2016, because he wanted to make something that wasn't Persona, apply all his know-how to something completely new. And they formed a new internal development studio, Atlus, called Studio Zero, bringing with it many of the creative leads from the Persona team.
So it really does, you know, feel like from the outset kind of what the Persona gang is going to do next, which is why I was really excited. I think you're pretty excited too, right? Is that fair to say?
Oh, yeah, really buzzed for this. I just thought that's surely a winning combination. They've been teasing for years.
They were making this fantasy RPG in an original universe. I just thought win-win, right?
On paper, fantastic. What's this guy going to do with this genre? In truth, if you really want to boil it down, he's made he's made another Persona game, but kind of reskinned it to be a fancy setting.
Everything that makes Persona Persona is in this game one way or another. So to give you a broad overview of what those what that means, in case you haven't played a Persona game and are interested about jumping in here, it is an RPG governed by time. This is a world where you are on a calendar and every day you have limited time to achieve something in this world.
And the way they put pressure on this is that there are key story beats that you have to hit. So in the case of Metaphor Refantasio, at the very outset of the game, the opening cutscene, the king of this fantasy kingdom is killed and it basically starts the sort of succession process for this kingdom, which is based on an election and a sort of magical election, it's sort of governed by magic powers and it's probably the most interesting thing in this game is that hook. This idea that all these people are competing to be king and they're following these strange arcane rules.
And as part of this election, there are naturally a series of deadlines to hit, because there are certain kind of political events, sort of hustings that you're going to. And so you have to kind of prepare for those things. So where in Persona you were racing against the clock to save someone's life by a certain time, here you're always racing against the clock to hit your next beat on the political trail.
So that's kind of the time element of it. How you spend your time in this world, again, very similar to Persona. You can go and do the dungeon, which is the story element at any given time, which you are chipping away at.
That's the thing you have to complete by the end of the deadline. You can improve yourself as a person by doing activities, narrative events in the world. Like they're not mini games or anything like that.
You're not actually doing anything. You can go and like sit on a bench and look at the horizon and it will improve your imagination. And by improving yourself as a person, there are then certain ability checks that you'll be able to pass.
So as you improve as a person, the world opens up further. And the third strand is your social connections. So how you choose to spend your time in this world, hanging out with party members, but also other kind of crucial NPCs.
Which, you know, if you've played a persona, all that's going to be very, very familiar to you. It's all about balancing your diary, making sure you're making progress in the main story, while also developing yourself and your social bonds, so that you, as a hero, can achieve more in the dungeon for the said story beat. So it's this big kind of soup.
It's an amazing structure. It's one of like the great RPG structures, I think. And there is still fundamentally a lot of fun to be had from that.
And if you liked it in Persona, you will like it here. Where I begin to have problems with this game is that there is a little bit of disappointment that they are just doing this structure again. And that given that they started work on this in 2016, seven year projects, basically, it kind of bums me out that he has just made Persona.
I really that may sound like I'm doing Persona down by saying just, but I was kind of like, Oh, right, we really are just doing this. Okay, that's a little bit of the sheen of this game for me. I think my bigger problem with it is I think the structure of Persona is so well suited to the teenager setting and story of the Persona games.
Because when you are a teenager, you are a person whose time is very, very precious and is dictated by lots of external factors. The hook of Persona is how do you save the world while also being a good teenager, hanging out with your mates, going to school, doing well in exams, getting a part-time job. That's the great joke at the heart of Persona, isn't it?
Is that Dungeoneering becomes just part of this busy schedule and the anxiety of trying to achieve everything. I think setting that in a fantasy setting with a load of adults in a JRPG party, doesn't make as much sense. It isn't as narratively neat.
It feels like a step backwards to me. I just think narratively it feels a lot sloppier because of that. Not so nitpicky that, you know, why are these heroes going to bed at the end of the day?
Or who's to tell these heroes that they can't keep adventuring? It maybe feels a bit arbitrary that you do a dungeon and they're like, well, we're not going to do anything tonight because we're all tired. And you're like, fair enough, but I thought that that made a lot more sense in the setting of Persona than it does here.
I think the other major problem I have with it is it's just no way near as cool as Persona. You know, Persona is this incredibly trendy escapist fantasy of going into these, you know, contemporary Japanese settings, hanging out with these incredibly cool characters. It's got this amazing, whatever it is, acid jazz soundtrack.
I mean, it's just completely electric. And this game instead chooses to step into a fantasy world, which is really quite like many other fantasy worlds we've seen. If anything, why Persona is electric is because it is different to, like, the 30 years of JRPGs that came before.
And this game goes, no, let's just sign up to that, let's do more of that. And as a fantasy world goes, I don't think it has any original ideas. Bar this election hook, which I do think is cool, it's quite boring fantasy races, quite a boring fantasy setting, deserts, big castle town, caves.
I mean, I feel like I've seen this all before, where that is just not something you could ever say of Persona. You know, that game is just so daring. And golf between that and what everyone else was doing was so vast and this to me, I was amazed at how vanilla a lot of it felt, which is just so disappointing.
Yeah, it's kind of my sort of overarching thought. It's good. Look, don't get me wrong.
It's still like absolutely rock solid. And, you know, there's a lot of, there's a huge amount of craft in this game, but it can't help but feel like a step down to me.
It's really interesting, because I suppose that was always the risk of them doing, like I think it was called, I think it was called Project Fantasy or something like that.
Re-Fantasy, I think.
Yeah, so it kind of suggested something that was going to be quite subversive or different, or like, wow, this is the Persona creator's take on this kind of high fantasy universe. So then, yeah, and then, you know, in your hands, at least, it feels like, oh, this is just a step back tonally. Like, it's all of the different Persona accoutrement is here in terms of it as an RPG, and they're being a great sort of like cycle to walk to the game.
But I don't know, man, like, you're right. It's the contemporary setting. It's like stepping into a world, living a life that you, you know, you as like, I don't know, growing up in sort of gray sky British towns might find aspirational or exciting, like teenagers living in Japan.
And that's like, you know, that is an exciting fantasy to tap into. So, when you are going into this broader fantasy tonal spectrum, you do risk just maybe seeming more pedestrian than you otherwise would. So, it's interesting.
Yeah. And what's really interesting about Persona is that you have this contemporary setting, which itself is presented in quite an abstract way. But then, you know, they step into a fantasy world, you know, they step into these mind palaces or, you know, Mementos or Tartarus in 3.
There is this very clear divide between, like, the everyday world and what is interesting. And when you're in a fantasy RPG setting, as metaphor is, it doesn't really, it can't play with that kind of comparison ever. You are in fantasy JRPG all the time, and actually walking around the main city town in this area, aesthetically, doesn't look or sound any different to when you are in dungeons.
It feels a lot more one note, and you realize that one of Persona's great kind of coups is the way that it has the ability to take you to two very different places. And here you're like, oh, it's just a, it's all painted in the same colors. It's very drab feeling, which is what really surprised me.
It has the extraordinary UI and scene transitions, text boxes, menu screens, the battle UI, you know, all that. You're like, yes, I absolutely expect this from the team, but it's never particularly cool. The only thing which is like truly extraordinary, I like that there are a class of enemies in this game, which they refer to as humans at the point I'm at in the story that hasn't like revealed any greater relevance why they are called humans, but I imagine it's something.
And they are almost a little bit like the attack on Titan, giant naked humans, they're huge for one, but then they've got some quite like sort of perverse, weird abstract imagery around them. They're kind of the closest thing to like the bosses that you would have got at the end of Persona's mind palaces, for example, where you see something you're like, oh, that's truly unusual. And whenever one of them turns up, you're like, oh great, this is more like it, but they're kind of reserved for like boss, big boss fights, which are quite few and far between.
So, you know, maybe this stuff's going to really resonate with other people, but I found a lot of it like surprisingly flat. I mean, probably the biggest disappointment, I think the music in this game is absolutely like the most generic JLPG soundtrack.
Oh no, that's like the one thing you always depend on them for.
It's a space where like so much amazing work is done in JLPG soundtracks. Don't get me wrong, there are a few tracks which are great. I quite like the battle theme, it's got this mad, I think it's some kind of Buddhist chant, but hyped up to a mad speed.
That's certainly very striking, but really so much of the music in this washed over me. Where this year, when it came out of Rebirth, which is just this maximal soundtrack that I just adored, I thought, man, this is like nothing. I can't harm any of this.
That may not sound like, who cares? It's not like every game has amazing music, but with so much of this game, it's like given the pedigree, given what the team did before, I'm just amazed that it's as unimpactful as it is.
I mean, it's a bit of a bummer because I did think this was going to be a game of the year contender. I will say that some of the things you've mentioned, like the drab environments, for example, that is quite apparent in the trailers they've put out. It's a lot of brown, kind of like, I don't know, deserty looking places and stuff.
It's sort of like the color palette, again, is a big part of why Persona really pops. I guess the UI is good though, Matthew. They got those nice UI bits.
Yes, the UI is good. And part of me is thinking like, is this just because I'm a bit of a Japanphile or a weeb-lite, I think I would call myself. And that's why I enjoy Persona so much.
And I know some people find Persona quite trite and don't like the teenage thing. And will they find this more...
Who are those people? Who gives a fuck about those people?
Well, yeah, well, maybe the team behind Letterford. Like, maybe a game about, quote unquote, adults. I mean, they look like the teenage characters from Persona to me, but they are allegedly adults.
Sounds like an excuse in court, that.
With more adult concerns, like, I would say like 40 hours in, there's no kind of hint of any romance system in this game. Like, your alliances are political alliances with characters. You know, they're not, they're friendships, but they're not, no one is a love interest.
You can't date the characters, for example. I feel like they've stripped that out to kind of go, well, this is a grown up game. This is a grown up business.
But actually, it's like a lot of what it's dealing with, it's just the same in Persona, you know, it's like you meet a character and in the course of a quest, their anxiety comes to the, you know, comes front and center and then you learn to deal with it through the power of friendship.
Right.
Like there's a lot of that, which I don't think is much, you know, hasn't really moved the needle on what Persona was doing. I'd really had high hopes for the election element, that it was going to be a bit more, you know, that it was going to deal with like, you know, politics or what happens in a political race, but it's quite cartoonish. Like it reminds me more of anything, of there's the Harry Potter book where they have like the big competition with all the schools.
Oh, the Triwizard Tournament.
The Triwizard Tournament, that's what it feels like. It's like by this date, all the candidates have got to find the biggest X and then everyone races off to try and find it to impress the crowd. And you're like, it feels like quite silly and, you know, teen friendly to me, given that this is meant to be their grand departure.
Well, I won't lie that when you said, when you described the political element and you used the word hustings, like the wind went out of my sails so fast when you said that. I was like, oh my God. It's like, why are we not getting laid?
We're in a fantasy universe, these are adults. Why are people not getting laid? That's what adults actually want in an RPG.
Well, not in this world, you know, it all comes down to this election. And there are literal hustings in this game. Like there's one of the activities that you can spend your daily time on is like debating rival candidates.
I say debating, I mean, they basically stand on a stage, say like a few lines, and then you have to just pick one of three options and hope it's the one which the crowd are going to like. But they're always really obvious. You know, someone's like, you know, we should murder everyone in the town.
And then you have to stand up and go, I don't think we should do that. And the crowd's like, this kid's really got the stuff. And you're like, great.
You know, it's, you know, I'm not, I wasn't, I didn't expect it to be like some great satire on politics, particularly because politics is so different, like on a country to country basis, you know. I didn't expect there to be any like, you're like, oh no, you ate some bacon, you know, and someone took a picture of you like, like, you know, like, that, that would have been too much to ask. But you do, you forget a lot about the election thing.
Like occasionally you do side quests, which improve like your political ranking. And whenever that thing popped up, I was like, oh yeah, that's what this game's about. I'm trying to become like king.
That's right, that makes sense. But yeah, one thing I will say for it, actually that is quite key to it is, I will say mechanically, they've got rid of their kind of monster catching stuff from Persona and they've made it a job system. But it's quite a different take on the job system to what you might be expecting in that you're quite free to recalibrate everyone's class in this game.
Like there's a currency you earn in battle, but it's quite easy to come by that lets you change character classes. And often it feels like dungeons and particularly bosses are like puzzles to be solved by recalibrating your party to have the right classes, as opposed to, well, I'm going to pick these five classes at the outset of the game and I'm just going to grind them up. Like you'll max out the class in maybe, you know, eight to ten hours, say, and move on to the next one.
But then you are expected to kind of rejig your party. And I don't know if you remember in Persona, there was a feature where you could press a button to see what other people did with their time on the same day.
Oh, I don't think I ever press that button.
Right. Well, you could you could press it. And it went well, at this point in the game, 15% of the players decided to go into the dungeon, 20% went and ate a burger or whatever.
This has a similar thing, except when you press the button at any given time, it shows you what the composition of everyone else's party was.
Right.
And I think that just gives you an indicator of either how valid lots of different compositions are, because they were all wildly different when I looked at it, or it's an indicator of that you aren't meant to be precious. You know, this guy isn't going to be your healer. He's going to be a healer, then he's going to be a knight, then he's going to be like one of the goofy, weirder classes you unlock.
And you just have to be, you know, often a weak version of the right class is better than a strong version of the wrong class. And being able to have that flexibility kind of unlocks the combat a lot more. Like a lot of my characters are proficient in like five classes.
Like, you know, I'm not going to say the specifics of it, but there's one dungeon in the game which is just four boss fights. And the four bosses are so different that you need to basically bring a different party to each fight. And in your like, it gives you like 18 days to do this dungeon.
You're like 18 days to just do four fights. But then it expects you to kind of go in and go, oh shit, I can't fight this boss currently, leave, go and do some grinding elsewhere and like level up your party and come back. And I quite like that mechanically, like I never truly love the monster hoarding of Persona.
Like the fusion stuff always kind of stressed me out a bit that I was getting like a bad deal. And I think this is quite a, you know, of everything it does, I'd say this is the most valid attempt to like do something new in the JRPG space, by sort of treating it as a much more flexible solution to like an immediate problem rather than a game long commitment. And I think that's quite interesting.
Yeah, that is intriguing. So I agree that I think in some ways, Persona, they all of them, they all allow you to basically have a very superficial relationship with the combat and the progression generally and just be like, well, I'll just keep this one monster I like and I'll whack it on easy mode or whatever. And then you'll never really be challenged to engage with the system more generally.
So you never really figure out the ceiling for it in terms of complexity or mastery, because you don't have to. You can just enjoy focusing on the life sim bits and then the combat is just something nice and flashy to look at. And you enjoy all of the Phantom Thieves doing their little finisher moves and stuff.
And that's fine. Like they, it feels deliberately scaled for that. But I think the idea of breaking form with that is probably not a bad idea because it's true that, yeah, that combat side of things is something I barely even think about when I consider the Persona experience.
It is more the life sim stuff and the writing and the cutscenes.
It also, you know, because in Persona, there was a connection between the social bonds and the monster rearing.
Yeah.
In that, different characters had different, like it was like the Tarot symbols, wasn't it? And if you had a strong relationship with X person, then X monsters would be stronger. And here, every character you befriend is tied to one of the job classes.
And the further you push your relationship with them, like the more stuff you can do in those job classes. So it feels maybe a bit more focused in that. But again, it's like a refinement on something that feels very familiar, rather than anything kind of daringly new.
I just don't know why he left Persona to make something just so similar to Persona. Like the talk of, oh, I really want to try something new. And I feel like it's so Persona-y.
Yeah.
It's just odd.
Is there a little bit of like, I don't know, that's kind of what counts as revolutionary, maybe to a Japanese game developer. Like, you use the expertise you have, and then maybe you push a few different things in a new direction, you create a new universe. And that is your version of like, something fresh and new, as opposed to completely changing the paradigm, making a different...
I don't know. I mean, that's...
I feel the leap from Persona 4 to Persona 5 was much greater than the leap from Persona 5 to Metaphor. And given that Metaphor is a big push to step away from Persona 5, that seems wrong to me.
Yeah, massive push. They've been pushing this really hard. And, you know, it's got a four-hour demo.
People can play it before they buy it and see what they think.
Yeah.
That does lead me to, I think, the key question, Matthew, because I do wonder if you're going to be an outlier on this or if you have more people in your corner going, well, actually, this universe isn't that exciting. And I would rather go on a date with Makoto than go to Hustings. You know, like it's, you know, what can I say?
What do you think, where do you think critically this is going to land, if you had to guess?
I think, so weird, I will say for all my problems with it, like, it's still, it's still better than, you know, it's definitely not less than a 7. Like I could see a world where I give this like an 8. Right.
You know, it's just that.
Edge 7 then.
I was expecting a 10, you know?
Right.
That's, that's the thing. I really was expecting a 10 from this. I think, I don't know.
You see, I would, I keep thinking, you're probably going to give this to Persona fans to review. And I would think they would have the similar reaction to me in that they'd feel the disappointment unless they are just so all in on Persona, that just having another Persona game is like more than enough. Yeah.
Like if I'd said at the start of the year, like I thought this game is going to get less than 90, like I just didn't think that would be possible. I think it deserves to be more of an 8.
That's not really that low.
Maybe let's split the difference and say, let's say a Metacritic of 85.
Yeah. Well, I wonder if it's one of those games where people go bananas for it and then a year from now people are like, that wasn't quite as fun as Persona. You know what I mean?
Yeah. And I don't mean to cast suspersions on the kind of people who do like a Persona game, I include myself amongst them. But I do think it's a lot drier from a first perspective.
And also, when you play Persona, you're like, oh, this stuff's going to look electric as cosplay. And I didn't really get a lot of that. Like, it's so muted and boring metaphor.
But I do think that is part of it. You know, I just really don't know. I'm kind of glad I'm not having to properly review it because I feel like there's always kind of like baggage with it.
Well, also, I haven't finished it. Maybe it'll be like absolutely blinding at the end. I feel like I'm only halfway through it with about 40 hours played.
The interesting thing is, I wonder if this would be... It sounds like a ridiculous scenario, but let's say Persona 5 never existed and you went from Persona 4 to this. Persona 4 has great memorable characters in it, has definitely the first factor involved as well.
But I do also think that the step up with 5 was so enormous in terms of how the Phantom Thieves all look when in costume in the mind palaces and stuff. It was just so visually remarkable. It's almost like it's created a rod for their own backs really.
If you just can't get anywhere near that in terms of style, color, quality, it's just tricky.
Yeah. I just thought the heist thing was so exciting in Persona 5. It gave it this real momentum.
You're like, I just can't wait to fuck another one of these guys over. This is going to be great. This one here, the big beats are generally, there's things you've done so many times in a JRPG.
It's like, there's a monster in a castle, there's a monster in a cave, something evil is taking over our temple. I've seen that a million times before. The brilliance of Persona was to basically take the nuts and bolts of that, but kind of reframe it and recontextualize it into something just so out there that you didn't really mind that you would, what you were doing is kind of the same thing, but it just shows you the importance of that framing.
Yeah. I've done this so many times, yeah.
Interesting. Well, Metaphor is available now. Maybe it will come up again on the podcast, I'm not sure.
But I spoke to Matthew yesterday, he sounded not entirely thrilled about putting a load more hours into this.
The particular mission beat in Montenoma, I won't spoil it, I'll say involves an island, is so boring. It's so boring and I've got like 18 days to do it, I'm like, I just don't know if I want to do this cycle in this game again. Yeah.
Okay. Well, look, that's a nice meaty chat there about one of the most anticipated games of the year and a genuinely interesting perspective on it as well. So, thank you for your honesty as ever, Matthew Castle.
Okay. So, our next game then is The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom, a game by Grezzo, developers of 2019's Link's Awakening remake that was very much in this sort of like toy box visual style. Went down really well for the most part, well reviewed, people really liked it.
I still marginally prefer the original game just because I think it still looks and feels amazing when you're playing it on any screen these days, the DX version in particular. Talks about Link's Awakening plenty on this podcast. So, Grezzo basically got a chance to make their own Zelda game off the back of that success.
And five years later, here we are, Echoes of Wisdom, a game where you play as Zelda in a game where Link disappears at the start, gets pulled into this rift thing, this sort of like dark portal. And then you as Zelda are imprisoned, but you escape from Hyrule Castle and then basically have to go around the world, closing these different rifts, which are spreading throughout the world, like these kind of like big purple cracks, basically as they appear in the environment and saving the citizens of Hyrule therein. But mechanically, it's got something quite different going on, it's a game where Zelda can summon items and also enemies to the field, enemies who can do basically her bidding, who will attack other enemies for you as you kill, new types of enemies, you can learn those and you're endlessly dropping in new objects to solve puzzles in the game, to reach higher areas in the game, even dropping a little bed in the environment to have a little rest.
But it's a combat system where you are endlessly summoning little traditional Zelda enemies, familiar Zelda enemies, to help you deal with different monsters around the world. Interesting game, Matthew, I think we've played almost exactly the same amount of it. And I wonder if we should start with you before we get to me.
I think that would be the right way around to do it. So I was curious what you made of this attempt to do something a bit fresher with Zelda, at this time where the Switch is kind of winding down. It's very much a Zelda in the handheld Zelda mold, as opposed to the kind of Breath of the Wild, you know, sort of like, yeah, like, monstrously large, all-encompassing, open-world, blockbuster style of Zelda.
It's definitely scaled down, but I would say the scale is still lovely. You know, it's actually quite welcome. But I'm curious what you've made of it so far.
I'm really enjoying it. So I've played a couple of Dungeons. I think the first point, I think it's really exciting that this was made by Grezzo, and the idea of not farming out Zelda, but allowing other teams to make new Zelda games, under the watchful eye of internal Nintendo producers.
That's really exciting, because it suggests a future where we will get a few more Zelda games, rather than having to wait whatever, seven, eight years for the next Tears of the Kingdom or like, or whatever it is they make. That's cool. I think that they've just made something that's quite an unusual Zelda game, in that, you know, it does look like the 2D top-down one, which I associate with being a bit more kind of restrained in terms of ideas, or certainly a lot more kind of traditional.
But they've mapped into it, you know, I'd say a couple of systems in both the echoes, and you also have this ability to kind of harness to items, which lets you move items around, which isn't too exciting, but also like echo the movement of that thing. And that's kind of an interesting power in itself. Like there's actually a...
I can imagine a Zelda game where that is the gimmick, without all the echoes. Like a gimmick where a character can harness something and then absorb their movement through by being harnessed to them. That's almost like a game, you know, game length idea.
But yeah, so you've got this layer of like quite sort of systemic ideas on top of like this very traditional 2D Zelda map. And currently I'm finding that really potent. I love the fact that in collecting these echoes, whether they're objects or enemies, you get a range of abilities, which I would say like already, having only done two dungeons, kind of rival the variety of like links inventory in a whole Zelda.
I feel like the verbs available to me to tackle challenges are already like huge. And I feel like I've only got a fraction of the echoes. It's not just a case of like summoning enemies to fight on your behalf.
There are trampolines which jump you over gaps. There are obviously lots of bits of furniture, which you can build up into like makeshift ladders. There are spiders whose webs you can climb.
And so that becomes like a whole interesting kind of variation of almost like a kind of vertical hook shot, which you can fire into the ceiling and use to kind of climb up. So, you know, all of a sudden, the kind of height of a room becomes part of the puzzle design. There's a mole echo that lets you dig down.
And you know, the digging mitts have been a thing in Zelda before, but you know, normally you'd get one item per dungeon. And here, it's actually certainly in this opening stretch, I feel like I've been bombarded with abilities. So, you know, Zelda is already incredibly capable.
And from a traditional kind of Zelda dungeon design perspective, it's quite kind of interesting to see them try and design for that and like build challenges that, you know, can't, you know, the big joke in this game is that everyone thought you were just gonna go into every room and then build a pile of beds to just climb over whatever the game threw at you. And actually seeing it try and not allow that to happen, to see them try and design for such a varied skill set. I think that's quite interesting to me.
It's like, it's where the wild imagination of the systemic echoes kind of comes up against with what you want from like traditional Zelda dungeon design. I think that's what's currently got me super engaged. How about you?
So when I first started playing this game, I thought that the inventiveness of that ability to summon in anything that you found in the world was very exciting. I enjoyed dropping like a sea urchin on top of an enemy when you got to the side scrolling Link's Awakening style bits. You just like, I'll just drop a sea urchin from you above, from above and then like, I like the idea of using traditional Zelda iconography to basically get one over on the enemies.
And I was like, okay, well, that makes this feel like it's working and it's exciting. But I will say that I would say that even though I'm at the same point as you, I already feel like it's work. And there's a few reasons for that.
One, I think that the enemies you get, it's like you're playing a tower defense game where the enemies aren't playing by tower defense rules. Because you're dropping enemies in there who perform slow animations because they're designed to be killed by a player character. They are meant to do certain moves at a certain time.
So you'll drop in a bunch of sword, goblin lads, moblins, is that what they're called? I can't remember. And then they will go and swipe an enemy.
And then it might be, they've got slightly faster attack animations. They took those out quickly. And I'm like, okay, well, I'll drop in the little firebomb lads and throw that at them.
And I'll just set everything on fire and that will resolve it too. And that definitely has a novel kind of appeal to it. But I will say that as you accumulate more and more stuff, and you're dealing with this, I would say not very flexible inventory management system where you've got four different ways to sort all the items you've got, but you don't have hotkeys to select key items that you can have over and over again.
You can only drop one thing in at a time. That combined with the fact that they don't, I think it's a real cop-out that they've got the ability to turn into Link temporarily. I think that shows a lack of conviction in the main idea.
So when I got to the end of that second dungeon, and I will say the dungeons aren't terribly inspiring, particularly the bosses which usually require one slightly rote solution, I just thought this feels like quite hard work. I'm at the point now where I just did another of the mini-rifts that were on the way to the next dungeon, so I'm not really enjoying this. I think it's just because she's not quite powerful enough.
I almost wish that they'd done something like have, instead of the Link turn into Link power, they had Zelda turns into Sheik power or something like that. It's something that was more her moveset. In some ways, it just makes her this very passive protagonist where, all I can do is drop enemies in and hope for the best.
It just leads to a lot of hapless spamming of enemies to take on other enemies. I'm sure that you get to a point where you unlock a couple of really strong enemies, you'd be like, ha ha ha, yeah, this is really exciting. But I would say it's lacking those moments so far, and ends up just being like a big mess of stuff.
But the inventory screen is my real bug bear. I turned the game back on when I was on the train today and I just went, fucking two beds and all these tables and where's my fucking trampoline? It's just like a lot of scrolling through stuff.
And it just feels a bit inelegant to me. Like it's, I think it's missing something. I don't know.
It desperately needs like a separate favourites.
Yeah, it does.
Toolbar, which you can customise to be like the 10 things you want. Because like I say, I've kind of boiled down, a lot of the things you look at them and you're like, well, this thing is actually, it's actually this item. You know, like I always want a spider because I want to be able to climb up walls quickly.
I want a mole because I want to be able to dig through things. You know, this is the strongest enemy I have at this given time. Now, if I could make a toolbar of like 10 of those, I think it would be much smoother.
I do agree with you on the combat. There's like a little bit of like, what if novelty of like, you know, oh, I wonder who would win in a fight between a dark nut and, you know, fucking green blob or whatever. And just sort of putting them in and seeing them fight.
There's like a little bit of novelty in that. But in a lot of the combat, I do run past a lot of the enemies, I'll admit, even now. I do think that the ecosystem makes for some quite like electric navigating of the world.
And when they do make it work for a puzzle, you know, when they... Often the 2D sections I've found, actually, they've... they're able to kind of like stem you in a little bit more and make you focus on like, well, you're going to have to use the mole here.
You know, this is a mole room. And that stuff works for me. Yeah, I don't know.
I just... I do like the playfulness of it. I like the fact that you can kind of come up with cumbersome solutions and that's perfectly fine, you know, or you might happen across a thing which just completely changes, like, how you perceive the landscape.
Like, it's almost a game where there are certain tactics that once you've tuned in to them, it, like, negates huge chunks of the game because you're like, well, you know, like, there's something I've discovered. I wouldn't say what that means. I don't feel like I ever really have to build a temporary staircase ever again.
And having those moments of realization is quite exciting. And allowing people to have those moments is quite daring, I think. You know, it's not like, it's not Nintendo not giving a fuck, but it's very loose for a Zelda game.
And I kind of like that, I kind of like that mode, you know?
Yeah, I definitely want to say that I admire the attempt to do something new. And I would, I prefer them to do this and remake A Link to the Past, which I think would have been the more obvious thing for Grezzo to do after Link's Awakening. I would much prefer they got to make something new.
It's like, we get plenty of remasters on Switch hardware. We're not short of them. It's, I'm glad they did.
They did this instead. I just think there's a few considerations away from being as good as it could be. And therefore I think it's like, it just avoids being a really top tier Zelda game as a result of that.
I think it will go down as like one of the, if there's like a, if someone makes a best Zelda spinoffs list, it will be like second or third in that list, right? So, yeah.
I mean, when they have done spinoffs in the past, you know, like Triforce Heroes, they often get it wrong, you know? Yeah. Like they're often, at best, mediocre.
And this certainly isn't that. And I still think you can enjoy it on a perspective of, you know, the music's delightful.
Looks amazing. I love that visual style.
I do love the look of it. It's got a real kind of solidness to it. And the little kind of tilt shift, kind of blurring that they do.
And it has some performance issues, definitely. But it's like thoroughly charming and winning, you know? Yeah.
It doesn't feel cheap or like a knockoff Zelda, you know?
No, it does have this weird, like, almost rom-hack style mentality.
I saw your tweets about this. I was going to ask you about that, actually, because that really made me laugh.
I thought it was quite a good way of framing it. It does feel like we went into Link's Awakening and made it so you're Zelda, but you can drop anything into the world. Do you know what I mean?
There's a little bit of that mentality to it.
Don't you think that's, like...
Cool. Yeah.
Yeah, it is cool. But I think there's something really exciting about, like, turning the internal logic of the game against itself, you know, like, you get those, there's, like, those crows that when they attack you, you drop rupees, and then when you spawn them and they attack things, they drop rupees, and you're like, well, this thing's just like a money factory. And it's like they've said, well, that's probably going to, like, bust the economy.
If you keep using these crows, you're going to have so much money, you're not going to know what to do with it. But also having the confidence to go, ah, so what, you know, like, we are going to adhere to the rules of this world, like, 100%. Like, if the enemy can do it, they'll do it.
And I kind of like how daring that is.
Well, I do like that about it. And I do like that often your puzzle solution will just be this haphazard pile of stuff you've built, or like, it just, a certain, like, weird combination of things you wouldn't think of using. Or I just dropped this here and it turned into a trap because of the exact way the enemy patrols back and forth.
And I managed to lure these enemies to walk into all these, like, spinning razor blade things, and it took them out. And it does have that, like, messily finding the solution I don't have a problem with. I just think that as a moment to moment combat experience, which is a massive part of what these games are, I just don't think it quite ever feels like it comes together in the way that you want it to.
And that's like I said, I think having the temporary link powers almost feels like, well, I don't have the solution, so I'll just turn into Link and bash these guys up with my sword. And so I just think it's on that level combined with the inventory, the work of going through that inventory, rifling through all those different icons, and you only ever gather more stuff. You only ever got more stuff to cycle through.
I just think those are two undeniable flaws with the game.
Yeah, I think when you've spent 100 hours wrestling with the infantry in Tears of the Kingdom, it prepares you for anything.
Well, that's the thing. I was there thinking, has Nintendo ever had to make a game that's got a really complicated inventory system before? I guess maybe Xenoblade has this, but they're not.
This isn't really their stomping ground normally, is it, to have you going through hundreds of icons or loads of icons and stuff. In some ways, this is kind of new territory for them, whereas other developers have been doing this sort of thing for years. They're kind of new to it.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I guess because it's a system that it's designed to be, you know, the game's quite fast feeling, quite fast moving and sort of Arcadian feel. So the idea of methodically picking over 100 icons does seem daft, especially when there's a thrill in mashing up different things together and solving things by using a combination of items and just the extra 10 seconds between each item selection. You know, that definitely is a bummer.
It's like, yeah, it's kind of really imperfect, but kind of fascinating to have a Zelda this different. Yeah, I just didn't think Rezo would ever be allowed to do something like this. I thought they'd be like remakes forever.
I don't know if you read the interviews, they do the kind of Iwata asks S interviews about these games and you kind of, I don't know, Numa comes across as like quite mellow in them. Right. In that he's like, ah, yeah, like, you know, we just kind of have to let some of this stuff go.
Not in a way of saying like, oh, it's acceptable that these things don't function as cleanly as they could. But in terms of some of its like designs philosophies, he's like, ah, let's just kind of see what happens. You know, there's like a strange alchemy to it.
And I'm kind of cool with that. And that isn't, that just feels very un-Nintendo to me.
Yeah, the idea that like you can have every five, four or five years, you'll have a new 2D Zelda and it's them putting their own stamp on it. I absolutely approve of that. It's got a little whiff of like Oracle of Seasons and Ages about it, I think, as well, where it's like a slightly different developer taking the bones of Link's Awakening and putting a spin on it.
You know what I mean? So I do approve, I approve, but it just doesn't quite get there for me, which is fine, which is fine. Other people seem to like it a lot, so people love it.
I do think it's also interesting seeing a Zelda in the post-Breath of the Wild world take on some of the conventions, given that visually it's so different to those worlds and how they function. But seeing the fact that after the first dungeon, you have a choice of two, you can do things in an order of your liking, and the way the kind of preamble before the dungeons is very, very similar to the dungeon preamble in Tears of the Kingdom, the kind of story quest that unlocks it, and the way that you have to sort of submerge yourself in the culture of the region, and it's like very much like a big sort of Gerudo story or a big Zora story, and that feels like the 2D Zelda version of what Breath of the Wild did. And it's just interesting that after Ocarina of Time, you obviously saw the echoes of that game for like 15 years in all the Zeldas that followed, and it's just interesting seeing that happen again with Breath of the Wild, albeit on such a different kind of Zelda game.
You know, just sort of like, oh, these are the lessons they've taken from it. That's interesting to me.
Yeah, for sure. And like, it's even got, you know, a kind of rudimentary recipe system of like-
Right, exactly, stuff like that.
Yeah.
That just feels like they're like, oh, well, we've broken the ground on that. You know, that's now a Zelda idea that's gonna be in all Zelda games. Yeah.
And seeing which of those have and haven't kind of made the cut. Yeah.
Yeah.
It does, there are occasional moments in this where you do think like, oh, am I breaking this? Which is quite exciting. Like when you find yourself like walking on top of trees, scenery, which traditionally has just been used to kind of block you off like the trees.
And you're like, this feels kind of a bit naughty. Yeah.
Yeah. But that's it. I think that my problem with the game overall is that you do often get this like one time shock of a giddy thrill.
And then it's like back to just haphazardly summoning things or you're doing the same thing.
Yeah, that's fair.
Two beds, surely you just need one of those beds. Can we just upgrade the bed instead of having two beds? I mean, I know one like heals slightly faster than the other one and one costs more than the other one.
But come on lads, that could be a slightly more elegant bed system. I got the slightly nicer covers bed, come on. Okay, well.
She'd be able to put them into storage in her mind palace.
Yeah, that's it. It's just like, even if she does get back to sort of Hyrule being in its kind of, you know, sort of like desired state and the king's like, okay again or whatever, she's just going to be like, I have fucking table and trampoline related PTSD. All I can think of is like pots and rocks that I've summoned into the environment.
Yeah, okay. All right. So I'm glad you like it slightly more than me.
Like it's, I think that that is a result of a game making brave choices and I absolutely endorse that approach. So in which case then we come to the last game of this episode Matthew. So Silent Hill 2 remake from Blooper Team, a resurgent Konami.
Konami were just making eFootball for a few years there. I think we all thought, well, that's the end of them. I guess they just didn't fancy console development anymore, which was a bummer.
Because guess what? Back in the PS2 days, like Konami were an amazing publisher, developer. We had so much good stuff from them, like so many defining games like Metal Gear, Castlevania, Silent Hill are our Konami concerns, and it's nice to have them taking steps back into the field.
I think people are very wary of Konami and how they talk about them. Partly, I think, as a result of the way in which Kojima ended up leaving the company. After that, I think there's been a bit of damage to maybe repair.
I think that there was a lot of trepidation about this remake project because Blooper Team made The Medium and Blair Witch Project and a few other games. I think people who were horror fans were a little bit cool on or thought just didn't quite have the stuff. They were remaking a seminal PS2 survival horror game with one of the, I would say thematically, probably the most disgust and beloved horror game of its generation.
Just really, it's like almost like a mythical proposition at this point, just because so many people haven't played it. They've just seen it on YouTube because you cannot play the original version of this now without some work. So it's a little bit lost of time, the original.
In theory, then, that makes it a good prospect for a remake. Matthew, first of all, curious to hear what your relationship with Silent Hill 2, the original, is before going into this.
So I didn't play it until quite late. So I played the PC, the one which you have to download all that gubbins to make good. What's that gold?
I can't remember. It's like some kind of restored or something.
It's like a mod. You know when a mod is just so prolific that it becomes the name of the game?
Yeah.
So it's like Silent Hill Enhanced Edition or whatever, but it is a mod. Yeah, I think my problem with Silent Hill 2 is I came to it after it had been so fully ripped apart and discussed. And so maybe the surprise of it is a big part of the game's power, which is obviously quite a crucial thing in a remake, because how well you know the game is going to impact, how effective that story is.
It still worked for me on a vibes level. Absolutely, you know, like the look of the thing, the sound of the thing, that music, the composer's name is Escaped, Yamaoka. Yamaoka, you know, truly like one of the kind.
But basically I don't approach this remake being too precious about it. You know, this isn't a key text for me. I appreciate that it's super important and very valuable and probably meant more, you know, 15 years ago than it did to me when I played it.
As a result, well, I thought, you know, I was expecting to have fewer issues with this than others, but then it turns out everyone seems to like it in the reviews. So go figure, shows how much I know. It is a quite a, well, I say quite straightforward retelling.
Like it's very, very true to the beats and the story and the events of the original game. Obviously it has a major change in that it's now over the shoulder. But even with that, it feels to me like, oh, it's this bit, it's this bit, it's this bit.
And it feels very true to the atmosphere and vibe of them, which I think is probably the most sort of important thing for them to have nailed. So even with a radically different camera perspective, it doesn't feel that far removed. I was trying to kind of place it on the spectrum of like remakes and remasters.
Like, like how different it is. And it's like, I think that camera change means it just, by definition, it feels much more radical than, than Resident Evil 4's remake, say. But the like adherence to just the flow of the game and, you know, the locations and the kind of logic of that world, that I don't think it feels as radical as the jump from Resi 2 to Resi 2 remake.
Right. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.
So it sort of sits between those two. I thought Resi 2 remake, because that wasn't just a perspective change. I thought that...
Genre change...
.that tried to kind of... Sorry?
Genre change, really?
Yeah, I think so. And this, this, like, this isn't that, to my mind anyway. It's, yeah, I think part of that is it feels really old fashioned.
Like, I've played about six hours of it, which, you know, traditionally would have got you through, like, most of Silent Hill 2, at least in my memory. It wasn't, like, a massively long game, right? With, like, ten hours tops.
Yeah, eight to ten hours, probably, depending on how stuck you got, or, yeah.
Yeah, so, yeah, I'm about six hours into it, and I've just got to the hospital, which is, like, probably, like, the second big, kind of, internal area of this game, if you're familiar with it. So, you know, it's, it's, it's taking its time. I'm trying to work out exactly how it's taking its time.
Like, the layouts, you know, I don't know the original well enough to be like, oh, this map feels like twice the size. They've definitely massaged them in ways. They haven't added, like, a huge amount of, of busy work, but it is taking more time.
I can't really work out where that time's going. It might be, like, that puzzles are a bit more, like, take you kind of into, like, different corners of the map a little bit more, perhaps. It's, like, ultra, kind of, traditional, you know, in the Resident Evil style of, like, lots of, like, weird keys and take this weird key to this weird door and you're always collecting medallions to put into strange devices.
The puzzles take a lot of the iconography of the original puzzles but come up with, like, new ideas around them, which I'm quite enjoying, actually, that balance. Like, it is a bit more puzzly than other Resident Evil say, and I'm quite enjoying that. But I think the thing that really jumps out for me, and the thing where it does feel old-fashioned, to get back to my original point, was, like, it really, like, leaves you alone.
It doesn't feel very modern in terms of, like, hand-holding. It feels like a game where you can play, you know, several hours without really being interrupted. You know, maybe, like, the little kind of cutscenes here and there as James, he's come to this town to look for his wife, keeps meeting other strange people who have also been drawn to the town for some reason.
And you have these little encounters, which are all out of the original game as far as I remember. But a lot of it is like, well, I have just spent two hours walking around this huge apartment block, going into loads of different rooms and collecting loads of different keys. It hasn't really interrupted me.
There haven't been, like, cinematic set pieces. The kind of things which maybe appeal more to, like, the modern appetite. And I did wonder if maybe why it has spoken so well to original fans and to reviewers in general is that it is a little paired back and a kind of straightforward and, like, no fuss, which I think is true to kind of games of that period.
Like, it feels kind of old, you know? It doesn't feel like a post-Naughty Dog game, which so many of these third-person adventures are. Like, they take little tricks or ideas from it.
James is just going, got a bad feeling about this pyramid head guy.
Yeah, well, there's, like, very little of that. Like, he kind of talks in the cutscenes and the rest of the time, not a lot.
Yeah.
And, you know, you're collecting these weird bits. There's no, like, upgrade system. There's no, like, there's no new systems that weren't in the original Silent Hill 2.
And it feels very, like, pure. And Resident Evil 2 didn't add that much, but there were little things that I think kind of made it feel a little bit more modern, you know, like shifting character perspectives and set pieces and just like a heavier, like, run of bosses and things, which this doesn't have. It's quite, it's quite sparse.
Like, the only place they have massaged it a bit is, you know, they've added a couple of, like, extra rooms here and there in the town bits of Silent Hill, which is this, like, very foggy, sort of small town America place. There are, like, extra shops you can go into, which feel a little bit like the kind of wide linear Last of Us stuff, you know? Like, you can go into this building and there might be another enemy encounter in there and you'll get, you'll get some health.
But the only thing you can ever find anywhere in this game is bullets and health. But there's no, oh, if you don't go exploring, you're going to miss out on an upgrade to your gun or anything like that. And you do think, oh, this feels like initially, I was like, oh, this feels a little thin, like what it's working with.
There's not a lot going on here. But over the six hours have come to kind of actually appreciate that purity that they haven't felt the need to like massage it too much.
That seems well judged to me. I think that the more the more you try and stray away from this, the more likely you were to anger fans of the original. It's like it's stripped back nature.
Maybe there was no HUD in Silent Hill 2. It's very like, really like what you see is kind of like what you get in the game to a large extent. I think that not messing with that is probably wise given the kind of fanbase they're dealing with and the potential backlash of like, if you do try and add to this, how they will respond.
So it seems like a good idea to do it this way.
Yeah I think it works. So there are moments when, this may sound dumb, but there are moments where it just feels like a succession of rooms with maybe monsters in them. And like that is all most games have fundamentally, but you kind of see it a little bit here because there isn't sort of, because there isn't anything to kind of break up the pace.
You're kind of like, oh, another corridor with probably a monster at the end. And that's, you know, maybe that's like, if you just play it for too long, you begin to see that like, there aren't many enemy types, you know, which I think is something you can say about the original. Well, I don't think they've added any enemy types to this.
You know, there's like some sort of like people who are only legs and there are, you know, some glistening kind of torsos that spew stuff out. Obviously, they're not nurses. But there's not like a huge amount beyond that.
So you can spend, like these six hours have been spent purely fighting the same two enemy types, which maybe makes it feel a little, a little repetitive in places. But then-
That is the original game, though. Like it's-
But yeah, that is. But yeah, and it's where the, it being so much longer by all accounts, like 17 to 20 hours, almost twice as long. You know, I'm kind of interested how that, how it doesn't get, like lose all momentum with so few enemy types.
Currently, I've just been into like the puzzles and the visuals of the thing. I think it looks absolutely amazing. You know, I'm really taken with like the fog, which is so distinct in that original game.
And it's so like PS2 specific hardware fog. And it's like something no one's ever really been able to recreate. You know, a big part of this PC mod was like trying to fix this fog.
And the fog here is very like deep and impressive and spooky. And, you know, the kind of squalor of the environments and how kind of nightmarish it is. But the thing about it maybe being a bit longer as well that's made me laugh is that, you know, the whole thing in Silent Hill is there's like the real world and then there's like the other world.
I don't really know what they call the other world. Like the rust, you know, place environment. And but the thing that's weird about it is like the real world is also just like a fucking horror, like nightmare town.
You know, it's all fog. There's just everyone in it is like a meat monster trying to kill you. And then you go to Twisted World where everything is just a meat monster trying to kill you except Pyramid Head also lives there.
And it's like in my head there was more of a divide, but I don't think there was. I think that's just my mind playing tricks on me. You know, it's kind of like out of the horror frying pan into the horror fire.
It's just a lot of horror this game, which is maybe what you want.
What did you make of your first encounter with Pyramid Head? Because you would have had one, right? During the apartments.
Yeah, good. Yeah, I think Pyramid Head is one of the elements, which is just, he's like too well-known. And once he's been turned into like a fucking Mario Kart character in that Konami crazy races, I think that's a thing.
I'm not imagining that. Like, he's a bit like the alien. He's just too well-known to be like properly scary.
You're like, oh yeah, right on cue. There's Pyramid Head.
Yeah.
And, you know, what he's doing in the cut scenes is obviously really unpleasant. But I've never found him that frightening as an idea. Like, just a bloke with that.
Like, I find his headpiece, like, it looks dumb to me. It looks like unwieldy rather than, oh my God, I can't imagine anything scarier than a man with a pyramid for a head. You know, like, it's just...
I think you just have to encounter him, like, on the, in the original game, when he's a very frightening, no context, why is he doing this to these mannequins? Kind of like presence.
Yeah, well, that's, but I never, and that's not a thing I can, like, can get back, because I'd seen it, I'd watched it, you know, in videos before I played it and seen screenshots of it. And you're like, yeah, yeah, it's that guy. Like, I had hoped that if they were going to do anything, that they were going to, like, you know, it was, was there any way to, like, pump him up?
Maybe they do in the rest of it, I don't know. But, you know, I know it's a cliche of this podcast, suggests that they turn everyone into Mr. X from Resident Evil 2 Remake.
Yeah, yeah.
But the idea maybe of a pyramid head who is in that space with you, I could see that being quite frightening. Like, they do a lot of stuff where you hear him stomping about elsewhere in the building as scripted moments. But the idea that you could turn the corner and then, oh shit, here's pyramid head.
Like, you're in his big rusty home and he's cross.
You mean oboe head, right?
Oboe head. You know, if you were going to riff on anything, that's maybe the thing to riff on. But then they just want to keep it, you know, they have to stick into the playbook on this one.
And that has definitely given it certain strengths. Yeah. I just don't know if Pyramid Head can truly scare in 2024.
Yeah. If any of the listeners have somehow made it this far in their lives without knowing what the deal of Silent Hill 2 is, I'd be fascinated to know if Pyramid Head does land for them.
Yeah. Yeah, because when I first played it, I didn't finish it when I played it on PS2. I bought it when I was at Imagine.
I was like, OK, I should go back and play this mythical kind of horror game. I played it and I thought it's like, everything it does visually in the original is so wonderfully calibrated to the capabilities. It's just so smart in that respect.
It's like everything, it's actually like really, even to play now, really crisp where you find all the items in the game, despite it being dark. Like you say, the fog is perfect, PS2 fog. The enemies are perfect, PS2 enemies.
The art style has this kind of like, because of the fog, it can sort of disguise detail quite well, the art style. And like the town, despite being mostly just like what seem like identical buildings. You do start to think about the layout of it quite a lot, because you go back there a bunch of times, and the few areas that you do go into actually are very distinctive spaces.
And it's just like one of those sort of 10 out of 10, had to have played it at the time kind of games. But yeah, it's just really interesting that it's had this like, 23-year journey into becoming this, an object that's so coveted, it just has to be remade with a budget. There's no doubt, probably like 100 times the budget of the original, or something close to it, you know?
But it is, and like, this is a mark against Konami that it isn't easier to play, but you know, compared to some games which get the remade, like Resident Evil 4 is so readily available in its original form now. Silent Hill 2 is slightly trickier, you know, it's basically like PS2 or like a slightly hooky version of PC, which you may not want to do, which I completely get. So, you know, having something which does just put it out there for people, you know, I've seen some people be quite sniffy about it going, well, you obviously just play the original, and you're like, well, it's not that easy for the man on the street to do.
Yeah, it's true. And it's, yeah, there's still money on the table as well, if they do choose to make a collection of all these games, like they did with Metal Gear. That is free money for them, if they can actually get that done to a higher standard than the original Silent Hill HD collection from PS3 and 360, which were notoriously hated by the fans.
I mean, well done to them for making something that people actually like. That's, it's a very, very hard fan base to please. And I guess we haven't seen how players respond to it, but certainly critics, 87 on Metacritic, that's pretty amazing to land on that.
And it seems like people are going to buy it, and they're excited about it. And that bodes well for the original games that they're working on as well, which I want to see, you know. I don't just want to live in PS2 nostalgia land.
I want to see what else can you, you know, let's flex your muscles with Silent Hill. Let's do something, look at what Capcom are doing with Resi. Let's see the Konami version of that, you know.
So maybe they'll grezzo it up. You've proven yourself with a remake. Now give us a, you know, a Silent Hill 5 or whatever.
I feel like more likely they'll end up making, remaking Silent Hill 3. That feels like the more, or the original. The original is pretty good, pretty ripe for a remake too.
But it feels like 3 because of the PS2 aesthetic. And that's like not quite as revered as 2, but it's still another like, futurey striking game.
One would be ripe for like a more substantial remake and reimagining, I think. Take the core idea. Like I didn't feel that they properly nailed it there, you know?
No, but you know, like, guess what? The sound of air raid sirens and fog is still fucking terrifying. So that's, they got a lot to play with.
That's actually a thing about this one, really stressful, is playing on PS5, the static when enemies are nearby, comes out of the controller.
Oh, that's so good. I love that.
And it's really loud. And it's like, when you're in a room and that thing is like ringing in your ears, it's genuinely stressful because you're like, I know there's something fucking nearby and I've got to get rid of it because I need to just quiet this sound.
Yeah, that's always great when you do that.
Yeah, that is really effective. Even though sometimes it's like, one of the enemy types is just like a little spider.
Yeah.
And it's like, you stamp the spider in and the static goes away. You're like, oh, that's static, is that one little spider? Come on, James.
Yeah, it's like horror games are like the only games that have ever really made much use of the controller that makes sound kind of system. That's why playing Alien Isolation on PS4 is worth doing at least once. So you get the motion tracker on there.
It's very effective when that kind of device moves to something that's even closer to you as a player.
Yeah, it's in your personal space. It actually does feel quite invasive in a way that I really like.
Yeah, I did see a piece from Digital Foundry that said the performance wasn't very good. That's not 100% not our area on this.
So I played it on the visual mode, which is like 30 frames, just because it's so good looking like the effects and everything are quiet. I think they take quite a step down on performance mode.
I don't think I need a horror game to run at 60 FPS necessarily either. So that's another thing.
No, not really. And it's so much of it's quite kind of plodding. And yeah, I mean, it looks good to my eyes.
But yeah, I only mentioned it because they said that like, oh, you know, like, this is right for a PS5 Pro version. I was just thinking, right. All they're doing is remaking a PS2 game.
It doesn't need to be. It doesn't need to stretch beyond the hardware we have now. I don't really get that.
But hey, hey. Yeah. OK, good stuff, Matthew.
I'm looking forward to playing this myself. A nice surprise to end the year with having a, yeah, another horror remake that people are really into that doesn't mess with the bones of it too much.
If you'd said to me in January, like by the end of the year, Silent Hill 2 will have really worked for you, but Meta4 won't have. I'd have been like, that's insane. Yeah.
Based on the track records of the people involved, I'd have been like, no, that isn't going to happen. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we're currently sitting on a big fat 90 for Meta4 and I just look like a complete boob.
Well, that is exciting for me this week. I can't wait to see that embargo lift and see where you sit in the, I'm sure it'll be fine, Matthew, because he did ultimately go, I'd still probably give this an eight, which is not that damning, really.
That's the thing, I'm just disappointed. Disappointment often sounds worse than outright hatred, I think.
I'd take a point of any game that has hustings in it, to be honest. That's my stance on this, Matthew.
I love a hustings.
Okay, that is the end of this episode. I think that was a nice little bang for your buck episode, Matthew. Thank you for playing all these games and carrying this as ever.
I don't know how you find the time to get through as many games as you do, but I'm always in deep admiration of that while I'm rewatching Mad Men or whatever, so that's good. The next episode of this podcast is going to be an interview with a returning guest. I'm going to make sure that that actually goes ahead before I say what it is, but it's a cool one.
I think it will go down well. It's a guest who's doing something quite different to what they were doing the last time they're on, so there's going to be some cool stuff to talk about. Looking forward to that, Matthew.
Then there's an Excel episode coming up as well where we each have to design a video game theme park. Matthew is a few days away now, and then he has to come back and record that with me next weekend, so RIP him. That's going to be tough.
But it's been fun, Matthew. Where can people find you on social media?
