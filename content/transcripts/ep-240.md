Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined once again by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, you came back from Scotland. I've not podcasted with you for, I want to say a while, but probably more like nine days, because that's the cadence with which we make these episodes. How was it?
Did you have a nice holiday?
I did have a nice holiday. I'm not very good at going on holiday. I very rarely do it, and so I forget how tiring it is relaxing properly, because you want to go off and do all the touristy things.
The good thing about Scotland and the reason we decided to go to Scotland, we went to Glasgow for a few days and then drove up to Glencoe, Fort William, that west side, I guess, is that wherever you drive in Scotland, it just looks amazing because the landscape is so good. So even just the traveling between things is very impressive. So you don't really feel the desperate need to be like nailing all these specific tourist attractions.
I highly recommended as a holiday destination, incredible food. I know I've put on about half a stone, great Indian food, some Japanese food, lots of epic fish, which I don't normally go in for.
Epic fish? How would a fish be described as epic?
Well, just big chunky bits of nice fish. I don't have fish very often. I'm not very good at talking about fish.
You do sound out of your depth.
I'm not a famed fish critic.
Yeah, that's what.
I'm not writing for fish edge.
Monkfish, that's a fish edge. Is that a spinoff? Is Tony Mott involved with fish edge?
Or is that like a... Does future license that out to someone else or... I don't know.
Yeah. Would any fish ever get the alleged fish edge 10?
What's the immortality of fish edge? I want to know. Oh, god.
I'm actually choking now because that's completely caught me off guard. Fish edge.
Well, it's good that there's at least one laugh in this episode.
Please don't mock up fish edge in the Discord. And I mean no disrespect to the current stuff.
If only you could talk to the Turbot.
Do you really not remember any of the fish? I'm a big monk fish guy, for example. I fish quite frequently, as you know.
You're always mocking my salmon as being gentrified on this.
Catherine had some monk fish. I had some halibut.
Fair enough. There's a solid fish. Monk fish are very, very nice, but very expensive.
Yeah. I had some halibut in Oban, which is like a port town. It's where you get the ferries across to various islands.
Oh, right. I thought Oban was the source.
Oh, no, no. Oban's a place.
Because you said monk fish in Oban. I thought, oh, I wonder what that is. Maybe he's about to explain.
Turned out to be a town. That's awkward. Yeah, it's a town.
Very good. Well, we offended the Scottish. So that's a good start to the episode.
No, I fully endorse their country. Apart from we missed our flights on the way home because there was a car crash and there's not just one road in Scotland, but there's not as many roads as you might think there should be because obviously it's going through quite mountainous terrain. It's a bit like the roads in Death Stranding when they like auto build.
Right.
Because there's not many places the roads can be because it's like locks and mountains and then the little bit of flat area, that's where you put a road. But obviously if one of those roads goes down, you've potentially got a two-hour diversion on your hands. It must be interesting living there, how often that happens.
Yeah.
I just love you starting this whole thing with, there's not one road going out of Scotland, but... And then like, I'm just going to debunk a myth that you didn't even know existed. I enjoyed that.
It feels like there is.
I've been moaning about there being one road and someone's like, well, there isn't one road. It's like, okay, there's two.
There's two roads. I will compromise it too. But no more.
No more than two roads. Very good, Matthew. Did you play many games on your break or did you just enjoy the opportunity to not play games for a few days?
I've been sort of tinkering with the play date for this upcoming Patreon episode. This isn't just me shilling the Patreon content.
That's a great ad. Great plug there.
Yeah. Well, I've been playing on that. Just trying to get a few more hours in, get a better range of things under my belt.
A lot of what I'm playing at the moment is either for work reasons or podcast reasons. So it's not particularly exotic choices. Yeah.
It was mainly play date and I'm playing something else I can't talk about. Nothing. Don't get your hopes up.
I'm not secretly playing Metro Prime 4 or anything like that. That isn't happening, sadly. Yeah.
Kind of visual novel thing on the go. And once I've got everything out the way for the podcast, San Andreas, I've got to get out the way. Once all that's done, I can go back to Death Stranding 2, which I'm about halfway through.
That's what I was playing, but I don't know if I'm going to get back to that for like three weeks now, which is a bit of a bummer.
I don't think it'll take you three weeks to get through San Andreas. My theory is it's a four-evening kind of game with the...
Really?
Yeah, I think so. With the quality of life, I got through, I think it's like a day and a half, I got halfway through the game. But more...
How long to beat? It's got to be like 30 hours.
Yeah, I don't think it's that short. But I don't know. But I had this with Vice City where I think I came in about six hours under how long to beat had it as.
Yeah, but I really wasn't. I struggled through that one.
I haven't found it as hard as San Andreas.
I don't want to even talk about the difficulty of San Andreas in case I jinx it.
Yeah, we'll have lots to talk about in that episode. But I will say that I am pleased that Rockstar did delay GTA 6, just so we had longer to make these episodes because it would have been an almighty crunch otherwise. So yeah, I'm pleased it got this spaced out a little bit because it means we can kick GTA 4 down the road until we're ready.
Maybe we do that in January or something. And then sort of pick up from there. So yes, so you got a playdate pod later this month.
If you want to keep Matthew and Turbot, then go to patreon.com back page pod, support the podcast, get two extra podcasts a month. Look forward to that. And yes, I've got San Andreas to do next as well.
I did half of it back in March when I was unemployed, fun employed, some might say. And yeah, so now the rest of it is sat there waiting for me. And I'm looking forward to going back to it actually, but did want to space out a bit after having done Vice City in that compressed space of time and eventually losing my mind to that fucking ice cream truck mission that was definitely like definitely tested my my resolve as I try to accumulate all the businesses in that game.
Yeah, bit of a shambles the second half of that game in the end, but hey ho, that's also on the Patreon feed. If you want to go back and listen to that from earlier.
That's a little taste of the kind of commentary you can get on the full episode.
Exactly, yeah, and such exciting questions. Which 80s tracks would you have in your Vice City radio station, et cetera? So Matthew, a couple of other bits I did want to sort of mention here.
Have you been to Beefy Boys in Bath yet, the burger place? And do you have any sandwich or lunch updates?
No, I'm afraid I have very few lunch updates. I mean, there's a lunch tragedy in that milk bun deli in Bath is no longer doing the chicken chappo. I can't remember if we talked about that on an episode.
No, I don't think we ever talked about that sandwich whatsoever. No, or if that place...
That's a heartbreaker.
Yeah, they still do that one that uses pate as butter, which is mental. That one's still there, I think.
I can't be dealing with that.
The bun me. I had the most cursed leakage from that sandwich into the bottom of my bag that I basically had to empty the sandwich liquid out of there into the toilet and then bleach the inside of my bag to get rid of the smell and sort of like texture and feel of the sandwich juice. That was a bad Friday afternoon, let me tell you that.
Tough. But I do like milk bun deli otherwise, and I'm sad, yes, the Chapo's gone. You recommended that to me, and it really paid off.
It's mostly just like a green mayo chicken sandwich with a bit of lettuce on it. That was kind of it.
A little bit of chili. It's got like the tiniest amount of kick.
Very tasty.
If it was any more kick, I wouldn't be interested.
Very tasty. Yeah, okay, that is a sandwich tragedy. I've been to Beefy Boys, I mentioned this in the Patreon newsletter this month, actually.
It's got, the most interesting thing about it, it's one of these places that does like a regular burger menu, they're like a dirty burger menu. And all I can really tell is that the dirty burger one, the bun is just a bit sweaty. That's like the dirty element of it.
How dirty do you want it?
Well, I don't really want a sweaty bun at all.
You sounded disappointed there. I want to know where you draw a line.
I don't really want a sweaty bun at all. I like being able to pick up a burger. It's kind of largely what the point of the burger bun is, isn't it?
So you're not picking up meat directly, you're consuming meat inside a very tasty container. So I don't really want any sweat on my burger. It's not sweat, it's like grease.
Just to make that very clear, I'm not accusing the staff of sweating onto my burger or anything. But the most interesting thing they do, Matthew, is the cheese disk. It might be called, it's got a different name to that, but I refer to it as the disk, capital T, capital D.
And it is, as far as I can tell, just like American burger cheese, just fried. But it comes in like an enormous, the sort of width of it is like twice as much as a burger itself, so it protrudes from the edges. But you pull bits off of it and it's so good.
It's like having a crepe or something made entirely of cheese. Fucking amazing. And that disk elevates the burger, I think, from a seven to an eight.
So that's my take on Beefy Boys and Bath, which is available now at the burger restaurant, if you're ever in town.
That's your review if you're writing for Burger Edge.
Fish Edge and Burger Edge. I mean, I desperately want these magazines to exist, Matthew. Lastly, Matthew, I thought we could talk about Stereophonic before we get into the episode.
This is a play we both saw. I mean, we never talk about this. You talk occasionally about going to the theater on the podcast, but not too much.
I feel like it either alienates or bores the listeners.
It's funny you say that, right? Because everyone I've spoken to about this play is a bit like, oh, the theater, and not really engaging me on it. I wonder, this is how you feel when you explain these things to me, when you're like, oh, yeah, I saw David Morrissey smash a drum up and get powder everywhere or something.
When you're telling me you're an addict, don't you say, when you've gone to the theater, exciting things happen. I wonder if that's how you feel.
You're just like, what a wanker. What a terrible wanker. I hate this wanker.
I hope this wanker's story stops soon.
No, not at all. But when you tell me these things, I wonder, is that how you feel? I'm not really engaging you in the way that I would if we were to talk about fucking Wario or something, you know?
It's always a gamble when you talk about plays to people, because not a lot of people do this stuff, and I think there's a lot of preconceptions about going to the theatre and the kind of people who go, and I think it's myths that the theatrical world itself is trying to shake as well and try and make it more accessible and all that. So I feel like you've engaged with my anecdotes to the level that I desire.
Good, bare minimum met, that's good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I like the fact that you went to see this after I told you about it. I was like, oh, that's cool.
You know, you're obviously, you know, you engaged enough with the idea that you'd go and see it. And I'm just really happy it was good, because I thought, oh, man, if I've managed to, like, talking into going to see this thing and it's shit, because it's so expensive and such a faff. And also, like, bad theatre is the fucking worst, because it's not like a film where if you're not feeling it, you can talk and they can't hear you.
You know, you're stuck there with a living person who can sense your bad vibes. Yeah.
And you can't just leave either. That's the other thing.
Well, you can.
But it's just not the done thing, is it? Yeah. So, do you know what?
It was pricey enough, but not too expensive. It's like £100 for the seat we got, which was really close to the stage and, like, really, really good. And, like, there wouldn't be much point spending any more of that.
I think it was as good a view as we could get. And you could definitely go a little bit cheaper than that. Still have a really good experience.
You could go down to about £60 or something. And that's not too bad, really, for, like, a day out. I mean, if you...
Anyways, try to get fucking Oasis tickets, or, you know, I'd see Lana Del Rey, or pretty much any major musician, the ticketmaster has got the griff going, so you end up spending a lot upwards of £200. That's, like, the whole thing is basically built on a... Exactly.
So, it's a bit different.
But it's on the sliding scale. Like, if all you ever do is go to the cinema, then you're used to entertainment being, like, 12 quid. And then people are like, well, video games are then 60 quid.
And you're like, well, there exists these other forms, which are even more expensive for shorter amounts of time.
That is true. I mean, you know, Stereophonic was three and a half hours. That's more than I played Assassin's Creed Shadow, it's Matthew.
So, yeah, that might not be true, actually, but it's close. So, this was a play Matthew recommended, I think, on the XXL episode that we did at the end of last year, when we were talking about things that were coming up that you're interested in. And it's basically like a Fleetwood Mac-style band trying to record a follow-up album to a popular first album that becomes more popular over the course of the year or so in which the play is set.
Maybe that's a spoiler, actually. The time period of the play, you know, the album becomes more popular, basically.
But yeah, I don't think it's a spoiler to say it's like a troubled long period of time that they're recording an album.
Yeah, that's true. It's a great sort of like authentic 70s set and the cast is really spot on. I would say only the couple of the cast had the energy of, I think these people have seen iPhones.
I'd say otherwise you can immerse yourself quite well into the 70s thing. And the music that was done for it, but I think it was like Will Butler from Arcade Fire, a band who I thought were massively overrated back in 2007, but were very popular. Music is absolutely amazing.
The whole Fleetwood Mac thing just seems like it's captured modern imaginations. That band is weirdly way more popular than they were when I was a teenager, when I remember them being on top of the pops too and seeming incredibly uncool. And I think anyone gave a shit about them.
But I think that the turbulent nature of the relationships going on within that band of just for whatever reason over time, it's just become one of those kind of like canonical huge bands. And so this is a great play to see with people who are not necessarily your usual theatre goers. I count myself in that.
I think that if you're in your 20s or whatever, you might have a superficial understanding of who Fleetwood Mac is off the back of things like Daisy Jones and The Six which riff on it as well. Any thoughts to add Matthew?
Yeah, great music. There's like an American guy in it playing basically the sort of the Mick Fleetwood role of British drummer. He's really charismatic and very engaged.
Even though it's like an American doing a British accent, I really liked his energy.
I had no idea he was American. That's, yeah, very impressive.
I actually saw it on the same day. I went to see another play that afternoon. We did a double bill.
Wow. Which was the Rosamund Pike play in Teralia, which plays a judge basis about sexual assault. But I won't say in what way, in case you want to go and see it and don't want to spoil it.
But that was, as the subject matter would suggest, quite a bad hang. So going from that to this quite fun band, even when they had bad points and low points and big bust ups, it was like, well, in the context of the thing I saw four hours ago, this still seems pretty light and fun. So that maybe colored it a bit.
Yeah. And despite being three and a half hours long, with a 30 minute intermission, it absolutely flies by as well. Yeah, and I'm a very, very impatient man these days.
But it definitely, as my point about Assassin's Creed Shadows sort of underlines it really. But yeah, thought it was super strong, Matthew. Another great recommendation from the House of Castle.
Never lets me down. So that's good. Okay, we come to the subject of this episode then finally, we've been putting it off as long as possible.
Games Court. It's Games Court. And what happens in Games Court is that people who have bought games secondhand on eBay or similar services can submit the prices and the names of the games and the circumstances in which they bought them to be judged by the dastardly judge, Matthew Castle, who lives on Castle Island, an island that doesn't have time, or the Internet.
There's quite a lot of other law that I've forgotten by now, all of which I'm sure will come up in various forms throughout this episode. And yeah, that's basically it. And then at the end I'm the lawyer, by the way.
I forgot to point that out. That's my role in this.
I'm the lawyer, by the way, as they famously say in court.
Yeah, a sort of Lionel Hutz-esque idiot, really, a buffoon, who just sort of like often turns on his own clients, tries to get them prosecuted when I feel they've transgressed by, I don't know, buying Batman Gotham Racing on PS1 for 67 quid. But then they say, oh, but my nan died that day, so it was okay. And I'm like, definitely not, send him to jail, Judge Castle.
There's a bit of that that goes on. But in theory, I'm on the side of the listeners. And yeah, anything else to add about what Games Court is, Matthew?
Does that pretty much cover it?
No, that's basically it. Some people really like it. A lot of people don't.
Yeah, the sort of...
Including me.
The people who don't as well. I mean, a couple of times they've spoken up and I think they felt like they've sort of like done something sacrilegious and other listeners are massively defensive on its behalf and it's tough.
Yeah, I think people have just come to accept it that every once in a while there's this given an episode they're not massively into, but hopefully the track record of the other episodes, they know that we're good for it. That we'll make it up to them in some way.
Indeed. In some ways, I only really look forward to these beginning bits, where I hear what the law you've come up with under duress. And we read our opening speeches together to each other.
So I'd love to hear how things are going on Castle Island these days, Matthew.
Yeah. You know what, one last comment before I slip into character as Judge Castle. I somehow fluked a good intro in the last Games Court we did, which I think is set an expectation.
It was good. That was a blueprints when the last Games Court, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Strong. Strong backbone to have.
It was strong, which makes this seem even worse. What's about to happen?
Thank you for that caveat.
Yeah. Okay. Here we go.
So, yeah. How are things on Castle Island? I am Judge Castle, head of Castle Island.
As you remember, I accidentally hired the architect from blueprints to renovate my palace and I've still not managed to draft a courtroom for Games Court, so I hired a new architect to basically build a whole new home. Unfortunately, it was the architect of Donkey Kong Bonanza, so now everything is fully destructible and it's another total nightmare. My bed, polystyrene, fell right through it.
The couch, made from those pink wafer biscuits, fell right through it and now there are wasps everywhere. I tried to sleep outside, couldn't find anywhere, had to pay a builder five grand to carve me a cave to sleep in. That's something that happens in Donkey Kong Bonanza.
There's an unstoppable gramophone playing the DK rap on the loop, so that's terrible. Worse.
Okay, I laughed a few times, keep going.
Okay. Oh no, it gets worse. Worse.
The residents of Castle Island are now digging down, hoping to reach a better, more liveable layer to live on. They hit the dead listener layer, which is just bones and copies of Clannoa on Wii, and it's always upsetting to be reminded of Clannoa. Then they dug even deeper and reached the magazines that closed when I edited them there.
And that one is really thick. It's just a lot to get through down there.
The five stars toughness on that layer, that's like, yeah, tough.
As ever, there's an increasing political movement trying to get time reinstated on Castle Island, or in-state, I don't know if it ever existed. They're actually the campaigners. They're coming off to the concept of Games Court itself, arguing that it makes no sense that an island without time would acknowledge the existence of second-hand games.
That's a very good point, actually.
It's a great point. Oh, this is so shit. I don't even want to say it.
Well, you have to now. I mean, you know, expectations have been set very low.
As you know, I'm suffering from a bad foot at the moment. This is, I am in real life, but Judge Castle is too. But because we don't have the internet, I can't ask WebMD how to fix it.
Oh, this is so shit. Right.
Come on.
We don't have SEO queries here. We've just got the SEA. That's the C.
I chucked my request in a message in a bottle and hoped for the best.
I don't think I'd have laughed at that if you hadn't done your little shame laugh at the end of that. But because you did that, it did make it funnier. So, I can't tell if it was good or bad.
That's why I got a fucking SEO to see. I mean, I was just sitting at my desk like, so I've got to have fucking something. It's like, my foot, the internet.
Oh God, that's diabolical compared to the last one. The last one ended with White Sinners.
Oh, that was good. That was an all-timer, yeah. White Sinners.
What a moment in time that was. White Sinners and Blueprints. Ah, Spring 2025.
Makes it nostalgic, doesn't it? And how will listeners be executed if found guilty, Matthew, today?
Yeah, so it's a giant rack powered by the cranking motion on play dates. That's actually what hipsters are doing when they're cranking the play date. On the screen, they're reeling in a fish or winding out the neck of some extendable dog or whatever, but they're actually pulling apart the bones of some guy who bought the Wheelman on both PS3 and 360.
Very good. I'm pleased that you incorporated the crank into a large scale punishment. That would be fun and painful, actually.
That's probably the cruelest one we've come up with yet. The drowning was pretty bad, I guess. And who's in the courtroom today?
Who's going to be watching all this?
Well, who isn't in the courtroom? We got a load of generic museum visitors from Switch 2 Welcome Tour. They're here, pretty nunderscript.
We got a holographic Mike Flanagan from Death Stranding 2. We've got 2025 era Donkey Kong, but please tell him, please tell him not to chuck any of the barrels. They're full of Johnny Sasaki's shit.
We got the Grove Street Gang from GTA San Andreas, and we will not be reading out any of their lines or doing impressions of them.
Seems wise.
There's a fly in the courtroom. Don't swat it. It's actually the star of indie game Time Flies.
Fucking hell.
Okay, keep going.
And we've got the digital replicas of the Ghostbusters, and I've not yet listened to that episode, so I don't know where we landed on them.
I think I was still cynical, but Dave had a nice time. That's basically the gist of that episode. Saved you two hours there, Matthew.
Okay, good. Well, that's the courtroom. And then the last thing is my opening statement, isn't it?
You don't have a statement as well, right?
No, I do have an opening statement.
Oh, nice. Okay, well, should I do my verse then?
Yeah, please, please, please give the listeners a break from my whole deal.
I enjoyed it. I think you really went for it there. And, you know, you tried your best with the lunchtime you had available.
And that's okay, you know. Ladies, gentlemen, and low-effort Donkey Kong Bonanza supporting characters of the courtroom. I would just guess that one preemptively because I assumed you would do that, Matthew.
I returned from a delightful screening at the Castle Island wet cinema shack where I got to see Stanley Kubrick's A Work Orange on the silver screen for the first time. I then returned home to my soiled tent only to find my Squaresoft RPG collection had been ransacked and censored by the Castle Island authorities with the boxes of such classics as Trigger and Cross hastily vandalised with a felt-tip pen. Fresh from his disaster of a diplomacy tour to Scotland where he insisted on ordering all his meals while impersonating fat bastard from the Austin Powers movies, Judge Castle was vowed revenge against the nation after getting trapped on the one motorway leading out of it.
As a result, Haggis and Whiskey Tarras on Castle Island now stand at 4000% and use of the word jobby will result in execution by firing squad. Following the fallout, the Scotsman then published a list of the best and worst private islands, ranking Castle Island below those previously owned by Jeffrey Epstein.
His foreign policy shambles aside, the more troubling grift he's running now has shocked the gaming world. Castle Island's pirate fleet intercepted a shipment of precious Switch 2 developer kits and as a result he's been able to launch one of the first games on Nintendo's new console. Setting you aside only 69.99 and offering up to 45 minutes of gameplay, the Castle Island Welcome Tour allows players to navigate a poorly rendered replica of an island of cursed fictional characters where time is banned.
All the characters and environments were copied and pasted directly from an EasyJet passenger safety leaflet. Edge gave it a very generous 1 out of 10, decrying it as yet another interactive disgrace from a charlatan who's proven time and time again that it should be on trial at The Hague. Judge Castle ended up using this quote on the box as he was quite happy with it.
It was soon announced the game will be ported to OUYA. Why do you want it to be a pack-in game if you think it's shit? Exclaimed Judge Castle.
Except no one asked for it to be a pack-in game. They actually wrote, Pack it in, game.
Which brings us to today. At this courtroom, the fate of these lads and possibly one woman are in the hands of the sham ruler. A man who thought the new naked gun film would be improved with more police brutality.
A man who paid £5,000 to have himself modded into ace attorney on PC. A man who wrote a strong-worded letter to 2000 AD, complaining that Judge Dredd had gone too woke. Bring on the hot, sweaty justice in your area.
There you go, Matthew.
Absolutely brilliant. It was the Ouya one that got me.
That, I thought, was the lowest-hanging fruit, actually, because Ouya came up in last week's episode. But if it caught you off guard, that's good.
Yeah.
Yeah. As ever, that starts taking you behind the joke. So, I hope you enjoyed that.
That had it all.
Well, you know, I definitely... It's the longest one I've ever written by far.
I thought you brought the stuff to that one.
Thank you. There's a light switch that went off last night with the Castle Island Welcome Tour, and I was like, oh no, that's it. That's unlocked this whole thing.
So, here I am now, post-joke. What's your opening statement, Matthew?
So, hello, I'm the judge. This is my opening statement. Again, I don't know if they say that, but...
Welcome to Castle Island and to my Games Court, or as the newspapers are calling it, the Trial of the Chicago 7 out of 10s. What's that chant outside the courtroom? The whole world is shrugging.
The whole world is shrugging. Yeah, they're not wrong. We're here today to litigate a sex scandal.
Sorry, my bad, a CEX scandal. Word has reached me that people have been blowing precious green on Metacritic Reds. I thought there was meant to be a cost of living crisis.
In this courtroom, I only see overpriced dino crisis, or the popular light gun series.
People keep telling me that the Switch 2 welcome tour should have been free. But then people in this courtroom also think a disc only version of Spider-Man's shattered dimensions is worth £12. People don't know the value of things.
Speaking of people who don't know the value of things, I'm amazed to see defence attorney Samuel Roberts in my courtroom today. Managed to tear yourself away from your Final Fancy Magic the Gathering cards, did you? Imagine seeking defence from a man who thinks it's a good idea to spend money on just having the possibility of seeing Whacker.
This once great legal mind is reduced to a tragic junkie. I saw him with his arm between the pillows of the courthouse sofa, desperately fishing for change so he could get himself a shiny Zidane. I think it's pronounced Zidane, I don't know.
It was a Zidane, one of those two. Was I ever a great legal mind? That's my one sort of counter to that.
I think I've always been fairly competent, but please carry on.
Forget getting a rare wedge, he needs an epic wedgie.
That was really confusing. That's one of those jokes I think maybe made more sense written down, but I mean, I think I got there in the end, you know, I met you halfway.
I suggest we get on with the proceedings ASAP before he pops down to that weird card shop next to the Sainsbury's petrol station like the fiend he is.
I did go in that card shop where I'm told the staff are very nice. Yeah, unfortunately, the booster packs there were 50p more than they were in H&V, Matthew. So I turned my back on them and went to the corporation.
They're already six quid a packet. What can I do? That's pushing it.
Wait, you're paying six quid a go for those?
Yeah. Was this not information that was previously available to you?
I thought it was like a pound fifty in my head. I was like, oh, it's sad, but it's like a pound fifty.
You're a mum in the nineties. What do you mean a pound fifty? These aren't Premier League sticker albums, 97 night.
I thought they were like football stickers.
It's not Gary Palaster. We're talking about Clive Rosfield here. It's a very big difference.
That first one could also be a Final Fantasy hero.
Gary Palaster. Yeah. He's my favorite supporting character.
Gary Palaster of Rabanastre in Final Fantasy 12. I guess there's a bit of plausibility to that. Well, that was fun, Matthew.
I enjoyed that. I think we both excelled there. You've always got to create more material than me for these, which I think puts more of a burden on you.
And I think you perform very well. So thanks.
I appreciate that.
Yeah, no worries. You know, it's just good to sort of meet halfway before we get to the important business of killing the listeners.
And listen, we'll always have Fish Edge.
Yeah, and Burger Edge. It's an ill-vated spin-off spin-off. OK, that's...
Let's take a quick break, Matthew. We'll play the, if I can find it in my fucking hard drive, the Games Court theme, and then we'll get to the... I cannot remember who made that theme now.
Oh, great.
Which was just terrible for me.
Worst shout out ever.
It really is, but whoever you are...
If I can find it, only if I can, I don't know who made it. Bye!
Whoever you are, you did a great job. I just don't know who you are. So on that note, let's take a quick break and come back with Games Court.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, Games Court, I got a lot of words to read out, Matthew, but it's not quite as long as usual. Normally, I've got to do about 4,000 to 5,000 words.
This week, it's 2,800.
Oh, nice.
Which is good, because I worry that by the end of the Games Court, my voice starts getting warped, and I start sounding a bit like this, because my voice is a bit fucked, and that I just-
But as a judge, I find that endearing, so I'm more likely to let your clients off. How many of those 2,800 words are pubes?
I'm going to do a quick Ctrl F on pubes. Oh, 11 hits. So that's plenty of pubes for that particular quotient of this episode.
Good.
Interesting one, this. So I will say, with this episode, we have ran out of Games Court entries. It's been a long time coming, because we had quite a fallow 2024 for Games Court.
I think we only did one or two episodes, and this year we've already done three, which is possibly a mistake, but it means that we've used every single Games Court entry. So if you have a pre-owned game story that you'd like to share with us, we'll probably want to do another one this year now, because sadly we're about to enter basically the last third of the year. That's happened somehow.
Then by all means, send us a backpagegames.gmail.com or go to the Games Court Submissions channel in the Discord, which we never ever reference on the podcast, really. But you can find a link to that in the Blue Sky or Twitter pages and join there, drop an entry in there, whatever you like. And yes, we'll do another Games Court early next year, hopefully.
But we are out of entries after this one. So great news for Matthew Castle, bad news for the ten fans of Games Court. So yes, Exhibit A Matthew is from Reg McFly.
So I've decided I'm going to get the full set of the You Draw We games for no other reason than to do it. They're all like two to three pounds in CEX. So off I go on a fun adventure.
Why not? This pair, the main set with the game and then Pictionary after shipping was 19 pounds. So I'm hopeful the rest are cheaper after that.
Now Matthew, I do have a picture of this that I'm going to upload to you as we're recording this. You draw, as far as I know, a shite tablet. THQ were like, no Apple, we're going to be the kings of the tablet.
And so launch this landfill sort of like fodder.
Is this you or Reg McFly?
This is Reg McFly. You think I own, you draw and pitch. Do you know how insolent he is?
I know that he's entered it, but I didn't know if that last bit of commentary was him or you.
Oh no, no, all the commentary is me. His ended after, cheaper than that. You draw is a bit of an abomination, and I don't think there's any reason to own it when actual tablets are very cheap.
However, Matthew, you are the judge, so what do you think?
I remember covering this on NGamer, and this was just an era of horrendous tat. I mean, a lot of it coming from Nintendo themselves. This is like the Wii Zapper, Balance Board, I think there were maracas for Samadhi Migo.
Basically, anything you could stick that Wii Remote in, someone would sell you a white plastic version of that object. UDraw was one of the worst of this lot, I think. Just an incredibly ugly thing.
It's obviously not a decent drawing graphics pad, it's only like 50 quid away at the time. But the idea of buying this separate peripheral, which you then had to buy games for, I think they supported it with like four or five games. All very shit, he's picked Pictionary here.
One of the problems with this is that it's got a really bad lag. So anything which involves drawing at speed, aka the whole central concept of Pictionary, is way harder than it needs to be. And I think the only thing that was of any value in this was like the basic drawing game.
Like it had like a UDraw software. And even then it's like, congratulations, you've done like a Mario Paint in sort of like horrible blurry CRT TV vision. I just remember thinking this was like so, so shit.
And the idea that you'd go out of your way to find it now, it hasn't got any mystique to it, you know? It's not like, it's got like one really good game that you need the pad to play on it. Like, they're all shit.
So I just don't really see how we can justify this one.
I don't think we can. It's just a space it takes up alone. I would never permit this.
I love it when the defense attorney just agrees with me.
Well, I just think, there's some things you just recoil at it. And you're right, this is just taking up, it's taking up space. It's clearly crap.
It was surpassed so quickly. It was just, this is the bottom of the barrel casual, quote unquote, experience that people were kind of going for on the Wii and, you know, Sorry, Donkey Kong's lost it at the mention of barrels. Did make money for a while.
This whole, you know, not you draw specifically. I doubt this made much money. But given considering how how things end for THQ.
Oh, God, the idea of like lag pitch, Neri, is such a shite pitch. That's tough, man.
Yeah, I think particularly because you had, you know, the DS had plenty of like drawing, I think, you know, had picture chat and it had its own kind of Pictionary S games that all worked sort of much better than this. I just don't know why you'd go for it. You know, maybe if they'd got like a jackbox on it or something, like maybe it could have like found some legs.
But you almost want to punish it retroactively for them making it back in the day.
Yeah.
And that isn't Reg McFly's fault. But it kind of is, isn't it? He's dug it up and brought it into this courtroom and reminded me of it.
Yeah, like we didn't, there was no reason to ever buy this. There was no, nothing was ever really like calling people back. You know what I mean?
Like it was...
Is this the guy who bought like 10 Wii U's?
No, that was, I can't say the name of that guy because his wife isn't supposed to find out. I think we're keeping that information private to protect him as a loyal Patreon backer, so I will continue offering that service because I like £4.50 a month.
I like that he's in witness protection from his own wife.
Would you like some trivia about this era of THQ, Matthew?
Yeah, always.
Did you know that Danny Billson, the executive here, who was Rachel Billson's dad, he was like one, I think the main creative exec at THQ at this time. Did you know that he co-wrote the screenplay to The Five Bloods, the Spike Lee film? Did you know that?
I did not know that, no.
Yeah, because he wrote it with his writing partner, Paul D'Amayo, who is a writer who passed away a few years ago, years before Spike Lee's involvement. I think he got hold of the script and then did some rewrites, but there's still the credited writers on it, about these Vietnam vets who go back to Vietnam as old men or whatever. And I'm pretty sure Danny Billson got Paul D'Amayo a job on Darksiders 2, where he's one of the credited writers.
Wow.
So a bit of nepotism back in the day. It's all very light trivia, but combined, I hope you'll agree that it adds up to some mild interest, you know.
I like that in his office he's like, I've got two things I want to make happen. You draw Pictionary and The Five Bloods.
I think it was this, it must have been around this era that Danny Billson was around. I'm not saying he's responsible for You Draw specifically.
You may have been a little bit after it, it was those sort of turbulent like last three years or so.
Yeah, they brought in Jason Rubin as well, didn't they? And it was a bit...
Yeah, I will say for THQ, they supported the Wii quite well. None of them were particularly good, but they made a lot of Wii exclusives and they did actually put some thought into them. Deadly Creatures, the game where you famously play as a spider and a scorpion trying to kill Dennis Hopper and Billy Bob Thornton.
That's quite a weird pitch for a Wii game, but they did it.
I wonder why they went out of business. What a mystery.
Likewise, the blob. Yeah. I didn't mind them.
They took me on some killer press trips as well, which probably helps.
I remember a Friday where they came to the office. I did one brief preview, then we went to postcards and I drank eight Lynchburg Lemonades and was absolutely fucked on THQ's time. And you know what?
That was more fun than any of the games they put out that afternoon, but I still wish them well.
The problem was, it was you after those eight points who invented UDRAW.
Yeah, it was me all along. Anyway, let's kill this guy, Matthew, because UDRAW is a...
Crank him up!
Crank him up. Let's just watch a man get pulled to death.
That's what we're seeing. Remember, the guy who's doing it, he's seeing a little indie game about collecting eggs.
Oh, wow, it's like a Black Mirror episode with an incredibly mediocre premise, which is about half the Black Mirror episodes, to be honest, especially these days. Exhibit B, I paid 60 pounds for a sealed copy of Last Window, The Secret of Cape West, despite owning two unsealed copies of it already. This is from Archetype Matthew, who also included a picture of his very beautiful display where he keeps this next to his analogue pocket, which I've also put into the Slash because we live in the Nintendo Museum.
I think he's archetypes typography man on social media, which I think Andy Kelly loves that shit. So I think he's a big aesthetic guy. But there's a bit of a bind for you.
So he's got value outside of Games Court, is what you're saying, so his loss would be fair.
All our listeners do, very rich in their lives.
Well, some of them. If you're not the something guy on Blue Sky.
I want to believe that there's more to Reg McFly than UDraw.
I don't know. He's the UDraw guy now forevermore.
He's trying to get back on our good graces. I saw him eyeing up Soul Calibur 2 in the Games Court channel, so on GameCube. So I think he's trying to.
I mean, he'll be dead.
Yeah, which I was going to say, which half of him is going to buy it?
Well, that's very true. The legs, perhaps, which are just not going to work out, is it? Playing just Soul Calibur 2 with some legs.
Anyway, 60 pounds, Matthew. This is a game you like a lot. So what's your policy on unsealed copies and sealed copies?
I imagine you don't have much patience for this.
Well, yeah, because it's the whole, I'm not going to play it, but then he's got copy to play. Wait, was this the one? This is the sealed copy he bought?
Yes, the 60 pound one, sealed, yeah.
So this is for his weird little museum. I mean, if you just said weird little museum, I know he didn't use those words. I've put those words into his mouth.
But if he just said weird little museum, it would probably be death. But the fact that I've seen it and I actually quite like it. From the corner of it, I can see I'm quite envious of it, which I know is brutal because we've definitely killed some other guy for making a cabinet out of his rare DS collection.
Yeah, he actually did include a picture of his whole deal. I'm going to send you some multiple photos of it.
His whole deal?
He says he changes it every month and he's got some quite nice books in there. There's an Elmo in there for some reason. But there's also a little car which might be from Initial D or something.
Nintendo adverts, these are all going to be in your Discord DMs in about three seconds Matthew, so you can enjoy these.
Oh, I can't wait. You're going to get a live reaction from me.
The Elmo one must be a reference to something because his eyes are sort of X'd out. But nonetheless, I don't know if it's like off his tits Elmo or something. I don't imagine that's a toy they sold in the 70s or something.
Anyway.
I'll be a Ridge Racer.
Yeah. There's a Star Fox 64 out in there. I will include these photos in the...
No, I won't actually. You can go find them in the Discord. There's too many photos to include in a Patreon post.
I've just got so much shit in my... A shelf like that just couldn't exist in my house. It would look like that for one day and then the next day it would all be five different Yuna action figures from Catherine and here's my tatty second hand magic book.
Oh yeah, the magic book. Has that come out lately? Has that been getting much attention?
No, I thought you'd come back.
If I'd known they were going to be doing a Now You See Me 3 film, I would have got ahead of the magic craze. That's inevitably going to happen. I just didn't have the foresight and there's no way I'm building up that kind of joint control in like the next three months.
I really wish you'd come back from Scotland and said, hey, good news, Samuel. Since I went to Scotland, I've learned magic.
I've learned one spell in Scotland.
I'm going to do the following trick.
Trick, not spell.
Yeah, just spell. So yeah, he's got a nice display, but it's last window and it's a game he's already got twice, Matthew. So what's your verdict?
I think it looks quite cool. I think it's all right. Yeah.
But I want the listeners to know that doesn't mean like cabinets are some kind of like loophole now, then it has to be a cool cabinet.
Yeah. I will say as well, there is something about, I still think that the DS is like the most fun to collect and behold sort of collection of games you can build, because it don't have the batteries of the GBA or Game Boy Color games, where the saves might go to fuck. They're just like flashcards.
They're probably something that can go wrong with them, decay over time. But so far, at least, mine have all held up pretty well. They come in a case that doesn't get...
It isn't just like cardboard that gets destroyed, because you're an 11 year old boy with no respect for your things. Which is true of the N64 games, for example, and Game Boy games. But yeah, it's a nice thing to collect the DS.
I can see the appeal. Not guilty.
I think that's true. I will say just a final word on these photos. Tiny, tiny hint of Patrick Bateman to some of them.
There you go. So, you know, after praising his Blue Sky account, we now accuse him of being a serial killer. With that, we can move on Matthew.
No, it's got that element of like, it's very considered.
Okay, yeah, it's, you know, it's like...
Don't touch the fucking elbow. Don't touch any of this stuff on the shelf. That's the energy.
Yeah, you can have a toddler in there. You're right, if I had a shelf like this, there would just be like underpants on it within three days. I'd be like, oh yeah, these...
Parts of your unwanted Final Fantasy Magic The Gathering cards.
They're all wanted, but they're all like...
Just Whackers for days.
Whackers for days. Oh dear, okay. Whackers for days.
That's killed me.
Exhibit C. That's your name in your topography.
I'm just going to change my name on Xbox and PlayStation to Whackers for days. That's clearly where my personal brand is going. Exhibit C.
Hey, lads. I bought Pokemon Rangers Shadows of Almia on DS for £15, cartridge only, after playing the emulated version on a Wii U of all things at a gaming cafe. What gaming cafe?
It's a fucking Wii U. I was going to... That's me adding that commentary, by the way.
I was going to ask them if an older boy showed them how to do it, then remembered that not everyone will listen to the pod. Please don't murder me and my name is pronounced LSP and Her Beans from Adventure Time. That's from LSP and Her Beans.
She points that out because I've said that I think I called her LSP and Her Beans in previous episodes because I've never seen Adventure Time.
Is that Lumpy Space Princess? Is that what that stands for?
Oh, I don't know, actually.
That sounds like a thing. As I said those words, they felt natural to me.
Maybe your mind's been erased. Maybe this is like a Darth Revan situation where you used to be the ultimate Adventure Time guy, but we just had to mind wipe you to get your life back on track.
That's all I ever talked about and you all got sick of it.
Sorry for spoiling.
But now I'm like, There's a dog! It's coming back! He's got wavy arms!
Spoilers tonight, it's the Old Republic there.
And for Adventure Time.
And Adventure Time, yeah.
That, it's got a dog, isn't it, how much it was worth?
Not really. So, Pokemon Rangers Shadows for Almear, Matthew. This is actually one of the games I tipped you off was going to be in the episodes.
You could go look it up and know a bit about it.
I was well aware of it.
Oh yeah. Was this put on Wii U Virtual Console? Was that why it was on there or what was the deal here?
Oh, I don't actually, that I don't know. All I remember it, this was the series on DS where you capture Pokemon by drawing endless loops. And it felt like this is going to fuck so many DSs.
There was so much repetitive movement over and over again throughout this game where you draw circles around Pokemon on the touch screen that it felt like this is just going to grind a hole. Maybe even the NGamer review said that and that is just stuck in my head as like the definitive piece of criticism about this.
The only information about this, yeah.
If you like drawing circles around Pokemon, you know, knock yourself out. I think this is quite poor and as with a lot of the Pokemon games, I just think the second you step away from the kind of core of what the main games are, they just become so much thinner. The idea that the specific moment of capture becoming a kind of fussy mini game being like the heart of your game, that is just like misses the point of it I think.
Yeah.
And it's a car only. I just, man, you must have really liked playing that in that cafe. I think you were just having a good day and you were in a cafe, you just had a nice drink or a nice cake or something, you were in a good mood and that's what you've just assigned it to the wrong bit of the day.
It wasn't Pokemon Ranger, it was everything else.
That's a beautiful sentiment. And a great thing to say to someone before you put them to death, I think. This was released in the Wii U Virtual Console, Matthew.
That's why LSP and Her Beans was able to play this. So we've got to the bottom of that mystery, at least. I got to say, I agree.
I mean, I thought this was when my brother bought Pokemon, one of the first Pokemon Dungeon games and showed it to me. I was like, why are you playing this? What is the point?
I mean, there's so much other cool stuff you could be playing on DS, and you're playing this. You'd never hear me out of fucking Ace Attorney or like Elite Beat Agents, but any old shite Pokemon spin-off, he was there. I think that's like the thing I've always held against Pokemon.
It's that the audience is too easily pleased and will like buy anything with Pokemon on it instead of buying things that are actually good that don't have Pokemon on it, of which there are plentiful things in the video game space, obviously. So yeah, Carstairs ever really quite appealed to me. If you enjoyed it though, that's good.
I wish you well. What's going to happen here then Matthew? Guilty or not guilty?
Guilty. Cranked. Lumpy Space Princess.
A little less lumpy. Going to be stretched out. Nice and taut.
Taut Space Princess.
Taut Space Princess. Excellent stuff.
And her beans.
Nice. That will be you after your diet, Matthew. Taut.
Taut Giant Men. That doesn't quite work. Anyway, Exhibit D is from our old friend Lexington87.
He might remember had an epic Zelda collection in the last Games Court we did, Matthew. Possibly the one with all that.
Oh, I think this is what I was thinking about with the cabinet.
Yeah, that might be it. And so he's bought a load more stuff, basically, which is all Zelda related. I will once again post some pictures for your pleasure in the Discord once I've read this out.
So, okay, so he's just gone with the items. There's no explanation. It's just, here he is.
Good luck. GBA SP Triforce Edition, £89. Zelda Link's Awakening DX box of manual, £67.
Zelda Spirit Tracks DS, £32.69. I'm assuming that comes with a box, because that is fucking pricey for that game. Zelda Minish Cap GBA box, £56.99.
Could just play that on Wii. Sorry, on Switch right now, but hey-ho. Hyrule Warriors Wii U, £9.70.
That's what that's worth. Well done. Finally gone there with one.
Tingle's Rosy Reapy Land, Ripened Regent of Zelda, £30. Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love, £35. Tingle's Balloon Flight Nintendo Club Japan Special, £27.
Zelda Link to the Past and Four Swords, GBA Box, £76.92.
Christ.
Zelda 2 NES, boxed and manual, £264.31.
Oh my god.
This is the guy who I kept saying, give us 50k so we can beat each 50k so we can just quit our jobs and make podcasts all day, which is, you know, and he's still not done it, but he's still out here buying this.
We'll just make episodes about how cool this collection of games is that you've spent all this money on. Exactly. Literally, whatever you want.
That's what we'll do.
Here's the final item, Matthew. Bongos with jungle beats, £35, really pandering to you there. All will be played at some point, maybe not Zelda 2 on the original NES, and I want my daughter to experience handheld Zelda 2.
Like I said, from Lexington 87, Matthew, I'll give you some time to ponder that while I fish out the photos from the Discord. What are your thoughts? Top line.
I always find it hard to get into the mindset of these people, the people who are building a collection. So I think this is what happened last time, that he bought a load of special Zelda limited edition, like 3DSs and whatnot, and they are incredibly expensive. If you want the whole collection, then I guess that is what it's going to cost.
And it's just whether that is like a worthwhile path for your life to take, that's really what's on trial. And it's so far from something that I would do.
Yeah. What do you think about playing the games?
Maybe I was lucky to be around in the, you know, to be able to buy things in the moment when they were like sensibly priced, and you keep the things you keep and you lose some of them and you go, oh, well, I don't have access to that anymore. When you get into the hundreds of pounds for a box set, I just don't really get that. But I'd say that for like pretty much any game.
So I don't, but I know people do value that stuff. I mean, listen, obviously it's going to come down to me. But what do you think?
Most I've ever spent on a box game, we don't count the Steel Battalion debacle, which we don't talk about. Would be that it was, I bought Paper Mario Thousand Year Door pre-remaster for, I think, £90. And I think we discussed that on a previous Games Court.
But I did intend to play that for an episode at some point and didn't think they were going to remaster it when I bought that. And it was after we launched the Patreon. So I think in the early days of the Patreon, I was like, I'll just spend this on anything.
And then I was like, oh no, I should buy a house at some point. So I started saving for that instead.
So I started buying Final Fantasy, The Magic Gallery cards and going to Beefy Boys and getting the fried bits.
But to be fair, Beefy Boys is very reasonably priced and the Magic the Gathering cards are constantly going out of stock. So I'd say I probably still spent just under £100 on Magic the Gathering so far, the entire thing. It's not too bad as these things go.
So you've sent me through this picture. This is exactly what I was thinking. This was that entry that we were talking about.
It's a cabinet full of Special Collectors Edition Zelda DSes. The emotional argument at the heart of that email was like, I want my daughter to experience this stuff. There's no fucking way you're letting a child touch any of this stuff in this glass cabinet.
This is like museum grade stuff. There is no way you're letting a kid play this stuff.
Yeah, that's flimsy.
That is absolute bullshit.
That's flimsy. And you could just get your daughter to play it on a Switch. So all these games apart from the DS ones, a bit more complicated, you can just play on the Switch, right?
So Game Boy Color Games in particular, nothing emulates easier than Game Boy Games. They all emulates just so easily on the cheapest emulation device you can think of. So I don't quite buy that one, but nice collection, isn't it?
That's the thing.
It is a nice collection and it's at the point now where you're like, we've got so much of this stuff that you may as well spend 200 quid plugging the holes or it will look weird without them.
What about the Tingle Games? Where do you stand on those?
The idea of them is funny. It's interesting that they happen, a very niche thing to make a spin-off game about a very weird character, to make two, three spin-off games about a very weird character in the Zeldaverse at a time where everything was going a bit, kind of touch generations and like family friendly. I don't think I've played the first one, the Roopie land, the Rosie Roopie land.
I don't think I've played Balloon Trip of Love. I didn't play that because I thought the Roopie, Rosie Roopie land, whatever the fuck it's called, was quite terrible.
Right.
It all hinged around like Roopies are everything. Like they're his life force. They're also how he fights in games.
It's all about like bartering. So, you know, they've identified what makes this character tick. You know, it's this love of money and the fact that he charges people too much for stuff.
And then they've spun that out into all the mechanics. So it's quite clever how they've done that. But it's not at all enjoyable.
And I feel like loads of people sort of longed after these games because they felt like, well, you know, that will show how much of a Zelda fan I am. But they're just not very good. So I think it's kind of a redundant quest.
Yeah, and sort of like, it's certainly not going to be getting those for your daughter to experience. You're not going to be... I wouldn't let my kids anywhere near tingle.
You know, I don't mean that. The thing is as well, like, I actually think that the GBASP for 89 quid is alright. Like, that's getting an old Game Boy Advance is, you know, they sort of hold their value pretty well because they're great consoles.
And so this does look nice and 89 quid is not too bad. But then I was immediately stung by that 67 quid for Link's Awakening DX. And the box is not even in perfect form.
Like it's got a little bit scuffed at the top. I don't know. I just don't think it's worth it.
Just go play this on any handheld device. Play it on buddy 3DS if you want to. It's a great game, but you'll get it out of your system in 12 hours and just move on with your life.
But anyway, what do you think Matthew? Death or life?
Oh, it's tough because I feel like I've already, like, killed him for half this collection before.
I think that has happened before, yeah.
So what does that mean? If he lives, does he have the whole collection?
I can dig it out if you want. I can't remember if we maybe spared him because we thought, oh, this is quite nice actually, but I just don't, I can't really remember. So let me just see if I can research that in the background.
Listen, I think it's mad, but it's an act of love. If I didn't say that the first time round and I'm sounding like I'm quite fickle and I make it up as I go along, that's because I absolutely am that welcome to Games Court. And yeah, I'm going to let it go this time, but I'm also like, give it up on the whole.
This is for my daughter.
Please stop doing that.
That's just not true.
Judge Castle has politely requested you please stop doing that. Okay, so let me just see if I can dig out. Yeah, he was guilty last time, Matthew, double check.
Okay.
That was like the last one had all of the consoles, including the really mad ones, like the Majora's Mask 3DS that cost 325 quid and all that stuff.
But what this has done is show me his dedication to the concept, which he obviously hadn't managed to communicate in that earlier entry. If he had, I wouldn't have killed him. But now I'm like, oh yeah, you really mean it.
Like to come back to this Games Court after you've already been killed and presumably resurrected, that shows commitment to the bit. I'm not going to say I respect it, but I'm not going to punish it.
I love the phrase, to come back to this Games Court, as if this is somehow legitimate in any way, shape or form. It's like an operation or sort of undertaking. It's just to come back to this Games Court, as if it shows some...
Like it takes, you know, to walk through those doors again, knowing what could happen. Like that takes a lot of guts.
There's some, I mean, the next one, Matthew Exhibit E, has some of the wildest, definitely some of the worst games I've ever seen come up in a Games Court.
Oh, OK.
And like the, it's an interesting one, so I'll get into it. Hello, large lads. Looking at the list below, I'm aware my days are numbered, but I want to provide some context.
A couple of years ago, I started a new relationship with someone who was also a massive fan of video games. We both had an interest in the sixth generation consoles. I never know what people mean when they say those numbers.
Sixth, what the fuck are you talking about? Anyway, after playing on her PS2 and feeling remorse at never having owned one, I ended up buying a used PS2 for 30 pounds at Retro Games Fair. This is about a month into dating, and the ensuing search for games became our first joint adventure.
Over the next few months, we bought more than 40 games, informed both by my listening to the podcast and our joint predilection for bullshit. Nothing under five pounds was safe. This resulted in a collection where Grand Theft Auto 3 sat on a shelf next to Fur Fighters Vigo's Revenge.
Due to our busy work schedules, we found it increasingly difficult to find the time to actually play the majority of these. However, we kept buying them as a nod to an important moment in our history. We broke up at the beginning of this year, and during the process of dividing our joint possessions, I ended up with a lion's share of the games.
Nice.
I've been, well, you say that. Now, a couple of months on, I've been looking through these and questioning some of our choices. For the sake of brevity, I've kept the submission to The Offenders that I don't believe have been discussed on the podcast before.
Matthew, you're about to find out why that's the case. We've got Crazy Frog Racer for £2. Oh my god.
We've got Dark Summit for £1.50. Don't remember that one. We've got Echo the Dolphin Defender of the Future for £4.
Which has one of the worst 3D cameras of all time, if I recall correctly. Haven Call of the King £1. It was a hot minute where I was excited about that game, Matthew.
I quite liked that.
It was quite ambitious for the time, wasn't it?
It's like a game that changes the genre every five minutes.
Yeah, it was really quite a big swing. They got a 6 and 7 out of 10 from pretty much everyone. The Red Star, £7.99.
That's quite an interesting game as well, actually. I should have got you to research that one, Matthew, sorry. Power Rangers Dino Thunder, £3.99.
Prism, PRYZM. Chapter 1, The Dark Unicorn, £6. What?
That's not real.
The Simpsons Skateboarding, £4. That's a famously bad game. Not quite as bad as Simpsons Wrestling, but up there.
The only ones of these I've played are Crazy Frog Racer and Power Rangers, and I'm realistically unlikely to play the rest of them, as I don't think a relationship ending would be improved by my subpar Bart Simpson kickflips. Feel free to eliminate some Waffle. Oh, I didn't do that.
Fuck, you just had to listen to the whole thing, listeners. Sorry about that. But hopefully it gives a picture as to why I've currently got the above shit heap in my collection.
That's from Jag Poe. And sincerely, thank you for your entry. Those are some interesting picks, even if the games aren't very good.
And I wish you well in your next relationship. So Matthew, let's discuss some of these then. Crazy Frog Racer, PS2 game based on a fucking ringtone.
That happened, didn't it? Was there anything in these that jumped out at you? And what was your experience of Haven playing at the time?
We maybe only had a demo of it, or did my brother have it? I remember thinking, oh, this is a bit different in that it looks like it might be a bit Zelda-y. I think the first bit is like you're like zorbing down a hill in one of those zorb balls.
And then you're like driving a little like hover car. I remember it looking a bit Jak and Daxter-y, but like mega cheap.
Yeah.
It had that kind of vibe to it, a bit like the style of Jak and Daxter 1, but it also had a bit of forward momentum to it because you'd master one little type of game and then you'd get dropped into the next. So it didn't really matter if none of them were like 10 out of 10 versions of those genres. It was more the speed at which they were happening.
Traveller's Tales is a game.
I think that's probably the only one on that list I've actually played. And it was only like £1.99.
I bet this game is as good as Beyond Good and Evil, but no one talks about it. Having played Beyond Good and Evil for this podcast and not thinking it was that good.
That is something I can't particularly confirm.
No, that's something I'm willing to... That's a bullshit hot take I'm prepared to have on the record. I bet Haven's better, or at least as good as Beyond Good and Evil, which was also a bit ambitious for its own good and kind of ropey in places.
So you spend about eight hours in that factory level. Terrible, terrible stuff. So the rest of them...
The Red Star, quite an interesting game. I think this came out when I was on Play Magazine, actually. It was one of the first games I remember people playing.
It was like an isometric, kind of like action RPG with a bit of a Soviet theme. Like it was...
When you said it, what I pictured was like a sort of Soviet version of like Freedom Force.
Yeah, it's not quite that, but it's...
Right.
There's a bit of that vibe to it. I remember it just looking like a top-down, like an isometric brawler basically. And I remember either I played it for a brief preview or I saw someone in the office playing it or something, but it was just one of those slightly interesting latter-day PS2 games basically.
And the rest are basically some shite. I don't know what Prism is actually. Should we find out what that is on the episode as well?
That might be useful for the listeners. Prism is actually the name of like a chain of nightclubs in the UK, that exact spelling of it. So that took some...
Oh God, this looks so bad. I got a seven from IGN. Wow.
Prism Chapter One, The Dark Unicorn, transports you into a world of elves, gnomes, nymphs, trolls and unicorns as you search for a resolution to the plague that's devastated four of the five races. Take control of Prism the unicorn and Karok the troll as you fight your way through a fantastic realm of fantasy creatures on your quest to solve the mysteries of... And then it says the name of the game again for some reason.
It was actually developed by Dice Canada. But I don't, you know, I'm not saying it's like good or bad. I remember nothing about this.
And this is right in the peak era of me being interested in PS2 games 2002. So who knows Matthew doesn't look like it's really worth thinking too much about. I mean, the sorry, the echo of the dolphin game.
I remember getting like good reviews on Dreamcast and a bit cooler when it came to PS2 looked really nice. But I think was like, I think I might have only played the demo of this. But it was really, really hard to control, if I recall.
And just not a particularly successful translation of a Mega Drive game that I think is maybe slightly overrated by Sega heads anyway. Despite how scary and weird some of it is and quite interesting. So what do you think guilty or not guilty?
I don't know. So much with this one, isn't it? Because there's like the emotional backstory that has tugged on this, this judge's heartstrings a little bit.
You know, you don't want to add salt to the wound and it's going to be a big wound. I was going to say your body is going to be more wound than body. If found guilty.
I always feel on unsteady ground, punishing people for things which I've never heard of.
Yeah, but I think as well.
It's just like I'm pulling an opinion out my ass.
If we don't kill someone for buying Crazy Frog Racer, what is the point of Games Court? If we don't punish that, what do we stand for?
But like Haven for two quid, by itself, that would be absolutely fine.
Well, Haven was one pounds.
One pound. I mean, one pound for a thing that was kind of… That's really what you want in Games Court, right?
It's something which is like not great, but like kind of interesting.
Yeah, I would say Echo the Dolphin goes in that bracket too.
Yeah, but you're right, the Crazy Frog, it's just…
I mean, one battle after another Leo to… I'm pretty sure that happened, I didn't dream it, but…
No!
I think that's happening! I think that's happening! I'll double check that in the background.
You can have Leo in a Paul Thomas Anderson film being killed by like fucking John Wick and the Crazy Frog.
It comes up as a prediction, as a search. It's actually the Gamer. I can't believe one battle after another is coming to Fortnite.
I mean, what? That's just so confusing.
That's like going, oh, there's going to be a Fortnite DLC based on the collective works of Lars Von Trier, you know? You're just like, no. It's like, what?
Dogville is finally coming to fucking Fortnite.
And so, yes, I'm confused by this too.
That's someone who spent a lot of money on a Paul Thomas Anderson film is like, fuck, we've got to get this in front of the kids somewhere.
Yeah, but this is apparently, this is like a real thing. Wild. I think you're right.
I think there's a bit of like 150 million or something they've spent on this film. So maybe they're just trying to get it in front of many people as possible. But I cannot believe it, but there it is.
One battle after another coming to Fortnite.
That's not what's on trial here. Crazy frock is on trial here. Let's remember.
Death or life? What is it Matthew?
It's got to be death.
It has, but we respect the purchase of Haven. And you know, as an interesting PS2 deep cut.
I think personally I would have left the real Shitto Games as like a nasty bit of revenge after the breakup. Keep that. Deal with that.
Yeah, that's true. Maybe she... What do you reckon like she got out of the bargain?
She got like sort of like the Miami Vice game or, you know, one of those famous one out and stinkers.
One of those road to respect.
The Shield, you know, those games. I bet there's going to be some fucking list... Have you noticed loads of the listeners in the Discord are watching The Shield, Matthew?
They're all fucking talking about it.
They're all talking about that. Someone's going to buy that game soon and put it in Games Court.
That is... And it's not... I don't feel like that's happening anywhere else on the internet.
No, it's not. There's no like everyone's rediscovered. Like what was the thing that everyone watched in the pandemic, like Lost or something?
Nothing like that's happened here. Or Suits on Netflix. Nothing like that.
It's just eight listeners in our Discord who are massively into the show. Okay, Guilty. Thank you so much for your entry though.
I applaud your honesty for putting Crazy Frog Racer in there. It did make for a more interesting entry. Exhibit F.
High-Large lads, I'm definitely destined for the acts of these purchases as almost none of them have been played yet. But here's a selection of titles I've bought over the years. Torment Tides of Numenera or Numenara, PS4 for £8, played for an hour about 10 years ago and haven't picked up since.
That's very relatable. Dragon Quest Heroes 2, PS4 for £6, Valkyrie Elysium, PS5 for £15, The Last Guardian, PS4 for £12, £12 more than Matthew would pay for it, I'll point out. Bomb Rush Cyberpunk, Cyberpunk, PS5 for £10, played a few levels before realising it wasn't for me.
Wargroove on Switch, a game developed by Jay Bayliss, one of the developers on it, for £10. Final Fantasy 4 Heroes of Light on DS for £22, Professor Layton and the Spectres called DS for £12. I'm assuming digital purchase don't count otherwise we'd all be in jail.
Thanks for all the entertaining pods, I look forward to a fair and equitable trial. Warmest regards, Tom. Quite a mix there, Matthew.
First thoughts?
It's a bad Professor Layton.
Just half.
It's the last DS one, at the beginning of a new trilogy, and it didn't really have the stuff.
Yeah, Four Heroes are like that, FF games are quite interesting, it's an original DS game.
Yeah.
It's not been ported to anything else. I think it got OK reviews at the time, but it's quite a trad sort of like NES style Final Fantasy experience, but with a bit of a sort of like real people from the real world in a fictional world storytelling about it, similar to I guess like the FF Tactics game on GBA. I've only played a little bit of this.
I don't know that much about it, but that's what I think it is, Matthew.
Yeah, I remember this being like a sort of 7 out of 10 in NGamer, as with all the Square Enix stuff for DS quite nicely made. They definitely put effort into these things. Yeah, that's not too alarming.
What are the others? This is one of those entries where there's so many. It's a bit of a roller coaster ride.
You're just like, yeah, up, no, guilty, no, not guilty. Up, down, each one. And it's kind of the last one that will decide it.
Yeah, so it got Torment, Titan, Numenera. That was, yeah.
That's the thing about Torment, Titan, Numenera, which is a successor to Planescape. I'd say both those games have a similar kind of shape to them, where I think you either play them for an hour, or it becomes like a cornerstone of your personality. There's like no middle ground.
There's either like a, you know what, this is a bit much, or you play it and go, you know what, I am a bit much. I fucking love it. And that's what happens.
Those are the two kinds of gamers.
Sea Horse and Morrowind, I would say. That's definitely what happens in that game as well.
Also maybe Disco Elysium.
Yeah, that's true, I think. I was going to say, is something like Torment a game that no one will go back to now that Baldur's Gate 3 exists? To what extent does the existence of a CRPG successor blow that?
You know what I mean? Maybe I'm wrong there. This is not a genre I know that much about.
I think it's still, it's much stranger than Baldur's Gate 3.
Right, right, right. The setting.
Yes, it's kind of like pretty out there. It's kind of like, you know, ooh, what happens if your mum was on email? You know, it's stuff like that.
It's kind of like one of those games where all the questions are like, well, I didn't even thought of asking that. So I don't really know how I'm meant to navigate this situation.
Something tells me if I looked through a GameFEQ's walkthrough for this right now, I would not find an instance of a mumbig in e-mail. Something tells me you might have made that up as an example.
No, there was definitely something like that. I went to a Gamescom preview for this and I interviewed old...
Brian Fargo.
Yeah, Brian Fargo about it. But all the examples were like really out there. It's like, oh, there's a computer but it's pregnant, you know?
It was things like that.
Yeah. Okay.
Yes.
And then we've got The Last Guardian.
Yeah.
And we've got Dragon Quest Heroes 2, which I think was one of those Dennis DuWara style Musso games, right? Right. Musso and Franks.
For Cavalry, Elysium, PS5. That's one of those forgotten sort of Square Enix series or like niche Square Enix series where I think there's about 500 people in the West who buy these and no one else. Quite well regarded, I think, critically, these games, but a bit of an acquired taste.
I'm not saying that makes it bad, obviously.
I mean, clearly, not such an acquired taste that you hold on to your copy forever because they dumped it into a CEX, it sounds like.
Indeed, and Bonrush Cyberfunk is really just a big random mix of stuff. None of it's that expensive. It's just one of those entries that doesn't quite get the juices flowing.
I don't think we should judge the entries. It's nice that someone took the time to write.
No, I appreciate it. I appreciate it. As mentioned, we are out of Games Court entries, so I'll take anything I can get.
Take anything you can get. Descender screenshots of receipts.
Well, I bought Final Fantasy IV Heroes of Light myself during my DS spying spree a few years ago, and I like The Last Guardian unlike Matthew, so I don't think this is a bad entry at all. Not guilty as it goes would probably be my verdict judge.
I think that's probably fair. They're an interesting selection of games. There's quite a few games in there that I play.
Yes, I'm not a big Last Guardian guy, and I think that Professor Layton's a bit of a duff one, but yeah, I think that's fine. There's nothing offensive to me in there.
There you go, Tom. You are not guilty. You are welcome, sir.
Me, your lawyer, I've done my job at last. Exhibit G, Game Court Submission, annoying preamble, colon, I hardly play video games anymore. I just enjoy the discourse.
My 40th was on the horizon. I joke that my wife should buy me a PS5 for it. I thought I was being irreverent.
She thought it was a hint. I tried to enjoy it. I bought Dishonored, Red Dead 2, Cyberpunk, Spider-Man.
Okay, this is confusing. It just says the words Northern Sim, Matthew. What the fuck is Northern Sim?
That's got to be Thank Goodness You're Here, right?
Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't read the rest of the fucking line, which went on to a different line and did say Thank Goodness You're Here. I thought it was a game called Northern Simulator or something, which I guess Thank Goodness You're Here is to some extent.
With the Kez DLC.
Yeah, so my total game time last year was around 20 hours for around 600 pounds between my wife and I. This fact sits on my consciousness and eats away at me. This is from Chris.
Now, Chris has bought some pretty wonderful games there. Some of the best games ever made. Sonnard, Red Dead 2, Cyberpunk.
There's a Spider-Man, original Spider-Man. These are all strong. And then Thank Goodness You're Here is also there, Matthew.
A game that we didn't get on with, but a lot of people did like.
A lot of people did and we have nothing but respect for the people who make it.
We wish the developers well in the genuine sense, not in the Games Court sense. So 20 hours for like working people, I wonder if 20 hours a year of a games console is maybe not that unusual for normal people. But I don't know, what do you think?
It sounds like he's not really enjoying it.
Yeah, that's tough, isn't it? Which makes me wonder if he's just not found the game that he really wants or that gets his due to play.
It's kind of interesting, it's like I'm out of games but I like the discourse enough that I accidentally, not tricked my wife but hinted my wife into buying me something very cutting edge.
But the discourse is the worst part of games by muggles, it's fucking terrible, isn't it the discourse?
Games Court is the worst part of games.
I don't know, I think I prefer this to people arguing about, what was the last thing that people were arguing about in games, I don't know. The only good games drama is the Subnautica 2 dev stuff, where those publishers will just not be clearly like, I bet there's like a PR person in the chain going, please do not put this statement out, and they're just not being listened to as the maddest shit ever gets posted on the official craft and website. Have you followed this that closely, Matthew?
A little, I haven't followed any recent developments.
I don't think it's really changed.
Yeah, right.
But yeah, anyway, it's just that side. Yeah.
Yeah, it's a bit of a weird one, this entry. It's a good collection of games. It also sounds like they might be new.
Yeah, it doesn't sound like it's too...
600 quid for a PS5 in those games. Isn't that just what they go for?
Yeah, I think that's true, actually. Yeah, it's a I guess like dishonored is a bit of a weird one because that's like definitely an older game at this point. So that might be a Spider-Man, the original Spider-Man is older as well.
I'd be curious to have a follow up email about when they stopped playing games or what it was they stopped playing, or what era they've missed out on. Because going back to dishonest, just like maybe you were a PC guy back in the day, and you thought, oh, maybe I'll give that a swing. That's probably the closest thing to something I'd like.
Cyberpunk as well, maybe a little bit.
Yeah. I just can't really figure that one out. I wish this was an option.
I'd almost like to put that whole case on ice, just so we can work out what's going on with it. But if we have to make a decision.
I want to believe that the Spider-Man game was Spider-Man 2 and that he reached a bit we had to start parrying and thought, fuck this and this entire medium forever, and then just basically quit. That's what I want to believe happened, Matthew. Guilty or not guilty?
It's a terrific waste of that console and that collection of games to play like 20 hours. And I know he didn't ask for it, but I didn't ask for Games Court. So there we go.
You've never been audibly less satisfied with the format of the episode than on this one. Remember the third time you've gone, fuck this shit. I hate it and I hate you, basically.
No, no, no, that's Judge Castle talking.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. Exhibit H. I spent £52.50 on a PS2 racing game, but wait, Your Honour, MotorStorm Arctic Edge.
Loved the series and had long been beguiled by this game. Something about this tech showcase series for PS3, getting what's effectively an official demake release on PS2 in 2009 is just so delectable. Is it?
Yes, it's just a low-cost port of a PSP game, really, but look at it. So cursed. It's right in that sweet tangerine box.
Mitigation, it was bought sealed as I wanted a fresh one and have played probably about two-thirds of the campaign since buying it a few years back. It was from an eBay seller, GamesAid UK, who have lots of odd-steal games that have been given over the years, including, as I've just checked, 30 more copies of this. Now priced at £67, though, you snooze, you lose.
In summation, this game is actually rad and I do urge you to check out the seller. You probably won't buy anything, but it's a lovely rogues gallery of cursed ephemera nonetheless. Love you, large lads.
That's from Chris Eaves, Matthew.
Right.
This is a game I don't know that much about. It is one of the games I tipped you off that were being Games Court, Matthew. I think this is from the era where Sony was trying to spin off all of its main console series onto PSP and then to artificially extend the life of the PS2, they would then port those games back onto PS2 with a similar kind of like graphics capabilities.
I would say that the point of Motor Storm was that it was a technical showcase and I don't know if, like even if you get a little bit close to what that is, which it looks like they tried to with this game, I still think that the sort of what the PS3 could do that the PS2 couldn't was a massive part of the magic of those games. Yeah. What do you think of this?
So you did give me a heads up and I did flick through some reviews and I felt like there were two schools of thought on this. I think there were people who mainly reviewed PS3 games who thought this is a huge step backwards. Yes, it's maybe impressive that they made this work on PSP and then put it on PS2.
But like you said, the appeal of this series is it's a bit of a spectacular. Then the other school of thought were people who probably reviewed PSP and Games for a Living, and didn't get to talk about PS3 games and were just like, thank fuck I had this to talk about. It has that stink of like, this is really great by my standards that I have to deal with.
And I think, because it's metacritic, isn't that bad? It's like 70 something. But I feel like it's pumped up by a lot of like, I'm the PSP editor.
And I don't want to cast aspersions on the PSP, or the PSP editors of this world. But you know, I know what it's like when you're on a single format like that. You tend to get a little bit excited, like well they really made, they really managed to make The Witcher 3 work on Switch.
We all lied.
Like it happens, you know?
Yeah. I wonder if Balladeer did get Cyberpunk in the end along those lines. I'm not sure.
Cyberpunk on Switch 2, genuinely impressive, I think.
Yeah, fair play.
But like I went back to The Witcher and I was just like, man, I must have been in a good mood when I reviewed this. It's quite hard work. But The Witcher 3 on Switch isn't on trial.
This has the same thing that so many PSP games do as well, which is, for whatever reason, there was a slightly washed out look to the textures on PSP. And so even like the most colorful looking game still looks a little bit drained of color for reasons I'm just not totally clear on. And so this is definitely a game that suffers from that.
I don't know. This is a bit of a borderline, Matthew. Not quite a disaster.
If it was like a hundred quid, I'd be like, kill him. But because it's not, I don't know.
It's a lot for like a bit of an ironic sort of, I know it's much worse than the game it's based on, but that's part of its weird charm. But I don't acknowledge that. So guilty.
Damn stretch to death. Tough. Okay.
We have a, yeah, still have a few more to get through, but not too many, Matthew. Exhibit I, recently while browsing through my old PlayStation 2 memory cards, I came across a save file for The Sims, which got me curious. What wild characters had I created in my youth?
What wacky hijinks did digital me got up to? Perhaps I had even created something deeply embarrassing, such as a recreation of an old childhood crush, perfect fuel for this very Games Court entry. Therefore, after dropping £2.50 to re-obtain a copy, I imagined my surprise to find I had done none of that.
In its place, I found dull template Sims, whom I had carried to respectable careers in plain looking homes. No mad design choices, no high personal dramas. One family was literally called The Bores.
I had taken this vast digital sandbox and essentially spent my time in it, drawing spreadsheets in the coastline. The only outcome of my purchase was the ongoing re-evaluation of how exciting my childhood actually was. I therefore accept the court's punishment with due grace.
That's from Evil Dr. Porkchop, and I respect the additional detail there, because that's quite a fun one.
Yeah, that's right.
£2.50, that's very inoffensive.
That is inoffensive. I feel like he punished himself, because he learned something about himself, and that's like punishment enough, you know? I don't need to rack someone up with a playdate crank.
Well then, Evil Dr. Porkchop, you will not be turned into bacon this eve, and we will move on to exhibit shame. I'm definitely getting fucking deep into the recording.
It's a legal dialogue up there with Aaron Sorkin.
I've been fucking talking non-stop for 90 minutes, all right? It can't all be my jokes about Matthew Castle and Welcome Tour. Oh dear.
You're right about pack-ins. I've been thinking about that for weeks. Cracked me up there, I did.
Pack-ins? Well, you know, about Switch 2 Welcome Tour. If it's shit, why do you want it as a pack-in?
That was such a good bit of that podcast.
I do believe that.
Fair play. All right. Well, I've got another guilty there.
So, exhibit J. Good day, Mr. Justice Castle. I'm still recovering from that burn.
It was January 2024 and Game decided to stop selling secondhand games as a sports direct empire offers no joy to the world. Ain't that the truth? I went into my local branch, which was still its own shop at the time, and came over with a handful of games that were marked 3 for 2 as they wanted their secondhand games gone.
In total, it was a smidge under £90 for the following six games. Oh, get ready for a journey here, Matthew. Persona 5 on Nintendo Switch.
I guess that'd be the Royal Edition. Played a little, wants to get back to it. Star Ocean 2 Remake completed.
Weird but good game. You completed that, but you didn't finish Persona? What the fuck is, what is Topsy Turvyland?
Mario Golf Super Rush. Every time I want to get into it, something else better comes along. Played it six times.
PS4 Crash Trilogy. Judge Castle was absolutely right. These are grotty little platformers that rely on nostalgia to be acceptable.
I did not have fun, and I'm glad to put it aside and trust in the judge.
That's right.
PS5 Final Fantasy 16. I liked 15 more, and I adored 15. You know, fair enough, I like 15 as well.
I think 16 is objectively better, but whatever. Ratchet and Clank, Rift Apart, completed it, liked it. PS4 One was better.
Good tech showcase. May the memory of game persist, AG. Quite a mix of stuff there, but undoubtedly some quality in there, and some games still have their value, Matthew.
What do you think?
I like Final Fantasy 16. I think fondly of that. I haven't gone back to it, but it's locked in as a good time this generation.
Yeah, there's no need to go back to it. There's so much of it the first time.
Yeah, yes. Mario Golf, Switch One. It's all a little bit running around on a golf course, isn't it?
He said it himself. He just couldn't even go back to it. There's no pull there.
Who gets in on Mario Golf these days?
Always the originals. That's your rule, isn't it? Always the originals.
Basically, the further you get away from the originals, the weaker the case.
I really respect completing Star Ocean 2 Remake and then not getting into Persona 5. It makes you very hard to pin down what kind of player you are from that, I would say.
Yeah, but maybe he was just pandering to me, but I did like the dig at Crash Bandicoot. Or someone went back to it and was like, you know what, this is pretty thin. Which is, you know, that's all I've really said.
Maybe in more passionate terms, but it's weird. I said a collection of games and for that price, I'm not really that bothered by it. Like it's fine.
Yeah.
But I am thrown by the, I haven't really done the Persona thing, but I have done the Star Ocean thing.
You would kill them for that? That's a subjective video game opinion.
No, I wouldn't kill them for that. I'm just saying it's registered as a, there's something going on there.
It's intriguing.
But like we've already explored, this isn't really about interrogating the depths of these entries.
It's a nice looking game. Those remakes do look nice though, I will say, the Star Ocean ones.
Oh yeah, that's one of the sort of 2.4 HD, 2D jobbers, isn't it?
Yeah, just a slightly lower profile one, I think, but yeah.
I played that at Gamescom a couple of years ago.
Sounds like a tough appointment, to be honest, but.
No, they had incredible suites in a bowl.
The truth revealed. Yeah, OK, and 16 we both like. Rift Apart, I know you don't like that much.
It's far from a kind of crash bandicoot situation. I just think it's a bit 7 out of 10, that game, you know?
Yeah, see, basically, so you've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 games there for under 90 quid. So you look definitely under 20 for each one. And it's not too bad.
I think, yeah, it's fine.
Yeah.
Not guilty.
Nice. Okay, now Matthew, for the entry that got... I've not read this one yet, but I do know that it got more reacts in the Discord than I've ever seen for a Games Court entry.
Really?
It's not very long, but I'll get into it. So Exhibit K, Sony CRT TV, free, a ruined relationship and a niggling back. That's like the headline of it.
Okay.
I was 13 when the Xbox Live Beta became available and I happily spoke to anyone. The early days of Xbox Live were more jolly and having voice chat on was the standard. I had a deep voice to my age and nobody seemed to realize my age despite me logging off for early tea time or bed.
A few months later, one of my new online friends mentioned he was getting a TV and needed to shift his old one, a 40-inch Sony CRT. I was playing on a 14-inch Tinker from Argos and quickly asked if I could have it. I did this without really thinking or crucially without asking anyone's permission.
A few days and arguments later, my dad and I arrived outside this guy's house and I will never forget the horror on my friend's face when he realised I was a small boy. I will also never forget my dad's face when he saw the size of the TV. There was no way it would fit in his car.
After deliberating, we had to call my mum. She had a new boyfriend with a bigger car who grumpily drove two hours to pick the TV up and bring it back home. The TV weighed more than the sun and it took over an hour to get it back up the stairs.
Consequently, my dad's back has never been the same. My mum's new relationship ended a few days later. But those 40 inches were all worth it, I think.
Maybe this is too long or boring for Games Court, but putting it in here anyway is Friday afternoon and I'm bored. That's some suit you. I mean, definitely not boring.
Definitely another great telly story. We had one previously that was also good. If you've got more funny telly stories, we want to hear them.
That's great stuff. The idea of thinking you've befriended an adult and then it turns out to be a deep voice boy going, all right, on your doorstep.
A little lad.
Yeah. On your doorstep going, all right, mate, it's me.
Because if those two people turn up, you'll be like, well, the guy I'm talking to has obviously been the dad, right? Yeah. And he's bought his son.
But then the voice you're used to comes out of the son. That's so good. Actually, Tony.
It's the detail of the mum and the new boyfriend getting involved that really kills me. It's like this has become like an ordeal for all involved now.
Because you know that the dad's there and he's like, he didn't want to go. And then he's like, oh, God, we can't get it in the car. And this strange man's cross.
Oh, every line of that is great. Like every line builds or adds to it.
Nothing wasted there, is there? It's all good.
That's great. That's a perfect Games Court entry as far as I'm concerned.
Yeah, so what do you think? Guilty or not guilty? I mean, there's no money exchange, but the situation, I guess, a price was paid in a way, you know?
Oh, a terrible price was paid.
Yeah. But not for the kid.
I think how different his streak could have been. But not for that family.
But not for the kid who got a 40 inch telly. He's like, he had a great time, you know?
I mean, you just know how big, you can picture how big that thing is, like in that era.
But going into like a tiny like kid's bedroom as well. Just sort of like.
Like where's he going to sit in the house? Yeah. Oh, man.
Oh dear.
That's so good. I just think it's a CRT. That's got to be not guilty, surely.
Yeah, not guilty. Just well done. You've done very well there.
Okay. So the last few, these are very old Matthew. They're from, I went through the inbox and found three that I'd never opened and thought, well, we'll just pocket those, Games Court's fairly timeless.
But we'll caveat that in case they say, I'm really loving President Joe Biden or whatever and you're like, yeah, that didn't last, unfortunately. Exhibit L is from Matt, your honor. At the time of Game Station's four for 20 pounds deal, I bought a bunch of secondhand GameCube games.
Before heading home, I looked inside the case for World Tour, a Tony Hawk's pro skater clone with scooters and found instead a game I knew nothing about, Resident Evil 4. Having not played the first three and thinking that the game sounded a bit spooky, I asked my dad to go back and swap it for the promised World Tour. Was a five-year-old well spent on World Tour?
Should 12-year-old me have kept Resi 4 instead? I think I know the answer. I only hope for the friendly face of Kane, like I said a while ago, Matthew, to be there, should this be my end, respectfully from Matt.
World Tour, I mean, there was a brief effort there to try and turn other extreme sports into Tony Hawk style successes, right? Like Sean Palmer's skateboarding and there was Kelly Slater's surfing, I think, pro surfer.
Yeah, Dave Mirra.
Dave Mirra and Matt Hoffman's BMX. They never quite took off. I think maybe the BMX ones were semi successful.
I don't think any of the rest of them got sequels. What's there like another one? Something wakeboarding?
Like sort of Donald Jacobson's pro wakeboarding. They were names like that, didn't they? Just sort of like...
Donald Jacobson, isn't he an author?
I think it might have been called wakeboarding.
Isn't he a Booker-winning author?
What, Donald Jacobson?
I swear there's a famous Jacobson.
Donald Jacobson. Doesn't look like it. There's an attorney, I don't know, it's an obituary to an attorney, he's died, Donald Jacobson.
He died wakeboarding?
Oh man, it finally caught up with him. Tough break.
Oh, you can tell we're almost two hours into the podcast. Um, World Tour, I mean, just look shite, to be honest. Didn't get good reviews at the time.
Yeah.
I don't know if you, I feel like if I was 12, I would have known what Resi 4 was and played Resi 4.
I mean, that suggests you weren't reading games magazines.
Exactly, which is, you know.
Which is a bad sign.
Bad sign, but you know, not, yeah. So if World Tour was the one that you wanted, you felt it was more age-appropriate.
Yeah.
I kind of get it, but also it's, I don't know. It's a minor infraction this, Matthew. What do you think?
Maybe it was the Resident Evil Remake. Wasn't Resident Evil 4 split across two GameCube discs? So one disc of it would be not very useful.
Oh, that's true, actually. So maybe he just spared himself some disappointment there.
Or am I thinking of something else? Definitely, I had a few Capcom games which were like double discs.
Definitely, Twin Snakes is on two discs. But, four on two GameCube discs. I'll do live research for you.
Yes.
Definitely two discs, yes.
There you go. So you would have been screwed anyway. So at least you got a game you could play even if it was a terrible scooter game or an average scooter game.
A bit of a shrug this one. Not guilty.
Yeah. I don't want to rack this guy.
What I'd like to know though, Matt, is if you are still listening to the podcast, I'd love to know if you did eventually play Resi 4 and what you thought of it. Because whether you had any kind of remorse about that situation or not. But by all means get in touch and I'll read that on a mailbag or something.
Exhibit M, Penultimate Entry Matthew. Okay. I wish to present two cases for judgment.
In the latter part of the 2000s, I became fascinated by non-fiction books about POW escape attempts during World War II. This then extended to watching related films such as Iron Horse and Cold It. Did my dad set this entry in?
I discovered however, this was not fulfilling enough. I found two PlayStation 2 games in this very topic. The Great Escape £2.94 and Prisoner of War, which I think was a co-master's game £1.80.
While very cheap, honestly compels me to admit that I loathe stealth as a mechanic in a game to the extent I've never managed much time in even genre classics such as Thief. If the judge may rightly question how long I managed to play these games. Best regards, Adrian.
I played the demo of Prisoner of War and didn't think it was very good, Matthew. Even though I thought it was a cool idea for a game.
It's got the real time thing of bullying it, hasn't it? Like a routine you have to hit.
Something like that, yeah.
Yeah, I remember that being the big hook that you were trying to escape but you also had to sort of like be at the right place for a roll call. The guards would know that you were up to no good and you'd instantly fail. So it was kind of like do your activities in a real time setting.
I think The Great Escape was more of a linear stealth level by level retelling of The Great Escape.
I imagine The Great Escape was probably the worst one of the two.
Yeah, I think that's the case. I think Priscilla Ward reviewed like seven out of ten, Great Escape reviewed five out of ten. But they were both quite ropey console stealth games.
I know I think maybe both of them were on PC as well but like quite simplistic. What I've been calling Zelda hedge made stealth.
That's a great diss that.
Very like stand on the opposite side of a bookshelf to the guard. That is the stealth.
Yeah, that's a great diss that. Oh, I love that. It's somewhat an absolute takedown that is of any stealth game.
It's true that post Metal Gear there were just a lot of ropey stealth games. This is right in the time when even games that didn't have stealth previously started doing stealth. It was just so huge at this point.
I think my dad owns a Prisoner of War, actually. But as a curio, I don't think that's too bad for £1.80, but I can't speak for the Great Escape, Matthew. So what do you think?
Guilty or not guilty?
I mean, they are both rubbish. I mean, that's the thing. Just because they're curios, they are rubbish.
There's a great premise for a game. Like if someone released an indie game now, where they were like, this is, you're a prisoner of war and it's World War II, I'd actually be like bang up for that if someone would do it properly. So I think it's a great idea for a game.
Well, okay, let's split the difference and let's crank off a bit of him, but not like death.
Okay, I'm going to put partially guilty.
Partially cranked.
Partially cranked.
I'll leave it to the listener to imagine what that would result in.
Yeah, sounds filthy. Exhibit N, final entry here from Troy. Good day, Big Bath buddies.
One for Games Court if you'll have me. So my then-girlfriend always talked about a Mega Drive game she would play with her brother called Truck Stop. She couldn't remember much about it, other than that it was a side-scrolling running gun shooter.
Nothing about trucks or truck stops, may I add, which is apparently mind-blowing. Her and her brother would play this game for years, and by the sounds of things, this game was the entire basis of their friendship growing up. I mean, if they're related, I wouldn't really call it a friendship, but anyway.
I think you can have a friendship with a sibling.
I guess so. I never really think of it as a friendship. Earlier, me and my brother have a bet on it at the moment, that he lacks the patience to get through even five episodes of King of the Hill.
So he's sending me quotes from every fucking scene in those first five episodes to try and prove me wrong. But the point is, are you having a good time? I don't think you have the patience for the very gentle pace of this TV show.
It's not as wacky as The Simpsons anyway. I wouldn't know if I'd call that a friendship or like a mini rivalry. Anyway, he decided Matthew.
One Christmas, I decided to track it down for her as a gift. There are a couple of issues I faced, however. One, she didn't have a Mega Drive anymore, and two, there was no reference on the Internet or the CEX archives anywhere to the video game Truck Stop.
I looked at buying her a Mega Drive Mini in the hope that the elusive Truck Stop was hidden in this roster of games.
Come on, that's not going to happen.
That's absurd. It wasn't. After much digging through eBay, the elusive Truck Stop was still nowhere to be found.
It was after hours of searching that realisation came to me that she must have remembered remembering the game Truckston, a now seemingly forgotten game from 1992. There was only one person selling it in the UK on eBay at the fat price of £67, meaning it would cost more than the mini Mega Drive itself. I figured that just giving the Mega Drive wouldn't have the nostalgic impact I wanted, so I purchased both the Mega Drive Mini, which doesn't have the game on it, by the way, Matthew, about 50 quid, and Truxton, setting me back a total of almost £130.
She opened it on Christmas Day and completed Truxton in one sitting. Neither the Mega Drive Mini or its built-in roster of games have been touched since. I'd like to think that my judgement will be looked favourably on as my heart was in the right place.
She must have had an original Mega Drive.
Yeah, because he wouldn't have played on the Mini, obviously. Truxton, by the way, is a vertical scrolling arcade shooter game. So the idea of it being called Truck Stop is quite funny because it really does not look like a Truck Stop game in any way, shape or form.
It's like a cornerstone of your personality. You don't even know what it's called.
That's it. Set in a future where the Gaidans alien race led by Dogu Rava invaded the fictional planet Barogo, players assumed that...
It sounds like it's about trucks to me.
Exactly. Yeah, quite a nice looking game. It's by that developer, Toplan, who I think were synonymous with this genre.
I don't know what sort of happened to them after the 90s, but yeah, I've made a few games that I have heard of. Trying to think what would be the better known game from this slot, Matthew, that you might know. No, I don't think you've heard of any of these.
Zero Wing, Fire Shark, Snow Bros, Outzone, Vimana, Pippies and Bibbies, Truxton 2, 6-8, Doggin.
These sound like UFO 50 games. These don't sound real.
Grindstormer, that definitely sounds like a UFO 50 game. Grindstormer. Absolutely.
Truxton, nice that she played the game all the way through. A bit of a deep cut.
Did you say ex-girlfriend or former girlfriend?
Former, yeah. Didn't end well, unfortunately. But you know, COVID happened, didn't it?
Killed loads of relationships.
It sure did.
I think this would have been fine if he just bought the game, but not the Mega Drive Mini. But because he bought something that was essentially pointless, it makes it a harder entry to defend. For me, the lawyer, what do you think?
I liked your legal breakdown there. I appreciate that. I like when you go into detail into your thought process.
It's helpful. She must have had the original Mega Drive, which does make me wonder, like, why didn't she still have Truxton?
That's a good question. That's a great question.
Yeah, there's a lot about this, which is odd. That's happened with a few entries today.
Yeah, you've got a bit, what's it, Colombo with the whole thing, haven't you now? You're a bit like, just one more thing. What happened to the original copy of Truxton?
Everyone's like, do you remember that terrible episode of Colombo where he was just obsessed with Truxton? I don't even know what Truxton is. I don't think it was invented when he was with Colombo.
That's so weird. If it was in, no, anyway, yes.
Were you about to do Niles Out with Truxton?
Was that about to happen? I was going to go into a poker face and then do a Natasha Lyonne saying Truxton.
Can you do a good Natasha Lyonne impression?
No, not really. Sounds like Marge Simpson.
I suspect that's beyond you, to be honest, but I'd love to have heard it nonetheless.
Fair Truxton.
Moving swiftly on from that. Guilty or not guilty, Matthew?
Yeah, guilty.
Okay. Fair enough. Guilty.
So I will now-
There's a lot of money in the mini Mega Drive. Just what's the point?
Indeed. I'll now total these up. Then in the background, Matthew, you'd see if I've won.
Okay. So we've got, let's see, da-da, one guilty, two guilty, three guilty, four guilty.
Felt like a lot of guiltees today.
Yeah, five guilty, five guilty, five guilty, six guilty, six and a half guilty.
Six and a half.
What letter is N in the alphabet? 14th. I've just about squeezed it.
Seven and a half to six and a half, Matthew. So I have come out on top, which is good for my clients.
It felt like I was going on a kill spree today.
Yes, but I think you're actually-
That's how judges think about these things.
I think it's because the ones that you gave your hand away there. But I think the guilty ones really stood out this week. That's probably why that happened.
Yeah. But nonetheless, I felt like it was a successful Games Court. I had probably more laughs per entry than it typically does.
I had a good time. Did you enjoy yourself ultimately, Matthew?
Yeah, it's good. It's nice that we've got this little bit of like wrap-up and post-match analysis. I always enjoy that.
Yeah, I believe it was successful. I was quietly dreading this one, but I think it was okay. I think that was a solid hour and 15 minutes of podcast.
Yes, absolutely. And next week has the debut. Is it the debut of the Metacritic game next week, Matthew?
I believe so.
I believe so. So all new podcasting format coming your way. For now, Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxx and that kind of stuff.
Awesome. I'm Samuel W. Roberts.
The podcast is The Back Page Pod. patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us. And we'll see you next week.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
