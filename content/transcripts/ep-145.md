I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello, Matthew, how's it going? Are you feeling happy about your DS draft win because the voting function is broken on fucking Twitter again?
Well done, fucking Elon Musk. Feeling good about that?
Kind of like, it's nice to win, but it's by quite a large margin, which makes me think there are either shenanigans or like, I don't know, people are taking pity on me. So I can't really enjoy my victory. I'm reading too much into it.
It's funny because on the Friday, I think I was down something like 18% to like 88. And then, or like, sorry, that's just terrible maths on my part, 82. And then I think it turned around by the time the voting broke.
So I was over 30%, which I think means that when the list went out on Twitter, my vote picked up a little bit, but yeah, I don't know. I think it was about time you won one. It had been a little while, apart from the XXL draft.
I think the last three I'd won, it was about time you won one, I think.
Yeah, but I don't want people to vote for me because they think I'm sad about the Hotel Dust thing, even though I am sad about the Hotel Dust thing.
Well, also, I think that New Super Mario Bros may end up being the pick for that draft without either of us really realising it. You know what I mean? If you want a platform that represents our system, I think people just agree that is as core a part of the DS experience as the Mario Kart is, you know?
That's true. That's true. I have steered clear of the discourse around this draft a little bit because DS obviously means a lot more to me than PS3 and some of the other drafts we've done recently.
And I was getting a bit of the rage of just seeing like absurd takes where people were dismissing my library because they were like, oh, we've blown it with New Super Mario Brothers. And you're like, that is still like a solid game. That is not a horrible broken piece of software.
And that thing where someone bases their whole vote on one game out of 15, like, I don't know. I was seeing red a little bit. So I thought, you know, I've got to get out of here.
This isn't good for my health.
The only thing I got into bickering with the listeners about on Twitter was, I was just, well, say actually, the response to it has been extremely nice and really enthusiastic. And I always think that the other scenario we could have faced with this podcast, I always think this is no one listens and it's really embarrassing. And we have the opposite of that, where every month we basically hear-
Too many people listen.
Every month we have like 30,000 downloads, which is really good. We have great Patreon support. So we're very grateful for how it does.
And so I want to like point that out before I get into the very petty arguments I have for the listeners about dumb bullshit.
I like his preamble.
Yeah, yeah.
But that said- Deep breath.
Yeah, exactly. So the Pokemon category was the only thing we got a bit of criticism for. People thought we made it too easy on ourselves and we should have said that if you picked HeartGold, it locked out Platinum and Black and White.
Wait, hang on. Sorry, I'm getting my things mixed up there. If you picked HeartGold, you couldn't pick SoulSilver.
So the idea is you'd only get one set of the games from which you've picked and it would have added higher stakes. I think that there is a germ affair criticism in there. However, I did also argue with the listeners on Twitter for no reason.
So we divided, Matthew, what do you think?
They did cancel each other out. But that's fair, we both accepted that, you know? But that's okay.
That's okay. It's really not the end of the world. I mean, I'm not gonna lose my wits over the Pokemon category of all things.
No, I didn't think it was the category that was really the decider. In some ways, it was a bit of a more of a cursory nod to something we knew was important on DS, but we didn't have loads of personal affection for. Although I do think that those games are good, but yeah.
There is the slight dramatic charge of you can take this series off the board by getting it early. Because without that, it's like, well, I don't think either of us wanted Platinum. That would have been a fine alternative to someone else having Heart Gold or Soul Silver.
Yeah, and it's not something you can get anywhere else. Platinum actually would have been a good pick in that respect, because even some of the features they added to it weren't in the Diamond and Pearl Redos they did for Switch last year.
Yeah, and it had a very sparkly box.
It sure did, which I, well, actually, I'll discuss that in a future Games Court, but I may or may not have a copy of that game now, Matthew, as a result of DS Draft Mania. But that's for a Samuel Roberts Games Court. This is a listener Games Court.
So yes, here we are back with a Games Court format. So as listeners of the podcast will know, we've ripped off all of our formats from different podcasts that we like, mostly the Big Picture and Film Podcast. But this format is our own awful son, our own terrible creation.
So Games Court, what happens is we basically let listeners send in a GameSafe purchase secondhand with prices, and then Judge Castle decides if they live or die based on that, and they will live or die in some kind of comedy way. And there's some kind of like vague law that hangs together. Matthew Castle Island, where the trial takes place.
I am a Jimmy McGill style lawyer figure who often sides with a judge when I want to just like put the boot in with a listener. So I'm an unreliable lawyer figure. But in theory, I make the case for the games and then Matthew Castle, Judge Castle, will decide whether people live or die.
How do you feel about returning to this format after four months, Matthew? Too soon?
Yeah, definitely. It seems like yesterday, you'd get a different answer to this on every day of the week. You have to be in a particular mindset for it.
I haven't, I don't know anything that's coming my way, but I've got a couple of things. So really that's what makes a Brexit. Have people picked good things?
Is there any interesting color in their emails? It's a very high-risk episode format. A high wire act can very easily go wrong.
People seem to find them funny, but there's absolutely no guarantee that it will be. Feeling quite a lot of pressure. I'm not feeling hilarious today.
Do you remember when we said at the start of this month, whatever happens, we agree we will not record Games Court on a weeknight? And what are we doing, Matthew?
That's exactly it. I don't really remember the law because, you know, I don't pay a huge amount of attention to all this bullshit.
You're like George Lucas in that respect, you know what I mean? You just hand it over to the fans to think about, really. Like, once it's out in the world, it's no longer your baby.
Yeah, so let's see how it goes.
Yeah, so the games, I would say, there's actually quite a lot of good taste in it this time. So the stakes are not necessarily as high as they could be. I think in some ways as well, we have very much affected the type of things that people are buying because people listen to the podcast and we're building, I think we're slowly constructing a canon of modern games.
That's sort of what we're doing, really. If there was a project of this podcast other than, I don't know, two mates having a laugh, it would be that, I suppose. It's just that...
Well, we were building a canon and you took a fucking sledgehammer to it in the DS draft by calling a hotel dust languid.
Well, it is a bit languid, isn't it? And it's okay if that's your sort of thing.
That's a canonical text of this podcast. Oh, I thought it was.
Yeah, it was like... It's funny, actually, because I think a lot of people have been tiptoeing around that thinking that we, you and I might have fell out in real life because of that instance, but we just moved on immediately. We were fine.
So at least I think we are.
It's meaningless. It's truly meaningless. Made for a good podcast.
I am a little sad, but there is also that undercurrent to a lot of this podcast in that we, you know, I think we both talk about stuff the other person hasn't played and we just trust that they're probably right. It makes you think about, well, maybe this is, maybe this is, this, this takes also wrong. Or, you know, maybe if I was to play X, Y, Z, I'd discover that, you know, I didn't like this thing that was invaluable to you.
Yeah, yeah, that's an interesting point. What do you think my version of Hotel Dusk is? If you played it and thought it was shit, you thought it might be like dramatic or awkward or it'd be heartbroken.
What is that game? Is it God Hand? Is God Hand that game?
No, no, I've played God Hand.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Did you steal Rich's copy or did Rich steal your copy?
No, Rich stole my copy. That's it, yeah. So I've had limited time with it.
It's hard to say. I mean, the thing is it's unlikely to be a Final Fantasy that I haven't played because I know that they're good, or they're meant to be good, you know, they're critically acclaimed. That doesn't feel like a huge shock.
You started playing Seven recently, didn't you? You thought he was good, so, you know.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, getting ready for the Final Fantasy Seven Disc One episode that we're going to do.
Oh, fuck yeah. Are we still doing that? I'm excited about that.
That's cool.
Yeah, yeah, well, I just need to get through Disc One. I've stalled. I've stalled.
Yeah. It's not that long. I'll tell you about ten hours.
Yeah, there's got to be something. What would it be? What would it be?
Maybe a start? I don't think, you know, it's not like Shadows of the Empire is that important to you.
Nah, also, it's not very good. So I'd be completely with you.
Yeah, right. That's the thing. Yeah, I'll have to get back to you.
I'll think of something and then I'll announce it.
Yeah, I don't know. Because the thing is that Hotel Dusk is so foundational to your identity on the podcast, I would say. And I don't know if I have those games in quite the same way.
Like a lot of the things that are foundational to me, I'm slamming them as well. You know what I mean? Like sort of like PS3 fodder and the like.
So you're absolutely untouchable. You built this perfect defense.
Yeah, I don't know, like maybe like Crisis Core, Final Fantasy 7 a little bit. But even that, even that, except it's a little bit corny and not a great action game. I don't know.
We'll give us some more thought and come back to it. OK, now to suffer through a Games Court episode. Welcome, listeners.
Thank you for listening and downloading this podcast. So we have, I think, something like 20 entries here. And yeah, what will happen is basically we'll total up the amount of guilty and not guilty verdicts at the end.
And basically, it's a slightly competitive element to it where I have to try and get more people off than are dead.
But it's not competitive because I can literally just kill everyone if I want and win.
Yeah, you can, you can. But like, I think the idea is that if I lose, I also get put to death in the same way that the listeners are put to death. So, but then I have to come back on the next episode.
So it's not like the stakes are that high. Do you know what I mean? It's fine.
Okay. Everyone's immortal on Castle Island.
Oh, is it? Are they? Oh, yeah.
Oh, I didn't know that.
If you die, you come back, you'll heal. There's like a natural healing energy to the island.
Are they like the Lazarus Pits from Batman, the Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pits? You have to dunk someone in there. Dunk someone in like a pool of Mountain Dew and they come back or something like that.
Yes, Rio.
Rio.
Rio.
That makes perfect sense. Rio. This is great.
Add it to the Wiki listeners. They've got Rio pools. Restorative Rio pools on Matthew Castle Island.
Yeah.
So that aside, Matthew, what else is new on Matthew Castle Island? What's going down on the...
I've got some headlines for you.
Oh, yeah. Go ahead, hit me. Yeah, yeah.
I've got... How many of these have I got? I've got six headlines for you.
Oh, he's doing that thing again where he says, I've got six jokes. I'm going to read them one by one. Joke number one.
You might like some of these headlines. You might not like some of them. We'll see.
Excellent.
Some of them are niche as hell. So what's new on Matthew Castle Island? Starfield was released and it caused a big stink because if you bought the premium edition, you could play it seven days early.
And everyone was like, days?
That's one.
Very good. The context there is that time doesn't exist on Matthew Castle Island as previously established. I can't remember if I said that on this episode or not yet.
So there are two facts. The only facts I remember about Castle Island is no time, no internet.
Doesn't Wario live here too?
That doesn't factor into these headlines.
Fair enough.
Oh, this next one is the one I'm least sure about.
Great.
It's been a very bad month for our island finances. I heard former SYNC creative Rika Suzuki is working on a new game. So I quickly invested all of our finances in it, sight unseen.
Only then to discover that it was called Dark Auction, Hitler's Estate. What a disaster. Have you ever tried to get Geoff Keighley to say Hitler's Estate in front of 10 million people?
Forget it.
The funniest tweet I saw about this was VG247's Alec Donaldson saying just like Nintendo Direct Voice Hitler's Estate. You just can't imagine it, can you?
Barbie and Oppenheimer came out in the cinemas on Castle Island, but because we don't have access to the internet, I was able to have a monopoly on the Barbie and Oppenheimer gags and now everyone thinks I'm really funny.
So you get a nod of approval on that one.
Of course on Castle Island we don't have the concept of time, so we actually found the non-linear structure of Oppenheimer really easy to follow.
Okay, good. So that's more than half the jokes down. We're getting there again.
Yeah, that's four. There's only two left. I should say not everyone is happy on Castle Island.
The head of the mercenaries that I used to police the island tried to launch a coup and marched on the capital, but I was able to talk them down and there was no bad blood between me and their leader, which made it especially sad when he accidentally wandered into a great pressing machine and poked himself.
Yeah, I was about to say, like, what's his Arwing downed in mysterious circumstances?
And finally, Charles Martinet sought asylum on the island now that he's been turfed out of his Nintendo apartment, and I granted it on the grounds that he can only tell anecdotes about working on David Fincher's The Game.
Oh, dear. Yeah, that's it.
That's the news.
The jokes are over. Everyone leave, please.
You can come out now. That was 10 minutes of lunchtime today. That was me thinking about what's happened.
That's good. Well, I mean, did when Eugene Acker was convicted, did he seek asylum on Matthew Castle Island? Was that a thing that happened, Matthew?
Well, he would be banned. I did have a joke about something about re-branding prisons as really difficult escape rooms, but it didn't really go anywhere, so I abandoned it.
Fair enough.
But, you know, I like to show how the sausage is made, how this disgusting, unsatisfying sausage is made.
Well, I appreciate your efforts. So who's in the courtroom today, Matthew? Who's going to be watching the trial?
Because it's a sham trial. They don't get to like vote on who's going to die or whatever, but they are there.
We got a Mario with a voice that's currently under NDA.
Chris Pratt. Good stuff.
God knows what voice is going to come out of him. We've got a couple of people from Starfield. We've got a companion who's got a really detailed face, but we've also got a general NPC who's just got a much sort of vaguer thing going on.
We've got a load of old guys from the Jurassic Coast singing sea shanties. We've got Richard B. Riddick from the Riddick Games.
Amazing. So a bit of Vin Diesel action.
And finally we've got Idris Elba promoting Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty. It's quite exciting to have a celebrity in the room.
Here is his flight. He has some issues on the way over, Matthew. Do you know anything about that?
And cheeky gag there. Okay, very good. How will the defendants be punished if found guilty?
They will be carried out by a swarm of adorable Pikmin, followed by another single Pikmin dragging a handgun. What happens out there, no one knows, and we will think nothing more of it.
Amazing. Can we vary up the Pikmin each time too? So someone can get frozen and then one can get, I don't know, one flies away.
Of course. Of course. Like, you've got all the Pikmin at your disposal.
I've got all the Pikmin at my disposal, so.
Alright. Well, I've actually finished Pikmin 4, by the way, Matthew, like, not just the first set of content, but the second set of content.
Oh, I haven't done the second set.
Yeah, yeah, so my opinions on it have changed a little bit, but maybe I'll save that for a future episode. So yeah.
That's just bad.
More mixed, but I did play it for more than 30 hours, just pretty miraculous, I think, as an offering. I've still got that Olimar 21-day challenge mode to do, but that seems like more of a Christmas concern for Big Sammy.
I like it when I see a tweet of yours about a game, like two, three months after it came out, but then you're doing, like, here's my Pikmin material, I really hate this motherfucker in Pikmin. I've got a lot of time for that. There's not, like, a huge amount of engagement, but I appreciate it.
Well, I just think that the highly specific nature of those jokes is more effective than Starfield, am I right? You know what I mean, like, it's in terms of those kind of tweets. So yeah, I'm happy, like, fuck, basically, like, the tweet Matthew is referring to is, like, fuck Louis in Pikmin 4, actually.
That guy's like a bellend. And, like, you never really find out what his motives are. He's just a twat who you're following throughout the second half of the game.
And he's teamed up with, I can't remember the name of the dog, but Bad Ochi, Evil Ochi, the green Ochi. So yeah, it's just, he's just, like, the worst antagonist in any game this year. So I did make a tweet to that effect, and I did indeed look up the release date of Pikmin 4 and realised it's now a three month old game and it was relevant to no one.
So you know, good to discuss that in the podcast. So thanks, pal. I've got an opening speech here that I have also hastily assembled in ten minutes while eating a salmon dinner.
So yes, I am the lawyer. I'm going to be defending mostly some... Let's assume they're mostly lads because let's face it, that's a demographic we are trapped with on this podcast.
Obviously, we appreciate them. Ladies, gentlemen, Hagrid's, Jeremy Peel's and Scoundrels of the Jury. That was before I knew who was in the jury and there are no Hagrid's and Jeremy Peel's.
Well, there can be.
OK, thanks, pal. We've got a Sega Saturn Jeremy Peel who's just been like lowered into the situation. OK, we once again find ourselves on Matthew Castle Island and in front of the judge declared 15th Sexiest Dictator in an article on The Times of India, bracket citation not found.
Once again, I ask, why must we debase ourselves in front of a man who sold out his wife's NAFDS decals for a cheap laugh on a computer games podcast? How can we trust the judgement of a man who picked New Super Mario Bros to win a podcast draft despite previously building his entire identity around hating it? Tastemaker?
The only things this man tastes are fruit pastels and beige German meats offered at the same time. Everything he knows about the law came from a dodgy fan translation of Miles Edgeworth 2 that he illegally downloaded from Kazaa. Even though he bans the internet for his own people who are famously unhappy.
To my defendants, some of you will die. That's the risk you take when you are hired me as the only lawyer on this timeless hellscape. My only advice to those awaiting trial, when someone in your jail cell asks you to whistle into the white pipe, I ask that you politely refuse.
Thank you, Your Honour. Was that worth the 5 minute delay of recording the episode, Matthew?
That was lovely. I almost did a whistle into the white pipe. I was going to say our national anthem is Whistle into the White Pipe.
But I was worried about putting Patreon only content in there. It's a bit like trying to tease people into a DLC package by when someone enters your main game and is like, hey, I've got this cool thing if you can if you can come to Magic Island for only £20.
Yeah, OK, so there is a bit of a horse armour element to that gag, I will admit. So I apologise that the whistle into the white pipe thing is a reference to a very obscure podcast me and Matthew just did about an escape room.
If that doesn't make you want to sign up for the Patreon, I don't know what will.
Well, I hope the other gags, which are unpayables, were also amusing. So the Times of India one I was quite chuffed with. I was thinking, what's like an SEO, what have I ever, you know, when I've googled something, Times of India has an article on it in like a Google News box.
It's cranking out the SEO content. OK, good. Then, actually, one last thing to say Matthew before we get into it is we have a Games Court theme now by listener Adam Saucier.
I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly there. But Adam is on the Discord and very politely offered us a theme that he made in his spare time. So we're very grateful for that.
So he featured it here. And his commentary on the theme is, I'm just glad you both like it. He sent it to me, Matthew.
We both really liked it. I think it fits with the image of a disheveled attorney swaggering into a courtroom full of video game characters and other nonsense, like a Who Framed Roger Rabbit scenario of cartoons and real people in the same world. That's what I visualized when writing it anyway.
OK. With that, Matthew, shall we take a quick break and play the Games Court theme and then come back to it?
Yeah. So, next time you hear us, we will be our characters.
Entering K-Fame.
Welcome back to the podcast. So we have a second big number of Games Court entries to get through here. I've got a slightly sore throat, so excited for that to be in an even worse state after reading out 4,000 words of testimony from our listeners.
Good God.
Exhibit A from Jimble. Games Court judgment was harsh on me last time, having played all the Discworld games back in the day, so I'm hoping to redeem myself with these follow-ups. Way back in the midst of time when video games were actually predominantly complete at the time of release and children actually played outside of the house, a young man had a game boy, which he loved very much, and would while away the hours playing a pretty significant library.
I will say actually just an interlude. I started reading House of Leaves, that book, because people were like, oh, you can't play my house model in Doom without understanding that book. So I did start reading it, and I will say the slightly odd sort of like stylistic choice of that book, this entry really reminds me of that actually.
It is like a scrawled entry about a confusing old house, basically, it's got that energy to it. This young and frankly rather handsome young fella grew up, moved onto consoles, and eventually became a sorry excuse for an adult and went to uni. Fast forward 20 years, it's a cold and drizzly Thursday evening, winter 2020.
The world was gripped in the icy claws of a pandemic, and this frankly fucking beautiful 38 year old chap lusted for nostalgia. Okay, on we go. His mother said his Game Boy existed, but we surely thought he did 20 years of shit in her loft.
That buried, I think that's meant to say. Looking on eBay, the cost of a Game Boy made him vomit. The sort of I and him of it all over the place here.
But the nostalgia was strong with this one.
This is worse than my Hotel Dust review. Sorry, this is worse than Matthew Castle's Hotel Dust review.
Hey, Jimble backs us on Patreon, Matthew. You pay £4.50, I'll read out anything you send in, okay? That's fine, even if it's like a dime.
Cheers, Jimble. Okay, so basically we've got an original Game Boy for games. We've got DuckTales, Super Mario Land, Pokemon Red and T2 brackets, which is awful.
For the sum of £85. It's a lovely conditioned little thing, however 10 minutes after firing up, the nostalgia had passed and alas, it sits on a shelf looking lovely now. So an original Game Boy, Matthew.
So the games are fine, I think. I don't know much about DuckTales on Game Boy, but Super Mario Land, obviously a classic. Still very enjoyable on Switch, I think.
And Pokemon Red. Can't argue with a bit of Pokemon Red, I don't think it's... Well, you know, maybe you can, but most people wouldn't.
Justifiable. I would say, actually, Pokemon Red is potentially driving that price up just because original Pokemon games tend to go for a little bit, but it's not too bad. £85 though, I don't know.
If that was below £50, I'd be like, all bargain, easy to defend. Not so sure.
Was that for the console as well?
Yeah, yeah.
Tricky one.
What do you got?
Well, whenever there's one of these testimonies which admits to something being awful, that always sets off alarm bells. Like you're fighting for your life here and you say, oh, like one quarter of this is bad, which is what I'm hearing from T2. So I'm thinking like a downwards thumb sliding into the lava at the end of Terminator 2.
That's the image which pops into my head.
Have the red Pikmin lowered him into the lava?
Yeah, oh yeah, they love it. They're having a great time. They're just like dancing around it.
For reference, Pokemon Red goes for about 25 to 38, 40 quid with no box on eBay. So, you know, that's probably about half the price accounted for there.
It's also like, it's just a bit rotten now, though, isn't it? Pokemon Red? You want to play modern Pokemon, if you're going to play anything.
I don't know. I think they've still got a lot of appeal. I think the best thing that Nintendo could do is stick the Fire Leaf and, what's it called?
Fire Red and Leaf Green on Nintendo Switch Online. That would be really good. But I don't know, this is like, surely when it comes to like a nostalgia play for Pokemon, these are the ones where it's justifiable.
Yeah, yeah, I guess. I mean, just personally, I have no investment and this is where people tuning in to Games Court for the first time realize how little logic factors into any of my thinking.
Well, just fucking kill it then, damn it. Get on with it.
It's just personal wish. I don't know. I think that smacks a little bit of like basic bitch Game Boy.
It doesn't do anything for me. There's nothing truly quirky or interesting in there. It's the obvious hits.
A couple of, you know, license things that I don't really care about. I want to give the Pikmin a workout.
Just test they're still working.
Yeah, just make sure they do. So I'm going to chuck. I'm looking at...
I've got to weigh it up and work out how many Pikmin it is. I'd say it's 50 Pikmin, 10 Pikmin for the Game Boy and then two Pikmin for each of the cartridges.
Excellent. That's good. I lost 60 Pikmin on the final boss, the game, by the way.
And that was... By the end of it, I was just swearing at my Nintendo Switch. Like, for fuck's sake.
I was just shouting at it, basically. Yeah, that's good. Okay.
Okay, sorry, Jimball, you are dead, but I do appreciate your contribution and wish you well. The classic Samuel Roberts wishes you well situation. Exhibit B.
This is from Adam Tudoku.
There's a gunshot from outside the courtroom.
I don't know what that relates to. No one could really say, you know...
Who knows?
There were no witnesses. You know what I mean?
A red Pikmin has now re-entered the courtroom and he looks slightly haunted.
Okay, sounds like one of my Pikmin, to be honest. Hello chaps, as we're hitting the mid part of the year, this is said a little while ago, sorry listeners, I thought now is the perfect time to chronicle what I've been purchasing of late. Firstly, a bit of preamble.
My brother's Wii console was sitting at my parents' house gathering dust for what seems like an eternity. Thankfully, my brother was kind enough to let me rescue it free of charge. So now I own a Wii, which I'm using for the main purposes it was invented, to play GameCube games.
Here's what I have so far obtained. Eternal Darkness, £30. Soul Calibur 2, the one with Link as a playable character.
Thanks for establishing that it's not fucking NetGrid and Spawn. £12. Crazy Taxi, £12.
Star Wars Rogue Leader, £12. Rebel Strike, £12. Seeing a pan here.
Burnout 2, £12. F-Zero GX, £40. Because I felt I at least needed to buy one Wii game, I purchased one of Matthew Castle's best games on the console, Red Steel, for £50.
And finally, the one game that may sink me. Oh god. Oh god, Matthew.
Okay, it's going to be a good entry. I ended up buying the one Persona game that I've wanted for quite some time. Persona 2 on PSP, £130.
I am a Persona guy, so hopefully you won't judge me too much. So, Adam's the one who's got the little joker symbol on Discord. Seems like a good dude.
So, that's really interesting. So we've got a bunch of GameCube classics there. And also Persona 2, which I actually think the GameCube games might have gotten away with it, because there's nothing in there that's too egregious, I don't think.
No, I mean, they're literally all in my GameCube collection. I've not got a problem with that. They're all good games.
Well, Rebel Strikes, with its on-foot segments, is a little bit heinous, but...
Crazy Taxi. What's the Matthew Castle take on Crazy Taxi?
Oh, actually, no, sorry. I don't have Crazy Taxi. I like the idea of Crazy Taxi.
I support it in an arcade environment. I've never really got the having-it-at-home element of it.
I sort of get your point. Weirdly, when I played it in the arcade last time, it had framerate problems, and I found that really confusing. That's when it hit me harder.
I could just be playing it on my phone with better technology than they have in the arcades.
But its whole vibe is big and obnoxious and look at me. It's pure arcade. It's like a pure arcade experience.
I would never want to play more than ten minutes of that game. I can't wait to get home and play another five hours of Crazy Taxi. It would do your head in.
But I'm not holding that against them. I know that, you know, it's fine. The Persona.
Those games are kind of weird actually. Because there were a bunch of like quite nice versions of Persona they did for PSP. Including Persona 3 Portable, which is the one they ported I think to Xbox.
And they did do one and two as well. So this is actually like your time to kind of pick up the series. And it was only like on sale for, I feel like they made limited quantities of them.
They did some quite nice limited editions of them. So I can see why this has shot up. But I don't think there's any game where I would pay 130 quid.
The most I've played for a game is Paper Mario, The Thousand Year Door, which has been saved for a future Games Court where I will reveal the price I paid. And that's to be decided at another time. But yeah, 130 quid, that's just, you could just buy, you could buy other things with that.
And they probably will put Persona 2 on other formats eventually. That's the thing, you know?
Yeah, I keep thinking of my Japanese crime books. And I've spent some extortionate amounts on a tatty used copy of a book. I feel like if this is absolutely evil thing, and it's a cool thing to have, you know?
It's not like that guy spent hundreds of pounds on weird bad Silent Hill games or whatever. You know? Like it's fundamentally persona, good series, interesting thing.
I haven't played Persona 2. I don't know. I almost like the madness of it.
So it sounds like a not guilty to me.
You know what? Yeah. A solid GameCube collection.
Like this thing taking pride of place at the heart of the thing, which means a lot to you. I mean, the fact that you've got a persona avatar on Discord suggests that, you know, you're all in on this stuff. Yeah.
You know what? I'm going to... I think that's OK.
There you go. So the guy paid more for persona 2 than the last guy paid for a Game Boy in 4 Games by £50 is not guilty.
But that's because it's interesting. That guy bought a lot of boring Game Boy games.
I think it's like an interesting little spread, but fair enough. This is definitely like a strong list of GameCube games. That's a thing.
Like, I can't argue with that.
If anything, without the persona, I might kill this guy.
That's preposterous.
It's just good and solid. It's just a good, solid collection of GameCube games. There's nothing to kind of set my heart racing in the same way as spending £130 on persona 2.
Fair enough. Well, cheers for that, Adam. You are not guilty.
Another victory for my GBS law firm, which is about to be struck off any day now by the bar. Okay, Exhibit C. If you like interesting, expensive oddities in Games Court, Matthew, you're in for a treat.
I mean, that isn't a blanket rule.
Fair enough.
I reserve the right to also be very judgmental of that.
I can't wait. This might be my favourite entry of this time because it's just so ridiculous. So this is on Jelly Bob.
Not quite a game, but I feel I should hand myself in for the purchase of the Logitech Heavy Equipment Bundle, which I picked up during a particularly deep farming simulator binge. To my defence, it was merely, in Verticom, £160, rather than its usual price of £230. Unfortunately, it arrived more or less as my urge to play.
Farming Sim subsided, but I've since used it for a bit of Euro Truck Simulator, and has the world's most expensive mute button from Google Meet. At the moment, it's mostly been used as a place to hang my hoodie, but I'm still convinced it'll set out for Space Sims at some point.
But it's got tractor buttons, right?
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
This is like a tractor interface controller.
Yeah, it's basically like a steel battalion for tractors, right? That's kind of like the vibe of it. I actually just picture something much more like a real tractor you sit in when I got this entry, but it's not that exactly.
So Matthew, what's your take on this one?
Again, I kind of get it. You're kind of obsessed with this thing, and you want to buy something that kind of fulfills that obsession. I was kind of with it until he talked a little bit about what he used it for, which is slightly cursed, like a hoodie hanging off it.
That's just a little bit too close to what's going on in my dining room where I record this podcast and I turn my head and I see all these bits of Flight Simulator that we got sent when I was on Rock Paper Shotgun for Flight Simulator. They kind of kitted us out with all the controls, and now they sort of sit under the table. The cats occasionally rub themselves against the various pedals and whatever because they've got that kind of rough shape.
One of them's got my books on how to do magic piled up on top.
Oh bless, that book is just the best because it hints at a dream that was never fully fulfilled, you know what I mean?
I don't know. I need to look up a picture of this thing. Okay, it's got a steering wheel.
It isn't just like mad sticks and levers is what I was imagining for some reason, even though I know that tractors have wheels.
Yeah, it's like, it's not quite, Steel Battalion's overdoing it a little bit.
Well, the main controller's got like loads of buttons on it. I don't know. It is quite funny that he presses one of those buttons to mute his Google Hangouts or whatever.
Big farming hardware. I don't know. It's a little bit too goofy and sort of funny for me to be like properly cross about it.
Right. Fair enough. I just yeah.
I think that like sometimes when you buy these things, it's a matter of how much value we get out of a spread of games rather than just one. And it does look like something you can use for like a Euro truck and it not be a big deal. So, you know, it's not going to go to waste.
Not sure about using it for a space simulator. So then it's basically just enough steering wheels, do they? They tend to have more complex controls than that.
But yeah, they're more like you have like flight sticks on me.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, I work on Elite Dangerous, but yeah, let's just say I know what I'm talking about.
Well, there are some, you know, there are some spaceships which are probably more like space tractors. You know, like...
It sounds like they're not guilty to me, Matthew.
Yeah.
Yeah, OK. All right. Fair enough.
So yeah, well done, Jelly Bob. So you can continue hanging your underpants on there or whatever. And Matthew will, despite reminding Matthew of his own living room, he is otherwise happy with your purchase.
So that's good.
Yeah.
OK. All right. Exhibit D.
So...
I like the idea if he's in, like, an important Google chat for work or whatever, and then he presses, like, the wrong button, it just sets off a huge tractor horn in the middle of his meeting that he then has desperately justified to his boss.
Oh, my God. That is a funny thought. Just like, I'm on with the CEO and it's like, oh, no, I accidentally turned on the combine harvester.
Okay. Exhibit D. Okay, you need a bit of context here, Matthew.
So I made a photo. The photo has eight yellowing NESs in it, okay? So, Rock, who can start?
This is already serial killer's death. Go for it.
The NES with the missing cartridge slot covering this photo is my childhood console. The other eight, however, okay, there were nine, are the result of me and a friend getting really into retro gaming in our teens. They were purchased as a job lot on eBay around 2006.
Fucking ancient games court. Well, time, again, doesn't exist. So, you know, this technically is happening now.
And tomorrow. It is weird.
It was described as faulty and without any cables. It was five pounds for the console and 20 pounds for shipping. Our initial plan was to repair and sell them.
We followed through on the first part before realizing that buying power supplies would make the whole venture unprofitable. They've now spent the better part of two decades sitting in my old wardrobe at my parents' house. In our defense, I now have no intention of selling them because they're far more valuable as an amusing anecdote and fond teenage memory than they would be on eBay.
That said, I should probably just get rid of the shoebox with the RF cables that we bought for them. Which is just visible on the shelf below. That's from With Ad.
So, eight Neds is a don't work. Thoughts Matthew?
Cluttering your poor mother's house. Absolutely terrible. Your mother has, we've got her in as a special witness.
And she's asked you to be put to death. So, that's good. This story, it almost has the beginnings of like, the life story of someone who went on to do something really big and important.
Like, did you watch that Tetris film with old Henk Rogers?
Yeah, it wasn't very good really.
No, but like the idea of like, we started off as enterprising kids, we decided to buy a load of old NESes and update them and sell them on. And then, in one timeline, we did that and we used the profits to make our first games console and now we own Apple. Like, that's the story, that's the dream version.
Like, what you never hear is the more likely outcome that someone has a big dream, buys a fuckload of old NESes and then just doesn't do anything with them and they end up in a cupboard being plain.
I really like that this is like the life path of just a very different life. I mean, I feel like we should probably put this person out of their misery.
I think so. So which Pikmin are they going to be taking with that away?
Well, we need... Because it will be quite spectacular, the eight Nes's also being carried. So let's have flying Pikmin to kind of like lift them through the air.
It will be like a proper warning to history. Everyone can see, like in the streets, they'll see this guy getting carried, then a parade of eight Nes's, then a gap and then one flying Pikmin with a handgun. And people will be like, I like the first bit of the parade, but that last bit, it left me uneasy.
Yeah, fair enough. Such is life on Matthew Castle Island.
Well actually, yeah, that's perfectly normal. They'd be like, go figure, I'd be worried if there wasn't a pink Pikmin with a gun.
Okay, right, that was a really good entry though, so thank you for that one.
Great entry, I love that story.
Yeah, I'll tweet out the photo too, if that's okay with you, and I'll just show people the context of that.
What's the yellow, you just know that those things are fucking yellow as shit.
Yeah, they look like world building in some kind of like first person horror game, do you know what I mean? Where you're like, oh, and this is like the killer's eight yellowing nezzers from a previous life.
It's got the energy effect, have you ever read that? Who was the guy who made the furniture out of people?
Uh, I don't know.
Was that Ed Gang?
Maybe, oh, right.
One of the famous American, you can look him up on Wikipedia, and there's like a list of what the police found in their house. Their whole thing was that they basically turned people into furniture. And it's just seeing the list in like the, you know, just the light of day where it's kind of, you know, eight chairs made out of human bones.
A lampshade made out of back skin. And it just went down, and then the final thing on the list was just a pair of lips on a string.
What I like about that is, is that you, you using they because you didn't want to misgender a serial killer who makes furniture out of people.
He had some lips on the string. I just like the idea that someone had all these bodies.
Matthew's pronoun respect goes deep. I appreciate it.
That's good. It's just the idea that someone had all these bodies. They made all this furniture, and then they're like, hmm, lips, what do I do with them lips?
I'll just put them on a bit of string, I guess.
Maybe I'll make a coaster out of this later kind of thing.
That's the bit where you know they're truly mad, because at least the other things are functional.
Exactly.
Anyway, that's what I think of when I hear eight yellowing nezzers.
Next month we'll have someone submit one of those fucking stalls to Games Court or something, so I look forward to that. Okay, exhibit E from GGA Bronco, who actually wrote a much longer entry for this, heard one of the episodes where we said we hate people telling us their fucking live story before they give us the entries, and then rewrote it. So, okay, my previous version was rightly castigated for being far too long.
So, in 1999, an independent game shop in Southampton had in stock an imported Japanese Dreamcast. They stuck a £225 price tag on it, and I decided I must have it. I filled a camping bag full up to the brim with box PC games, and notably my beloved PS1 and any games I had for it.
Altogether, I'd taken an easily 30 games. I'm not sure why I thought this would be enough when they totaled it up. It came to about £90.
Instead of going home, I sold it all for the following. Star Wars Episode I, Podracer, £30. Star Wars Episode I, The Phantom Menace, The Game, £30.
A PC game so mediocre I can't even remember it. And they said a game that's a bit like Tombstruck, £30. I submit this preamble to contextualise the value of money used to buy this middling set of games.
Podracer was pretty good.
So he went in with the dream of the Japanese Dreamcast and he settled for Podracer, a tie-in of Episode I and some game which is like Tombstruck.
And lost a PS1. A PS1! Even in 1999 a PS1 is worth holding on to, surely.
That's got big Jack's mother, Jack gets back from the market, how much did you sell the cow for, this one magic bean. It's got that, except those three, two shit games and one OK games. I'm going to assume that the game which is like, he's asking me to evaluate a game he hasn't even named.
That's hard. I'm going to assume, if you can't remember the name of it, it's bad, right?
Yeah, that's true.
I actually don't mind Tombstruck itself. I would have had a little bit more respect for that. But something like Tombstruck, I can only imagine what point and click horror that actually was.
It's a bad licensed game and pod racer. They ain't making a beanstalk. They ain't taking you up to that castle full of all them treasures.
No, it's a powerful analogy to underline the fault here. So well done, Matthew. I was very won over by your literary prowess there.
It was great stuff. Yeah, so I think as well, if these were like, if I was like an N64 pod racer, I'd be like, oh cool, that'll hold its value. PC games just drop like a stone in value.
In retrospect, I'd rather have had my PS1 in any games you had for your PS1, which I know would have been more appealing than this set, I think, in the modern day.
That's terrible. And also just sort of, just bending so quickly to like, oh, I can't have what I want, so let's just get this crap instead. It's just a terrible state of affairs, really.
It's really bummed me out, this story.
There's a lot of like historical games score entries popping up this time, like there's a lot of, is there a statue of, oh no, no, because there's no time. Right, so yeah, I'm sorry, I forgot. There's no statue of limitations because time doesn't exist.
No, no, no, no, no.
We established this before, it's fine.
Yeah, I'm putting each of those games on the floor. I'm chucking a rock Pikmin in each of them. The discs are shattered, and no one will ever have to play them again.
And it's standard red Pikmin for the rest. No parading through town for you. It's just too weird a collection to share with the public.
Fair enough. You've got to do one where you drop the heavy Pikmin on one of them, Matthew. That'd be good.
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about the fat boys.
Yeah, well they're not fat, they're just dense, you know what I mean? They're just like, with matter.
They're the purple ones, right?
Yeah, they're a little bit chunky, but they're not like... I think in the game they're just like, dush when they land. They're like one of you and me landing, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, good. We're on to exhibit F. This is sort of a reverse games court, as it's some things I sold rather than purchased.
But I ask for leave for my violation of the format and crimes. Also, it's too long. For the launch of 360, I had pre-ordered my console at a local store whose owners I knew well.
Fuck me, another historical one. I went in to collect it. They had a bunch of large white display boxes with a 360 logo on them.
As the Xbox box jokes had been big during the previous generation, I asked to take two of the display boxes. Returning home with these two boxes, I realized I couldn't think of a good joke to do with them at college, but wondered about eBaying them instead using my mum's eBay account. I listed each box as Xbox 360 Box, brand new, but made very clear in the listing that these were simply boxes and not consoles.
This is around Xbox 2005 and both sold for around £15 to people who were planning to prank their family with the Xbox boxes. One guy we sold it to sent back a message later saying something along the lines of Hahaha great laugh, Gary was so pissed off, which isn't very notable. The other buyer took a long time to leave any feedback and as my mum really cared about her eBay rating at the time, this was chased up several times.
Almost a month after the empty box had delivered, the seller left a single message that still haunts me. Lowercase, with no punctuation, it simply read, my son was very upset. They also left the lowest possible feedback rating, which my mum was very upset by.
I still wonder if the buyer really knew what they were buying and if I really did upset a small child somewhere in the UK that Christmas. I used the almost £30 profit I had made to buy Cameo from a mate who didn't like it. God, this is a curse story.
I didn't like it either. I think this was karmic in some way. Unrelated in preparation for the Mission Impossible XXL ranking pod, I bought the N64 game for £18 shipped.
Wow, just adding insult to injury here Matthew. At present, it has not arrived. I do not own an N64.
Wow. Holy shit, that was like the sort of shut up and dance sort of Black Mirror episode version of a Games Court entry. That was a bleak as fuck, but also quite compelling.
That's from Tab Dull. I don't know how to pronounce that. But thank you for your entry.
I've got to say Matthew, people who sell like the manual or the box of a thing you want on eBay are kind of the worst because you see it all the time. I saw this at Ghost Trick Loads. People are like, I've got the box for Ghost Trick.
And you're like, well, where is the fucking game, you num nut? Do you know what I mean? Like there's a bit of that that goes on.
But yeah, I mean, you know, you probably don't get this if somebody doesn't buy a second hand game.
No, as long as it's clear what you're buying. Yeah, I like the idea of the mum who she must have known what she was getting, but then just didn't like the joke when she was faced with it, you know, on Christmas Day, she didn't like what she'd become. And so she tried to pass it on with negative feedback.
There's a lot of tough details in this one. Like the act of like... The act of trying to like spread a little bit of like cruelty and disappointment in the world with this joke is like, that's bad.
The fact that he hurt his mum's eBay rating. That isn't ideal.
It's not bad, but it's not ideal.
The Mission Impossible like in itself isn't heinous because it's kind of a quirky pick. But like buying it for a console that doesn't exist. It's just stupid, isn't it?
I just don't get it. Why would you do that? Like what...
It's not like an aesthetically pleasing thing to have on a shelf. Like a copy of the N64 game of Mission Impossible. I just don't get it.
And the cameo of it all. Oh my god.
Yeah, definitely cursed.
Like if this guy doesn't get executed in this court, I think they'll be uproar.
Like Richard B. Riddick will kick off basically.
Oh, everyone will kick off. The sailors will sing like a really angry shanty. Desperately tries to think of who else is in the courtroom.
Mario will say an expletive that none of us will be able to repeat because it's under NDA.
I've been trying to like woo one of the companions, but then it didn't work out, so I'm starting to woo the less detailed companion instead, Matthew. See how that goes?
The person from Starfield will tell us how outraged she is, but she'll tell it... She actually says it straight into a wall. She's got a back to us for some reason.
That happens in Starfield.
I can't wait to hear your Starfield takes now. What a tease that is.
We're keeping our Starfield takes secret from each other, aren't we?
Yeah, I've not played that much of it still, to be honest, because I was playing My House and Pikmin 4. Don't ask what's gone wrong with me this year. The answer is a lot, Matthew.
No, we've got to kill this guy.
All right, George W. Bush.
How do we kill him? What's the weirdest?
We haven't done ice yet. Got ice?
Yeah.
Too obvious?
Too obvious. I'm trying to think of what's like... This is a disturbing case, so let's pick the most disturbing Pikmin, the freaky white ones.
Okay, little red eyes.
Yeah, what do they do again?
They're like toxic ones.
They're like poison-resistant. They don't poison anyone. They're just resistant to poison.
That suggests they've got poison in their vein. If anything, this is such a toxic entry that only a Pikmin who is poison-resistant can possibly touch these games and this person and take them out back to who knows what.
Okay, so guilty. Alright, good. We're on to entry G.
Good, he says. You're the defence attorney.
Oh yeah, sorry, that's terrible. I'm just going to write a dear John letter to your mum who you ruined her eBay rating. It's so damn, wasn't he a great dude?
Apart from that one time you bought Cameo. That's terrible, that is. There you go, I've done my cursory job and I get to go home with my £45 a day salary on this island, so that's good.
That's a fortune in Castle Island.
This is exhibit G from Tanner. I returned from the dead after a guilty verdict for having too complicated of a 3DS purchase with a simpler acquisition. This is a guy who bought a 3DS XL Matthew but he was German or American and it didn't work or something like that.
It was like a whole thing, the listeners might remember it. Sin and Punishment Star Success over $30. This is a good one, right?
It will basically be my first rail shooter outside of Star Fox 64 and REZ. My brother saw it at a used game store and called me for a confirmation to buy and I thought it would have been way more. Just for the record, basically I'm an American living in Germany, I bought a 3DS XL but had to jailbreak it for my American collection.
Oh, that doesn't make sense actually. That was a, like I say, a tanner. Sin and Punishment Star Success, Matthew.
I think that might have come up in the Weedraught. This is the second one, isn't it? Not the first one.
Yeah, it's a great Sin and Punishment and there's only two of them and they're both great. Sin and Punishment, you kind of play, you're on the kind of foreground where you can move left and right and can jump about, but you can also shoot into the screen. So maybe like a little bit kind of space harrier-ish into kind of how it looks in terms of that shooting into the screen.
But obviously this one with the Wii pointer, which was a really good match for it. Yeah, like you can't really kill people for buying cool treasure games, like that's just a rule, especially on Castle Island where we like those things. I think this is OK.
I mean that you can play Sin and Punishment with the slightly horrible Wii Virtual Console controls on the Switch. You know, it has those slightly weird mapping issues, so maybe buying the original and playing it on an original Wii is the best way to go. Yeah, I'm OK with this.
Yeah, it's cool that you can play that original on there, but they should excavate this one. It's like one of the few hardcore Wii games, and not many people played it.
I'm intrigued by the detail of, like, my brother found this and then called me to say, shall I buy it? Like, he's some kind of... Like, you've got scamps out in the world going to pre-owned game shops or something.
Yeah, like a broker or something like that. We've got it now.
We've got access to this game now. It's going to go, I have to have the word. Can I spend $30 on it?
It's like, that's how I imagine people build basketball teams.
You've been watching Winning Time again, haven't you, Matthew?
Yes, I have.
We've got this great kid.
He's so good at throwing. Can we spend a million on him? It's like that, except sin and punishment.
Amazing. Matthew watching Winning Time is like an indictment of how bad TV is this year, I would say. There's just nothing else to distract him.
TV is... I'm having a good time this year in TV.
Fair enough, yeah. Winning Time is one of those unusual things because you don't like basketball. What is the appeal of Winning Time to you?
Well, I always liked the line that they had on The Ringer, which is like, it's the American, the crown. You know, it's the sweep of history told through the kind of factual bones of what happened, but with like big melodrama. Like, I may not appreciate the sport, but I can appreciate the complex network of human emotions that make up a striving basketball team.
I see. What's their version of the Annus Horribilis? Do they have one?
Like, the divorce year?
Yeah, it's probably when Magic Johnson hurts his knee for like six months.
Amazing. Well, there you go. That's a nice little review of winning time there.
Available on NOW TV and HBO Max. So, yeah, thank you. Thank you for that, Matthew.
That was his knee-us Horribilis, his horrible knee.
Oh, so this guy's not guilty, right?
Yeah, not guilty. Let him go.
There you go. I heard that he had a gunshot then. I think it was the original Red Pikmin who the guilt got to him.
So he took his own life. But I've lowered him into the Rio, so he'll be back with us in no time.
So he still has to live with his terror. He now has to live with even more bad shit that's happened to him, because he's not only got the memory of the life he took, but his own life that he took.
I'm pleased that we can make jokes about Pikmin dying, because, like you say, if the game doesn't take their deaths that seriously, then why should we, basically?
Exactly.
Okay, this is from John. I have no further information on who John is. Exhibit H.
Hi gents, today I bought Demon's Souls PS5 from CX for £22. Not a particularly controversial purchase, however, I've never played a Souls game, and I'm not normally one who enjoys overly challenging games. Should I be poked for buying a game I almost certainly won't get on with?
Before I receive my fate, I have a recommendation for Samuel. Recently I was listening to an old episode during which Samuel mentioned that he wished there was a good modern 2D Batman game a la Shredder's Revenge. If you haven't played it, I highly recommend you check out Batman the Brave and the Bold on Wii.
Now John, you just made an accidental error there, which is you recommended a WayForward game in front of Judge Castle, and we know how he feels about those, don't we Matthew?
There's like certain trigger words in this court I don't want to hear, and I like WayForward game, it's one of them. Four of them.
Okay, so we have that. But Demon's Souls for 22 quid, I mean, it's a really nice version of Demon's Souls, even if you're just vaguely curious about souls like you've never played one, it's probably not a bad way to dip your toe into the water and see how you feel, right?
Yeah, I bought this thing like full price, and I'm basically the same. I know that I have a terrible time with these games, but it's, you know, a cool thing to have. It is an absolutely amazing looking version, and it's still probably one of the more next-gen-feeling PS5 games, this far on from launch, mainly because it was a PS5-only game.
It's kind of all singing and dancing in terms of using all the goofy functionality of the PS5, which I know doesn't matter to most people, but it has that kind of... the early kind of mad years of any concert where everyone's like all in on it. I always like that period.
Yeah, no, like, do play it. You might surprise yourself. It's got a slightly different energy to the other ones.
But I would definitely give it a go, and I'm gonna let you live, provided that you do give it a go. Otherwise, the Pikmin will come and get you. I'm gonna send...
I'm weighing up how big this guy is. I'm gonna send 50 Pikmin with you, and they're gonna stay at your house. And if you don't play it, they're gonna take you when you're asleep, and take you out back.
Well, we'll see what happens out back.
The little one whispers, Whistle into the white pipe.
Yeah, the white pipe. That's what one of the white Pikmin says. That's extra creepy.
He goes, Whistle into the white pipe. And you're like, uh-oh, this is bad.
I've got quite a lot of not guilty verdicts so far, actually. So, Judge Castle, not as bloodthirsty as he normally is.
They've been good picks.
I've not got a lot of beef with them.
One of these is so long. I think we should just pulp them on principle. It's so long, Matthew.
They had to write two sections for it on the Discord. But that's not this one. That's the next one.
I like that you're looking ahead and you're in a bad mood now with your current client because you know the next client is a real difficult one.
Yeah, exactly. So there is a bit of that. I strive to give everyone their day in court.
But if you wrote too much text for me to read out on my throat, it's slightly sore, then who knows? I might turn on you and assist the judge in having some Pikmin assassinate you. Okay.
Exhibit I. This is from Reg McFly. Dear Games Court, I went on a Wii U rampage recently to try and get as close to a full set of PAL games as possible.
That must have taken you about fucking 15 minutes. The following were picked up from CEX slash random shops and eBay. Batman Arkham City Armored Edition, Matthew's favourite Wii U game, six pounds.
Call of Duty Ghost, eight pounds. Fast Racing Neo, physical edition, still sealed, 13 pounds. That sounds rough.
That's one of the shinin ones, isn't it?
Oh, okay.
Lego Marvel Super Heroes, three pounds. This is where I confess I've not played any of them, uh-oh, but did encourage me to play Arkham City on Steam for a bit. Please don't pulp me.
I've got to say, I'm not the judge here, but those are not interesting Wii U purchases, in my opinion, Matthew. Those are kind of like bottom of the CEX barrel purchasers, as opposed to things that are actually exciting, like Star Fox Zero or, you know, Xenoblade Chronicles X. But what do you think, Judge?
Just run me through your list of names again.
Arkham City Armored Edition, Call of Duty Ghost, Fast Racing Neo, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.
I do like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, but there's nothing specifically Wii U-ish about it.
You can get it on any format for like no money.
Batman with added Electro Fists, just what it always needed, said no one ever. The Shinnen Racer game, their whole thing was we can make amazing graphics happen on underpowered Nintendo hardware, but then they just made very boring F-Zero clones and a very bad platformer called Jet Rocket. I'm not a fan.
I'm sure there's lots of other Wii U adjacent judges who would celebrate that, but you've managed to find the one who does not like Shinnen games and unfortunately that one has sealed your fate.
Have the Shinnen games got big conduit on Wii Energy, Matthew?
It's very much probably average games, but lifted above their state. This obsession and this chip on the shoulder some Nintendo writers had about how games looked on Nintendo platforms, the way they just go to shit the second anything shiny came along, it was sad, it was fucking desperate. Who cares?
If games don't look as shiny as other platforms, they don't look as shiny as other platforms, you just have to deal with that and reset your expectations rather than going, this looks so good. No, this guy's toast.
Fair enough. Well, if you listen to the rumours, Matthew, they've probably got that Matrix demo running on Switch 2, so who knows? If not, I look forward to playing the conduit remastered coming in a particularly cursed Nintendo Direct.
Okay, so we got guilty, right?
Yeah, but in honour of shitting in, I will send, or shine in, or however it's pronounced, I will send out the ice Pikmin to turn some water into some ice, because it's quite a nice graphical effect. So it'll be quite pretty as it gets taken off round the back of the courtroom with another little ice Pikmin following behind with a handgun.
Excellent. Okay, here comes the long one. Fuck it out.
I'm so sorry for the amount of words from Samuel Roberts you're about to hear, listeners. You deserve better than this.
It's all right as long as it's funny as the pub story.
I don't think it's going to be.
Let's see.
Yeah. It's summer vacation and I have nothing to do at work, so time for a submission. Obligatory preamble time.
I've been living in Japan for the past five years, but last December I finally had the money to go to the UK and partake in one of my favourite hobbies, travelling the country, visiting every CEX I could find and buying semi-cheap video games. My partner in England for the first time didn't appreciate that particular activity, but I did get Max Payne for £6 in one of them so it evens out. Some of these purchases were in Japan, so I'll put their yen and rough pound equivalent.
So we've got Final Fantasy XIII Trilogy 360, £1.50. For the whole thing? Wait, no.
So we've got the first, say, 13.150, 10, sorry, 13.2, £2.50, Lightning Returns £4, I believe is what they paid there. Eight quid for the lot, usually going for £15 each digital. I had these on PS2, but I'll do anything I can to never have to turn that on again.
Matthew empathises there, I think. You've got to have the backwards compatibility. I'm stuck halfway into the first one, but enjoying it for what it is.
Prey, PS4, £4, Max Payne and Xbox, £6, he already mentioned that one. Marbles, Balance, Challenge, Wii, £15. Back in the day, NGamer said the sequel to the excellent Kororimpa was really good, and I seem to remember it going for over £40 last time I was in England.
I had to buy an Impulse for that reason, but sadly didn't get a chance to play it before having to go back. I assume someone from NGamer traded in like 400 copies of that, Matthew, and brought the price down. Call of Duty Infinite, slash Advance, slash Modern Warfare, PS4, we've got £4, £6 and £9 respectively there.
That seems pretty good for Modern Warfare. For some reason Call of Duty is one of the only Western games that releases in Japan entirely in Japanese. No option for English text or even voices.
I liked the campaign, so I thought it'd stock up on the last few years while the opportunity was there. Also, Jon Snow is in one. Oh right yeah, it's a character in Modern Warfare.
He's in the space one.
We've got to talk about that game sometime. People quite like that game.
We've got to get Jeremy on to talk about all the campaigns.
Would that be a good oddball Two Giant Men play one if we just talked about the sci-fi cod that no one likes? Would that be a good episode or would no one listen to that one?
I'd be up for that.
That'd be fun wouldn't it? It wouldn't take too much work to actually get through it, so that might be good. All right, Akami and Final Fantasy XII, Xbox One.
That's like £13 each. Two favourites from the end of the PS2 era. I already have them on PS4.
Oh, but wanted to replay with a fresh set of achievements because that means something to me for some reason. Silent Hill Homecoming, £360. That's £12.
I never had this one. Heard it was all right. OK, we are now halfway through the entry, Matthew.
This is your...
I've got to remember all the shit in my head.
Time to pull over at the server station, have a quick shit, get a Mars bar, back in the car. OK, think I committed enough. Gamers Court faux pas there.
Wait, did you say that or did he say that?
No, I said that. I've written it down. That would be funny as a mid-entry break for them.
He's like, I've got to stop writing this message on Discord because I need to shit.
This is just great, high-end Sammy Roberts original material. I think I committed enough. Gamers Court faux pas there that Discord imposed a six-hour timer before I could post the second part.
How embarrassing. Jesus Christ. I'm dead anyway after spending a couple of months living budget on a mediocre Silent Hill game.
So may as well get this over with. That doesn't seem too bad.
I don't know. He understands stuff which kind of has annoyed us in the past. I say ask me.
Okay, we still got some more games here. I'll recap these at the end. Trails of Cold Steel 1, PS4, £9.
One of those series I say I'll get around to someday. And I bought a couple of the other ones a while back for reasonable prices. I'll be upfront.
I already own this digitally. So I bought the disc just to complete the set.
I need to complete a set of something I'm not playing. This is diabolical. All right, carry on.
It's absurdly expensive online, so I took the opportunity. I reckon it'll be one of those impossible to find sought after series in a few years. All right, Dell Boy.
When this is over, pass them down to whoever takes after me. Famicom Detective Club Collectors Edition Switch.
What's that reference to? That's weird.
Yeah, sorry about that. £38. Sure, it's not in English, but if you consider that I bought a very nice art book and poster with it, it doesn't seem so bad.
Or game set, sorry.
That was Famicom Detective Club Collectors Edition. This was bought in Japan, so it was actually 7,000 yen. Also, it's educational because I can use it to study Japanese.
Big question mark on that one from MeDog. I definitely will someday. Big question mark from MeDog.
But it will only teach you Japanese as long as you're involved in a murder mystery. So it's not very practical. There's no one who's just like, where is the train station or can I buy a hat?
It's all kind of who is set to inherit the master's fortune and why is that rock covered in blood?
Yeah, that's it. It's like, what would you like to order from our restaurant today? I cracked him over the head with a baseball bat and laughed.
You know what I mean? I just think we'll struggle with that one. Okay, Beautiful Katamari 360.
That's £2 or 300 yen. I've never seen this documented anywhere, but sometimes if you have backwards compatible 360 discs from a foreign region, it'll download the game from the region your account is set to instead. That tracks actually.
I imagine Xbox would do that. The Japanese Katamari disc can still the UK version of the game on my UK account, even pulling my 15-year-old save file. God, Xbox backwards compatibility is the best, isn't it?
I can't say this works 100% of the time. I recently got a copy of Modern Warfare 3 for £1.80, which is still the Japanese version. Still, it's one of those weird things I've never seen discussed before, and hope that discovering this very important slice of video game knowledge makes the judge forget that I've just typed out two unnecessarily wordy messages to try and justify my actions because I have very little else to do.
And with that, the entry is over.
That was a powerful speech. That was like Richard Gere summing up at the end of Primal Fear. That was like Paul Newman in The Verdicts.
That was powerful.
Thank fuck, it's over.
That's what they play in your Oscar reel clip.
Yeah, that's okay. Good. Well, that was from Nell.
So I'm knackered from that, frankly, and it could have been a lot shorter, no offence. Didn't need all that detail, but I did like the CEX on tour detail, but that was only like 20% into your post. You could have left it there.
Yeah, the idea of like, you know, you're in this really exciting country with like its own kind of video game shop culture and its own...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, really exciting country. Are you talking about the United Kingdom?
No, Japan.
Oh, right.
He's out in Japan, then he comes back and goes to all these fucking CEXs and buys all these mediocre, you know, copies of games that half of them, it sounds like, he already owns. Like, I was more interested in that. Oh, and buying all these quirky Japanese things.
Now, I will say the fact about buying a Japanese copy and then it downloading the localized copy because it recognizes you've got a UK account, that's a nice little bit of color. I didn't know about that. And I do like that.
I will say, Matthew, something that is funny about this, right, is that your point about Japanese games, right? I mean, let's say you're in like Super Potato, the least interesting thing you can buy is a Call of Duty game.
That is the flip side to this, is that then when you are back in Japan, you buy some truly dire stuff. And I'm not big into Famicom Detective Club, it should be my jam. The idea of buying it in a language you can't read, that seems preposterous to me.
There's too many bad purchases in here. Though, you know, I will say there is a slight pang of guilt goes through my head for maybe like three seconds as you vanish around the corner of the courtroom carried by an army of red Pikmin. Because I do think, well, there goes that guy that told me that quite interesting fact.
But that's really all it is.
I think you were doing very well until you got to like the Silent Hill Homecoming, then it started to go bad from there. Like FFXII, Xbox One, you know, perfectly good purchase. Kami, Max Payne, Xbox, you can play it backwards compatible.
Prey, great game. FFXIII Trilogy for eight quid, the entire lot. All those are pretty solid.
It was just too long, I forgot about all that. And now I've sentenced him to death. So like, let this be a lesson.
People should like boil these down to like the premium picks. It's too hard to judge and balance a life's work. What a lazy judge I am.
Imagine if a real judge was like, this case was so long and complicated. I've forgotten what happened in the first two thirds. I wish you had just told me the good bits.
If you didn't want to be dead, she's had a short testimony. Let that be a lesson to you.
I think that's how all courtrooms should be run. It's like one side, give me your best bit of evidence. One bit.
You give me your best bit of proof against it, and then let's see how it lies. What's your very best versus the very best? And really, that should decide it.
If you think it through logically. So this guy, just too many games. The whole, like, bought a physical copy of a game that he already had digital.
That's just so dumb.
I have no time for that at all. I kind of fear the Trails games a little bit. Like, I just don't understand that whole thing.
That's on me. That is my fault for not, like, having played these things and got my head around them. But that's because there's, like, 20 and you will have to play them out of order and they all kind of interlink and lay side.
And whenever you ask anyone to explain it, just the most incomprehensible shit comes out of their mouth. So maybe I'm kind of, like, projecting a bit of that on these picks as well. But I heard too many, I heard too many kind of bad, you know, red alert words in there.
So, it's done. It's done. I've already heard the gunshot.
I've been talking this whole time. He's already been taken out.
You felt the need to provide an equally long explanation to the original entry review. I've got a riff for 25 minutes until we get to the end of this one. Okay.
I like how you are still going, even though you've already established they've been taken out back and shot by the Pikmin. But you're like, I've heard too many bad words. They've been dead for a long time now.
The body is rotting.
I just felt like they'd said too many game names. People were like, we didn't really get our money's worth from the judge. He didn't really pass judgment.
He just killed a guy. And so I was trying to make you feel like there was some kind of logic to the proceedings.
Fair enough. Do you think people in Japan talk about CEX with the same reverence that British retro nerds talk about Super Potato? They've got this amazing shop, right?
Where they've got all these old games across formats going back decades. But all the good stuff's been stripped now by collectors. Do you think it's the same discourse but for CEX?
And then you go upstairs and they've got a hundred copies of American Pie 2 on DVD. They're like, what's with that?
OK, we've still got so many more to get through.
Have we? I'm beginning to get a bit of a sweat on.
No, I'm the same. So we've got, I don't know, something like seven left, something like that. OK.
Oh, seven's OK.
This is quite a short one. Thank God, after that one. Alex Drew.
After a little nostalgia hit, I picked up Kesson for the PS2 for a £2.99 plus postage. I wanted to buy my main Christmas present from 2001. Fuck me.
Talk about a deprived kid. I have pestered my mum all summer about this game. At £12 it wasn't the game my mates were talking about, but God, I spent many, many hours in the strategy land and still love that era of Japanese history today as a full man-child.
This seems very innocent to me, Matthew. Kessin probably is a little bit underrated as an early PS2 game. I like the idea that you got so hung up on this, you bothered your mum about it.
Mum, get me Kessin for Christmas! That seems so unlikely, you know?
My relationship with Kessin is just seeing the box for Kessin. It had a photorealistic general type on the front, which makes you think it's going to be something you're interested in. But then if you turn the box around, you're instantly like, oh no, no, no, no, no, this isn't for me or anyone else.
So, that's the amount of research you need to do to know not to get Kessin. The idea that you actively looked into it and was like, I'm going to use my Christmas wish or my birthday wish on Kessin. I know what it was like back then.
It was very rare to get a game. And using one of those shots on Kessin is bold. And then coming back for round two.
I just don't know. Is Kessin good? Is it?
I think it was like a strategy game, right? And I think it's like a 7 out of 10-ish. I think you got 7 from OPM at the time.
I think it's around that level. But it's not like Dynasty Warriors.
No, it's sort of like a Nobunaga's Ambition type thing.
I don't know.
It's my understanding.
I mean, it feels wrong to kill this guy when I know so little about it. I mean, it's quite a harmless price for quite a niche thing. And he said himself that it instilled an interest in Japanese history.
So, yeah, you know what? I'm going to let him go.
Yeah, a real-time tactics game. It does look like the, I would say, typical kind of Koei sort of interface and experience. You've got loads and loads of dudes on screen basically.
But, yeah, I think it's very innocent for that price. My only experience with the Kessin Rite is people might remember this. Like Blockbuster used to do different tiers of games for when you'd rent them.
So my memory is that it was like a pound or a pound fifty more to rent the really modern stuff. So in early 2002, I was in a Blockbuster and I saw someone from my school there. And we were both in the same boat of like we've only got three quid to spend on a game.
I got Crazy Taxi because I didn't have the requisite four quid to get Death May Cry. They got Kessin. And I just thought the idea of like two mates having a sleepover and renting Kessin is such a, that sounds like such a disappointing weekend.
Do you know what I mean?
Well, I don't know. Or they emerged that evening like far more sophisticated than when they entered into it. And all of a sudden they return to school and they've got all this like deep Japanese strategy knowledge and like all the girls super impressed.
All the teachers are like, you've really matured this weekend. Maybe Kessin is the key.
Yeah, the girls love a bit of Kessin famously.
No, because you can say something kind of like wry and you know, like a wry strategic idiom from the feudal period. People are like, he sounds cool and growing up all of a sudden.
Oh dear. Well, look, you're definitely getting people value for money on this podcast, Matthew. And I respect that.
This one's really long again. Actually, it's not too bad.
I had something else I was going to say about Kessin. No, I can't remember.
It came out recently, Kessin. I can't remember why. I think it was again the butt of a joke of some kind.
But I can't remember what it was.
Apparently, Koei, before they were Tecmo Koei, maybe they still do this, but apparently in their international offices, they still ran them to like strict Japanese traditions. So like in their European or UK or American offices, they like adhered to all the workplace things. They had like a day where all the staff would come in and like clean the office from top to bottom, because that's what they did in the Japanese office and things like that.
They were just like staunchly traditional. I don't know whether they still do that, but I remember writing an end game of footnote about that.
Okay, good. I know somebody used to work there, so I'll drop him a line and ask him, see what he says.
Did you have to come in and clean the office? As per Japanese tradition dictates.
Right then. Exhibit L. I didn't write down who this is, so I don't know who we're killing here.
Sorry about this. It's been a long week.
We don't know that we're going to kill them.
No, that's true. Hello, fellows. I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller, growing gently concerned about the tentative future of Gamescore.
It is a pod format to be proud of. Prompted mainly by the pod and sincere appreciation for the DS and 3DS, I have been returning to the Coq collection. Notes for the use of defence can be taken or left.
Hotel Dusk, Room 215.
Eight-fucking-snore. Am I right?
If you want to play a six-out-of-ten adventure game... No, I'm joking. I don't think that.
Presentation is very nice. I thought this would be... I'm just making it worse.
I thought this would be good at bedtimes, but it's been soothing me immediately to sleep, and I've made absolutely no progress whatsoever. This sounds like a plan by me, doesn't it? So does this next one.
Meteos. Five pounds of fond childhood repurchase. This is all marketing for my DS draft picks, Matthew.
Interested to discover this was a Sakurai game, which I was too on the episode, having not done my research properly. Zookeeper, £1.99.
Zookeeper? Chrissy, our production editor on NGamer when I first joined, was big into Zookeeper, and her review avatar was the angry giraffe from Zookeeper. There you go.
There's a little Zookeeper fact for you.
Well, there you go. I'm now sold on it. I will load it up on an R4 cartridge.
No, I'm only joking. Okay, we've got a cracker here. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars, £3.00, a Julian Gollop classic.
Unfortunately, the cover is so gross and yellow that I've not brought myself to open this one. Yeah, we're talking about it. Someone just pissed on it or something.
Very confusing.
It's so gross.
Apparently, gross and yellow. 40-2, all-time classics, £1.50. Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, £10.00.
Already owned on Wii for £8.00 in 2015, but found it too hard. Confusing. Tropical Freezer.
So let's play it with even fiddlier, smaller 3DS controls. That will help me.
Tropical Freeze is such a banger, I thought I'd give it another go. I personally think you were better off just sticking with Tropical Freeze there. Sushi Striker, The Way of Sushido, 3DS, £3.00.
Feels quite overlooked. Picross 3D, round 2, £10.00. So supplanted Hotel Dusk as the bedtime game, that's brutal.
But Matthew does like Picross.
No, I like 3D Picross too, that's okay. You've swapped one Castle classic for another, I still win.
Yeah, now Hotel Dusk has been established as a sleeping aid, we could all move on basically.
I took so much damage here to a working relationship of very much value, I'm only joking.
It has got a hazy, dreamy nocturnal vibe to it, but not a sleep aid, come on.
Oh man, I've done so much damage to this partnership. Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner Soul Hackers 3DS, £32. Surprised myself with this frivolous purchase, but it felt quite exciting to see an old looking and odd looking SMT game in CEX.
SMT Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker, £28. Did not finish the first Devil Survivor, but it was next to Soul Hackers on the shelf and excitement overcame me. DS Astro Boy, £2.
Mistook this for the superior GBA game that I used to own.
What a mistake to make.
Terrible mistake. And in my SMT-fuelled fugue state, I grabbed this too. Very disappointed to boot this one up.
Cheers, and we don't know who that's from, but I wish you well, whoever you are. Quite a grab bag there, Matthew. Mixed, I would say, overall, but where are you at with this?
Well, Hotec Dusk, Legendary, Meteos, great, no complaints. I think that Donkey Kong is the most egregious one here. Like the idea of, oh, I really love this game, so let's play a slightly inferior version of it, as in the first Donkey Kong Country Returns, and then let's play the most inferior version of that, the 3DS one.
That, to me, is a very strange journey you've gone on.
10 quid, though. 10 quid's not too egregious.
Yeah, even that, I'm like, nah. Not for me. No, thank you.
Also brings back some of my Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze PTSD, just hearing its name said. SMT continues to be a bit of a blind spot on this podcast, though they are, like most of them, beloved, if you actually play them and get into them, and quite difficult to get hold of. They're only getting more and more expensive.
Lots of people bought loads of these. There was a massive sale just before the 3DS store closed, and they sold all of these for $5.99 or whatever. So I basically stocked my 3DS up then.
So that was good for me, I guess. That anecdote wasn't going anywhere.
You're great, good. This is a big anecdote about your dad being friends with Sailor's Energy.
Needless to say, I had the last laugh. I think there's more good than bad here.
Fair enough. I think I probably agree. There's good taste at the heart of these picks.
I think we need to reward that.
Shadow Wars for 3 quid. That's a proper 3DS hidden gem. Yeah, that's strong.
No, I think that Hotel Dusk, the SMT games, that's fine, I can live with it. And I'll pardon you for Donkey. I'll tell you what, let's smash Donkey Kong Country Returns on 3DS with a Rock Pikmin again.
And you can have the rest.
Okay, not guilty. Wow, lots of not guilty verdicts today. Matthew is not out for blood.
He just wants to regale the court with his anecdotes about vague things that may or may not have happened. It really is a midweek podcast. Sorry, I'm being a dick this evening.
I don't know why. I think we have just five entries left, Matthew. So let's get through them.
Okay, all data, no bullshit. Wii U Premium Console, £50 from Man in Car Park via Facebook, September 2021. Wait for it.
Stylus was badly chewed. Required £5 replacement via Amazon. Rock Band Wii Beetles Full Plastic Instrument Set, £50 via Facebook, October 2021.
Battery... Battery had leaked into a solid crusty lump within guitar, scraped out with kitchen knife. Cost of my health as yet unknown.
Rock Band Extra Tracks Disc, £1 from CEX, October 2021. No further context provided there. Fear, Xbox 360 Disc, £6 from CEX, August 2023.
Well, no complaints from me there. Fear is a classic. Great price.
Sorry, there was actually a small amount of bullshit in there. Plus some Slayer Disco. Quite a fun little entry there, Matthew.
The crude details make me question it slightly, but this is a good question, though. Is there any justification for owning a Wii U, like now? Is there ever a good reason to do that, do you think?
You just want to check out the two or three gems that haven't made it over. What do you think?
That's difficult.
There's so few things on there, but there are a few things which will only ever be on there. So I can definitely understand it from a preservation point of view. But it's not a cool thing to buy or collect for because you're going to be getting inferior versions of a lot of things which have been improved or moved over to Switch.
I don't hate it in principle, but the details of the thing and just how cursed it all is, that's pretty bad. The chewing, the chewed stylus is just so fucking gnarly. It's just not something you'd want to touch.
Because you know, because you bought it from the guy in the car park, you know it's been probably in his mouth specifically.
Yeah, five minutes before the purchase.
Who chews a sty...
I just don't know what game that you'd ever be playing where you can just sit back and you have to like ponder that you can have a good old gnar on the stylus, you know?
Nah, this is some David Fincher shit right here.
Yeah, just for the unpleasant details, it's probably got to be death.
Okay, how's it going to happen? Which Pikmin are being dragged in for this one?
In honor of a weird corroded battery, so we send the yellow electric Pikmin.
Oh, very nice.
And we will... Instead of the handgun, stand down one yellow Pikmin pulling a handgun, the yellow Pikmin are going to carry into one of those electric fences from the game.
Okay, excellent.
Just that. But it's going to happen outside, just the lights will flicker for a second inside the courtroom and people will be like, what's that? You know, the bad graphics NPC from Starfield will look slightly alarmed or maybe it's just their face glitching out and it will carry on with the rest of our day.
Okay, excellent. Why don't the yellow Pikmin, like, electroshock enemies in the way... Why do only the ice Pikmin get to have some kind of elemental ability?
That seems like a weird design choice to me.
I don't know. Ask God.
My God, do you mean Miyamoto? Is that who you're talking about there?
Oh, that God, the God of the world who made the Pikmin.
Yeah, fair enough. It's just something that I thought about. Like, why don't more of these have, like, elemental powers or whatever?
But hey-ho, anyway, I can save that again for a future podcast. I keep dropping in Pikmin 4 takes that no one asked for. Exhibit N.
Again, I've not written down your name here. Oh, wait, I have, actually, yeah. This is quite an interesting one, Matthew, because this is a partner whose husband then entered the Discord after they provided this entry.
So, hey, guys, I found your podcast through my husband who had it on in the car. I'd really missed Judge Matthew's takes since Weekspot was ended, so I started from the beginning. Anyway, my entry is Detective Pikachu for 3DS for £22.
I bought it after the second was announced because I forgot it existed. Please put my husband to death instead, though. He still has games in Shrinkwrap because he can't stop playing Destiny 2.
That's from lspandherbeans. Now, I don't know. I think that's right.
I'm sorry if I've ever said that wrong. So, the husband then later dropped in and said, In my defense, the games have been in Shrinkwrap since before my Destiny 2 obsession, and I at least played Deathloop, Elden Ring and God of War 2, Dagnarok while in the throes of Destiny. So, Detective Pikachu Matthew, 22 quid.
So, not a very good sort of like adventure with some Pokemon narrative elements in it. I've played it. It's one of my 3DS Keros.
It's very lukewarm, I would say, as a game. It's not challenging. It's not particularly interesting.
It does look nice. It's one of the nicer looking 3DS games. It's well presented and everything.
Did inspire a three-star film. I would begrudgingly give it three stars with Justice.
That's a fucking Mewtwo voiced by Bill Nye in it. Come on. And that's three stars?
Jesus.
I've seen it twice. I think I've got a bit of Stockholm Syndrome in it.
I'm sending you to film takes court.
Fucking hell. I'll never leave that place. Me and the rest of the Discord people, Matthew.
And me. We're all dead. We're all guilty there.
Yeah. So what do you think?
I'm not going to kill your husband. He's not on trial here. You know, he's fundamentally playing something.
I can't. I can't sort of have too much beef with that. Detective Pikachu.
See, I really didn't like the film. And so I'm going to blame the game for the existence of the film. And yes, I know it's a no for me, dog.
You came to this courtroom hoping to kill off your husband, but it is you instead who's taken out back by a load of red Pikmin. I'm sorry.
Matthew could write dialogue for General Hospital. That was some dramatic shit. Good stuff.
Okay. So guilty. All right.
Excellent. Just typing that in because I have to keep a tally. Glad we're finally picking up a few more of the guilty verdicts here.
Yes, I am a terrible lawyer. Exhibit O. Tony Hawks.
What extra time that that guy's now got to play Destiny.
Exhibit O. Tony Hawks. That's a dark thought, actually.
But there is no time, remember?
Tony Hawks' Downhill Jam, DS, £4.19. Puzzle Bobble Universe, 3DS, £5.9. Both free shipping, thanks for that.
Trust me, that ain't gonna swing this.
Was buying some Pixies DVDs from Music Magpie and got these from their 3DS slash DS section. Tony Hawks is probably the most speculative purchase, seeing as I couldn't get on with the remake of the first game, but I thought the smaller scale might make it more approachable. I only know Puzzle Bobble from Speedruns or Game Stunt Quick, but I thought I'd have a go and want to get my first physical 3DS game.
That's weird. That's a weird first 3DS game to get, I'll be honest with you. I've gotten further with this than Tony Hawks, but probably only played half an hour total.
Other than that, I haven't really used my 3DS since the eShop closed, which maybe justifies the semi-pulping I got last time. Then I remember there was mistaken identity, so I deny any knowledge of previously being on Games Court. In mitigation, I'd like to submit holding off from buying Advance Wars Dual Strike when it was £28 at CEX, which is now £12.
Sorry, which is now £28, £20. That's from No Genius John. So, two not very exciting DS and 3DS games.
Yeah, and Downhill Jam is like... Downhill Jam's rank.
Yeah, I think that's got to be a guilty right.
Yeah, absolutely. The good thing is though, because, as I mentioned, already pulped, rather than the Pikmin having to carry him out, they can just drink him like they drink the Jew and power up. So I'm going to send 50 Pikmin, they're all going to have a little slurp and grow a lovely flower on their head from your bloody remains.
Wow, grim stuff. I thought you were going to say that they would all get on skateboards and go downhill and collide into the man or something like that.
No, that would be more charming, but I'm trying to follow the very strict logic of the Pikmin universe.
Fair enough.
I respect the license too much.
This would have to make sense on the Wikia page for Pikmin basically.
Yeah. Okay. Pikmin drank a pulped listener who returned in his liquefied form.
We come to my other favourite entry here, Matthew, which is genuinely a really interesting one, I think. So I'm sorry I don't have much beyond midweek energy to give you in talking about this. Exhibit P.
Oh gosh, I didn't write down your name either. I'm a terrible person. Not technically games, but games adjacent.
Last year I spent about six months scouring eBay for copies of Sonic the Comic, the 1990s UK-only comic based on Sonic the Hedgehog and other Sega games, and this year I acquired a complete collection of all 184 original issues and specials. I just finished adding up everything I spent on them, and the total came to £597.70. Highlights among the collection were £36.50 for the Eternal Champions special, a one-shot spin-off issue based on a game I've never played, and £39.10 for Sonic the Poster Mag 3, a six-page spin-off comic slash poster hybrid notable for one very regrettable character design.
In my defense, they're surprisingly good comics containing art and writing by lots of 2000 AD regulars, and they're from the era when Sonic games were at their best. So Matthew, I will find the name of this person in the Discord very shortly, but Sonic the Comic was actually good, and it's definitely like, I think for a lot of people, it was their first taste of a video game magazine. It certainly was for me, because it used to have the charts in it for like, here's the Game Gear games that are selling, here are the Mega Drive and Saturn games that are selling, and I do remember like reading different storylines in this.
The artwork was good, the stories were all completely original. It was a lot better than the Archie Comics Sonic, which felt a lot more like anodyne sort of tie-ins. These are a lot stranger.
I think writers like Mark Miller, who writes diabolically bad comics now, in my opinion, also got their start with Sonic the Comic. So I think it is significant, and it is quite a unique case, but £597.70 is a lot of money. Thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, it's unfortunate that this taps into, like, Sonic culture, which is the thing I don't like. Like, if you just got stripped all that away and just kept the core few original Sonic games that are actually good, and a couple of 3D ones which are passable, like, I don't actually have that much beef with Sonic. You know, as an actual game, like, the music, the look of the thing, the vibes, no worries.
It's the second you leave that world, and it becomes about the character. That's the thing I have a problem with. Like, I can't stand Sonic, I can't stand his universe, I can't stand his friends.
So the idea of something which is purely that, it's a very hard sell for me. Though, you know, I hear what you're saying, and I know that this is, like, an important cultural artifact for lots of people. And if this court was based purely on personal taste, it's obviously death by Pikmin.
Right.
But, I don't know. I feel like there'll be uproar for just dismissing this whole, like, subculture just like that, even though I do dismiss it just like that.
Well, of all the different bits of Sonic subculture, this is kind of among the better stuff. Like, it's actual comic books that people made. There are some oddities in there based on Mega Drive games, as kind of mentioned there, like, and a lot of, like, actual good comics in there.
I will say just it was so exciting to me as a kid in the mid-90s reading this. Like, it was just Sonic was not embarrassing at the time. There were just good games and also the Game Gear games, some of which were good, but most of which were bad.
But, yeah. I think I was already a little bit too old for it.
Yeah, you probably were, because you would have been about 12 or something like that, and I was, like, seven, so it was aimed at me basically, you know.
Yeah, I've just never been a comics guy, as in, like, a child comics guy, like a Beano or anything like that. Uh...
You really? No Beano exposure at all? Not a Backstreet Kids guy?
Maybe it's a bit working class for you. You're probably already reading...
That's not true. Collectible Thunderbirds cards?
You were already reading Encyclopedia Britannica at that point, weren't you, Matthew?
Yes. I was playing Kessin to refine my mind.
As evidenced in this episode. Is this the work of a man who has not played Kessin?
I'm going to let it go. Let it go down 200. I know you like it, and I know that this will make me seem a little bit more legit in Jay Bayliss' eyes, and that means a lot to me.
No, he would definitely downgrade you for this, I think, but that's okay.
I thought he hated Sonic. I thought you loved Sonic the comic.
Oh, I don't know if we ever talked. He would have been too young for it, I think. I think Jay has just turned 30, so he would have been like two when this was out, basically.
Oh, I thought he was into it. Interesting Sonic subculture.
No, he is, but he's sort of like from a kind of like, you know, a sort of I appreciate this, but also judge it and myself at the same time kind of deal, like his Bionicle love. We've got like a big thing going on where like, you know how there's like a Shin Godzilla and Shin came in Rider films from Anno, the Evangelion guy. We've joked that Jay is going to direct Shin Bionicle.
That's like an ongoing joke. We've got basically like the reflective kind of like movie version of some very cursed old Lego toys.
Maybe I've invested too much in trying to impress this person.
Definitely. I think even he would agree with that.
I really need to step out from that. But anyway, it's done. I'm going to let it go.
Baileys or not, Sonic the comic. I mean, just just keep it to yourself. That's all I ask.
Like you can have it. Just don't tell anyone about it. Like, you know.
Yeah, OK, fair enough. All right. So well, that's probably some of my best lawyering there, Dan200, which I certainly didn't give the other exhibits.
So I hope you enjoyed that. Nice short one here. Matthew from COIG Exhibit Q.
The Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man Edge of Time for £2.50 each on £3.60. Thoughts?
Ah, I kind of like this pick.
They're very much the middling Activision Spider-Man games.
Oh, they are. But there's also the slight... They're not backwards compatible, are they?
No, they're not.
Bit of a pain to play. Yeah, but there's... I don't know.
There's something about the five or six out of ten superhero tie-in, which has a certain charm to it.
I don't know.
I don't know. What are the two games again?
Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man Edge of Time. Now, for the listener's benefit, I will say that the one you might be thinking, wasn't there a good one in the mix that is now quite rare? The one you're thinking of, Shattered Dimensions, which was a precursor to Edge of Time, and was a little bit better, but I still think one of those sevens are a bit overrated.
That is what I'm thinking of. So you have successfully turned this from a not guilty into a guilty. I congratulate you, the worst lawyer on Castle Island.
I'm the only lawyer, so yeah. Okay, sorry about that, Coig. I think Edge of Time is the one that's got Val Kilmer in it, actually, which is quite unusual.
They use it with the marketing materials and stuff. I can't remember who he plays, but Amazing Spider-Man was sort of like a rudimentary tie-in to the Andrew Garfield film, and the second one was received quite poorly. I think this one got like sixes and sevens, but yeah.
Shadow Dimensions remains the interesting one, you know. Plus, we're washing Spider-Man games now. Anyway, there's going to be like three good ones by the end of this year, so yeah.
A classic bit of lawyering there from you. I absolutely love it.
Thanks, Val. We've got a really long one here. Good god.
How many more have we got left?
There are three left. I've been counting this badly as I've gotten, sorry. It just keeps stretching on.
We're almost there. Okay. Exhibit R.
Okay, no offence, but I'm going to just read out the games here. Sorry.
I'm so hot. I'm so hot. Like, I am just going to start killing people because I'm hot.
Okay. We've got Psy Upster Mindgate Conspiracy on Xbox for £1.50. I recently began collecting OG Xbox games as one of my favourite areas of gaming.
The catalogue has largely escaped typical retro game prices of today while offering arguably the best versions of most multi-platform games from the generation. This is a classic. Saw it on a hidden gems video and decided I had to have it.
Tony Hawk's Underground 2 on Xbox for £4. Super Monkey Ball Deluxe for £6. FF12 on PS2 for £4.
This is Sam's fault. I would have got the PS4 version myself, but hey.
FF2?
12.
12?
Yeah, on PS2. GTA Chinatown Wars on DS for £15. Also Sam's fault, I think, but I'm sure Matthew also likes this and put it up on the pod.
Resident Evil 4 Limited Edition on PS2 for £18. I've also started to collect Resi games, and this is one that's obviously better on GameCube, but a version that's nice to display. I assume simply buying games to display isn't going to go down well, though.
Okay, so the framework here is they're on holiday buying a load of games, basically, and has had a 21-month daughter in tow, and a parent and grandparents with them. Like, a lot going on. So these next ones are quite interesting, Matthew.
Resi will outbreak on PS2 for £10. Outbreak File 2 for £20. Resi will dead aim on PS2 for £15.
That's a light-guy game, I believe. I know these games aren't well thought of, but I do intend to play them, especially dead aim. R-type Final on PS2 for £10.
Silent Hill 4 The Room on Xbox for £20. This one had only just come in, apparently, as it was on a little shelf of mixed stuff next to Q and upset the girl who served me as she wanted a nabbit for herself. I hope your judgements are fair, but I'm happy that Michael Caine will have a pretty good Resi collection once I drown.
That was a different podcast, I'm afraid. You'll be carried off by Pikmin. Sorry about that.
I should say, after every gunshot we heard from outside, we also heard a very faint... He's sitting outside. He has to witness all these terrible things.
That's the thing. Today he was like, I'm not going in the cool house. I'm going to sit outside where it's safe.
And paid a terrible price for it.
Oh dear. Things that should never meet in any context is Pikmin and Michael Caine. I'm actually trying to explain the concept of Pikmin to Michael Caine.
What the bleeding hell are you?
Oh, they're hell. These bloody little fellas. They're bloody everywhere.
Okay, good. We've got the bad Michael Caine impressions out of the way. Okay, so a bit of a mix there, but nothing seems too egregious.
I did question buying Sun Hill for the room on Xbox, because that is not backwards compatible. So I don't... I thought that's just going to be like, you've either got a modded Xbox or it's just going into the Abyss.
So I'm not so sure about that.
I thought you said lots of stuff he bought was just for the Xbox.
Yeah, it was. That's true, actually. That is true for most of the...
So it sounds like they have an Xbox. I'm assuming this person has an Xbox so they can play these things on.
Yeah, yeah. Let's go with that. So the one I question there might be Matthew's Resident Evil 4 Limited Edition on PS2.
I had this edition. It's like a metal steel case thing. It's alright, but PS2 Resident Evil 4 is a little bit underpowered really is the thing to understand.
Yeah, so that's not good. It is possible to have an underpowered version of such a good game. It doesn't just get an automatic pass.
PsyOps is interesting. PsyOps aka interesting second site. We like to think of it.
Is PsyOps the one that wasn't done by Free Radical?
PsyOps was the fun midway one as opposed to the Free Radical one. Where Free Radical did the Free Radical thing. It was very much the Armageddon deep impact of that year though.
Such a good analogy and so appropriate.
Or the Anxel Bugs Life. Take your pick.
Excellent.
Yes, I'm not hugely familiar with the Outbreak games. But I remember them being like only okay.
I think they're interesting but they were meant to be experienced online. So I don't see any way that an offline version is really going to cut it.
Yeah, there are things I just remember reading about in magazines and going, well, that's something I'll never experience. Because it was at that time where the idea of online gaming or having access to constant internet on a console in my bedroom was just like, well, that is never going to be the case. You've got parents kind of policing what you do on the internet every second counts.
Yeah, there is the hole. I intend to play these games as well, which is a little bit underpowered. Buying the Outbreak games, buying the light gun Resident Evil.
I'm going to send the Pikmin in.
Which ones?
Well, let's make sure the full range of Pikmin 4 is represented. Let's actually send Ochie to do it.
Oh, that cursed little fellow. Ochie? Yeah, I call him Ochie.
Ochie will drag you out by your collar. And there's a red Pikmin holding a handgun, holding on to Ochie. So he's going along for the ride too.
Amazing. Ochie.
But I will keep that copy of PsyOps. Thank you.
Fair enough. And I'll take the copy of Dead Aim. I might give that a go at some point when I enter my hobbyist lightgun dad phase of my life, which is no doubt coming.
OK, we have two more left. Exhibit S. Hello, I don't know if this counts as Games Court or Reverse Games Court as this is a story beyond capitalism, a tale of bartering.
I discovered a local game store and handed in a bundle of video game stuff. I'm left with a different bundle of video game stuff. This is what makes this exciting, Matthew.
There's like the things that go in and the things that come out.
Oh, interesting. It's like alchemy.
Yeah. I gave in one black PS2 Fat, one silver PS2 Fat, two 8MB PS2 memory cards, one Hyrule Historia, a big Zelda book, a present I already had a copy of, a Pikachu hat, it was horrible, a small figure of the Just Cause 3 protagonist, two Pokémon branded Game Boy colour cases, tatty and cheap, a trio of N64 games, very cursed, Matthew, ISS64, 1998, a great game, but why would you play it now? Loose, Extreme G, Loose, F1 World Grand Prix, Loose.
Extreme G is probably the one of those, it's the most interesting. And in return, I got a PS2 Slim, I've used it a bit with my other memory cards, an Xbox 360 Elite, I had got a load of 360 games where I got an Xbox One and some were not back, Pat supported, played two of those so far on the console, GameCube games, cell damage.
That thing's like 99p everywhere. God damn it, that's bad, right?
It's meh, but playable. Zootopia. I had fun with this, but I'm sure I will go back to it.
To add to my defence, both the PS2s had different issues reading discs. The N64 is too old for me to fully appreciate. I started gaming in the GameCube generation, the N64 generation is aged terribly for my youthful eyes, and I never cared for the tat I got rid of.
I also never had a 360, so going back to explore the library is fun. To aid my prosecution, I didn't think the store was very generous, but I did want rid of the junk, and I traded in the hardware with no cables, but got cables back. I could wax poetic about these lists and why I had them, but I thought it best to be brief.
I hope I live AG. So I will say of those, Matthew, I think the 360 Elite jumps out as the thing that's like, that's kind of worth buying, because that is from the times when I believe they sorted out the Red Ring issue, so that won't plague you. It should work for long term.
It's got the hard drive built in, I think, and it's quite nicely presented. If you're going to buy a 360, this probably is the one to own. But what do you make of this?
Yeah, like, a load of shit goes in. Quite a lot of shit comes out. I mean, that's, cell damage is bad.
What's the other one?
Do you say Zoo Cube?
Zootopia?
I think you mean Zoo Cube. Zootopia was the Disney film, right?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Zoo Cube was a GameCube puzzler, but not stellar at all. I mean, the games are terrible. But I think of all the things there, the 360 Elite is the best thing.
So fundamentally, you have ended up with one better thing. And you got all this shit out of your life. I don't think there was anything good that went in.
No, no, I think you're right.
Basically, a load of broken stuff that you managed to scan them into giving you an Xbox for.
Yeah. Okay.
It's, I mean, in the smallest way possible, a net gain. So I'm okay with this.
All right. So not guilty. All right.
Good. I thought it was going to go a different way. So well done there.
If you'd have traded in an N64 as well, I'd have said you got into like net loss territory, but you just have the games. So you're okay. Right then.
And the games were a lot of those are quite bad.
Yeah. Speaking of bad, Matthew, we got some more in our final entry here. So we have exhibit T, Owen E567.
I've slowly been rebuilding my PS2 collection over the last two years. Some of my recent purchases are pictured. Now in the picture, there are two Avatar games on PS2, as in Avatar, the Nickelodeon series that people quite like.
Sonic Unleashed on PS2, Matthew. And Disney Extreme Skate Adventure. The two Avatar games were £3 each.
Sonic Unleashed was £6, and so was Disney Skate Adventure. So I wanted to end us on a high note. So how would you like to execute this one, Matthew?
Any thoughts on this one?
No, I don't think so. But not much has been spent. That's only a total of like £18.
But Disney Extreme Skate Adventure, that one I was not familiar with, actually. That sounds like the most interesting, but I don't know. It's like basically a 2003 Toys for Bob game that was Tony Hawk, but with like Goofy in it, essentially.
Those are the vibes. Yeah, actually, it's Goofy in it. It might be more like Toy Story kind of characters.
Yeah, I've just looked up a box art and it's got like Kid, Tarzan and Simba on skateboards.
Cursed. But reviewed quite well. Had like 78 on Metacritic on PS2.
I do miss the era where like you could make a skateboarding game out of anything.
Yeah, this is the most Activision game ever, isn't it? Activision of that era is like exactly what they made was this basically.
Were the Avatar games good? Probably not.
No, if they were good, people would talk about them now.
I feel like I'm pretty aware of what the hidden gems are in the license scene, and I've not heard those mentioned. What was the third thing? Sonic Unleashed on PS2.
Sonic Unleashed at the best of times, which is the 360 version. Half that game is dogshit anyway, and then the half of it, which is a Sonic game. That's when they started getting very shiny, and they at least they looked cool, even though they played miserably.
The idea of like settling for a version which didn't even have that, you know, we had like this must have been a port of the bad Wii version. Definitely, yeah. Most successful selling issue of O&M.
Sonic Unleashed, everyone loved it.
The Avatar games, I'll add to that by the way, they have like 50s on Metacritic each one, so definitely not.
Yeah, that's bad. And you know that those will be overinflated by some idiot reviewers. So let's assume they're 30s.
Someone should make a good game out of that universe though. There is the potential for that, absolutely.
I don't know. I think I'm just too old to watch it. I've tried watching that and I'm just like, this feels like this should be on it like, CITV at 4 o'clock.
You're like, this is Dodo Ruto, then you turn it off.
Ruto's cool. Yeah, anyway, Avatar's not on trial here. You know, that's for a very niche XXL episode.
Yeah, that no one will listen to and will result in a net loss of subscribers to the Patreon.
Yeah, I'm intrigued about this project of like, is he trying to buy all PS2 games? It's weird that these are the ones which get surfaced in this episode because if you're trying to buy all PS2 games, you're going to buy...
No, no, rebuild his old collection.
Oh, right, so you're trying to build all the bad games you played when you were a kid. Where actually now is the time to be building the collection you should have had as a kid. That's true.
Yeah, I mean, no offence, but I think that sounds like a bad exercise. Like, something should be left in the past and something should be left out the back of this courtroom. And that is you.
Okay, sorry about that, Owen, but thank you for writing in.
We're going to bend the air again with the flying Pikmin.
Bend the air, very good. Excellent.
Not really, that was desperate.
It was forced, but we do what we can on a weeknight Games Court episode that we've both been backed into. So, that completes the exhibits. Right, got to total them up now, so talk among yourselves briefly while I do this.
I'll do the Ace Attorney sound effects.
Hamanamanamanah, hamanamanamanah, hamanamanamanah.
I couldn't concentrate while you were doing that. Hamanamanamanah, hamanamanamanah. I think it's majority guilty, so I think I get put to death as well, Matthew.
Yeah, I mean, I deserve it after all my terrible lawyering. So, what happens to me, Matthew?
You also get taken out by the Pikmin, followed by a single Pikmin with a handgun.
Wow, okay, which ones do I get? Do I get the Heavy Lad? Heavy Lad's going to jump on me.
Out of respect for the good job you have done, I'll let you choose your poison. Which Pikmin is the last thing you'd like to see on this Earth?
Err, let's think.
Or Ochi, or one of Olimar's friends. Would you like to see Louis? Do you want to stare into Louis' eyes as the last thing you see?
No, fuck Louis. I will only look Louis in the eye if we're both going to die, like a gun to each other's heads. Just like us in the escape room with the Nerf guns.
You obviously haven't got to the true ending of Pikmin 4.
Yeah, the departed ending of Pikmin 4. Yeah, I definitely don't want to see Ochie the last thing. I don't want to look at...
I want to look into the eyes of my enemy and feel like I'm dealing with my equal. So I think the little black rock Pikmin are probably the most... I just always believed in them as fighters.
They would come through, they were hard to kill. Yeah, they were elite. So the little black Pikmin, Matthew.
Okay, it's done. And you are dragged out the courtroom again while the sailors from the Jurassic Coast sing a sad song of a lawyer who came close but failed.
Excellent. Well, I look forward to being resurrected in a pool of Rio for the next time we do this. So thank you so much for listening to Games Court.
The Games Court bus splutters to its final destination.
Oh my god.
We could all get off.
I'm going to let the Pikmin take me out back.
Okay, Matthew is sweaty and needs a cold shower. So that makes it sound like you're aroused. I apologise for that.
It wasn't the intention. I always feel sexy after Games Court. Okay, Matthew, we are done.
Where can you be found on social media?
