Ready for a shitty mailbag? All right, I've hit record.
Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how are you doing in these pre Gamescom times? Are you excited about going to Germany? Are you excited about having a tiny beer and some beige meats?
Yeah, tiny beers, yes. Beige meats, yes. Though, you know, I'm a bit too fussy to enjoy pork knuckle.
Just the name of it is like, I wish they'd call it something else, because it just sounds gross. And it looks kind of gross as well. It looks like a piece of meat that you might find in a house cellar in Resident Evil 4 Village.
Where Leon might walk past it and go, what the hell is that? Except here, it's loads of game shows going, mmm, mmm. So, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, obviously when this podcast goes out, Gamescom will have been in full swing or have largely happened. And my verdict is, based on what I know I'm seeing, is people are going to be thoroughly underwhelmed.
Wow, okay.
So let's see, maybe there'll be loads of secret stuff which only gets revealed at the show that I'll be desperately trying to get the team in to see. But currently, it's a no from me, dog.
Well, obviously my game will be exceptional, Matthew.
Your game aside.
Oh, I appreciate that. So yeah, it's a weird one for us. Because we are at Gamescom, we're recording this on the previous Saturday and we're editing it on the Sunday.
So it's just basically in the post for the Friday while we're away. And so brisket mailbag might be good for us. I do remember the first time I had pork knuckle, Matthew, because people had talked up pork knuckle to me.
They were like, oh yeah, it's like infinite food basically. They just bring you this giant lump of meat and I was so excited by it. And then why pictured versus the reality, which was like a little side of sauerkraut, which is barely vegetables, let's face it.
Like that's like, you know, it's almost the same color as the meat that you're eating. And then the pork knuckle was, seemed to be like 75% fat and then in there somewhere was some pork.
See that's, I'm quite fussy about my very fatty meats, which is why you might understand I'm not into pork knuckle that much.
That's fair enough. You're much of a sirloin steak guy. It's got the little eye bit with the fatty bit.
Fry that good and proper, it tastes real good, I think. But you know, that's, it's not for everyone, I admit.
So I like processed meat meats.
I like chicken nuggets and other such things.
I like meat that's been very carefully shaped to hide that it was once a living creature.
Ideally in the shape of a dinosaur or similar.
Or definitely, yeah, or like the cartoon character of the day.
Absolutely. So yes, excited about that. I'm excited about the tiny, tiny beers.
I do remember a bizarre situation last year where I think that like the Irish pubs stopped accepting cash after a certain point. Or they stopped setting cards after a certain point and only accepted cash. And then I had this weird situation where I couldn't like get out of the bar and I couldn't pay for anything in the bar and I was trapped in there with no drinks.
I can't remember exactly how this happened. It was just really bizarre. There was just some reason I couldn't leave.
Maybe it was, maybe I, oh, that was it. I think I'd bought a beer for someone else while the rules in Germany had changed of like you can no longer have beers outside after a certain time. So while I was at the bar buying like four pints, it basically, I could no longer take it outside.
And so I had to either abandon my four pints at the bar, go outside, get people, bring them back to get their beers, which they couldn't drink outside anyway. I just might have been trapped in there for about 45 minutes, it's a very strange situation. But yeah, anyway, I'm excited for an omnibus edition of that experience this week.
And to go back to the puppet bar as well. I always thought these places actually, which are like, I should say to people listening, in Cologne, there's like one sort of block of the city center where a lot of the hotels are and the restaurants are and British press in particular, and media people and sort of industry people all end up going to like these two pubs, like an Irish bar that's not particularly Irish really. And then like a bar that's got all these like old antiquated puppets, basically like, kind of like a novelty sort of bar, I would say.
And those are the places that people go. And it's quite funny how underwhelming they are, I would say. They feel like kind of touristy spots.
And the first time I went, I was like, oh, this is the place people have been talking about.
Well, it's so naff, given that city is famous for its beer halls and traditional drinking places. And we all congregate in the shittiest bit of it, really adhering to stereotypes of what British louts are like.
Yeah. And we try to be self-aware about it, but there is nonetheless that feeling of, there is a whole city out there.
It's the same thing that draws everyone to the Saddle Ranch in LA 3-3. It's just like, oh, it's the piece of shit that we always go to. Why do we do this?
Every now and then, though, I have the appetite for the Saddle Ranch because it's so different to anywhere you would go in the UK. But then, I think, like I said last time, when I saw a woman in tiny shorts on the bucking Bronco and an elderly couple having a big dinner, sat next to it watching, I was like, this is a fundamentally cursed place. We need to burn this down and start again, basically.
So, yeah, good times.
I'm just always in such a foul mood after a day of doing the show floor and doing all the appointments and the stress of it. That actually I just want to go and be by myself in the hotel room. Like, knee or no knee, I would probably still rather be in the hotel room.
Yeah, do you know the other weird thing? Do you ever get this when you're a journalist, right? You always hear about parties you're never invited to.
And this would happen at E3 a lot. I'd hear about like a Fortnite party and stuff like that. Or you'd hear about a Sony party at Gamescom.
And I was never invited to those. And I always thought, okay, I'm editor-in-chief of PC Gamer. Like as press go, that's actually like, that's what we call tier one, Matthew.
That's like, you know, upper end press. And I never got an invite. And I thought, what are these shows for except to get press to write about your game and you don't invite them to your party?
What's up with that?
It's not that though, you throw a party for your other mates in the industry and maybe influencers, like the bit the press need to go to is the boring bit in the game center where you show your games. Like that's the, oh, snore. That's what we're actually here to do.
And then that's just an excuse to hang out with all the other PR and marketing people who you actually like.
Well, I invited lots of press to our party this year, Matthew.
Did you invite me?
It's just people from PlayStation Access on the list. There's three of them. Are you not one of them?
No.
Well, I'll send you an invite. So by the time people listen to this, hopefully you've been to our party.
And I'll be doing an in-depth review breakdown on the next episode.
I've been Twitter stalking people actually for like knowing they're at Gamescom and being like, okay, add them to the party list. And just getting our PR agency to email out invites.
Is it going to be a banger, your party?
I think so. It's on our booth. It's a really big booth themed around the game.
It's pretty cool.
It's like during the day or?
Again, by the time people are listening to this, it's all happened, Matthew.
Yeah.
No, it's after the show. Yes, after hours.
After hours, but within the convention center.
Yeah, exactly. And it's before, I think it's before people come in. It's on the Wednesday night.
So it's like before the booth has been like ransacked by the public.
What music do you have booked?
Shaggy. He's going to be doing all of his hits. No, I don't know.
Baby man.
No, we have no musical act. But I have a little air of, do you know that Simpsons episode where Martin Prince gets the swimming pool and he like invites everyone round. He becomes the popular kid suddenly.
It's the same episode where Bart injures his leg and they get this because they got the swimming pool. And I have like a tiny bit of Martin Prince energy when I'm like getting all of these journalists to come to my party. You know what I mean?
I feel like I hope it doesn't seem like I'm currying favor because on the night I might just go and hide in a corner with a vodka coke. You know what I mean?
Well, that's ironic because when I'm at Gamescom, I famously have Bart's broken leg energy.
Well, that's the thing. If you do come to our party, I will have to insist that you arrive with a shattered knee. That's like my only parameter, so yes.
That's the entertainment Shaggy and Matthew Castle's open knee wound. That isn't a band name. That's literally he's going to have a knee wound.
Yeah, they're playing at Moles and Bath this Saturday. I'm excited about that.
We're supporting health on their next tour.
Yeah, and then you just slag them off before their next set. I don't know what you've heard about health.
They go, are you ready to hear a drum for an hour?
I'm like, well, you're in luck because that is literally who you're getting.
There's so many in-jokes. You've wrapped up into one 10-minute opening there. I think that's good energy, I think, for a cursed Mailbag episode.
We know what kind of questions are coming, so we're trying to have some fun now.
No, there's some good ones this week. There's a couple of bad ones and we won't say what they are because we don't want the listeners to feel bad.
Let's see if you can guess from our reaction.
I somehow think Matthew is not going to disguise his contempt time around. So yeah, there's that. I did actually have a tiny bit of pod admin to go through first, Matthew.
So I just wanted to say for people who listened to the best games of 2016 last week, I think people did enjoy that episode, but you've probably noticed a curve of downness kicking in with us talking about our latter days in print. We are aware that that makes a slightly depressing listening. I think it's an inevitable result of the modern world becoming really, really bad and that becoming incredibly obvious around 2016, but it curdling a bit before that.
Also coinciding with whatever was happening with us. So we decided that for the next best games of X year episode, we're going to go back to 2001 and talk about that. So you'll get more in the way of me doing my paper round anecdotes, as opposed to what I was doing with a copy of PC Gamer.
I've got some hot home-based content.
So we're going to do that because we think it'll be a bit different. The games are completely different, obviously. So we'll probably do that in a couple of months or something, but I just want the listeners to know that.
So 2017, we'll probably say for next year at some point, but yeah, so we're going to do 2001 next. But that's a way off. This week's episode is, like I say, a cursed mailbag.
Our listeners have very kindly sent us in questions. We have loads of questions backed up, actually. Matthew, in a general sense, I have some gratitude about how much interaction we get because think about when we ran magazines, right?
How fucking hard it was to get people to send letters in and how naff those pages would end up being because you didn't get that level of interaction here. We have more questions than we can fit in like a monthly mailbag episode, I'd say, which is a nice position to be in that people give a shit about what we've got to say. How do you feel about that?
Yeah, this sounds like you're course correcting because I've been too down on mailbag.
Well, no, I mean, I'm the one who called it a cursed mailbag. Did I start the episode recording by saying, let's get this piece of shit mailbag done?
Yes.
No, I think people always enjoy these because we sort of freewheel a little bit, but I don't know, I'm grateful for the interaction. I noticed you didn't really answer my question there.
Oh, yes, I mean, of course, you know, awesome that people feel this invested. Some of these questions I took like out in vain. Do you really want to know this?
Or do you just want to have a little bit of interaction? That's okay. If it's the latter, that's fine.
Yeah.
They can just say hi to us on the Discord.
Yeah, some of them you just straight up answered in the Discord. So someone said, why are you greener on from NGamer? And you were like, because he works for some company or something like that.
And it was, I was like, okay, good, he took care of that one. So we'd have to read it out on the episode. There was one bit of Discord business I wanted to cover actually, Matthew, before we get into this episode.
So one thing that's kind of notable, I suppose not, because obviously we have something like 5,000 weekly listeners, 6,000 weekly listeners. So not everyone is in the Discord. There's about 800 people in the Discord.
But there is a Twitter account called Back Page Pod Quotes that's existed for a few months. And it's been a kind of like a sort of ongoing feud between me running the main Twitter account and that account, because the quotes they pick, I would say, were not particularly memorable. They were quite strange.
They were a bit like sort of like, oh, I bought episode one racer for my mom once, episode something or other. Where you're like, okay, I mean, that is a notable thing that Matthew said, but it's not hysterically funny. You know what I mean?
It's no...
You don't think people are gonna say, that isn't a useful marketing tool for us. People aren't gonna see that account and go, I gotta get me some of that.
Yeah, exactly. No one has you calling the people outside Yogg's cast fucking psychos, which I think is the funniest thing anyone said on this podcast recently. That would actually be great content for it.
It's like, sorry to disappoint you, you fucking psychos. That made me laugh so much, listen back to it. So I've just been saying, cause also the account's really languid, it wouldn't post for like two months.
And sometimes it would slightly misquote us. And it felt like it was a deliberate running joke that it was like doing a quotes account not very well. And then the listeners loved it because we were basically bashing our own fan account, which is functionally what it was.
So it was a great combo all round. Basically, there's been a sort of like who done it of who was actually running that account. And people sussed it in the Discord.
And it was quite fun. People trying to piece together from some very abstract clues who the person was. And they were eventually unmasked by our admin, Betamax Bandit, who figured out it was Angry Kurtz, who works for EA and used to work for Team17.
And it was quite fun. It was like a live role-playing experience where everyone was trying to figure this thing out. Even you must have been like quite impressed by the whole thing, Matthew.
Oh yeah, I mean, as a lover of detective fiction, it was thrilling. I mean, there was a moment where, was it in, it was the account itself posted some cryptic clues as to who it was?
Yeah, the account, they posted a screenshot of the game Black, a picture of the football player Eden Hazard and then-
And Donut County.
And the game Donut County. And the, yeah, yeah, go on.
Well, like I didn't give it much thought. I looked at it and thought, is there, is this a clue about someone's Discord username? So there was a lot of people going like, Black Hazard Donut and-
Trying to work out, you know, what the relation of those images to the Discord was. And it turned out to be much, much more bizarre in It Was The Account, AKA Kurt, attempting to trick us into thinking the account was run by Ashley Day, our friend. And fellow Team17 person.
I don't quite understand the specifics of what was going on with that, but I kind of like the audaciousness of it.
Yeah, I think it's because the clues was like, basically the clues were that they used to work for Team17 and Eden Hazard's shirt was like, that was a number 17.
Oh, right, that was it, yeah.
It ruled out Ash straight away because it was a football player. Ash would have no idea who the fuck Eden Hazard is, so I was never gonna assume it was Ash. Then it was, the other clues were, you know me, Kurt, I love black.
Famously, and also Donut County, and that was like, honestly, I had no idea, and I felt like the clues were like...
The Donut County thing was, because Ash's blog is Games From The Black Hole. And so it's a donut hole, black hole thing. The idea is like, you know, someone who's read a lot of crime fiction and dealt with a lot of fictional killers who've tried to frame other people.
If you're going to try and frame someone, you don't try and frame someone with incredibly cryptic clues. The whole idea of a framing is that it's kind of obvious who the person is. So the idea that he was trying to use these clues to set up Ash, but the idea that someone would look at Donut County and go, Donut Hole, Games from the Black Hole.
It's just... It was an endearingly bad attempt at framing.
It was. I think if I was to frame Ashley Day, I would just put a picture of like fucking Shining Force, of Valkyrie Chronicles. Worms.
Worms, yeah.
Or Ash, just a picture of Ash.
From On Games TM, circa 2007, looking like Bill Hader, that sort of thing. Yeah, so it was good fun. And also I felt bad about slamming the quotes account because Kurt's a really nice guy.
Kurt's the one who sent us copies of Jedi Survivor, Matthew. So very grateful for that. But yeah, the clues were like the most abstract things I've ever seen.
But I was very impressed by Beta Max Bandit uncovering who it was. It made sense actually when I read back the messages that Kurt put versus what the tweets sort of like added up. And then there was even a grand unmasking moment of the, you know, the perp in question.
It was good. It was really fun.
Before the grand unmasking, didn't you DM and accuse someone else?
Yeah, one of the listeners who sent us... Basically, there's a listener in the Discord who has been like... has previously been waging a campaign of saying Bayonetta 2 is better than Bayonetta 1.
And I've been like, absolutely not. They probably caught me on a bad day, but I'm still like... I'm not even engaging with that.
Even though I think, Matthew, you've kind of come around to that idea a little bit in recent years.
I don't think it's... It's not something I would roll my eyes at.
Right. Fair enough. So I did think that if I was going to be like...
trolled by an account that was doing a quotes account, not very well to my standard, then that person, doing it deliberately to drive me nuts, kind of added up in my head. And I just went, jacuz in the Discord. And they said that they read that message while they were in the toilet.
And I felt bad after that. Because I was incorrect.
The whole thing was like a very bad Poirot episode. A guy who was bad at framing, a bad detective who gets it wrong the first time around. Imagine that in a crime show.
It's this guy. No, it's not.
All right. So yeah, it was good fun. It was a significant moment in the history of the Discord.
It was like our very own ARG.
Very much so, yeah. It was really, really fun. So now we need someone to set up a worst back page pod takes account.
And then we can unmask that person as a kind of like sequel. Much like, you know, it could be our version of Death or Denial, Matthew. Or whatever the fuck Branagh is doing this year.
That one.
Spooky Venice crime adventure.
Absolutely. OK, good. Let's get to the questions at 20 minutes in, Matthew.
OK, do you want to read this first one?
Didn't we answer this on the last one?
Oh, is this the last one we answered, was it?
Maybe we asked it, but we didn't actually answer it because we just went off and had an anecdote about pizzas.
I don't remember answering it as such.
We'll throw it in anyway. It's a bit like when you get the next episode of a TV show and it starts with the last minute. That's more of an anime thing where you watch half of an episode of Naruto that you've watched and then you get to see a new bit of Naruto.
That's the vibe. Short one. What's the best pizza restaurant you've eaten at and what's the best pizza chain?
Following Samuel's brutal takedown of Bella Italia in the RPG channel on Discord. Hey, are you streaming? I was talking episode chat.
That's confusing. That's from Balladeer.
Yeah, probably the meanest thing I've done to a friend is say that their partners joke that their partner's favorite restaurant is Bella Italia to suggest they somehow lack taste in some way. That's probably the meanest thing. I've said to a good friend who will be listening to this and saying, yep, Samuel did say that and he is a piece of shit.
So I got to say, the most excited I've ever been about having pizza was having like a dollar slice in New York in 2007. I was with John Denton who listens to this and friend of the weekend, John Denton. And yeah, having a slice of New York pizza was pretty impressive.
But I got to say, I got to fall back on the old oven, Matthew, really, I just think that I've had so many good... That's really raised my expectation of pizza on the flavor front. But how about you?
Any more exciting answers?
Yeah, in Bath, I like the oven. I've still got a lot of affection for the Real Italian Pizza Company, which I know you're a little cool on, but I had a birthday dinner there once with NGamer many, many years ago, which was the first time I went. And the fact that the pizza was good, combined with just the camaraderie of being with the whole NGamer team, means it's cemented as a very fond memory.
Yeah, like, you know, I think I've eaten... I can't remember the name of this restaurant, but we went to this pizza place in New York where the table reservation system or like the waiting system in the restaurant was like a train departure board. They had like an antique train departure board from like an Italian train station.
And when you came in, you got given the name of a station. And when your station came up on the departure board, and then your table was ready and you'd go to it. That makes it sound kind of like, you know, gimmicky and sort of trashy, but it was actually quite sophisticated.
I remember that being good. Though my memory is so hazy, that might have also just been a pasta restaurant. A terrible anecdote.
I like the departure board detail.
Yeah, there's a bit of colour. But yeah, I love a good old pizza.
The truth is actually, the time I remember having pizza that was mind-blowing, the first time ever, was when I was on a holiday in Bordeaux with my family, and we got pizza from some takeout place there. I think it was the first time I'd ever had freshly made pizza that wasn't from Pizza Hut or wherever. And that seemed like the greatest thing ever at the time, just how warm the crust was.
I still kind of remember the exact texture of it. So no pizza can surpass that because I was very young. And I was very on a holiday.
And it was like a kind of mythical memory of a pizza. Very much so. I did have a moment there where I was describing that though, and I was going, this is a fucking video games podcast, right?
What are we doing? So let's move on to the next question, Matthew. Your favourite question, this.
Just a quick question. When the next Xbox and the PS6 are released, do you think they will still have a disc drive?
Nah, I don't know.
That's from IMGTR63.
I don't know, I don't know. Who has an opinion on these things? Um, like, isn't the rumour that there might be a PS5 Slim with a modular disc drive that you add to it?
Yeah, I don't see why that's appealing, personally. I just, all in one or nothing for me. I don't really get it, but, you know, I'm not sure.
Yeah, I guess it's a question about, like, if we ever make the, you know, who will be bold enough to make the jump to, like, fully discless?
Yeah.
And, you know, will we ever have the online infrastructure or the online policies that make digital only a bit more appealing, a bit like Xbox with their, you know, I swear once upon a time they talked about, could you sell on a digital game to a friend? Wasn't that sort of part of the Xbox One pitch that then everyone was so like, fuck this, that they were like, alright, we'll just do it like we've always done it?
Yeah, I think there was some discussion about that, yeah, but I don't know, I mean, that is different to a secondhand system because they would presumably control the pricing of that, wouldn't they? So, you know, it was to stop some kind of grey market popping up. So, yeah, I don't know, it didn't sound that appealing to me at the time, but I don't know.
Should we just, I have a quick answer to this one Matthew, then we could probably move on. So, I think the answer is yes, they will, because there are parts of the world where physical media is still very much the core of what they do. I think as well, it's probably more appealing to retail partners to say, you know, we're going to sell games as well as...
Oh, here's the proper answer. This is the proper answer you're hearing right now.
I was just worried about you having a 10-minute monologue about the question that turned into an existential crisis.
No, I just said my bit.
Fair enough. No, that's fine. So, yeah, I think the answer is they probably will.
You'll probably get what you get in this generation and get one with and one without. I don't want to go fully digital. I still like getting physical games.
That's not going to change. And I think Xbox is probably in a better position for this than Sony because most of... I think digital is a much bigger deal than Xbox.
They've made more of that transition, probably because of Game Pass and, you know, the likes of that. So, yes, there's the answer, Matthew.
Thank you for that, Piers Harding Tubby Rolls.
No worries. Do you want to read the next one?
Dear S&M, brackets not a horny podcast, I've just discovered that Tears of the Kingdom has 32 more shrines in it than I thought it had. I was all set to mark the game as completed, but now I'm obliged to play it for another 30 odd hours at least. Question, is Tears of the Kingdom too long?
Bonus question, what's the ideal length for a video game? Love from Jamie.
Probably a question for you Matthew, because you finished Tears of the Kingdom.
I haven't finished it.
Oh what? How much have you played?
150 hours.
Well that confirms it's too long. That's too fucking long that game. That's too fucking long.
That's too long! It should be done by now.
But I'm relishing in it. I'm just taking my time with it. We're getting one of these games every six years.
I think it's fucking perverse to complain about this game being as big as it is when it's the quality that it is, when we get them so irregular. Like, this has got to last us a long time. We want it to be done in ten hours.
You can start being like, where's the next one? Like, no. Absolutely.
It's obscene that someone would complain about how much good stuff there is in this game. That is preposterous.
Oh, dear.
Bad take. That Zelda is too long. This is the last one we're going to get until fucking 2029.
I'll be so old then. I'll be like 41. That makes me want to die thinking about that.
Just enjoy it. Just enjoy it. It doesn't have to be done.
It's not against the clock. I haven't finished it, but I also haven't played it for the last month.
Yeah.
I've just got it on pause. I'll go back to it. I'll dig into it.
I'm just taking my time. I'll have finished it by, you know, Tommy gets a game in the air, but no. Like, if a game is big, it's not bad, but it's not.
It's good. So fine. Good.
Well, look, Jamie, I appreciate the question. Thank you for writing in. So, related to this, Matthew, and the other part of the question, the bonus part of the question, and what's the ideal length for a video game, I think that probably part of it, which is The Kingdom, is it was the first of like a fucking cascading series of 100-hour games that have come out, and we are just awash in them this year, and, you know, it's ridiculous we had Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo and Baldur's Gate 3, and now we're going to have Starfield on top of that.
Like, that is a ridiculous amount of game. In a year, they've still got Assassin's Creed to come as well. That's just so much stuff.
So, I think actually in that context, it's almost like people probably are, if you own more than one console like me and Matthew do, you might be itching to move on to the next thing, and you're there thinking, when will Zelda end, or when can I feel like I can sign off from Zelda and move on to the next thing? So, I sort of see why you might have this. But yeah, I sort of agree with you, Matthew, really.
I think that with Breath of the Wild, I played it for 65 hours. I saw as much of it as I wanted to see. I didn't do every shrine, but I saw every bit of the open world, which is, you know, that was my personal objective, to just see that whole world.
And then I was done with it after that. But, you know, it is built so you can play as much or little of it as you want.
That's the thing. I don't think it holds you hostage at all. I don't think it leans into the, you know, some of the more cynical kind of completionist kind of tricks.
You know, there isn't a big tick list. There's not loads of icons you're trying to remove. You know, you can opt in that, you know, you don't have to explore all of the depths.
You know, the actual things you have to do down there is probably a couple of hours. Like, you can definitely get through to the end credits of this game, you know, in, like, 30 hours or whatever. Loads of reviewers did, you know.
I think it... Maybe this is the rare case of a game which I think does sustain its length. It's maybe the more level-headed take.
Like, I feel like I'm at 150 hours, I haven't finished it yet, but I don't feel like, oh, fuck this game, or I wish it would wrap up. I know how I could wrap it up, and I've just chosen not to, and that's fine.
Fair enough.
I don't mean to scoff, I don't mean to suggest that Jamie's an idiot or anything, that isn't what I'm going for. I don't know, the wait for this game, it just took so long, and the idea of, it's done, and now I refuse to go back into the waiting pattern, because I know it's going to be a long time, so I'm just taking my time.
Fair enough. I think as well that, I feel more in general in recent years, I feel slightly intimidated by the growing length of games. I think my ideal year of games, if we're doing a game of the year, has five great games that are six hours or less, or three games that are under 20 hours, and maybe two that are under 100 hours.
I think I'm going to pick my battles this year, and I'm probably going to skip Diablo for game of the year stuff, and just focus on Baldur's Gate 3, because that's become the significant game of the year, so I feel like I have to have a take on it for the end of the year. And FFXVI, I've already started some way into that one, so I will try and finish that one as well, but otherwise I will give up on the rest.
Yeah, Final Fantasy XVI was too long. There is a game which is 70 hours, but it's got maybe 30 hours of actual gameplay evolution and interest in it. That's the difference.
Tears is a very rare case.
Yeah, as well, if you want to compare, I think if you look at Jedi Survivor and how you can basically blast through that story in about 20 hours, but there's probably another 20 hours of stuff to do on top of that for you to go and find when you unlock the full power set later in the game. So it's structured nicely that you can engage with that stuff or not. It's very nicely laid out worlds where you see things that grab your interest, but you can't return until later.
And if you want to, and if you want to build your fucking Jedi garden at the top of that pub or whatever's going on in that game, you can do that. And that's good.
How's your Jedi garden coming along?
I think I just planted a load of like space camagers and fucked off basically. That's my only interaction with that garden. Yeah.
I did love that.
Whatever trophy pop or...
I did love that little bar space and like watching the PS5 wrestle, we're trying to load it in and out every time you walk into it because there's so many NPCs in there. Whereas FF16 obviously holds you hostage to complete all these boring side quests and you almost wish it had the Jedi Survivor thing of just saying these things are actually optional and you don't have to do them.
Yeah.
You can see the end credits then go and do it later, but instead it's gating all of this story content with those quests. That to me is black and white sort of like good design versus not particularly user friendly design, but hey-ho. Okay, next question, Matthew.
I'll read this one. Hi, Simon and Matthew. At the time of writing this, I'm currently watching the Mission Impossible series, for the first time in preparation for your podcast on it.
It got me thinking. Why don't you think there are more many spy secret agent based games? We had the likes of Alpha Protocol, The Bond Games and Hitman, I guess, at a push.
Why do you think it's been underserved? That's from Angry Kurtz, the culprit in question previously discussed. Or should I say Black Hazard Donut?
That's his secret agent name, ironically. Welcome, Mr. Black Hazard Donut.
The name is Donut, Black Hazard Donut. My take on this is, it's kind of like, I think a lot of popular spy fiction is tied to a particular set of licenses, Matthew. So James Bond is so overpowering as a depiction of like, you know, secret agent something, you know, fiction in general, that, you know, it actually does feel, it's filtered down to the way that the likes of Born and Mission Impossible have been made, for example, it's influenced those and it's, it looms so large that if you end up doing something like Alpha Protocol, you might make something looks and sounds like a knockoff if you're not doing the actual thing.
Right. And then the other side of spy fiction is like the Le Carre stuff, right, where it's like a bit more sort of like dudes meeting in like 70s coffee shops or wherever and code words and not much action really, which doesn't necessarily lend itself to a video game. So that was sort of my take.
I don't know if you could do like slow horses as a video game. Do you know what I mean? It's not that kind of vibe.
Plus visually, it's quite hard to create something mega distinctive looking as well. And the other part is I think that Call of Duty has a little bit of this too. You do get some spy type missions in Call of Duty or set pieces that feel a bit James Bond-y, particularly in the first three Modern Warfare games.
What's your take on this, Matthew?
Yeah, I think there maybe are like in respect to how many games get released, like there's probably as many spy games as you'd imagine there would be. You know, like that you have Hitman, which basically is this big spy game. You know, it is a games Bond game really, I think.
You know, it's not like there's loads of games being made full stop is part of it. I also just think a big part of the spy fantasy is stealth and like that's just never, never, never been a big thing. Like it's provably less successful than other genres.
You know, the optimal spy game probably is something like Alpha Protocol, which is a bit more like, you know, you have to have offer stealth, a social experience, a good action experience. Then you're almost veering into like immersive sim territory, which would, you know, bring out most publishers in a cold sweat. You know, maybe there just isn't a mainstream appetite for the kind of the full fantasy of the spy game, you know.
You know, your best bet is making an out and out action game and I don't think that would satisfy the sort of spy secret agent genre, would be my, like, attempt, I guess.
Yeah, I think I kind of agree with that. So, yeah.
The license things, yeah, I mean, that's right as well. There was a period where, like, all, you know, 360 had all kinds of, like, Bourne and James Bond tie-ins and Alpha Protocol. You know, it felt like we were, you know, giving spies a proper go.
Yeah, they did that, but they did the Bourne conspiracy. That was like a Vivendi game. And then there was, there was going to be a Starbreeze Bourne game.
Do you remember that was in the works for a while? Oh, I don't remember that. Yeah, it got axed.
It was like, it was part of, you know, when EA did all those EA partners things in like the late, it looked like Shadows of the Damned and Alice Mann. I think it was part of all that business, which didn't seem to really go anywhere, and they sort of ditched it at a certain point.
You could see Starbreeze bringing a bit of Riddick's physicality to like first person Bourne combat, you know, shoving, whacking someone with a rolled up magazine. I could see that hand animation, him squeezing a magazine tight, and you're like, oh yeah, we're going to bash, we're going to kill someone with the Radio Times. This is going to fucking rule.
The thing is that the Bourne conspiracy game they did make did go for that close quarters, pick things up, sort of LA combat, but wasn't particularly well reviewed, and it had the old minority report on PS2 thing of like we couldn't get the actor, so it's like off-brand, you know, Matt Damon instead, whereas I feel like now if anyone tried to make something like that, they would just try and get Damon, even if they only could have recorded like VO for a day or something, they would at least try and get him because it would be a big enough marketing hook to make it a success and I don't think you can make it work without it. So, yeah, it's a weird one.
I.O.'s Bond game, that's going to be the one. That could be one of the greatest spy games of all time. If they just made Hitman with less of a cynical streak, they've done it, you know?
Yeah, absolutely. I keep fantasizing about what that game could be in my head, so no pressure for them, I'm sure. This is a really hard question to answer.
Hi, guys, what's the worst take you ever heard from someone you respect about something game related? I've got a mate who once called Metal Gear Solid V just cause without any of the fud and a worse plot. That's from Danny Mann.
What's your answer, Matthew?
Throwing me under the bus. I really struggle with this one.
Yeah, sorry.
The people are a bit like... even if I disagree with them, they tend to argue their case. I don't, as a rule, respect contrarians and befriend them.
I find them quite irritating people.
I get them muted straight away on Twitter basically.
Yeah, that's the thing. So I kind of cut anyone who's trying to deliberately stir up this kind of stuff. One opinion from someone I do respect, which has always kind of tickled me, is Geraint of NGC fame was like...
So Geraint Evans, he was one of the writers on NGC magazine, now works at P Cube. And he is like, in a non-ironic way, a huge Battleborn head.
Right.
Which is like... When I say he's a huge Battleborn head, I mean, he's the huge Battleborn head. He was like legitimately into Battleborn.
And at first I thought it was just a Twitter bit because everyone was like, we all know Battleborn is a fucking disaster. And he was like, actually, I play it loads and it's legitimately great. And he wrote a piece for Kotaku UK about why Battleborn is my game of the year, which I wanted to like refresh myself on.
But unfortunately, because the internet is a big piece of shit nowadays, all the good stuff from Kotaku UK has been deleted. So it's very, very hard to find. So I can't actually remember what his argument was, but he was like legitimately into Battleborn, which I thought was genuinely terrible, even knowing his affection for it.
In the case that he made, you were like, this was a moment of madness. He also quite liked Too Human, the very bad 360 days diet thing. Yeah, I think he's just sort of like a patron saint of like lost causes.
Yeah, yeah, that's quite funny. Yeah, I wonder if he's got his takes on Lair from Factor V, Matthew. Yeah.
This is really hard because I can't, I don't know about worst take. Even Matthew doesn't have any takes that really offend me, and I've heard every opinion you have.
There must be some where you've been later.
The one where I'm like, I don't know why he's really down on this, is how you feel about the end of Red Dead Redemption. I'm a bit like, that just, that at the time just seemed like such a good, such an incredible ending to that game. So when you're a bit like, this is where it turns into an 8 out of 10 for me or whatever.
You didn't actually say that. I'm just saying random bullshit now. It basically being like the pat of the ox of that game.
I think I'm just, just at the time, I just wasn't cynical about it at all. I just thought, oh wow, what a confident end to this game. But otherwise, I do respect your takes.
And I think likewise, Contrarians, I just like blot out and I don't find that, I don't know, maybe I am too aligned with the people I sort of surround myself with or whatever. But I will say actually, I'm not going to name the writer, but there was one editor I really respected who I worked with who definitely was down on Japanese games and I think thought that a lot of Japanese games were quite silly. And was like quite into like the likes of Bioshock and taking them seriously.
But then I would say wouldn't give Japanese games the same time of day. And I think that it was like a bit of a perspective of ignorance of like I'm not willing to engage with this while praising this other thing. That sort of likes, I just sort of thought, yeah, like, you know, you can sort of like, yes, these games might have ridiculous character designs or, you know, a sort of like, or some kind of like preposterous cutscenes you don't like, but they are part of the tapestry of games.
It's good to understand them even if you sort of, even if you ultimately dismiss them. So I've had like instances like that and I've had the reverse as well where people revere Japanese games and then just don't play Western games. So I'm like, you just need both those parts of your diet, I'm afraid, to understand like the full sweep of what this medium is.
So I've had that a little bit. But yeah, I couldn't think of many specific examples here, really.
A lot of people fell in The Great War of Breath of the Wild versus Horizon Zero Dawn. But I don't think anyone I respected sided with Horizon, so that was fine. That would have been a disappointing moment.
Do you want to read this next one?
I'm not sure if this question has been asked before, but was there ever a game that you both wanted to review that for some reason you weren't able to review? It could be a game from the 90s and early noughties, or one that came in while you were there working for a mag you missed out on because you were reviewing something else, say. If it had been asked before...
If it has been asked before, read from here. Ryan also asks, are there any games from the current gen, that's launch of PS5, Xbox Series XS and Switch, that will be considered true all-timers in 20 years, like Ocarina of Time or GTA San Andreas, for example, thanks to the awesome content you learn to put out each week and month? That is from Ryan Cobain.
So two questions there, reviews you would like to have done. I like the idea of, like, that you weren't able to do in the 90s or noughties, and it's like, we weren't able to do those because we didn't work on magazines.
Yeah, because I was five, you know.
That you weren't able to do for reasons of the flow of time.
So the second part of the question is really easy. Just breath the wild. That goes in there.
Done. So that would be considered an all-time classic. I don't think there is on PS5 and Xbox series yet.
That's not happened. But they've still got, I don't know, probably three or four more years, so fingers crossed.
Pikmin 4.
I do like Pikmin 4. I've actually completed the first layer of the game, and it does get so fucking hard once you get past that first bit of credits. Have you got that far?
Have you seen the end of them? No, I still haven't finished it.
Yeah, I see some frustrations with the structure of it being almost a tutorial for the first 20 hours. I can see if you're an experienced Pikmin head, that might bother you. But now where I am, it's the real shit.
I lost 89 Pikmin in one day.
And an Ochie.
Ochie got fucked up twice. Yeah, it was a tough day actually out there.
We had to have Ochie put down.
And I'm just sort of like, I do feel like it's all getting a little bit sort of like, I'm like a World War I commander now. It's got that vibe to it, you know what I mean?
In a good way or like a be careful what you wish for kind of way?
Bit of a General Melchon, Blackadder kind of way, you know what I mean? Just sort of incompetent basically. So yeah, anyway, so the other part of this one, I did think that, you know, with Noughties obviously covers, oh no, it said early Noughties, no, my answer doesn't apply here.
I was going to say Fallout 3, which came out when I was on Mags and there were a lot of like...
Yeah, it can be when it came out on Mags too.
Yeah, that's fine. There are a few, I would say, I would describe them as Fallout 1 and 2 bores in the office who were like, well, actually, if you'll find that this game's, the tone of this game was already defined by these games in the 90s and Noughties. And I'm like, yeah, okay, I get it.
The same as people who are basically like, if you don't understand Bioshock because you haven't played System Shock 2, those bores, those bores. Obviously, I have no time for that. So yeah, but under early Noughties, I don't know, it would have been really interesting to review one of the GTAs.
It would have been like interesting to have Vice City, but I would have found it really stressful to complete because obviously those games had such high difficulties and some missions which were just a massive spike and it would have completely fucked me up.
My review of Vice City would be like, this is about a guy who goes to this city and works really hard to climb up a criminal empire and then can't save his friend from a junkyard. And it's weird that that's the end of the game, but there we have it.
Yeah, mine with San Andreas would be very similar where it's like you were, yeah, it's going great, you know, it's this odyssey across California until you get to a mission where you have to shoot down tiny airplanes with a turret. And then, yeah, CJ just vanishes from reality and then that's the end of the experience. So, yeah, very much that vibe.
What about you, Matthew?
I would love to have reviewed Super Mario Odyssey just because as a general rule, getting to review Mario and Zelda games is always fun because people actually want to read those reviews and hear the takes. And being able to play it before other people and formulate your own opinion and your own line on it, I devoured the Odyssey reviews. I was properly obsessed with what that game was going to be.
I would have loved to have reviewed Xenoblade 1. I can't remember why that didn't happen on NGamer. Like, Kitsy reviewed it.
I think we had it on import first. Maybe I didn't want to like... I've done my fair share of wrestling through games, which I didn't speak the language of.
So, yeah, but I would have liked to have... Because, you know, I reviewed 2 and 3, and I would have liked to be able to kind of like set out the whole trilogy there. Looking further back, I had so much fun reviewing Metal Gear Solid V.
I think to have been able to review Metal Gear Solid in the moment before anyone had spoiled any of it. Maybe what I'm talking about with these review dreams isn't so much the writing, the review, it's the getting to play it before it's out and no one has spoiled it for me. But being able to talk about Metal Gear Solid, the big breakthrough game that's so full of interesting stuff, that would have been a real treat.
I'm very envious of the writers who've had that relationship with that game all through their career and were able to review each bit of it as and when they happened. That would have been cool.
Yeah, I think I agree is the experiencing it for the first time thing because that was the magic to reviewing GTA IV, for example, and seeing what was on that second island for yourself.
Yeah, right. When we had Dan Dawkins or Andy Kelly on and talking about playing PS2 classics before other people and you just had no idea what they are and the idea of just picking up Silent Hill 2 and going in completely blind with no expectations. That's pretty crazy.
Okay, so good answers there, Matthew. Next question then is from Flabsy. Next question is from Flabsy.
I posted a different question first before coming to my senses and realizing that talking about gaming's industry trends and whatever the company's suits are up to is boring nonsense no one should care about, me included. That's a great moment of self-realization there. Here's a proper bullshit question, more in the vein of what the podcast is truly about.
You're both stuck living your lives as a companion character in the world of Baldur's Gate 3. What race are you? Humans not allowed.
What pre-made class is your character? As a horrible bonus question, would you take each other's companion character with you on your adventure as you play the game? Love the pod.
Cheers from Belgium, spiritual home of the applesauce. I don't really know anything about D&D, Matthew. I've not played Baldur's Gate 3 yet, so I just wrote a goblin man, I guess, a rogue.
I don't really... Maybe I'd go fiddle-de-de. Do you want to get laid?
That's what happens in Baldur's Gate 3, right?
Well, so a lot of my thinking was... I kind of took the question... I took both parts of the question together.
I want to build a character that... If Sam was to take it as their companion, I want to make sure you don't end up romancing me, basically. Because I didn't know that would be weird for both of us.
So I thought, what would be, like, the most unappealing thing? Going through all the character creation stuff, there's a race called Deep Gnomes. Gnomes are, like, obviously, they're, like, small.
They look a bit like sort of Dobby the House Elf kind of size. They're, like, very small, like, big heads, kind of big ears, but tiny bodies. They're not, like, stocky, like dwarves.
They're quite sort of skinny. So that's kind of grim. But they come from, like, the Underdark, I think is what defines them as a deep gnome, which is, like, the kind of the world under the world.
And because of this, the deep gnome.
Is that, like, the dark web, the deep gnome?
The deep gnomes from the dark web.
And they've got, like, quite an unhealthy shade of purple skin.
Right.
Because they grew up in the darkness. They look a little bit like, you know in Willy Wonka when that girl eats the chewing gum and starts turning into, like, the blueberry? And she sort of turns that particular shade of purple.
They kind of look like that. So, like, that, also, about two foot tall with a bulbous head, I don't think there's any chance, like, you're going to fall in love with my companion.
Well, there's always that part of your, you know, that part of, like, your mind that asks, what if I fucked Iron Bull? Like, there might still be that curiosity if we're talking about a role playing experience.
This is like something you'd say to your therapist.
This also sounds like that Commander in Apocalypse now talking about Colonel Kurtz going mad in the jungle. Like, it's just, like, you know, just sort of like the line of madness, basically. Yeah, so, okay, I suppose that is quite unappealing, but would you otherwise sound like you?
Because I think you would be a good companion for an RPG. You know, you're a fun time, you're a good hang, you're very amusing, you make, you know, amusing comments. Would you still have all of that, or would you deliberately be really boring and have no opinion on things?
Uh, yeah, I just don't want to be... I don't want, like, my soul, like, online existence to be, like, GIFs of, like, some awful sex scene from Board Escape 3. I just want to be everyone's kind of, like, very sort of...
Yeah, just for... I just want everyone to put me in the friend zone, so whatever personality would draw that out. I think...
It's telling to say, yeah, I think my natural personality is very sexually unappealing. So, yeah, I think... Yeah, to answer your question, yeah, I'd be myself.
People are, like, what is the tuck? Because there's all these articles about, like, how you romance to different companions and who's, like, the best characters to romance and stuff, and, yeah, I think I'd be just, like, that weird deep gnome who's in your party.
Someone said to me, I can't remember if it was you, actually, someone was saying to me, it's too easy to get laid in Baldur's Gate 3. People are always propositioning themselves to you. And I was, like, well, you know, just to be...
not to reveal too much about myself, but I think the idea with a role-playing game is it is a fantasy, and I imagine most people playing have not been... do not get propositioned on the reg and therefore find that very exciting that they do have the option to have sex on tap, basically.
It's the classic back page thing of being propositioned while you're in a dark room, illuminated only by a computer monitor. It is the cursed image of Katherine coming in, and she's like, you know, what are you doing with the... because some of it's quite wild, the stuff you can get up to.
It's immortality all over again, Matthew.
Yeah, basically. Let's bubble bath. There's no bubble bath in this one.
Sorry, I was thinking of the Yakuza hotlines.
I was going to say, I don't remember a bubble bath scene in Sam Barlow's Immortality.
Yeah, sorry. I misheard... I completely misheard and assumed you must be talking about Yakuza, where you can ring up all the ladies who are having lovely bubble baths.
Yes, there's quite a funny tweet doing the rounds about... there's this wizard in the game called Gale. You can quite accidentally enter into romance with him, because it is sort of framed and like, oh cool, this guy just...
this feels like male friendship, but can very easily slip into male romance. It can happen, you know, like even with my weird deep gnome with my horrible nasal voice, you may find yourself romancing me by mistake.
I fear I'm going to have the word deep gnome welded into my brain for the next two years now. Just going to be saying deep gnome constantly on this podcast. So, yeah, I look forward to that.
I'd be curious to see what the romance scene would look like in the game. Because the gnome is such a different size to the other people.
I just picture like different versions of the hot coffee mod from GTA San Andreas. That's all I can picture when I think of a video game scene. And in that context, you know, little purple guy just on top, let's say.
Not good, you know what I mean? Like, not good.
Tiny. He's tiny. He's like the size of your leg.
Okay. I don't want to go any further down that road. What class would your deep name be?
What's the least sexy class? Monk?
Take that Monk's IRL.
Well, you know, he's probably going to talk about like Monk stuff. Monks you think of being quite chaste.
That's true. Yeah. And a tough hang.
Apologies to any Monk patrons.
All right. So that's that question done. That was quite a lot of territory in that one in the end.
Okay. Do you want to read this one, Matthew?
In light of Ghost Trick launching on Switch and Steam, do you still prefer to play a game on a particular console? Or is it mainly about which version is cheapest and or will be available to you to access for the longest? Also, any thoughts on Tesco stopping physical media sales?
That's from Red Holt.
So the helicopter has landed and Pierce Harding Tubby Rolls has entered the building, Matthew.
Did someone say Tesco stopping physical media sales? We're like, sadly, yes.
He's entered the building like Jeremy Irons in Margin Call basically. It's like, yeah, it's like it's all about to go down.
I really hope he never listens to this podcast.
Yeah, okay, so I actually think this applies to almost all DS games in particular. So I think this ghost trick redo, but actually I think that this looks like one of the better ones. I think this looks like it comes out in the wash a bit better than Phoenix Wright does in other formats, Matthew.
I don't know if that's true from what you've played, but it seems that way for me from the outset looking in.
It's a bit more like dynamic. There's, you know, basic pitch tape. There's more action in it.
It's less static, so it's more visually interesting and fills the screen a bit better.
Yeah, exactly, whereas obviously the roots of Phoenix Wright were, you know, they were GBA games, so they're working with that for the first three. But I think in general as well, like, DS games just belong on DS. It's probably why it's the format I've collected for the most, why I've got, like, you know, more than 100 DS and 3DS games combined, because I just, I don't know, I think that the dual-screen format to some degree just always dooms those games to that format.
You know, I say dooms, but it's always going to be their home, I think, and I don't think that's going to change for the majority of those games. And that even applies to the likes of FF4's DS version, which you can play on other formats, but the visuals don't make sense on other formats. It's a 3D style that fits the DS, you know?
Yeah, that's 100%. I think games have a connection with their intended hardware for sure. I mean, sometimes that connection is weaker.
More broadly, there's not a lot of difference between playing a multi-format game on PS4 or Xbox One, say. But the handheld console divide is definitely a big and real thing. A game made for handheld play is going to have a different rhythm.
That's whether the graphical style fills the screen or even just the pace or tone of the game. There's some experiences I don't want to have sitting still and dipping into a little visual novel when I'm just popping out of my pocket and reading a little bit of it like I would a book on a bus or something makes way more sense. I also think there's a distinction between playing a game on a PC and playing a game on console on the sofa.
Like as a rule, because technically, following the logic of this question, the cheapest and best way of sustaining the length of a game's availability is playing a naughty version on the PC. But basically, if I can avoid playing anything on PC, I will now. I'm just out on PC gaming, I think.
Whether that was just working from home and my desk is, like you've said this many times before, it just becomes associated with work or COVID times or all kinds of weird baggage. But also just the feeling of mouse keyboard and sitting in an office chair is like, I don't know. That's what I do for Excel.
I don't want to play games. Boardersgate 3 is the only thing I've played on my PC this year. And yeah, so that distinction is quite massive for me.
Sorry, that probably doesn't really answer the question.
No, I think that is true to some extent. There are some games where I don't mind them being excavated to other formats if the hardware can support them quite well. So it's good that you can get Normal Heroes 1 and 2 on Switch, for example, where you can mimic the controls with...
Yeah, oh yeah.
But that's the thing, I'd say that's like a console-to-console shift, which is like an easier move than a handheld-to-console or a PC-to-console.
Yeah, I think the other thing is that the point about access to it the longest, I think that is true to some extent. Like, I've been buying more games on Xbox recently because they have been more bullish about supporting backwards compatibility than their competitors have. And that means that if I buy, let's say, Midnight Suns or Diablo 4, I feel more confident that they'll be forwards compatible with whatever Microsoft makes next.
So there's a little bit of that. But I'm not always consistent with that. At the same time, indie games I now mostly buy on Steam, because I think having a Steam deck, this will come up again later, has underlined the fact that once you do buy a game on Steam, you really do just have it forever.
It's basically just there. You can forget about a game for like nine years and then come back to it later on. So, yeah, I suppose, yes, it does matter, I would say.
But DS in particular is where it matters the most to me, I would say.
Yeah.
Okay, next question. We often hear about games people regret missing out on when they first came out, but what games do you wish you never bothered with? Some Welsh boy Mick.
What about you, Matthew?
Messiah was a huge bust. I remember buying that when I was like a teenager, because I thought, oh, you could possess all these characters. That would be cool.
And it was just a really miserable, difficult game. A big one for me was Doom 3, which I bought because we had quite a good gaming PC. I thought, oh, yes, you know, this is going to be really shiny, exciting.
And I just hated what that game was. The kind of the horror experience of it's not fun at all. Big, big bust.
That Killzone launch game on PS4 was another one. Played like a level of it. And I was like, should have just bought a console without a game, really.
And yeah, I don't know. Most most things. Those were the ones that jumped out to me.
I didn't like. I also remember buying that. What was the Half-Life expansion with the security guard?
Opposing Force, is that it?
No, that was the other one. Blue Shift. Yeah, that was dumb as well.
But all those examples come back from, you know, when I was buying, you know, with pocket money or like money from my Saturday job. So those games had to be really fucking good because I had worked quite a miserable time in home base to have them. So I kind of I took I took less than good gaming experiences a lot more personally back then, I think.
Yeah, I kind of get that. I've got a few examples too in a similar vein, actually. So I did spend a bunch of my own money as a teenager on the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone game because you have to understand I was 13 and they finally made a film adaptation of this and Harry Potter was suddenly in other media for the first time and JK.
Rowling wasn't, you know, as contentious a figure as she is now, obviously. So there was this PC version of Philosopher's Stone. I didn't read any reviews of it, obviously.
I just went and bought it because I just needed to have this experience and I didn't have a PS1, so this is where I was going to get my Harry Potter fix. I finished it in about five hours. It was shit.
The combat was crap. The puzzles crap. It was a really naff, rushed out depiction of classic early EA, early naughties EA fodder.
My sister had this on PC.
Oh, it's so underpowered.
You and my sister should do the Harry Potter revisited episode.
The funny thing is, right, I quite liked the PS1 game they did, the one that has a cursed PS1 Hagrid in it. I actually thought that was a lot better. It was a bit more...
This one on PC seemed a bit more puzzly and a bit more like trying to be educational or something. I don't really... It just felt...
It was very underpowered. At least the PS1 one sort of just looked a bit more Harry Potter-ish and stylish. I stylized.
It was just crap. So that was really bad. That served me right though.
I learned my lesson there. Final Fantasy XIII-2 is one I would probably take back. I played that entire game and didn't feel nourished by it whatsoever.
I found it just a very vague collection of stuff, like jumping between all these different timelines, not really connecting with the characters and finding the slightly Pokemon-esque addition to the combat system of controlling the monsters and leveling up the monsters, very nebulous compared to just having a straightforward party of characters.
What, a big Chocolina head?
Very much not. I was, yeah, underpowered. I probably would have played a bit less GTA Online than I did.
I was really happy to have done the heists they added to the game. They were really good. But I think some of the other more rote stuff that I ended up doing during the pandemic or slightly before, I think might have just been like, I would have been better off just playing a single-player game or something.
So those are mine, Matthew. Cool. Shall we move on?
You've got another long one to read out here.
Right. Why do you think that video game RPGs seem to be almost exclusively medieval fantasy or science fiction adventure stories? I don't necessarily think that.
In the tabletop sphere, this has stopped being the case years ago, and especially with the proliferation of independent role-playing games, they seem to be set in a multitude of settings to tell all kinds of different stories. In other video game genres, we've also seen them move into other previously unexplored territories. But RPGs, with very few notable exceptions Disco Elysium and Valkyria Chronicles are the only ones that comes to my mind from recent years, and they both have fantasy or sci-fi elements, seem trapped telling the same sort of stories in the same kind of worlds.
Do you think there's a specific reason for this? Do you know of other RPGs that try to do something different? That's from Margin Walker.
I think that's partly because games are too risky to do anything too wild with a massive budget game. I think there's an element of truth to that. I think the other thing is as well that I personally have come around to some of the criticism that these settings get for being imperialist fantasies and reinforcing imperialist or colonialist norms.
I do understand that a bit. The older I get, the more I understand that criticism and how these types of stories in some ways exist to promote that as a status quo. And that's part of the origin of those archetypes in the first place.
But that's not to say that everyone making it buys into that. But when you get stories of kings and chosen ones and stuff, there's a very obvious grounding in where those types of stories come from. It's not that interesting or maybe not even really relevant to our modern world anymore.
But I think as well there are some exceptions to this. I did think about this some more and obviously you have the likes of Persona 5, which is archetypal in other ways, you know. But you have like Nier Automata, which is kind of an action RPG, I guess.
That's a very different type of setting to what I've seen in other games. And in the indie space you have, as you mentioned, there is obviously Disco Elysium. But a game like Amore, which is kind of a weird horror sort of indie RPG, wasn't my sort of thing at all.
But you can't deny that the setting is quite distinctive.
I just don't know who would play Disco Elysium and go, oh, not another fantasy RPG.
No, but they said that's a notable exception. That and Valkyria Chronicles are the notable exceptions.
Oh, right. Oh, sorry, I read that both have fantasy elements.
That's true, but I think they are saying it like otherwise, they're not quite the same thing. But yeah, I think that is just because they sell. That's why.
What about you, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, part of it's like, you know, the people who are now in power to make these things grew up in a certain era with certain, you know, they've probably brought certain things through their lives. And, you know, maybe you'll see, you know, a broadening of these things when a generation raised on, you know, more very tabletop scene. Like a lot of the people who have developed designing games now have all grown up on the same D&D or Warhammer or the same kind of sort of fantasy tropes, which is maybe why people turn to the same things.
But I don't know. I don't entirely agree with, like, oh, well, the other genres outside of RPGs are so inventive, you know. Like, I feel like everything's pretty tropey.
The only, like, you know, examples of RPGs that don't heavily lean to, like, one or the other, like, I think something like 80 days would count.
Oh, yeah, kind of, yeah. Sort of more visual novel-y, I guess, I don't know.
But yeah, yeah. I feel like there's enough sort of interaction and choice and, you know, the inventory element of that adds something to it. Catherine suggested that Betrayal at Club Low.
Oh, yeah.
Which is kind of like a sort of surrealist sort of RPG, I guess. You know, like has maybe a bit of a sci-fi tinge to it, but is more like real world through a weird lens. Yeah, I kind of take the point.
I'm also like not... I don't think I'm as bothered by the point. I'm not like, oh, my God, RPGs aren't feeding me anything new.
I feel like there's a lot of diverse, interesting things happening even within those tropes. Yeah. You know, you compare like A Mass Effect to Citizen Sleeper and very different vibes.
You know, approaching it from very different angles. Both super interesting, both super valid.
I personally think there's more to be done settings-wise. There are more radical types of settings to explore or different influences to draw from. I wish there was more easy answers to this question, so I do sort of agree with the point a little bit.
Next question, Matthew. The console chat in the PS3 Draft episode makes me wonder, what do you think is the most exciting or successful jump between generations? Whether it's a technological leap, exciting new design ideas, or coming back strong after the last console failed to impress, what's really impressed you?
That's some Serrano. What have you got for this one, Matthew?
I've said it many times before, but the jump to N64 and 3D genres of things I was used to playing on the SNES and Mega Drive, I don't think it will get much more impressive than that, but once you've made that initial leap, I think the jump to the 360 generation was pretty special. I can remember seeing even the earlier versions of those games, their world seemed to instantly hold so much more detail compared to what was happening on the PS2 and Xbox and GameCube.
That was console-PC parity, which was quite a big breakthrough moment, definitely for those of us who couldn't afford expensive gaming PCs.
Yeah, I think Xbox 360 is a good one. If you think about how piecemeal the Xbox was and strange it was, the fact that they had the Duke controller, which they replaced, and then they had a remote control to turn it into a DVD player, which you didn't have to do on PS2. The Xbox Live stuff came later and separately, whereas on 360 it was all built in, you just plugged in and you're ready to go.
It was much, much stronger and obviously the games looked incredible. I agree that was probably the last leap that was really exciting. In terms of hardware, I would say that the form factor of the Switch was an exciting move forward.
Yeah, for sure.
That was a generational leap where it's the way you interact with the console rather than the power itself that is super impressive. So it's still capable on that level. But yeah, I can't deny that the last couple of generations for the PlayStation and Xbox are, you know, it's nice to have the extra power, but you don't really feel the leap in the same way anymore.
You know, the N64, for example, is a really good one. Just like the way games progressed in the 90s, it will never be like that again, but it was something to experience in real time for sure. Cool.
Okay, do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
Also inspired by the PS3 draft, talking about MGS4 and how Kojima went all out in the self-indulgence and fan service, are there any other games you can think of that went hard due to creators' vision? All the best, lads, and thanks for making Quality Podcast. That's one just, Kai.
Is that the person you accused?
Yeah, that's the one I said Jack used to. That's the big bayonetta two-head. Sorry about that, mate.
Yeah, so I've got a few answers to this one, Matthew. I'm sure you have too. Bioshock Infinite feels like it jumps out as one of those.
I'm sure it's like a series of creators who are informing the end result, but it definitely feels like, you know, just when we read Ken Levine's interviews, that his sensibilities are in that game to a large extent. And his next game, I don't know, I can't remember the name of, but certainly looks like it's following a similar vibe. So there are some ideas that he obviously is very invested in.
Other games in more of the indie space, I would say, I definitely want to play The Beginner's Guide, the Davey Reedham game. That goes very hard and I think it's actually quite hard work because it's a bit too much of the creator in there. It's a bit too much like open wound about him and his life.
And I don't really respond to that for whatever reason, but I know some people have mentioned that when we've done previous Game of the Year episodes of a game we could discuss. I wasn't a huge fan of that. I would say probably the games of Daniel Mullins, Matthew.
Oh, that's what I wrote.
Oh, good. Yeah, I'll put an inscription here. Do you want to jump in there?
Yeah, no, I'll just say like very singular visions. I mean, maybe they're becoming like a little predictable in that, you know, they're going to be super meta and break the fourth wall at some point. But the fact that he is committed to like outdoing himself and making games which become ever twistier.
You obviously had Pony Island, which started as a sort of simple game and then a simple kind of arcade game and then reveals this sort of mad demonic other side to it. And I actually think of the three is made. I still kind of probably enjoyed the second one.
It's not called The Pact, The Hex, which was like a murder mystery where all the characters were video game genres and you kind of learn each of their backstories by playing their game in their respective genre. But actually within each of those games, some of them had mechanics which you could have pulled out into a whole game. You could almost imagine a version of The Hex where one of the many rounds was inscription.
Say there's a weird platform and there's a weird fighting game and a strange tactical adventure. But there's always something going on. There's always an element of hacking or going into the code in some way.
It's got to a point where whatever he does, I'm just in on it. Yeah.
I think inscription as well has the very powerful turn that occurs after you've done the initial card game element. That meta moment is like pure magic, I would say. How they do it is really impressive.
The game itself kind of tails off slightly after that.
Yeah. That's sort of why I like The Hex. If one of the flavors of the game isn't quite your cup of tea, something else comes along.
But inscription is definitely the fuller, more comprehensive work.
Yeah. With MGS4, actually, I will say, it's harder to tell whether that's pure Kojima or whether it's just Kojima trying to give people what he thinks they want. That's why it's got so much excess.
Because I think MGS2, in a lot of ways, is more pure Kojima than 4. Just because I think the ideas are very clear in there. 4 is like a big garbled pile of stuff, basically.
It doesn't really cohere.
Also, Death Stranding is like Kojima leaving the constraints of, I can't do what I necessarily want to do here, so I'm going to leave, and this is what I chose to do. This is presumably where his head is currently at.
I think Death Stranding kind of ticks that box too. I was also into this question. I was going to throw in Sakurai games, which I think, whatever they are, whether it's Kirby, Kid Icarus or Smash Brothers, I think they are, the through line is just that he kind of goes all out and he just throws everything at them.
He's obsessed with modes and unlockables and all the gimmicky kind of detritus of video games is just all in there constantly. Even if what the actual games are about are quite different, he never ever offers half measure. He's another creator.
I think you can always expect that from him.
I suppose one more to throw in here as well, Matthew, would probably be immortality. That's like a creator's sensibilities front and centre, it feels like. Of recent games I've played, that would be up there.
Sakurai is a good one because those are different genres you wouldn't necessarily associate with a creator's vision as such compared to stuff that has a lot of story in it.
I think there is a lot of his sensibilities. His sensibilities is in framing, modes, menus and options. There's something in that, I think.
I was going to say on Sambalo, I recommend listening to his episode of My Perfect Console, which is quite interesting. I liked Spoiler Alert for that episode. He picks five works of interactive fiction, like none of which I'd played.
I'd heard of a couple of them. It's quite like a hardcore episode as a result, but it's quite interesting hearing him talk.
Through the scene that he emerged from and what interested him and how that ties in to what he goes on to do in her story and immortality and even some stuff with Silent Hill, Shattered Memories and things. That is an interesting episode.
I think you'll find there are no other podcasts, Matthew, just this one.
There are no other podcasts, but if there were other podcasts, there might be one in which Sam Barlow talks about five works of interactive fiction in a very engaging manner.
OK, next question. Do you want to read this one?
Hello, Samuel and Matthew. Are there any art or visual styles from comics, fine art, movies, animation or other media that you think would be cool to see in games? I'd love to see a 3D world inspired by Klimt's famous The Kiss painting.
That's from Blinky. This is a very generous assumption of our knowledge of fine art.
Yeah, I actually ended up... Obviously, I do try and go to exhibitions in the UK, but then I rarely know who paints this stuff, or do anything beyond taking a picture on my phone I can do nothing with. My actual base knowledge of this stuff is more like, oh, there is one painting I saw at a witch's exhibition in Oxford that would be rad for a style of game, but unfortunately I didn't know what the painting is called or who painted it, so I have no information to share.
So I have to go to pop culture because that's where my brain is truly at. So I think it would be nice if one of these superhero games actually looked like a comic book. Instead, they all look like versions of the MCU, I would say.
Maybe they're afraid of doing cell shading styles, but I think it's sort of like... I was playing Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and the way that Wolverine and Venom look in that game, for example, just such beautiful styles.
I feel like it would be nice if one of these 3D games tried to ape the style of comic books a little bit more. You had more of a Jim Lee style to how they do, I don't know, like a Rocksteady game or something like that. But I think that just, yeah, I think instead, like I say, yeah, I don't imagine, for example, the Black Panther game EA is making will look massively different from Marvel's Avengers or Midnight Suns in its basic aesthetic.
I think it will be like some 3D models in the real world basically. So the art of Darwin Cook as well, a sadly deceased artist who was one of the original artists in the Batman animated series has really stylized, I would guess you'd describe them as sort of like 40s or 50s style to it. Just really, really beautiful.
Did this book called DC, The New Frontier. Just gorgeous. Kind of like the ideal vision of what Superman or Wonder Woman look like is how he drew them, I would say.
So that kind of sprung to mind. It would be nice if more games that had a manga or anime aesthetic were better able to mimic some of the better looking entries in those genres. A game that looked like Cowboy Bebop would be amazing, for example, or Akira.
But games can only get so far in their current form.
Some of the anime fighting games or action games do come quite close. When you see footage of the Demon Slayer game, you think, I don't know how it plays as an actual game, but as a fan of that anime, you're getting something quite close to how that show looks and moves. I played some of the Naruto fighting games, and they definitely had quite a commitment to doing the mad scale and the escalating chaos of these world-shattering moves or whatever.
I just never really got into them, sadly.
Or like Dragon Ball FighterZ, right?
Yeah, right. It may not be quite right, but it's definitely an attempt to find a 3D version of that.
Yeah, so I wish I had a slightly more interesting example for you here, Blenky, but that's what I got. What have you got, Matthew?
Yeah, again, I have even less of a pool to pool from because I don't have the interesting comic book observations you have. I was thinking about, like, I really like the Leica stop motion films, like Kubo and the Two Strings, those kind of like stop motion puppets where there's like a, you know, it could be achieved with 3D animation, but there's a kind of texture to them, whatever, which, you know, I wonder a kind of 3D action game which kind of pulled from that slight sort of stop motion, the sort of feeling of sets. There's a sort of an awareness that you're looking at something kind of handmade in a way.
And actually, like, some of the better stuff I've seen in Dreams does tap into that. Like Dreams, everything has that slight sort of handmade, whether it's just like the natural wonk of what the hand carves, you know, using those game creation tools, but that, you know, even the most photoristic Dreams games, there's a sort of veneer of kind of sort of arts and crafts to it in some way, which maybe taking that as an aesthetic and blowing that out would be cool.
Like Tearaway does.
Yeah, yeah, but that was like very specifically papercraft. It's more like the, I don't know, just the sort of, the sense of something kind of carved from wood or being a different material. Yeah, I guess like Tearaway, but for like other materials, more games like that.
I always like the kind of after arts and crafty things.
Yeah, yeah. It's funny actually, because I watched Pinocchio for the first time during the pandemic, which I know sounds really weird that I've not seen it previously. The Disney one.
Okay.
And I had obviously previously played Kingdom Hearts, and there is a Pinocchio level in that, in Monstro the Whale. There's basically just a bunch of like weird looking pink rooms. And then it doesn't prepare you for how weird and dark Pinocchio is.
It's a very strange film. It's a really, really odd and quite dark film. It's like a borderline horror film at times, I would say.
And it was quite funny to see how the slightly, you know, the necessarily naff way in which the Kingdom Hearts artists had brought that world to life on PS2, versus how incredible Monstro looks in the film. It was quite funny to compare those two things. I suppose making 2D aesthetic work in 3D is just such a massive challenge, so I can understand why it doesn't happen quite so often.
Actually, I guess Psychonauts 2 had a little bit of that feel to it. That had a slightly carved, slightly... Whatever they were doing with textures in that game was really nice.
That really spoke to me. On Pinocchio, the bit where they go to the theme park and everyone turns into donkeys, that's genuinely distressing body horror.
Oh, yeah. And also there's quite a strong implication that the dudes in the shadows are paedophiles, right? That seems to be what they're going for in that film.
Is it? I don't remember in that much detail. Pinocchio is one of those films which did...
I think a lot of the reason I don't smoke is because of all the obnoxious boys in that... That film did such a number on me as a child of like, if you behave like these people, you will turn into this donkey. And obviously I knew I wasn't going to turn into a donkey, but I definitely think some of my life choices kind of come from things like that.
Yeah, I think so. It doesn't.
Naughty boys. I still, somewhere deep in my head, there is an association with smoking and drinking and turning into a donkey at that naughty theme park.
You were just like, in your late 30s going, I've just got to not turn into a fucking donkey before I die.
That's all I've got to do on this planet. One of my university friends had a, it wasn't a stag do, it was sort of a head and do with male and female friends at Thorpe Park.
Right.
And it was Thorpe Park, yeah. And if you go to Thorpe Park, you can go to the local train station, and then there's a Thorpe Park bus they put on that just goes endlessly back and forth between the train station and the park gates. But it's mostly full of children.
It's for people who can't drive to go to the theme park. So it has huge punnocchio energy, because you go on that bus, and it's just a load of teenagers with no adult supervision, and they're all losing their minds because they're excited about going on a roller coaster or whatever it is that kids like, or they're going to eat their body weight in candy floss, so they're losing their shit. And that bus had huge punnocchio energy, like bad, naughty children.
I was on there as a 28-year-old or whatever, thinking all these bad children are going to turn into donkeys when they go to Falk Park. They were so loud and shrieking, and you were like, punnocchio really got a lot right, you know?
The timeless depiction of naughty children.
It really got what children are like when there's no adults. They're just awful.
Yeah, right little bastards. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, good.
Well, on that note, we move on to the next question. Hi, Large Lads. Is The Back Page pod discord more good than bad?
How do you feel about it as cult leaders in chief? Yes, I partially asked this to hear how exasperated you get over the takes in there, and so we can all feel seen for a little bit. Please don't nuke it.
Cheers for the show, and sorry if we've damaged your mental health. That's from Bob Bob. Discord Matthew, what's your take?
Because you're on there less than I am, but when you turn up, it's like Kramer in Seinfeld. You get loads of emojis. People fucking love it.
They're having a great time.
But Kramer when he was a less controversial figure.
Yeah, pre-2005 Kramer.
Yes. Yeah, it's okay. I feel like I almost don't want to go in there too much because I feel like I disrupt the natural ecosystem, you know?
Like, it's a bit like... If you say something, you know, it's like God comes into the Discord and lays out the law and then everyone's too scared to reply or it kills the conversation dead. You can't go in there and have banter with them because most of them, the Discord people, are like oh, well, that's the end.
We don't want to argue with this figure, I guess. So it's kind of difficult. It's a weird one.
I just observe it from afar and I feel bad when I go in and, you know, when I see a bad take, most of the bad takes I let go. Occasionally, you go in there and you're like ah, that just sucks as a take. And then you feel like, oh, actually, that's like...
I mean, when I keep describing myself as God, I don't actually think of myself as God, but...
No, of course.
That is like, you know, God descending from the heavens, going up to a person and going, you suck. And that person would be like, fuck! Like, God thinks I suck.
So I am aware that we have that effect on people.
Yeah, I've definitely like done a sort of like God just said I sucked thing to several of our listeners in there. I interact with them more than you. I think it's definitely more good than bad.
I've had up and down moments with it where I think people have been maybe too familiar or, I don't know, just like I feel like they're frustrating us on purpose, baiting us or whatever.
That's what I don't like is the obvious bait. It's like, well, I'm just not going to interact with those people because it's just boring, isn't it?
It does seem to be a little haven for people who want discussion about games away from the Twittersphere. And you do actually think that there are probably limited numbers of places you can actually go for reasonable discussion these days. And I do think that our state, our sort of like us popping up in there, does keep it, does keep the sort of tone of it at a certain like level and prevents it from becoming Twitter or something like that.
Plus the people in there are mostly very nice. So yeah, I think it's, I think it's actually like quite a good little community we've built. And I am sort of like reasonably determined to maintain it that way.
So I did see someone shared a game from a controversial creator in there yesterday. And I did almost put them on cooldown. So I was like, because then it got into like, I don't know, Twitter accusation territory.
There's a bit of that I occasionally have to do, but usually they take care of themselves quite well, to be honest.
They set up a little game club or something, right?
Yeah, it's called, I think it's called the Seven Out Of Ten Club. And they're all going to play like, I don't know, one game a month or something. I don't know, I've not actually read that channel, so I don't read every channel.
As mentioned before, they could be planning a terrorist attack in the parenting channel, I don't have no idea. I might be culpable for it as the creator of the Discord, but I don't look in there because I don't want to know what's going on with the parents. So who knows?
Yeah, anything more to add Matthew? What should we move on?
No, that's good.
Okay, relatedly from Dynamic Calories, this is for the Discord. Good god, a lot of Discord stuff.
This is very self-indulgent that the Discord want to be talked about this much.
I don't actually know if I've got an answer to most of these anyway. So we'll just see if you have any answers, Matthew. Number one, top bad hang in the Discord.
I'm not calling anyone in there a top bad hang.
No.
I've got someone I think it is, but I'm not going to say it.
Yeah, same.
Number two, member you wish well. Number three, best meme poster. Number four, best meme poster.
I like the categories say more than the answers.
It takes to make you go, oh yeah. It takes to make you go, oh no. The obvious one there is the Mission Impossible 2 breakout that happened in there of people saying this is good actually.
And then just thinking, I don't think so, no.
Breath of the Wild weapon degradation. That's a no, no.
Yeah.
Yeah, is anyone agreeing with something I've said on the podcast? Then I'm like, yeah, this person gets it.
Channel that's a no from YouDogs Sports, obviously. Yeah, sports parenting. Don't really look in the pet photos one either, but again, wish the people well.
Is there a pet photos one?
I think so. I think it's like a pet animals channel. I think it is.
Yeah.
One discussion you never wish you have to relitigate again.
I guess weapon degradation.
Definitely. Yeah, that's the ultimate one there. Like definitely not.
Nine, worst discourse implementation. Don't really know that one, what that one would be. I don't know.
I'm not sure. Talking about...
Good answers to this section.
Yeah, struggling. Ten, best recurring third party channel or podcast repeatedly mentioned despite instructions otherwise. If Simon Parkin listens to this podcast, by the way, he might be interested to know there is a sub channel about his podcast in our Discord.
So that's something that exists. Yeah, I don't know if there is anything else. TCGS comes up a few times.
But again, as mentioned, there are no other podcasts.
There are no other podcasts. Talking about how much you like other podcasts in our episode chat, that's a big no-no. My ego doesn't like that.
I do like the Final Fantasy X memes, even though I have played Final Fantasy X, but I just don't remember a lot of it. And I am reverse-engineering what that game is from the memes.
I quite enjoy that, because I feed into that very much.
It's just like Whacker and Blitzball is all that game is now to me.
I did really like the meme that said that Oppenheim was Final Fantasy X and then Barbie was Final Fantasy X too. That was probably the best one I've seen in recent months. That was really good, especially because the person in question hates X2 and was trying to diss X2, but actually ended up complimenting both games and both films quite well.
So that was funny. Okay, enough Discord chat. Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
Oh, but then the Alfred Molina 3 PS3 Classic. Any tech demos you remember being particularly wowed or underwhelmed by? I remember seeing screenshots in Lom of the Zelda demo at Spaceworld 2000 and getting so hyped for the GameCube.
Basically, because of this, and then they included a picture of the 3D model of Ganondorf. That's from Nasalin.
Yeah, so the obvious answer to this was the peak shitheal move in 2005 or 2006 when they did the FF7 remake tech demo. That was what the game would look like on PS3 if they were making it, which they weren't. I mean, does anything sound...
I don't even remember that being a thing.
Yeah, they did the opening of FF7 with PS3 tech. They showed Cloud in kind of like Advent Children level of detail, I would say. And they showed that during one of the conferences.
And they weren't making the remake. And they were like, this doesn't exist, but if it did, it would look like this, despite obviously people clambering for a remake. Does anything sum up the PS3's fortunes like that?
A thing you could have had but didn't get. By the way, here's some brown shooters. That jumps out.
I would also say, I feel like the getaway for a long time had these really bullshitty pre-rendered screens you would see in official PS2 magazine. I thought, wow, a game that looks like that. But it obviously was like PS4 level of details, like CG level stuff.
Obviously, you'd see it in the end that it would be like a low res JPEG of a HMV attached to a block in the game and that was London. But that's fine. Those I got excited about.
I suppose I do remember this Spaceworld demo, Matthew, and it was a huge deal for sure, but would end up creating quite a few headaches for Nintendo over the years, wouldn't it? What about you?
Yeah, I mean, there's headaches because they then do Wind Waker instead and everyone feels that they want to see 3D photorealistic Zelda, even though Wind Waker is one of the best looking games of all time. Annoyingly, the most impressive... Tech Demo, maybe this isn't quite the right thing, but it was the Behind Closed Doors destruction demo for Crackdown 3, where they showed us the original version of what that was going to be online, where it was the cloud server-powered persistent damage of a...
basically a multiplayer game that played out in an open world city where you could destroy the city on a granular level and it was all persistent and never forgotten. So you could literally machine gun a hole in masonry by chipping away at it like concrete atom by concrete atom, or you could blow up entire skyscrapers and they'd fall over and knock down other skyscrapers, and it was all calculated and powered by the cloud, which was how it was going to be possible on Xbox One, and obviously they just never ever managed to make the tech work, even though we played a version of it, a live demo of it at Gamescom, and everyone came out going like, well, that was the most impressive thing I've seen in years, but they just never ever delivered on it, sadly.
Where is that build? Let me play that build. I want to see what it looks like.
You still can't fucking knock down buildings in games like that. They hinted at the Red Faction Gorilla. That never happened again.
I guess that's not quite the same as these tech demos. In terms of underwhelming, I always used to roll my eyes at the annual or every couple of years updates to Unreal around the time of Gears of the War being massive. There was quite a big thing of like...
Because they basically show you the new engine in the framing of this is what the graphics will do in the next Gears game. So it's like, here's Gears 2 and here's how we've updated Unreal. And do you remember like the meat cube?
They had like this big meaty cube to show off like flesh physics and just things like that. You're like, this isn't quite my bag, but people would go absolutely nuts for it. And maybe that's because at the time I was on a Nintendo mag where tech demos and graphical leaps just weren't in the conversation.
Another underwhelming one, though, probably doesn't count as a tech demo, it might just be a bullshit trailer, was like the very first unveiling of the Wii back when it was the revolution still. Like the early trailers of what Wii games would look like and how they would like move is quite far removed from what they are or what they were, particularly in the looks department. They kind of oversold, you know, it always is going to look super shiny, but they always do that when they announce the console.
It's like, here's the kind of the theoretical kind of place we're going to as opposed to where we end up.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's yeah, one other one to throw in there actually is the not related to Nintendo, but related to Unreal was the Matrix demo they did for PS5. That was fucking great.
That was like it was because it was playable as well. It wasn't just like a thing you saw in a conference. You could actually play it, which was quite unusual.
And they gave you basically a whole open world with nothing in it, but also a pretty amazing looking set piece with agents chasing you down a highway right a la Matrix Reloaded. That was a very generous, free thing to give out and a cool thing. Probably one of the ten coolest things I've experienced on PS5.
It was decent. I think we've got some good spread of answers there, Matthew. This one's a bit weird, Matthew, because this is a slightly older question, but I think people would like to know your take.
I have a question for Stealth Tactics Specialist Battle Pesto. Have you played the demo of the new Mimimi game? Shadow Gambit, what are your thoughts?
Do you think that the graphics are a step down from Desi 3? Desperado's 3, which is so amazingly crisp, that's from Bumpster. I'm not sure what to make of that name.
So, Matthew, have you played a bit more of this now?
Yeah, I have played a bit more. I've not played as much as Catherine, who reviewed it for RPS and gave it a best of best, but yeah, it's great. It's obviously the next game from Shadow Tactics and Desperado's 3, except this time it's Pirates.
I don't really get the graphics being set down. I haven't put them side by side in my head. It's kind of how Desperado's looks.
This game's got a slightly bigger scale to it. It's set on bigger islands that are almost sandbox-y, and the big change between their earlier games in this game is that you build your squad of characters rather than go into a mission with a preset, so they're having to design these levels that hold up as stealth challenges based on all the different combinations of characters you can build, so it's definitely a more ambitious swing than their previous games. Visually, I wouldn't say it's a step down.
I don't really buy that. Maybe I'm slightly less into the pirate aesthetic than I was what they did with Cowboys, but yeah, it seems great. It's a much more complete feeling game in that outside of the missions, there's a hub area and there's a lot more story stuff going on.
It's their own story. It's their own IP. Their vision for it feels much bigger compared to Shadow Tactics and Desperados III.
The light RPG elements, the order you unlock or reanimate your crew obviously then changes the crew that you take into the missions. It's got some really nice training elements to it that maybe the other games could have done with. When you unlock a character, you can go down into the hold and do these bespoke missions that are designed to teach you their powers.
I feel like they're trying to give their core gameplay, which hasn't changed much from Shadow Tactics. The best shot it's possibly had of impressing people and bringing new people in. I just think people sometimes look at the screenshots of these games and go, oh, it's a strategy game, or it looks like a real-time strategy game because it's isometric.
I don't play those games either. It's honestly a real take your time and savor it and enjoy the power of these mad abilities. To me, every bit is fun and experimental, as a Dishonored or something.
It's just a different visual perspective on it. I just hope people give it a go because it is pretty amazing.
Cool, yeah. Lucky people to get a sneaky little what you've been playing, Matthew, in the middle of what's meant to be a value-free, deeply malnutritious Mailbag episode.
Have to edit that out.
Yeah, we'll stick it in another episode. A good one. I've got this one downloading, Matthew, so I will play this one.
It'll finally be a MeMeMe game I have a take on, and we can talk about it. Who knows?
That's why it's true. It's my game of its respective years.
Yeah, it feels like the moment for this to happen, despite the fact that everything's been overshadowed by Baldur's Gate 3 at the moment. Okay, lads of large stature, I hope this finds you well. After a conversation about the attraction of replayability in CRPGs and Western immersive sims versus a more common one-and-done approach of JRPGs, I wondered why you both stood on replaying games and revisiting other media.
I imagine there's a certain amount involved in producing the podcast, but how about for leisure? I'm pretty much a one-and-done guy for 99% of games. That other 1% is basically just Sekiro.
As ever, I love the pod, and I've already asked... And if you've already answered this question and I've forgotten it, please dismiss. That's from Dynamic Calories.
Matthew, replaying games outside the podcast, how common is that for you?
Not very common. I'll replay the Castle canon masterpieces, Galaxy, Ace Attorney, Hitman, but actually replaying stuff for the pod, when we've done a serious retrospective or a deep dive into a particular creator, it actually does make me realise how much my views do change on games when I revisit them. I'm quite happy with the version of games I have locked in my head, but I'm also aware that I will have fresh takes and that it would be more interesting for the podcast, but you have to draw the line somewhere because my job is, and a lot of this podcast, is what's new and looking to the future as well.
It is. I would rather be playing more, replaying more old stuff, because I think a lot of our best podcasts are actually us rediscovering things and recontextualising things and re-evaluating games and understanding the different places.
I'm not ever really... When you've gone back and how you go back and play N64 games and that kind of... There are certain eras that I'm like, you know what, I don't really need to do this.
And I'm kind of happy with my teenage memories of these games and they just haven't aged as well. I don't want to just go back and dump on all the things I used to love, which is why there's a little bit of apprehension about going back sometimes.
Yeah, I think it depends how far back you go. I think that when I tend to go back to the PS2 era though, I'm generally having quite a good experience and I enjoy... Some of my highlights of making this podcast were revisiting God of War games or the Metal Gear Solid games obviously and playing GTA 3 when they re-released that.
I really love doing that. If anything, I wish I had more time to do it for the podcast. I feel the dual pressures of we have to do a Game of the Year episode, so I don't want to make that bad, so I have to make sure I'm playing new stuff.
I almost wish there was slightly less of that. That's why I'm a bit perturbed with the amount of big games this year because I would almost rather spend a bit more time replaying stuff for some of the episodes we've got coming up, like the old Hitman episode or the Resi Moments episode we're doing on Patreon. So, yeah, it's a balance, but I think I'd probably get more out of it than Matthew, and I probably naturally did it more than Matthew.
And, fun being honest, part of why I started the podcast is because I did want to revisit some of this stuff and have a good reason to do so. And I like that we've got that built into the DNA of the podcast, that we can do a Two Giant Men, Replay Metal Gear Solid 3 if we want to, and find value in that. Or, you know, playing Replay Max Payne 3, probably some of the most fun I've had making this podcast, Matthew, it was a blast to just play that for a few days and talk about it.
But for every one of those, there's like, you go back and play some Golden Eye and then you're like, mmm.
Yeah, that was a tough replay. You know, facility is still fun. The first like, half of that game, mostly, is still pretty enjoyable.
I just think that's basically what, that game was what my personality was for two years. And now I'm like, half an hour, I'm like, nah. I mean, I cannot state how much of that game I played.
Yeah.
Yeah, so that was, I just don't want that. I don't like those moments of realization.
No, but we're quite careful, I think, to not go back and dunk too much. You know, the exception obviously being Jet Force Gemini. Sorry for any fans of that game.
We've heard me dunk on that game's controls many times, but I can't help myself. So yeah, it's a balance, I suppose, is the answer. Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
We've only got two more.
Dear Large Gentlemen, Hopefully I'm not too late for the Mailbag. I'm just re-listening to the Steam Deck episode of The Pod, and would love to hear your feelings about the Steam Deck one year on. After a burst of playing it after launch, I found myself putting it down for a few months as the novelty wore out only after picking it up infrequently.
I've started playing through Final Fantasy VII Reunion and Ys Origin on it lately, though I've immediately, and now I've immediately fallen back in love with it. How are you finding your deck one year on? That's from Nashire.
Yeah, so I think the Steam Deck has sort of replaced the Switch for me when it comes to playing indie games. It's because some games are coming out on it before they're coming out elsewhere. You can't play Dave the Diver on Switch, for example, but you can play on Steam Deck.
I've got Dredge on Steam Deck. I've played Arcade Paradise on Steam Deck. I've played Pizza Tower on Steam Deck.
I'm using it for that, I would say, more than big games, because I find the battery just drains too fast for the big games thing to make sense, as impressive as it is. I think that's something you do when you first get it, and then you find more of a pattern of games that are appropriate for it. It was amazing to watch Dave's gone on there and play that for a couple of hours, but then if it's only running for 50 minutes, you might as well just go play it on your PS5 that's in your house.
That sort of happened, but I still use it as a tinkerer's device. Like I say, older boys tell me that PS2 games run great on there. I wouldn't know anything about that, obviously, but those older boys, that's what they tell me.
They say that if you want to try Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction, then maybe play it on there. Again, these are older boys. I have no information about their whereabouts or what they do, but yes.
How about you, Matthew?
I actually haven't played mine for quite a long time. I don't really use it. I think that's mainly because I was pretty much exclusively using it to play, you know, the 100-hour-plus visual novel Umineko, which I'm still only like halfway through.
And yeah, I don't know why I stopped playing it, but it's literally in its little package by my bed. I don't really have a very interesting take on this one, I'm afraid, other than like, you know, for work reasons, I've had to like familiarise myself with a lot of PlayStation stuff recently. Like I've been playing a lot of first party games on the Switch.
I just don't play as many like indie games, things as you, things which probably would exist quite happily on Steam Deck. Yeah, it isn't any slight on the Steam Deck, it just doesn't quite fit my diet at the moment. I'm in a big console phase.
The funny, the other thing is, I don't know if you have this Matthew, but because of the amount of hardware I own now, it feels like everything I own, I only enjoy sporadically. I don't feel like I'm persistently using any one thing anymore. My PC or my PS5 or my series X or my Switch.
I look at all of them and I'm like, am I getting enough use out of this? And I feel that way about all the hardware I own now. It might just be through volume.
Do you get a bit of that?
Yeah, that's definitely true. I mean, there's an indicator of things, like Catherine plays hers loads more than I play mine. But that's probably because I'm hogging the console.
Like I basically sit downstairs by myself playing the console and she sits upstairs playing Steam Deck. Sad, sad image of our home. But that's the beauty of Steam Deck.
It enables us to have no interaction.
I really, honestly, I just wish I had a better battery life. And I know why it doesn't, because it's kind of miraculous what it does. But I did like last night just installed this on the 2.
And while it did that, it lost like 15% of its battery life. But I was like, wow, this thing, I just forgot how quickly this drains.
Do you still have to have it on to download things?
I don't know. I'm actually not sure.
That was always my big beef, is that you couldn't download while it was like in sleep mode.
I think mine might still be doing that.
It just had to be on in the corner of the room, which is like just constantly seeing out the corner of your eye, like that screen being on the floor, I was like, this isn't good.
Yeah, absolutely. I've got a lot of devices with LCD screens that are just collecting dust. Honestly, after we did the Wii U Hall of Fame, I kept my Wii U out for about three months and the state of that screen, that Fisher-Price screen on the controller, man.
Okay, I've got one more question, Matthew. Do you want to read this one out?
Yes, sorry, I have to go into a different doc for it. One sec.
No worries, I also had to do that, which is why I got you to do it.
Oh, I see. Oh, well, this is really long. Okay.
But it's a good one.
Yeah, it's good. This is from a friend of the podcast, Nathan Brown. Hello, normally sized men.
I hope this finds you well and isn't too long to read out in the pod. Matthew's recent Apple Source disaster had me thinking about my own embarrassing memories of press trips over the years. They are, quite frankly, Legion, and many of them can never be repeated, but one in particular sticks out.
It was in 2014 when I went to Nintendo HQ in Kyoto to interview Miyamoto for an Edge cover story. This was in the middle of the Wii U and 3DS era, when Nintendo wasn't doing so well, and thanks to a company-wide cost-cutting drive, we had to fly through Dubai, which turned a 14-hour journey into a 20-hour one. We landed at midnight, went straight to a Tokyo hotel, were on a bullet train to Kyoto the next morning, met Miyamoto the morning after that, and went straight back on the train to the airport to head home.
We were in Japan for less than 48 hours, and I was a jet-lag mess throughout. Miyamoto, you may remember, had been working on four Wii U prototypes at the time, and after I'd somehow made it through the interview, he asked if I'd like to play the Star Fox prototype. It involved constantly switching focus between the TV screen where you saw Fox's ship, and the gamepad, which had a cockpit view for apparently easier aiming.
It was, as anyone who ever played Star Fox Zero will attest, absolutely awful. Through a combination of nerves, jet lag, the game's cumbersome, counterintuitive concept and controls, and my steadily increasing sense of shame and embarrassment, I made an absolute mess of it. Through his translator, Miyamoto began offering helpful tips, which merely added to the confusion.
I eventually offered him the gamepad, said something to the effect of perhaps you could show me how it should be done. And my god, I will take the look on his face to my grave. He wasn't furious or anything, just disappointed.
And that was far, far worse. Anyway, that's the only time I met the world's greatest ever game designer. Weird that they never invited me back.
What's your most embarrassing hands-on demo memory? Thanks for the wonderful pod and keep up the good work. Lots of love, Nathan Brown.
Oh, what a lovely story. Indeed. I wanted to end the mailbag with a little treat for people, Matthew.
A little award for getting this far.
You can't listen to all that dog shit. But then Nathan told a good story. I just put that up as one of his blog posts.
That's good.
That's a hit point. Yeah, like entry right there. Yeah, so hands-on opportunities.
I've talked about a few of these before. I remember, this one I haven't talked about, there was a Crytek MOBA I went to an appointment for at E3 or something. And, look, I don't like MOBA games, okay?
I'm not interested in the character designs. I'm not interested in the mechanics of like, put a guy here and he just does stuff, send little gremlin guys, buy a little stuff from a shop. I don't care about any of that.
The time I had to play Dota 2 for PC Gamer was like the worst time ever. It's not good. Played this game, got cancelled.
I remember the dev, she was really getting frustrated with me not understanding how to play a MOBA. And I was just like tuning out and not having a good time. And I could see her getting frustrated with me, not grasping it.
Occasionally I have those kinds of appointments, I guess, as a journalist. But the other one, and I've talked about this before, was when I played Leia with the six axis controls in front of Sony's PR. And she just, she had played the game enough to know how to play it properly.
And she took it off me and she could control the dragon, make it fly around fine. But I took it and I just couldn't do it. I was just like flying the dragon from one end of the map to the other.
And then every time I tried to turn it around, it would do like a 180. It just wouldn't steer precisely. And it just felt like an absolute nightmare.
And then I would occasionally just like, I just, I was just really struggling with it. And that, that was such a stinker of a demo. And I mean, obviously that control scheme was absolutely slammed.
People did not like it. They did eventually add, you know, twin stick controls, which here make it a little bit, a little bit better. So, yeah, but that one was like, it was just someone telling you something works and you're like, it doesn't work.
I'm trying it. It's not working. And then the world says it doesn't work, you know.
How about you?
That's tough. I think I may have mentioned this before, but when I went to the, like the big, there was a big WiiWare day in London. And this was back when Super Meat Boy was still coming to WiiWare.
It was intended as a WiiWare game. Eventually they never released it on there. But I played Super Meat Boy on the Wii with Tommy Refnes, I think his name is.
One of the co-creators of it. And like the room was quite hot anyway. So, you know, being a larger lad, I was already a little like a little overheated.
But like the stress of playing Super Meat Boy, it brought me out in like incredibly heavy like instant sweat. And I can remember just there and he was really like, I think he wanted me to finish the level because it had that gimmick where it would show you all the playthroughs at the end. You know, you do it and then it shows you like all the Meat Boys dying, but you had to like complete the level for that to happen.
And he's just like, you know, another go, keep going at it. And you're like, oh, this is really getting hot. I could feel like the Wii Remote getting like really slick in my hands.
So I had such a such a disgusting sweat on and like the pressure of trying to complete this game, which is like, you know, its whole selling point is how hard it is to complete. And this guy kind of looking at sort of taking some pity on me. And I just felt so sort of disgusting.
And you're like, I just want to like walk away from this demo completely. And that was that was really rough in terms of absolutely like just completely biffing a demo and not really understanding it. This wasn't so bad because it was it was part of a preview session.
So I was really keeping an eye on me. But when I was on RPS, I started having to go to preview games for the channel in genres which everyone who listens to the podcast will know. I have like no interest or experience in.
So like anything sort of strategy or 4X, it just meant I was going to have a really bad time and come away with a lot of very bad footage and going to do Total War Three Kingdoms. And I just couldn't pass that fucking game at all. Like I couldn't make it do anything.
You're like, I'm trying to go here and it's like, these guys, you can't do that because these guys don't have like grain. And then you're like, how do I give them grain and like triggering these battles which I didn't know how to control. Just absolutely abysmal.
I like those games are so hard to get into.
They're a genre in themselves really, you know.
Oh, yeah, absolutely. And, you know, I really tried. I tried prepping.
I tried playing other ones before I went. So I knew like, oh, I don't know how these things work. But I just don't understand how people ever get into them.
But they seem so confusing to me. I consider myself reasonably intelligent. But I just couldn't do it.
And they're like, they always have this on this one. You know, this one's especially user friendly. We've got these really in depth tool tips.
And you're like, I regret to inform you your tool tips did not help me one bit. Everyone's starving. There's no fucking grain.
Like, it's like, oh, yes, I think I finally managed to attack something. And it's like, well, you've just attacked one of your own villages. You fucking burk.
And you're like, that shouldn't even be an option. What's happening here? Bad time.
But it was, it was at the top of the Shard.
Oh, yeah.
In one of those fancy hotels there. So that was quite fun. I always like to preview event up there.
The toilets in the Shard, they have urinals that just look out. Like, they've got glass windows behind them. So while you're taking a piss, you can just look out and see the London skyline.
It's like you're like pissing into the city.
Big Roman Roy energy to that.
Oh, big Roman Roy energy. Except Roman Roy wouldn't have like struggled through an hour of Total War Three Kingdoms. He would have just, he would have fucked that off like minutes in and just gone and eaten lots of the free Chinese food buffet that they had.
I think the Warhammer ones are a bit easier to pass than maybe the historical ones are if you've not played one before. I had played a bunch of them. I think we're going to have a second one during the pandemic and have a pretty good time.
It's just this thing where people are like, you know, fucking, you know, Lou Bu or whatever is going to negotiate with you for land, and you realize you've sold a mountain for one sheet of cotton or something. Like all these other warlords are like, fucking, get him while they're going to good guys. This king does not understand what he's doing.
Let's strip him, let's strip everything he has.
I like the idea that you, did you go to this demo because you were like, maybe I'll see Lou Bu, my guy from Dynasty Warriors. Was there a bit of that?
It's just like, you should go to this because it's a big game on PC, and we're a PC video channel, and yeah, maybe some of my apprehension about Gamescom this year is because the last time I went, it was for RPS, and that would mean going to see a lot of quite hardcore PC games, which I had no understanding of. You can basically apply the same things I've said about Total War 3 Kingdoms to any number of demos I saw there. The worst footage you've ever seen of Mount and Blade 2 Banner Lords.
I'm like, here's a guy who doesn't understand that. And that has the look of a third-person action game, but I would think I was trying to play it Skyrim or something, and Skyrim it ain't, and we put a video up and it did hundreds of thousands of views, but all the comments were like, it's so wrong that this fucking idiot got to play this and I didn't.
Yeah, when this happened to me on PC Gamer, I just like hosed the situation down with Fraser Brown basically. Like, Fraser just reviewed Baldur's Gate 3 and it was like, any RPG or strategy game is like, yep, here he is, here's Fraser, Fraser knows exactly what he's talking about and he can take this and protect me from looking like a fucking idiot basically.
Honestly, like whenever someone reaches out, which is quite often about like, how do I become a games journalist, Mr Castle? I should just say, honestly, that like if you want the, like you definitely want a job is master the strategy games and be a half decent writer and like you will be, you will be in use forever. Like everyone needs that person and there's very few of them about, you know, like yeah, there is only one Fraser Brown.
Yeah, that's right.
When we hired him, it was like the greatest, maybe the greatest moment of PC Gamer was hiring him. I was like, oh, we did it. You know what I mean?
We got, we got our missing piece. We have, we have everything we need now to make this website function. Funny but true.
Okay, that's a good note to end on then Matthew. The podcast is done. Me and Matthew are privately aiming for a round an hour with this one.
And it has, of course, ran to two. But I think it was a fun episode, Matthew, some laughs in there. I think maybe like there's a three quarters in it went a little bit like, when will the questions end?
But I think it came back around and it was good. How do you feel the episode went?
I feel like it went okay. I think Nathan Brown bailed us out with a good anecdote at the end. I feel like I said deep gnome too many times.
I don't think you said it enough personally. But yes, that's this podcast done. This is the last one of August of the main feed.
XXL, we've got an episode for Patreon folk at the XL tier on a streaming service draft that me and Matthew are doing. So that should be a fun one. That will go up after we come back from Gamescom.
And next month, we're definitely going to do the Nintendo DS draft. So I'm excited about that. I've presented Matthew with 15 categories.
He has not fed back on those yet. So I'm not sure how he feels about them.
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, I thought they were good. Let's do our business here.
We'll move ahead with that then. And I think we're probably going to bring back GamesCourt next month. And I'm also wrangling a game developer guest to come on next month.
So talk about something quite cool as well. So yes, lots to look forward to. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
MrBazzle, underscore, pesto.
I'm Samuel Dobby Roberts on Twitter and also BlueSky. I'm on there too, if you have joined that app. And yes, I've abandoned Threads.
One listener did at us on Threads, Matthew. And it was like two weeks ago when I'd like checked. So I was like, oh, I'm really not engaging with this platform.
And Back Page Pod on Twitter. And yes, we'll see you next week.
