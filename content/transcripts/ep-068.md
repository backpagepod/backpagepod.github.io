Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, this episode marks the debut of our theme tune. Ah! Yeah, it finally happened.
Composed by Paradise Killer composer, Barry Topping, very kindly. We commissioned that from him, and it's a terrific Phoenix Wright-inspired work, I would say. So yeah, basically for people listening at home, we decided to go legit and stop using unlicensed music all the time.
We'll still use like little bits in like the breaks between sections, but we kind of wanted to sort of have our own little theme tune for a while. But I mean, I knew obviously Barry was extremely talented, but it turned out better than I could ever have hoped really. What did you think of it?
I'm still kind of like a sort of peasant looking up at some gods who can make music. I have no idea how people make music. I can't even begin to comprehend putting together a tune.
So yeah, hearing something from nothing based on our muddled notes was really awesome.
Basically sent over like four or five completely unrelated Phoenix Wright tracks and said, something a bit like this. And that was kind of, that was our commissioning skills at work there. So maybe it says a lot about how we ran magazines.
It made me think whenever I'm kicking off about how bad theme tunes are in all the Marvel films, now I sort of understand it. It's quite hard to explain what you want musically, because if you could explain it, it would just be the tune. Wouldn't it?
You're like, I want it to go like this. It's like, it needs to sort of be like this.
Yeah, so shall we play the full version of it at the end of the podcast? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, because from now on we'll basically cut it in half.
So you'll hear the first half at the start and then the second half at the end. And that'll be a nice little bookend. That's kind of what we commissioned.
There's a few stings as well that Barry threw into. So you might hear those periodically. And it's perfect to have a Phoenix Wright inspired kind of like tune to kick off our latest edition of Games Court, Matthew.
I feel like that's thematically perfect. So this is our first Games Court episode of 2022. It's been a while since we did one of these.
Our listeners buy secondhand games and Judge Matthew Castle decides whether they live or die on Matthew Castle Island, a kind of a people's Republic, as it were. It's a matter of taste versus money spent. And that's what the verdicts are made on.
And sometimes it's all just down to the whims of a Kurt or Kurt-style judge who hates Sonic games and obeys no real rule set. So Matthew, I do want to ask you about Games Court. But first of all, I think I need to check in with you on Elden Ring, because this is a persistent obsession of ours.
So how has it been going for you since we recorded our two large men play Elden Ring episode?
Very well. I think I've taken out my second Big Boss. Big Boss?
Oh, nice.
Much easier than the first one. I don't know if that's just because I'm clicking with the game or I've levelled up or I've levelled up in a particular direction that was good against this particular boss. It was, without spoiling it, a little bit more gimmicky in the first boss.
If the kind of stuff in Stormvale Castle is more of a straight up fight, the next one had a sort of a slight almost puzzle-ish element to it. And then a more straight up slog. Me and my ghostly Godric soldiers who I can summon are now such an unbeatable tag team, I actually sort of begin to feel sorry for anything that gets sort of stuck between us.
So yeah, it's going well.
Well, enjoy those lads before they inevitably get patched as well. Yeah, so I haven't actually got that summoned yet. Are they stronger than the Skelly lads who you get early on?
I think so, yeah. It's more that one of them shoots from afar and the other one uses a sword and people just don't know which one to focus on.
Oh yeah, that's definitely bullshit.
So they almost feel like two summons and they're also pretty hardy. They are available in the first area, I should add.
Yeah, I did go looking them up after you tweeted about how you're bullying bosses but then struggling with regular enemies in between when you could summon them.
Yeah, but I've become so reliant on them if I'm in an area where you can't summon them, which is most of the map, admittedly. Yeah, I'm just absolutely screwed. But the second I see that little symbol pop up, it's like, well, you know, party time.
No one's going to be able to do with me now because here come me and my little Godric squad.
Yeah, I'm sort of in the first. So I've actually come to the doors of, I think you called it Elden Ring Hogwarts on Twitter, which is accurate. So I'm kind of outside the door and I've got this little map that kind of sends you on this little quest to get some kind of key to open the door.
So, OK, that's like about, I know, probably three or so hours behind you or something like that in progress. So, yeah, but I do like that swampy kind of foggy area. That's very nice contrast to the rest of the game.
Also, I did kind of learn the game is a lot bigger than I thought it was. And I got teleported somewhere. I won't ruin it.
But it's so it was so rad. It was so gigantic a place. It was quite overwhelming.
And it was. I just kind of like I can just see now this game is a lot bigger than I thought it was when I was looking at a map originally, which I thought was the entire world. And it's I don't think it is, to be honest.
So I've not actually seen a picture of the world map. So I'm still kind of like surprised every time it opens up. I've got a faint feeling of like how it shapes and how it sort of functions.
But yeah, there's definitely like tears to the map, I think.
Yeah, I went to Mourne Castle, did that all business. Found these sort of like walking mausoleum lad. Found the trapped pot lad.
Gave him a whack in the arse to get him out of the thing. Yep, good stuff. Just a great game, isn't it?
Really, really good.
Oh, really good. Yeah, I'm super into it. To the point where I actually sort of present everything that takes me away from it.
Including this podcast.
Including this podcast, work, seeing family. Yeah, the works.
I played 24 hours of it in seven days. And that is like an extraordinary amount of time when you think about it. And you've played even more than that.
So yeah, you are indeed my friend. But exciting times. We've briefly discussed the idea of revisiting Elden Ring.
If and when we finally finish it. Maybe like do two giant men finish Elden Ring as an episode. Again, starting with the title first, working backwards.
It's good stuff. But here, Matthew, we've come back to another game score. I was looking it up, right?
It's been five months since we've done one of these. The last one was in early October. That was a Listener's Games Score episode.
For those who are relatively new to the podcast, had about a thousand or so new listeners since then, this year as a result of the Game of the Year episode, which was quite popular. There's like, people might have missed these. So basically, early, I think it was at some point in 2020, I did Games Score where I put all the stuff I bought during the pandemic on trial.
Matthew had to decide whether me hoarding some bullshit and some good DS games and 360 and PS3 games warranted me being put to death or not. And then we revisited that idea when I'd somehow managed to buy more games throughout last year. And then we did a listener edition where listener's purchases were put on trial.
It's a fun format. I would say probably the daftest of our episode formats. Would you agree, Matthew?
Yeah, I don't know how much nutritional value it has because so much of it is, but you know, I maybe have intelligent thoughts on like half the games people mention. Half of them I haven't had any experience with, so it's basically whatever mood I'm in in that given minute. I also like the idea of just actively killing off loads of our listeners.
That seems funny to me. I'm more into the framing, I think, of the courtroom than maybe the actual work of the law.
Yeah, that's completely fair. I would say as well that some of these listeners might have been drowned last time and I can't remember.
Everyone gets a do-over.
We decided that there would be some kind of Phoenix Wright-style spiritual bullshit that could explain that. Some kind of pebble that Maya wears around her neck to bring you back from the dead to be killed again or something. Something like that.
I would say let's get to it, Men Matthew, because we have 18 different exhibits to get through. But in a twist this episode, at the very end of the episode, Matthew has some purchases that I'm going to pass judgment on. That'll be a fun little bonus section at the end.
I'm excited about that, Matthew. To start with then, how have the people of Matthew Castle Island been faring lately, Matthew? How's it going over there on your state?
People might remember last time, you had banned the concept of time itself from existence there. How are they doing these days?
Yeah, they're doing fine. Because I've been playing a lot of Elden Ring, and that's distracting me, I actually think it's a period of relative peace on Matthew Castle Island. They've got a modicum of peace, which is good.
The flip side to that is that, while I'm playing Elden Ring, I'm getting a lot of leadership inspiration from the mad rulers of the Lands Between. There's a guy who's grafting his citizens to his own body. So I might introduce a bit of that into Matthew Castle Island.
That seems like quite good. I could become a human pick and mix of just the best of the land.
It's a really weird flex of yours now that you mention pick and mix every episode.
That is not intentional.
Well, you say that, but I don't know. I think there's some psychological warfare going on here.
It's not like the poll is still open. I can subtly influence it. I'm not trying to say pick and mix so people are like, oh yeah, I do want pick and mix.
Unless I'm generally setting up for our next draft and there's going to be another huge pick and mix, play that I'm preparing for.
Yeah, it's like my PS Vita Mini comes with some pick and mix again and people are like, yay, Matthew, and they vote for you. I'm not ruling that out.
I'm basically well on my way to becoming a human meme.
In a larger sense, to the listeners at home, the behind the scenes on this is me and Matthew were messaging each other last night saying, it's a lot of pressure to try and be funny on purpose in these. And like, there's a lot of that today where it's like, oh, I don't know, is this too big a swing? Is this going to go down with a third?
It's very much like you're under pressure to perform. And it's not like, I'll be honest, it's not like Simpson's Golden Age level writing that we've got here. It's more like later season's a family guy, I would say.
Which is brutal, really. So what happens in every episode as well is the courtroom is filled with all kinds of colourful characters. They can't affect the outcome of the case, but they sort of add a little bit of drama, I would say.
Some kind of reaction.
Were they originally meant to be the jury?
I think so, yeah. But I realised conceptually that made no sense. So, yeah, I think originally Masters of Terror's Carcy poorly rendered Chewbacca was in the jury.
But then, yeah, I think the jury is there because it's a sham trial. So they're just sort of there for the sake of it. There's no real judicial system at work here, just the whims of a mad ruler has established.
So who's in the courtroom this time, Matthew?
We've got a giant pot with arms from Elden Ring. Because he always looks like he's throwing his arms up in sort of celebration. So I think he's quite a good, he's quite a nice character for me to see.
In my eye line, I feel celebrated by him.
It's true, he never really looks perturbed unless he put his arms on like on his sides and then looked a bit stressed out. He's a pretty happy looking dude.
I've got a Kirby dressed as Agent 47. And I've got an Agent 47 disguised as Kirby. That's interesting.
Yeah, very good. But no one can tell which one is which. That's the magic thing here.
We've got the Prosecutor from Great Ace Attorney Barak von Zeichs. I just thought I'd get another lawman in the court. I've got a badly rendered Michael Caine from Batman Begins.
What, the PS2 tie-in?
He looks terrible.
Right.
But he is in it. I made sure that that was true by watching a YouTube playthrough of Batman Begins. Skimming along the timeline, trying to find Michael Caine, just so that that legit works.
I will say not worth the effort. And I've got a big robot elephant from Horizon. Basically, it's what I've been playing recently.
That's what came to mind.
Yeah. Minus Batman Begins.
That was just a desperate Michael Caine callback.
In a wider sense, I always found that with these PS2 tie-ins, they would also always do a good job of getting the actors who played the characters to reprise their roles in the games. But they would re-enact lines from the film in the most stilted fashion possible to completely undermine the value of casting them. So you get Michael Caine going like, I will never leave your side, boost.
That kind of dialogue delivery. I don't know, you got the same thing with Tobey Maguire in the Spider-Man games and stuff. And it's like, you're barely here, man.
This is like the equivalent of a two-page review piece of freelance for you. Just a six out of ten, just knocked off.
Big reviews round up energy.
I was surprised he didn't go for the bootleg. Michael Caine, they had in the Italian job on PS1, Matthew. But he might have only been a voice.
There's a cockney manager shouting over some cars driving around, and that's sort of like the whole situation there. Okay, so the other important thing is that, the defendants of Matthew Castle are put to death if found guilty. So Matthew, how will people die in this episode?
I wanted to crack out my prestige water tanks again. You know, I can't really do that to Michael Caine. So what I've done is I've actually imported the grape press from Hitman 3's Argentinian vineyard.
So I'm going to pulp the guilty. And to add insult to injury, because that's important, I'm going to decant them into wine bottles, so I can put them on display. So yeah, you're going to get turned into a very fine...
I know that isn't how you make wine, but pulping a body doesn't turn it into wine, you just go with it.
Yeah, I mean, the rest of the process can happen behind the scenes. Who's pressing the button to pulp it?
Is it Kirby disguises Agent 47 or Agent 47 disguises Kirby? It's one of those two.
Yeah, but we may never know which one pressed the button.
We know, because they are so similar.
It's a bit like a rifle squad, like where only one's got the bullet in it. It's like that, except only one Kirby slash Hitman mashup is pressing the button, so they can both live with themselves.
Yeah, it is exactly like that.
Okay, good. In no way is that in poor taste. I look forward to having a nice little glass of one of our listeners after this is over.
That should be fun for me. I, Samuel Roberts, am the court-appointed attorney, a kind of like Sol Goodman style figure, as previously established. I turned up in my cheap suit, very, very cheap, like British home stores, kind of like off the rack cheap.
And then, yeah, sort of like looking a bit stressed and like sort of my briefcase falls open, it's just full of sandwiches and there's nothing else in there, no paperwork. And then, yeah, I step up and I'm ready to deliver my opening statement, Judge, if you'll allow me.
Yeah, knock yourself out.
People of the court, I am here today to defend 18 people that may or may not be guilty of making foolish second-hand purchases of computer games, from dodgy PS2 tie-ins to porny Sega Saturn garbage. My clients are here to assert their rights to hoard questionable bullshit from years past in the name of capturing some precious glimpse of their lost youth. Who is Judge Matthew Castle to stop them?
This is a man who still owns box sets of House starring Hugh Laurie in 2022. This is the man who went asked to name his favorite eateries in London after living there for several years, came up with Subway as his third choice. This is a man who went to Bars Best Steak restaurant and ordered a risotto.
He's not the arbiter of good taste, he's the sweaty meatball marinara of injustice, served on the Italian herbs and cheese of contempt. To my clients, I promise that some of you will be going home today. To those who don't make it, I'm afraid you died for nothing.
Oh my god, you put so much effort into that. Last night when you messaged me, and you were like, oh, I've spent two hours prepping this one, and I was like, oh yeah, you know, I'll put, you know, thinking, oh, I better put some work too. I just, all that changed was I went into a document and wrote, Michael Caine badly rendered.
And that was it. That was my plan.
That's fine. I mean, if you want gamescore done the way you want it, you've got to do it yourself. It's basically what I came up with.
It's quite sad to hear your life boiled down to these true facts. But you're like, these are just so indicative of who I am as a person.
I will say. So do you actually own box sets of house? Because I thought I saw them last time I was there, but I couldn't quite remember it.
I hope that was factually accurate.
Maybe Catherine does.
Oh, OK, right. So I've actually implicated Catherine in this. So yes, let's crack on then and put these mostly lads on trial.
So Exhibit A is from 16BitSmith on Twitter, an indie developer. He bought Brave the Search for Spirit Dancer, £10 on PS2. I have the best, worst submission for Reader's Games Corp.
Backpage Pod. Bought Exhibit A because I worked on it in QA as my first job in games. I spent £10 on this PS2 game, Matthew, which from what I can tell is a very dodgy looking PS2 action adventure platformery thing.
Kind of looks like about 14 different games from the time. Bought this from working in his QA job, but it turned out he already owned a copy that he bought for £3 previously, so it's a double purchase. So I will ask for leniency from the fact that there is like an emotional element here, even though I can't defend the game, which looks quite bad.
Thoughts, Judge?
And you know how I feel about the old buying something you already have. He bought it for almost three times as much the second time.
Yeah, it's just this pre-owned games market man is out of control.
He worked on it, so he knows it's not much cop. I get this one confused with what's the Sony first party one, which has got a similar kind of energy?
I don't know, really. You're not talking about like Mark of Cree.
Isn't that similar?
There's loads of games from this time that kind of have like, they're kind of like Beyond Good and Evil-y sort of games, you know what I mean? Like that kind of action adventure where it's not quite a platforming mascot, it's a little bit more real-world-y. It looks like it's kind of from that, made by the developers of State of Emergency, Matthew, a PS2 classic.
Oh, God.
I kind of know where this one's going, but I just wanted to get it out there anyway because I enjoyed the submission. But have you seen the screenshots of it? It's quite dodgy looking.
I must admit, I haven't played this. It's the kind of thing that you saw in a half-page review on Games Master getting like 40% and then you'd never touch. Even if it was the best game in the world, the double purchase and such an expensive second purchase, it's so unwise, isn't it?
I think we got ourselves a pulp in.
We got ourselves a wine. Good stuff.
An excellent year because it's quite an old game.
Yeah, good stuff. Andrew John Smith Vintage there. Sort of in the form of a Malbec maybe.
I don't really know what I'm talking about with wine.
I don't know anything about wines. I know there are red ones and white ones. These are red ones for obvious reasons.
OK, so we got one dead, right?
Yes, one dead.
OK, one dead.
Do you win if you get people off the hook?
Yeah, we should establish that, shouldn't we, before we press ahead.
But you don't want to say press ahead.
You're wrong. Really the wrong thing.
I mean, that's a very poor choice of words.
So, yeah, basically, I think 50 percent is like where I win. So I have to get half of my clients off. OK, next up, Exhibit B.
As a huge Destiny fan, I was rather hyped for Anthem than swiftly disappointed by the reception it got a release. I never tried it. I paid £2.39 for it on the 30th of June 2021.
And it's not even worth that. I deserve to be drowned by Michael Caine. That's from Owen Christie.
Now, I think Anthem for £2.39 is well worth it. Anthem is not like a terminally bad game. It's just a disappointing game.
And if you play on Xbox Series X or S or Xbox One X, as we established in a previous episode, you get the framerate boost too, so it's a nice looking thing. I think there's at least like four hours of fun to be had with Anthem here. For £2.39, I think that's pretty good.
£2.39, that's like the price of a very bad shop bought sandwich. You could get a very disappointing sandwich, which has gone in, I'd say, five minutes tops. Just on the time element, I think everyone's a bit too quick to get round and dunk on Anthem.
It is flawed, but it's also kind of beautiful in its own way. Flying around is fun, the world looks cool. I think there's £2.39 worth of fun in this for sure, especially if you play it on Xbox, like you say, with the frame boost.
Yeah, I'm not going to pulp this. This sounded like a man who wanted to die from his email. That makes me feel iccy.
Exactly. You have your own very complex code of morality to follow. Sorry about that, Owen Christie, you're still alive.
I don't know how I feel about that.
Exhibit C. Hello Samuel and Judge Castle. During Christmas I wanted to play Christmas themed games, browsing the web I saw, Dead Rising 4, Frank's Big Package.
I thought to myself, surely it can't be as bad as people make it out to be. So I gave my £8 to the seller on eBay. It promptly arrived and truthfully I've not played it yet.
I will get round to it, I promise. I accept the harsh verdict I expect to receive. Kind regards, Jordan on death row.
Yeah, thoughts Matthew, because I do understand this was a relatively disappointing entry in this series, but I don't know, 8 quid, which I presume that Frank's Big Package edition comes with all the DLC. I don't think 8 quid is too bad for a win purchase, and it is a Christmas themed game and they are quite rare on the level at which Dead Rising 4 commits. So, what do you think, Judge?
I had to cover Dead Rising 4 when I was on the Xbox YouTube channel. Like, this was a first party game when it came out, so we had to do, like, videos about it. It's kind of fine in the way that, like, all the Dead Risings are sort of fine.
I don't know if this was a series I ever really loved. They're all kind of the same thing, aren't they? You just go and whack people.
At least you get a big shopping centre in this one. I think it was a step in the right direction after Dead Rising 3. There you go, that's a bit of nutrition.
Eight pounds for this, with all the DLC. I think that's okay. Again, writing to us from death row.
Why does everyone assume they're going to die?
I think it's just because you have been established as a judge who is thirsty for blood.
Yeah, but I'm also a contrarian. There's no pleasure for me in killing someone who's already kind of resigned to their fate.
It's like, look mate, if you want to do some damage control higher up PRT, what can I say? I mean, like, you know, the reputation is a reputation at this point.
No, I don't think I can pulp Dead Rising 4 for £8. I think that's OK. I wouldn't pay a penny more over £8.
Do you think that the not having played it element makes this worthy of a pulp-in?
Wait, why are you making the case for pulp-in?
I believe in justice first.
Excuse me, Judge, are you not forgetting the fingerprints on the weapon? Oh yes, thank you. Thank you, the defendant.
Yeah, you haven't played it. Yeah, I forgot. That is a very pulp-able offence.
Yeah, my trust pilot reviews just went down. That's bad for my law business. Okay, exhibit D.
Hi both. My questionable games court purchases Army of Two. In 2010, a housemate and I played 90% of it together in one sitting but never finished it and eventually I traded it in.
I bought it again last year during lockdown. I have no one to play it with as I live with my wife who has no interest in good games, let alone Army of Two. Love the show, thanks Alex.
Self explanatory Matthew, Army of Two. I remember the first one being a bit of a dud and the second one being maybe a bit more fun, a little bit more spicy. But they're kind of like generic third person shoots of the day.
Thoughts?
A very boring game. Boring enough that you got rid of it originally. I think your past you was right and knew what they were doing.
They didn't finish it then, they didn't care for it then. I think basically this person cast their own judgement all those years ago on their future selves. They didn't know it at the time.
But yeah, he's pulped.
Wow, it's like Cloud Atlas or something. Just like a grand tapestry of time and consequence.
Except the last segment is all the cast is getting pulped in a giant great press. Which is not the end of Cloud Atlas.
Okay, so that's three dead out of four. You'll hear me periodically typing as we go here. Sorry about that.
I know it's annoying when people do that on podcasts, but it's the only way I can keep a tally of the living, basically. So, Exhibit E. Slightly longer one here, but it's...
Let's see. It's like... This guy's dead, basically.
Hi, Samuel Matthew.
It's not a good start.
Well, I saw the word on a movie show, and then I kind of perked up, but then I saw what the game actually was, and I was like, oh, no, oh, fuck. We're in bad town here. Hi, Samuel Matthew.
So, my entry for Gamescore is inspired by listening to the episodes that you've done on this so far, which have been great. Hoping that this is not too obvious, an obvious attempt to curry favor with the judge. I found myself thinking about games that I'd always liked the look of, but never played, and managed to purchase one such potentially hidden gem for the sum of 99p plus £1.83 postage, or as you call it, the heavenly sword tax.
Reference to me buying heavenly sword for like three quid, where I questioned, why would someone even bother walking to the post office for that? Which I think was a good observation by me. As a fan of the Onomisha games, I had my eye on this game before I owned a PS3.
When I finally bought the machine from a friend who was moving abroad, it came ready with a collection of games, and I never went back to look at some of the earlier titles I'd missed. But I now own a copy of Genji, Days of the Blade. I think this scored about six or seven out of 10 at best when it was released, which is maybe why I never went back to it at the time.
I expect that I'll get some enjoyment from it, and look forward to seeing what the court thinks, or if you have any experience with this game yourselves. Love the podcast, thanks Dave. So Matthew, this is the famous Giant Krabs game.
Yeah. But to be fair, Elden Ring has loads of Giant Krabs, so you know, Giant Krabs have never been hotter, frankly. But what do you make of this one?
I mean, I think it's a little reductive to say, to try and liken this game to Elden Ring, because they've both got Krabs. There is a quality golf. I must admit, I really only know this game from the meme, and it is a powerful meme, but that does suggest that there is a problem with it at its heart.
Have you played this one yourself?
No, I don't think I ever owned it. I think there were four PS3 launch titles. There was Resistance, Motorstorm, this, and then one other one that I can't remember.
I think it might have been Flow on the PSN network. And so this was definitely the least desirable of them, I would say. There are more interesting weirdo PS3 purchases to make, I would say.
Not as cheap as this one, but I would consider buying Folklore by the same developer. That's quite an interesting, weird RPG from the early PS3 days.
See, I don't know if I would have pulped them for Folklore. Or I've kind of shown my hand about what's about to happen here.
It's not looking good for old Dave, is it?
Well, there's no need for a drum roll. Let's pulp them up.
Yeah, it's fine. Drums aren't allowed on Matthew Castle Island anyway. Four dead out of five, Jesus.
Not going well for me.
Oh, the Barak von Zeichs from Great Ace Attorney has just chucked one of the bottles of wine because that's one of his animations. I'm really, really sorry to... Who was the brave guy again?
Andrew John Smith.
Yeah, I'm sorry, dude. You're currently smashed all over the wall, so you won't even be remembered. I'm really sorry about that.
Yeah, that's tough. Sorry about that, mate. Difficult time for me.
Awkward for me, really, is the defence attorney. So, people of the Games Corps, I present to you the absolute pinnacle of comic book game adaptations. That's right, it's Judge Dredd versus Death on PS2 by The Mighty Rebellion.
It was so cheap, it felt like I was robbing the store. Pennies, I tell you, pennies. It's a game I can spend many minutes playing before getting a headache.
And it's honestly not as bad as the reviews made out to be. I remember the reviews being middling for this rather than terrible. It doesn't include a stencil set, so hopefully I'm safe this time around.
Judge Matthew's bias against them is truly shocking. A bit of context there. I think this defendant had previously submitted a Mortal Kombat stencil in a previous games court and then got drowned for it because Matthew has a grudge against stencils.
He got wronged by a stencil once, as we established. For the record, I'm a huge 2018 Judge Dread fan. I even regard the 1995 Stallone film as a cinematic masterpiece.
It was robbed at the Oscars. Clearly the people behind Forrest Gump bribe the judges.
When he said that, I gave the nod to Kirby over by the button.
Or is it Agent 47?
Or Agent 47, but one of them.
Regardless of the outcome, it was still a better purchase than the time I bought myself a second hand copy of Tribes 2, only to find out I couldn't play it online because someone had already used a CD key for their account. Have mercy, Your Honor, I beg you, Christoity. I can't say I really remembered Judge Dread vs.
Death, but to be honest, Chris, if you'd have gone for Dread rather than Judge Dread as like your cinematic pick, I would have been on board with that because that's one of the five best comic book adaptations, Dread. That's like a great, great film. And so, yeah, the 2012 one with Carl Urban, real good.
But you went with the Stallone one and like basically, you know, tightened your own noose essentially. So where do you stand on this, Judge?
Well, this is a very, very rare case where I once upon a time also bought a pre-end copy of Dread vs. Death.
Wow, OK, weird.
Yeah, when I bought my... When I got my PS2 Slim at the end of the PS2 life, I hadn't owned a PS2 up until that point, and I basically just bought piles and piles of pre-owned games because it's when they used to do like five for 30 quid or whatever in Game Station or something. Yeah, I've definitely got a copy of this on PS2 floating around somewhere.
I think it had your gun. You can load lots of different ammunition into the same gun. He's got like flame bullet and then his gun can also shoot like, I don't know, concussion rounds or something.
Yeah, I don't think this was like totally, totally horrible. It would be kind of grotesque hypocrisy to pulp someone when I made this man. I'm not even a mistake.
I actually think this is okay. If anything, the whole I love the old Judge Dredd film, that puts it on edge. But you know, this is a games court.
It's not film score. I will, however, hand you over to film court once games court is finished.
Is that also on Matthew Castle Island?
That is also on Matthew Castle Island. And do you want to take a guess at who the judge is?
I mean, surely. Is it Michael Caine?
I don't know. No, it's still me.
Oh, that makes more sense.
In fact, it's the same room we're in right now. We just put up a different flag.
A different flag with your face on it.
We might get rid of the pot with arms, because that doesn't really make a huge amount of sense. Michael Caine can stay, because he works in both.
Good. I look forward to Films Court, where the theme tunes of Marvel films will be put on trial endlessly. Sisyphean horror for everyone involved.
Does that mean Chris has survived, Matthew?
He has survived. For now.
We've got basically four dead out of six. So, not too bad.
If that's your idea of not too bad, those are terrible figures. If that's your website, which is like two out of six go free, but in brackets, they still live.
Well, it's like, you know, if you want a... Basically, like, this is a kangaroo court as previously established. The whole thing is a sham.
So, I'm the best you've got on this island, I'm afraid. Like, there's no better option. It's like, it's me or nothing, or self-representation.
And I don't think these lads are up to the task, frankly. So, yeah. On a side note, I do think there should be more 2000 AD games.
Like, it's a great license for like... You would think there would be like a ton of different indie-scale games based on the different properties that they've got. Because they've got so many like, nice-looking, sort of self-contained worlds and stuff they could make out of it.
But, yeah, it hasn't really matured enough.
What was that cover shooter that was quite good? With the blue boy?
Rogue Trooper.
That was solid, I thought.
Yeah, I thought so. Yeah, it was cool. I just think they said there's more potential there.
But, yes. So, Exhibit G. Good morning slash afternoon slash evening crew.
Well, there's no time on Castle Island.
Oh yeah, of course. We've established this previously.
Come on, get it right.
I hereby submit myself to trial. After listening to your Weedraft episode, my partner and I finally committed to something we've been thinking about doing together for a little while and bought a secondhand Wii. A couple of CEX trips later, and we now have a small collection of games going.
Will Judge Matthew look kindly on my purchases? Now Matthew, there are no prices here, which is tough, because that's often part of the GamesCorp mix. So, I think you have to call this on the overall quality of the games combined.
So, we've got Ghost Squad, GoldenEye 007, largely for the split-screen multiplayer, not the duff Daniel Craigness, that's in brackets there. Coro Rimpa, do you know that game?
Yeah, that's the marble rolling game. A game which I described as trying to say Kuala Lumpur with a mouth full of food. I remember that line from NGamer, don't know why.
That's good, that's classic Matthew Castle.
Is it?
We have the ultimate one-two punch of love-hate for Matthew Castle here too, which is we've got Little King's Story and we've got Night's Journey of Dreams.
Oh dear.
We've got Apuna, now we're just making these up, I think.
No, Apuna is a co-EJRPG when you throw balls around.
Is that not just someone saying Epona while eating a sausage roll or something?
That probably was also a joke in NGamer. Actually, Apuna was reviewed by Rich Stanton. I remember this also.
Was it good?
Yeah, I think he gave it mid-80s. I don't think anyone ever played it. I played like a couple of hours of it and thought it wasn't for me.
Okay, good. Laughing at my own Epona joke there. Samba de Amigo, which features Mambo No.
5.
Oh, that was shit, aren't we?
Which features Mambo No. 5 in a maraca duel against Sonic? Oh, God, that's like...
You're not making your case here any easier, mate. We've established how Matthew feels about Sonic. Super Mario Galaxy 2, not the first one because they already had it on Switch, they say.
And finally, Zack and Wiki, the quest for Barbara's treasure. So I hope I survived the hallowed court, but if not, know that I regret nothing. On another note, thank you for producing such high-quality content on such a regular basis and for no cost at all.
I discovered you guys when I was in the throes of COVID and you were into your second or third episode. And the pod has been a highlight of my week ever since. All the best, Tom Lawler.
If you think that sob story is going to get me on board, forget it.
And soon it won't all be free, so we'll have a paid tier on Patreon. So that...
No, seriously, thank you very much for your kind words, and I apologize in advance. What a bitter pill to swallow this would be, because they've taken some of my favourite things and they've combined it with some of my least favourite things.
Yeah, it's quite a little challenge for you to deconstruct.
I really can't win this one.
I think it's slightly tips in their favour, personally.
This is almost like... There's a film where Kevin Spacey gets convicted of a murder and they kind of put him to death, and then the twist is that he actually didn't do it, and it was to show the flaws in the court system. We tricked you into thinking he was guilty, and you've put an innocent man to death, and this is why you shouldn't execute people.
This feels a bit like that, like it's forcing me to either make a terrible decision or let off something. I feel like I've been set up here and I don't like it.
Is this film a sequel to Seven, Matthew? I've never seen it.
The Life and Times of David Gale. That is not a film I expected to be talking about this morning.
I imagine the appetite for watching an old Kevin Spacey film these days is fairly limited, I would say.
Especially the story about a man who makes himself look guilty but is actually a saint, and you're like, oh yeah, can it Spacey? No one wants to hear it.
Yeah, that won't be on Film 4 any time soon, I don't think. Should I read the list out again?
The thing is, Galaxy Little King Story Ghost Squad.
Zack and Wiki.
Zack and Wiki are like four of my favourite Wii games, but I think GoldenEye and Wii is shit. The way they turned it into just Call of Duty, it had none of the magical charm of the original GoldenEye. I thought it was really, really misunderstood, as in they really misunderstood what they were trying to do.
Samudimigo is just plain up broken. Like, regardless of Sonic being in it, it's just the Wii one absolutely sucks. I went to a preview event for that.
That's where I first met Kristonan, actually, and we bonded over terrible Samudimigo.
It's very much the layer of the Wii, just not working, not functional controls. The original was a beloved Dreamcast game, right?
Yeah, but it worked. The Wii one doesn't. It's Gearbox made it.
Terrible game. And the last one, well, Nights. I mean, I've never understood Nights, and any opportunity to cachet that Ujinakeru has to be taken.
He didn't even make this one. No, he was busy making Let's Tap, which you like.
What a minefield. I believe at the start of this email, this was a purchase between him and his wife. Is this not correct?
Just says partner, yes.
Partner? So I'm going to pulp one of them.
Do we know which one?
Probably him. I don't know if his partner had anything to do with writing into Gamescore. Most reasonable people would want their partner to live on, right?
That's the nice thing. That's what you're meant to say.
Watch out, Catherine, is what I would say.
However you actually feel, that's what you're meant to say. So listen, let's split down the middle. Half of your collections are masterpieces.
Half of it's an abomination. One of you gets pulped. But I'll let the other one have the bottle.
It's like ashes.
But tasty.
So for me, because this is important for my Trust pilot reviews, does this count as half alive?
This is half, yeah.
So we've got 4.5 dead. Alright, good stuff.
Sounds like a sitcom.
Yeah, BBC Three energy to that. Exhibit H, hi Chaps, thanks for the podcast. It has given me more Laugh Out Loud moments this past year than any other media, let alone podcasts.
My submission for Gamescore is a double whammy of Stuntman on PS2 and Stuntman Ignition on PS3. Oh, big Jeremy Peel vibes to these purchasers. These purchasers came from a desire to have a driving game based on skill, which wasn't just racing.
I really enjoyed the set piece based driving of these games, which made you feel incredible and still do when you manage to nail a level with no mistakes. Have they aged well? Well, the actual driving mechanics are still great, as you'd expect from Reflections, but the games are still brutally hard to the point where it feels unfair, and I'm not sure some of these films would have got greenlit, but on both counts, I think that was the same case back when they were released.
Personally, I don't think I should go down into the drowning pool of Pikmin's or whatever is this episode's punishment, but then again, I would say that. Cheers, Kurt Lewin. So I always kind of wanted Stuntman on PSD and Matthew.
I think I played a demo. It's really hard, like all of Reflections games were, but I thought it was all right, and I think Stuntman Ignition was like a solid 7 out of 10 THQ kind of follow up a few years later on 360 and PS3. What do you think?
Yeah, I don't know the follow up at all. I did play the demo of the original and absolutely hated it. The idea of like a driving game where the art of it was driving to incredibly exacting standards.
I just never understood what the appeal of that was. Just to sort of enact these not particularly impressive stunts of set pieces. It always absolutely baffled me.
Yeah, I kind of hate this game. I mean, I feel bad about pulping because maybe the sequel tidies it up a bit and is a bit more user friendly. And this isn't shade on reflections.
They made plenty of good stuff. But I thought this was just a little too actively hostile towards the players. Would you like to play Driver?
But it's only that rotten driving test tutorial at the start. Like, no, thank you. So yeah, that's getting pulped.
Okay, I thought the idea of the fake films was quite cool, actually. I thought that that went reasonably well. I agree it was super, super hard.
But no, I don't know. They got sevens and eights for the day.
Yeah, well, I think, yeah, did we actually, did we even buy this game because of its reviews?
It was like a big hype game.
Yeah, but I just, I never got it. I just never got it. It never clicked.
Like the idea of it just seemed so inherently flawed to me. I don't like things which are sort of basically do it by rote. That's a huge turn off for me.
Are you the man playing Golden Ring at the moment, Matthew?
Yeah, but that's the thing. That's why I like this one is because I don't have to play. I've got other opportunities to go elsewhere and lots of different angles of attack.
It's true. You couldn't summon a little crossbow man in Stuntman to help. It was just, you know.
Oh, no. If I could summon a ghost of a stuntman to come and just drive the car for me and I just watch an amazing stunt happen, I would like that game and Kurt wouldn't be dead. But unfortunately, that isn't a feature and he is dead.
Yeah, you had earlier said he was pulp too. So unfortunately, at that point, Kirby Hitman had already pushed the button. So while you were deliberating this, Kurt was already dead, unfortunately.
Yeah, there's no point coming in doing a last minute heartfelt defense when I've already got the bottle in my hand. That makes me feel awkward.
I think that's harsh, personally. I think that there's nothing wrong with the Stunman games. Those are like good win purchases, if you ask me.
I think the judge has made a terrible mistake.
Oh, finally we get a bit of fire from the defense. How are we going to die before we got to this point?
Are you punishing a man for buying a 7 out of 10 game? What's wrong with that? That's fine, isn't it?
Yeah, but I have personal experience with the game and didn't like it.
Okay, fine. It was just so hyped in the moment because it was their first game after Driver 2. I remember back when I was reading the official PlayStation, that was everywhere.
I liked you better when you just took the deaths like a man, so I did it.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. Maybe this new persona doesn't fit me. But I'm like Saul Goodman in that I'm going through my own kind of moral arc, and I sort of flirt with being a better guy but then I realize I can get further ahead by just putting my clients to death and taking my paychecks, so yeah, that's on me.
Exhibit I. Hi, guys. I'll use my last living moments before execution to thank you for so many entertaining episodes of your wonderful podcast.
Having never watched Star Trek before, I decided to go through some of the older series, starting with TNG, through to Deep Space Nine, and have recently finished Voyager. After falling in love with the world of Star Trek, I needed more. The best way to do this, of course, was to buy Raven Software's Star Trek Voyager Elite Force on PS2 from CX for £5.
Of course, I haven't played it yet. This is a 2001, sorry, 2001 PlayStation 2 first-person shooter that probably controls like garbage. I have also been watching the X-Files for the first time.
You can probably see where this is going. I bought the X-Files Resist or Serve also on the PS2. A resny will knock off complete with tank controls and even zombies for good measure.
Both some impressive voice work from the cast of the series. Gillian Anderson and William B. Davis as Scully and The Smoking Man both stand out and are putting in way more effort than the game probably deserves.
In contrast to them, however, the highlight for this game for me is David Duchovny's monotone delivery every line he has given. I think you'll find that's just David Duchovny generally.
Yeah, I mean, that sounds true to the character.
Yeah. He has completely checked out and there were parts I was worried he was actually falling asleep in the recording booth. The £15 that I spent on it was probably worth it for the laughs I got out of that alone.
More recently, I have found myself looking at the Sopranos game at Los Fierdomas on eBay. Get me in the tank before my crimes continue. From Joe Castle.
No relation. Brackets, I fucking love sandwiches, so maybe some distant relation to Matthew, question mark. Well, yeah, lots to think about there.
So you might be killing a family member without knowing you're here, Matthew. I will say, gotta get ahead of this, right? Star Trek Voyager Elite Force is a Raven software game.
It is legit. That is a great first-person shooter. You can play it on GOG these days and the second one as well.
That is a good purchase, if you ask me. Five quid, nothing wrong with that. That's a great shooter from a well-respected developer at a time where it was arguably making some of its best stuff.
So that's good.
Now do X-Files.
Okay, I rented the X-Files with my old mate Donald from Blockbuster. We made several flawed rentals from Blockbuster. We rented this and Kotor.
Guess what? You can't finish Kotor on a weekend. That was a terrible fucking decision.
And the X-Files, we played about an hour of it. We hated it. It was so boring.
Such a boring tie-in. Yes, I had the voice acting, but it was basically just shit Resident Evil. It just wasn't good at all.
Reminded me of playing the Men in Black tie-in, actually. Just not good. So 50-50 on those ones, Matthew.
Bear in mind he hasn't bought the Sopranos and lost yet. What do you think of all this?
That's almost like laying down the gauntlet, isn't it? It's like, put me away or I will kill again. So that gives me pause and makes me think, you know, maybe I should just pull to put him and everyone else out of their misery.
I don't know. Your defense of Star Trek Voyager was so passionate.
Yeah, it's legit. It's legit.
Yeah, I mean, I haven't played it. I couldn't even picture it in my head. I'm assuming you shoot with like a phaser in first person.
Yeah, you should look up it. I mean, it looks like a shooter from the time for sure. But you know, it was like, I think it was on PC first, and then they brought it to PS2 a bit later.
If it's as good as you say it is, like £5 for a genuinely good forgotten little hidden gem on PS2, that's kind of what pre-owned games are about, right?
Yeah.
You're meant to be filling out your collection with the odds and sods that you missed first time around, but that still will hold up. Like the X-Files thing, that's expensive for something that is shit. Yeah, it was like a 5 out of 10 for the time.
You said so eloquently.
It was like a 5 out of 10 for the time, that one.
I mean, really, what we've got here is kind of like that Wii situation again, but unfortunately it's just one person. I can't pulp just half of him, or can I?
Just his arms, you know what I mean?
Interesting. No, I don't, I think that gets weird, because it would be like half a bottle of wine, I wouldn't really know what to do with it.
It'd be like one of those little bottles he used for cooking, you know.
Oh, maybe that is quite cute. No, it'll be fine. I'm gonna let him off on the grounds that I, you made a good case for the Star Trek game.
I'm gonna overlook the X-Files thing, but the lesson from this is just don't touch those Sopranos. If I find out you have bought the Sopranos, you will be pulped. Consider this your final warning.
These are two things I never really got into either, like Star Trek and the X-Files. I like the idea of like going on a little journey with them, and you know, kind of getting into these like 90s TV shows, because you kind of end up realising that modern TV isn't really capable of making good episodic TV like it used to anymore. Not in America anyway.
I have faint memories of there being quite a good Star Trek point and click game, maybe like a meager era of next generation.
I think I know what you mean, yeah. I think you can get that on GOG too.
Yeah, like I think there are good Star Trek games out there. Like if you're Star Trek obsessive, like you can play bad, don't play the film tie, and that was terrible.
Oh, that was bad, yeah. The VR game bridge crew, that's good.
Yeah, that's, you know, that's a fun little kind of, you know, if people were thinking about other pre-owned purchases where they could avoid a pulp in. There are some good Star Trek games that would probably save them. Yeah, next.
I've still got five and a half dead after that one, that's good.
How many lived?
Oh, I don't know, actually, because I can't count based on the letters, so I'll have to tell you at the end, basically. It's still not looking good, I'll be honest.
We've got 18 entries, right?
Yes.
So if we go above nine dead, you're dead?
Yeah, I guess so, yeah. That's a good way of thinking about it. Okay, the stakes have never been lower yet again.
Exhibit J, Honorable, you spell it with a U over there, right? Judge Castle, I come to you to humbly present a series of GBA games I've bought on eBay to feel better about the state of the world in the months of June 2020 and June 2021. All cartridges were, also, all cartridges were assessed to be authentic before and after bidding.
All the prices have been converted to Great British pounds. So, number one, a copy of Advance Wars purchased on June 2nd, 2020 for £21.67. Number two, a copy of Metroid Fusion purchased on June 2nd, 2020 for £19.43.
Number three, a copy of Donkey Kong Country purchased on June 4th, 2020 for £6.35. That's pretty good. Brackets, I originally played the first two DKC games on GBA as a kid and wanted my experience of the third to be in line with the first two.
This version also has a completely new soundtrack by David Wise, which is much better than the original. Number four, a copy of Wario Land 4 purchased on June 18th, 2021 for £26.16. Number five, a copy of Golden Sun, The Lost Age, purchased on June 22nd, 2021 for £23.16.
Brackets, I thought this was the original Golden Sun. When I bit on it, I realised after I won the auction that I would need to track down a cartridge of the original before I could enjoy this game. The only two of these games I have completed are Metroid Fusion and Donkey Kong Country 3, but I promise you I will play them all eventually.
To sweeten the taste of this lot of purchases, I will also add that I recently picked up a used copy of The Back Page approved Deathloop on PS5 for £18, shipping included. Please look kindly upon my purchasers. Thank you for the podcast and your commitment to justice.
With contrition in my heart, Jamie from Chicago. Jamie, go and leave us a review on iTunes so we can get more of your countrymen listening to this podcast. That's enough for self-promotion.
If you give us a five-star review, I won't kill you.
I think that's like a veritable treasure trove of GBA games, Matthew. What do you think?
I would say they're quite expensive. There are cheaper ways of playing them. If you did have a Wii U, Virtual Console GBA on there, you could probably get most of those games for the price of one of those games.
Come on, mate. You'd rather play that on a handheld than a Wii U controller.
I don't know. I quite like the GBA on the Wii U.
I mean, it's a good emulation, but I mean, like, it's the faff of setting up a Wii U when you just want to put a cartridge into a handheld.
Yeah, that is true.
That's a good price for Metroid as well. I'm pretty sure Metroid Fusion is now super pricey to pick up.
Yeah, I think just because there are cheap VC versions, that's the only thing here which is kind of putting me off. Also, and this isn't going to earn me many fans, I'm not an old Donkey Kong Country guy. I'm not really mad about those games.
Secret Rare Hater, Matthew.
Not Secret Rare Hater. I just think they're very overrated, like quite awkward platformers. I didn't like the look of them then, and now I think there's something sort of hideous about those digitized looks.
It's just not for me. I've never really understood the soundtrack love. People go nuts for the soundtrack for these games, and for me it's just like, I do not get it.
And I know that isn't a popular opinion, like David Wise is considered a treasure. But that's only one of many games. They're all good, apart from that one.
I guess for the authentic carts, I can't speak to there being cheaper versions. I like too many of these games, plus you've actually played some of them.
Completing Two is pretty good.
Yeah, let's go for it. No pulp, but two things. Give us a good review, or give us a review.
I will say actually, I've got to establish for the previous guy, for Joe Castle, that I have established a restraining order of you and the Sopranos game in Los Via Domus. So if you come within 100 feet of either of those games, Matthew Castle will pulp you, so just watch out for that.
Yeah, and I believe this email also had a promise that he would get round to playing those other games, and we will hold you to that, because buying that many games and not playing them would be a pulpable offence. Just to be sure, from now on, you will live inside the Great Press until you've played them. I just want to have that, like, motivation factor there.
Well, he'll have to get out while you're putting these guys to death. Was that a thing?
Yeah, I know that's awkward, because you'd have to, like, move your bed and stuff, but, you know, so it goes.
That's good. I really am picturing all of this in my head as well, because I've got such a vivid image of that Great Press, so, like, I can... It's a very strange scene there.
Exhibit K. Hi, chaps. Hope you're both well.
Please may I submit to the Games Court for Judge Castle's deliberation the following. Resident Evil Outbreak File 1 on PS2, £26 via eBay, late 2021. Mitigation.
I have no mitigation other than a puppy like Love and Fealty to tank Control Zero Resi. This one is a nostalgic rebuy. I'd played it in my teens and vaguely remember it being difficult, but I simply had to play it again.
Thanks, guys. Love the pod. Cheers, Joseph King.
Now, I think these have a good reputation, Matthew. These are the games that were online in America, but not in the UK, as I understand it. So I don't know if that changes your mind much.
It's not like you could play it online anyway if you had the American version. But these were like... I think these are considered good rezi games in retrospect, kind of online-y sort of rezi games.
Any thoughts on this one, Matthew?
In my head, these were just the online ones, and what's the point of not being able to play them online? But if you say there was a non-online UK version, which I must admit, I didn't know. That's a lot of money, though.
Are these good?
I think, like, let's see. At the time, got like seven out of ten, basically. But it was like punished for the lack of support of online in Europe.
But I don't know. It was designed to be a co-op multiplayer game for four people. So, you know, there were like five story scenarios in it, and the AI basically subs in if you don't have human players.
Oh, see what's still playing. It still kind of looks how it should look.
Yeah.
We're a big Rezzy supporting podcast. This is a big blind spot for me in terms of Rezzy. But I also can't object to someone being so into Rezzy that they do seek out the more niche corners of it.
Yeah, I'm going to give this a pass. It would be churlish of me to just pulp it with really no good reason.
I do love it when Matthew uses the word churlish to refer to the act of deciding whether someone lives or dies. Like that's funny stuff. So, Exhibit L.
Hello Backpage Pod, it's me again, damp, moist and looking like a bloater from The Witcher 3 after my last game's core entry got me a good dunking from his Honour Judge Castle. My last sin was out of laziness, not wanting to wait an extra week for my eBay copy of Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge to arrive, so buying a second copy to play immediately. This sin, however, is far more sordid.
The sin of lust. Again, my game purchase is not a bad one. The Sims 2 and its pets expansion.
However, my crime comes from the reasoning behind this purchase. You see, I never had any interest or any real intention to actually play the game. It was bought entirely based on the lies I told a girl in school that I really fancied.
I'd overheard her one day talk about The Sims 2 to a friend. So a few days later, I casually mentioned in conversation to her that after school I was going to go home and play the latest pets expansion for it. I did not own the game at all, but I figured a simple white lie could start the ball rolling on what would definitely be the start of a glorious relationship with the girl of my 14-year-old self's dreams.
The plan worked too well, if anything. We traded stories about our virtual Sims families, all mine made up, of course, from the limited knowledge I had of the game. Yeah, it is a little bit, isn't it?
It's like the Netflix series You This. A few weeks later, we'd become good friends talking on and off about the game. Things were going great until one day when she suggested she come round mine and after school someday to see the new house had been boasting about building in the game.
I panicked. On one hand, I was terrified she'd finally discover my lie, but I'd never actually played The Sims and had been making things up all along. But on the other, I was a geeky teenage boy with a girl who actually wanted to come round his house.
How could I say no? I did what any hormone-driven boy my age would do, stole 40 pounds from his mum's purse, Jesus.
Oh my god, this is like, this is absolutely shocking. This is, forget Gamescore, this is actual cool.
I have a question about the, a technicality question on this, Matthew, I'll get to it at the end. But, bite to game and managed to get a cheap pre-owned Sims 2 and an annoyingly full-price Pets expansion. I assume this is a game in Ferrum as well, which just as a place I kind of remember, I think you should be polled really just for the Ferrum factor, but let's carry on anyway.
In two days, I managed to learn the ins and outs of the game, enough to convince her I had actually been playing it and build the house I'd been bragging about for so long. I'm not sure what I was actually expecting to happen when she did come round, for her to take one long look at my lovingly rendered German Shepherd and instantly fall in love with both the dog and me perhaps. Alas, she did not.
Watching someone cluelessly click around on a Sims 2 game is hardly best setting for a romance. Still, months later, I eventually went back to the game and learned to love it for what it is, a fun wacky life simulator, and not what I thought it would be, an instant aphrodisiac for a girl well out of my league. I leave my fate in your hands, Judge Castle.
That's from Danny Mann. I mean, I am glad I read all that out now. It was good.
I will say, though, this obviously happened so long ago, Matthew. Has the Statute of Games Court Limitations not expired on this one? It's like 20 years at this point.
No, I don't think so. The rules are different on Castle Island.
Oh yeah, there's no time, is there? There's no concept of time.
Yeah, so we bet everything happened at once and never.
You're like the Flash in Zack Snyder's Justice League.
It's very confusing.
So yeah, this has happened. This has yet to happen also. Yeah, I mean, it's a great story.
Kind of sinister. I mean, it's sweet, but sinister. I mean, I can't really endorse stealing money from your mum.
I swear the Red Alert 2 story involved getting your mum to buy you something as well. I feel like your mum is the true victim of all your anecdotes.
Yeah, I want to kind of know if there's any consequences from the mum, because if I stole 40 pounds from my mum, she would not forgive me. Like, she would be, like, fucking livid.
Yeah, that would be... I would have been in big time trouble.
Yeah, I never did anything like that. The worst thing I ever did was spend money she gave me to buy a book on, like, a biscuit at school, and she was furious. She screamed at me for that, because I can't imagine taking 40 quid to go buy an expansion for The Sims 2.
Oh my god, it's got really shit Jack and the Beanstalk.
This is just what growing up in, like, a working class gospel was like.
I gave you that money to buy a book and you spent it on this magic biscuit.
Oh dear.
I mean, yeah, like, if I'd stolen that kind of money, the punishment I would have received, I would never have grown up to be the dictator on a mad island. So, you know, that I can't really comprehend. I just think there are too many sinister elements to this story for me to endorse it.
Yeah, it's got like, it's got like horny, straight teenage male stuff. Like, that's just awful, no matter what, you know what I mean?
Like, I have very clear memories of being in junior school and like fibbing about games to friends to try and impress them. Like, I kind of feel some sympathy in terms of like, you're just desperate to impress people with access to things and like, maybe reading games mags and then recycling their opinions as my own of like, oh, I've played that, blah, blah, blah. But even with that in mind, you can't steal from your mum.
That can't be the message of this podcast.
Nah, kill him. I reckon kill him.
And your mum can have the bottle of wine to remember you by.
Yeah, Mrs Mann can take that and enjoy it.
And that's got to be worth £40. I mean, just as a kind of like, creepy, like novelty item, you could probably sell it on some evil version of eBay for lots of money. Dark Web eBay.
On Matthew Castle Island, it's a thing.
I mean, Dark Web is just what the web is on Matthew Castle Island.
Yeah, that's where you can also buy the drowned young men from The Back of Pain.
Megally cursed. Yeah, so there you go. Yeah, you're popped.
There you go. So yeah, I look forward to that bottle hitting the Dark Web eBay with the seller name alno69. That would be wonderful.
Also, write in again and tell us what your mum did after this, because I'm really curious about the consequences of stealing £40 from your mum to buy a Sims expansion. We did it for love. That's not love, though.
Would that story be better if you ended up with, and that girl is now my wife?
Yeah, that's the thing. It kind of needed that level of payoff in order to forgive the action, I think. But it didn't.
We met over a huge lie. It's quite a nice origin story.
If anything, I just wish you had someone in your life to explain to you this girl isn't really interested in you. That's what you really needed here, not the Sims 2 expansion. If you're working this hard, it's not worth it.
It's not going to happen. Just try again in four years when you're a bit more of a well-rounded human, not when you're 14.
She's just using you for your virtual Great Dane.
Okay, next up. This one's a lot shorter. Watch Your Honey Bunches.
Oh, no, this is the one that's on email, Matthew. I have to get you to read this email. This is Exhibit M.
This is from Hyperplay RPG via email. Firstly, thank you for hours of aural pleasure. That's A-U, aural, very good.
Pleasure monetizing this thing about time. I, for one, will be subscribing to your weekly offering. That's good.
Coming April 1st. It's not a joke. That's when the Patreon will launch.
That isn't in his email. That's what you're saying.
Yeah, it is. It's a bad way to reveal the date, isn't it? For somebody who works in the PR professionally.
I promise you my work at Frontier is a lot better than that. I promise you.
I love the idea that they announce the export so accidentally before coming on stage.
GameScore. Please may Matthew hand down a gravelly gavel-based judgement on the merits or lack thereof of buying Super Famicom games just for the boxes, manuals and Oh My Giddy Gumdrops maps example. And then they submit a picture of a game called Lenus.
It looks like Enus on the box. I won't be playing Lenus despite my over-bloated pretensions of Panji RPG expertry. It cost £11.50, delivered from You-Know-Where eBay.
So kind of like an obscure SNES RPG there, Matthew.
Paladin's Quest in the West.
Oh really? A waste of diminishing funds, but these boxes give me the warm fuzzies when I look at them. And there is quite a beautiful array of Japanese copies of games there, including Treasure Hunter G and Gun Hazard, Wonder Project, Star Ocean.
The original Live Alive.
Yep, that's cool. Final Fantasy V there as well. So those are some nice looking boxes.
I mythically saw that one. And look here, here being below, if it's good enough, the legendary Will Overton, we're all golden, right? So it attaches a tweet from Will that has a bunch of the same games in that image.
Eddie Road, as much as I respect Judge Castle, I don't need his validation, though let's face it, it would be nice and reside just above the birth of my two sons and just below kissing Iggy Pop's bleeding head of the Royal Albert Hall. I think my point is, I'm going to keep spunking cash on these long little rectangular boxes of delight. Love you both and hope this dribble is at least good enough for getting you over the Games Court threshold.
There's a load of other stuff there, Matthew, but I think we're done with the Games Court element. So what do you think of this? I think it's fine to buy a Japanese copy of the game for this price from the box art.
It's quite nice. What do you think?
Game purchase as cosmetic thing for the map and the art and the look of the thing. I get that. I bought some Famicom games from Super Potato when I went over on a press trip.
It's kind of a rite of passage. Those boxes are just so much more beautiful than ours. What we had, yeah, I'm kind of on board with it.
I just saw actually on this email was a PS where he says he doesn't like the sandwich chat. Now, that is...
Oh, I missed that.
That's a risky move, considering your life is in our hands.
Yeah, that is like dangerous, I would say.
But let's keep it to the games. Quoting Will Overton, knowing that, correctly, you would never pulp your heroes. That's what they say.
And he's right. But this isn't Will Overton writing the email, I'm assuming. Yeah, I think I'm actually going to let this go.
Don't think... If it is Paladin's Quest, I think it's Paladin's Quest. I don't think that's meant to be much cop.
But, like you said, he's not even going to play it. Pretty brazen, but he likes the box. Yeah, this is fine.
Not guilty.
Okay, alright, so we're six and a half dead. I just read that PS actually. It was like, basically, I always skip the first ten minutes of the podcast.
I was like, oh, cheers.
Because you talk about sandwiches. Now, normally I would pop someone instantly for that, but I'm going to be the bigger judge.
The largest judge available.
Two large judges play Elden Ring.
So next up, I will say, when people send in images, it's really annoying because the podcast is in audio form, so the people at home can't see them. So I will say that there's like limits to that format. I much prefer the text ones.
Oh, I love it when the defense chastises the clients for supplying more physical evidence to help make their case. It's really good. It's like, oh, I've got this thing here that proves I was in the bar on the night of the murder.
And they're like, oh, yeah, but I don't like visual aids. I say, yeah, but this is the thing which proves that I'm innocent, sir? He's like, no, no, no, don't worry.
Just pop in the press.
Terrible.
Terrible lawyer.
I am committed to justice in any form it takes. So, OK, this is from Andy Dewald for Exhibit N. This is, of course, about the DS game right here.
Attached is a picture of Oktoberfest, the official game on Nintendo DS, available in five languages. And, like, I mean, I will post an image of this on Twitter because it is genuinely funny. There's a picture of a pretzel, an accordion, beer, and a woman in what I would say is a very stereotypical, kind of like, you know, a kind of German beer-themed outfit.
Just quite embarrassing. And so when you look up the game, it looks quite dodge, as you'd expect, kind of like Flash game sort of material. But there's more text here, which is quite fun.
All I can say in my own defense is I have a terrible sense of humor, so when I saw this game randomly pop up as I was browsing through DS games, I might have missed originally any way to get this one, if only just to have it in my collection as something to laugh at. A bit like when I discovered the Yaku-ken special on the Sega Saturn, which is basically a strip yanking game, brackets Rock Paper Scissors. Not because of the nudity, specifically, yeah right, but really because I'm a huge Sega Saturn fan and the game is incredibly dumb and ridiculous.
I read Playboy for the article.
So incredibly dumb and ridiculous, I felt my Saturn collection would never be complete without it. It's true that this was like a major component of what was going on on Saturn. Come to think of it, if I'm not getting killed for Oktoberfest, the Yaku-ken special might do me in.
Anyway, hope it's all over quick. That's quite a fun one, Matthew. Oktoberfest, the game, thoughts?
I've never even heard of it. Didn't cross paths with this when I was on NGamer.
Wasn't a cover on a particularly bad month then.
No, I'll imagine. Just based on the cover, it looks quite cursed. I don't know if I want a licence tie-in for just the concept of Oktoberfest.
I'm not sure if it's something I need to kind of experience in virtual form. I just don't think making a game about the pleasure of a drink just doesn't make any sense to me. There's no way a game could tap into what any drink is like.
That's really bad news. So is this Rock Paper Scissors one also part of the pitch?
Yeah, I think it has to go as one because there's basically a Saturn.
The thing is, it's got these really nice wholesome women on the back.
Right.
They just all look like kind aunts. It's quite sweet. The box is quite nice.
The box has got a very nice energy to it. It doesn't say this is going to be smutty.
I think it's like a mobile game that was ported to DS or something like that, from what I can discover.
It almost passes the same test as the last one, of just like, oh, here's an interesting box to have in your collection.
It is a rock paper scissors game where ladies take their clothes off.
There is that. I am basing this too much on the box.
Remember, this is not a horny podcast, Matthew.
This is not horny. I mean, Matthew Castle Island is very puritanical.
Yeah, they love the MCU because no one ever had sex in the MCU.
Oh, yeah. That October dust fest looks... It looks like semi-cursed enough to be worth pulping.
But, you know, if the rock paper scissors game goes missing from core evidence, who can say what happened to it? Wario probably took it. Tea here, probably.
Yeah, probably, yeah.
When anything dodgy happens here, I just blame it on Wario.
That's how justice really works here.
Institutional anti-Wario sentiment. Okay, that's seven and a half dead, so as a reminder, nine is what it takes to... for someone to die.
I'd love it if the half pushes it over.
What, another half? Yeah. It's like, oh, sorry, your legs have got to go.
All right. I'm feeling pretty good about this one. Oh, good afternoon, Judge Castle.
My submission for game score is Resident Evil 5. I brought a PS3 when the PS4 was just out and the prices were dropping, grabbed some secondhand games with it as well. So this would have been in 2013 slash 2014.
One of these was Resident Evil 5. I don't know the exact price, but I think it was around £7. I've never so much as opened the case.
Given how it's generally regarded now, I'm not sure if my never playing it works in my defense or not. I respectfully await judgment. Keep up the great work on the pod, unless you're sentenced to a horrible death, in which case I won't be here to enjoy it, so feel free to let it go off the rails.
Thanks, Ian. So, Resident Evil 5 Matthew. We've established on a previous episode that I like this game, while acknowledging it has some problematic elements.
I always awkwardly talk around that, but people know what I'm talking about when I say that.
The eggs, right? So many egg throwing.
Just Chris Redfield's biceps are just unrealistic. That's an unrealistic body standard for men.
Need egg.
Give me an egg. So, yeah, Resident Evil 5 Matthew on PS3.
I mean, so again, I'm going to use the word churlish. The churlish part of me thinks, well, you're emotionally attached to this and it would be funny to undermine defense's confidence by pressing someone for this particular game. Like if I'm playing mind games with you.
But that hinges on the idea that I see you as the person who is saving a lot of these people, which we've established just isn't true. That just isn't your relationship with your clients. That takes that off the table.
I like all of these over-the-shoulder Resi games to varying degrees. I think we've celebrated this too much on the podcast to execute someone for it.
Agreed. You will live, Ian.
You will live on. So, seven and a half dead. We're nearing the end here.
Exhibit P. Good afternoon. Hang on a minute.
Have I just copied and pasted the same one twice? I have. Matthew, there's actually only 17 here.
Which actually makes the stakes higher for me. Oh no, that's terrible. Let's pretend that never happened.
After having discovered the podcast back in April last year and consequently binging all the episodes until I was up to date brackets the first time I had a week to wait for the next episode was genuinely disappointing, a testament to the great content you guys make. I found myself going down a rabbit hole of DS games. One of the genuine joys I received from this was rediscovering Hotel Dusk, Room 215, which I previously owned back in 2007 and played during the summer before my second year of uni.
I never actually finished it back then and for some unknown reason, I left my DS at home while I went back to study. There it remained for a couple of years until a new game came out that sparked my interest in the console again. He couldn't remember what that game was.
So the next time I was home, I went to dig it out. To my horror, I found out my mum had given my DS and games to charity since I wasn't using them anymore. This was something I had purchased, by the way, not a gift, and thus ended my relationship with the console for good.
I was going to say, that's ending my relationship with my mum.
I kind of understand. I've never let her forgive that to this day, and so it brought me great childish joy that when going down this rabbit hole, I was actually staying with her for a few months and could show her some of the things I had to rebuy. I'm clearly trying to delay my sentencing, so I'll no longer insult the honorable Mr. Justice Castle and submit my evidence for judging.
Didn't get their name there, Matthew. Anonymous. They'll just be John Doe here.
None of the wine bottles have got labels, so it's fine.
This is like the easiest one, yeah, I think, because it's Hotel Daska game you like. They've played it before. The only reason they lost it is because it was like, you know, the mum gave it away to charity.
What's your take on this one?
I mean, that was careless to allow that situation to come to be by leaving it at home.
Yeah, that is true.
Do we do this as just a moral lesson for the people of Matthew Castle Island about taking care of your possessions?
I mean, you know, hey, it would add a bit of drama. What can I say?
It would add a bit of drama, but at the same time, I can't pulp something for Hotel Daska. There's not like a, there isn't really a flip side to this one. It's not like Hotel Daska and the Sonic RPG or whatever.
To bring up a previous example.
You know, if that was it, then it'd be like, then we got a half and half again. No, you were saved by the press. You know, you found Judge Castle's weak spot.
Yeah, if it was Hotel Daska and like, you know, your Kai Watch 3 or something, then it might be a bit trickier. But exhibit, ah, hi guys. I went through my eBay purchases and I think I've got two that are interesting artifacts and are likely to get me thrown in a pit.
If only that was the punishment. Unfortunately, it's not. It's much worse than that.
I wonder how many people would have sent things in if they knew that they were going to get pulped if they failed.
That's the question, Matthew. Does the game get pulped with them? Like, do the purchases go into?
I mean, that might be unpleasant for the drink, for the wine.
Yeah, I mean, human flesh and bone, not necessarily.
You've got to ignore that. It gets turned into a very fine wine.
It's like, oh, I've got a bit of X-Files resist or serve in my...
I'll tell you what, all the games, they go in the pot with arms. That's what's inside the pot with arms. He's just full of shit pre-owned games.
That's what happens if you kill one in Elden Ring. Just spills out terrible old copies of Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.
It's like, wow, Flicky's Island is in here.
That's weird.
Very strange.
Explain that in a 10-hour lore video.
OK, so, hi guys. I went through my lockdown eBay purchases. Here's two that are interesting.
First up is Star Trek Starship Creator Warp 2 for £4.99, a very graphically basic game where you customise a Starfleet vessel, crew them up with even the most minor characters from the show some movies and send them off on various missions.
What was the subtitle for that one?
Starship Creator Warp 2.
Oh, I thought you said Star Trek Creator Warp. I was like, what the fuck is that? A game where you make a wharf?
That sounds amazing.
That's got a bit of the old sort of Denny's New Warriors subtitle energy to it. Yeah, amazing. This is mostly represented with text and a 2D map, although the ships themselves can be displayed as 3D models and even imported into Star Trek Deep Space Nine Dominion Wars.
I'm not sure I call it a good game, but it will sort of run on Windows 10 if you install an ancient version of QuickTime. If you would install an ancient version of QuickTime, how cursed. And I had fun streaming it with some friends and debating what missiles to put on a Constitution class.
Samuel might be interested to know that some of the mission text was done by comics writer Peter David. Yeah, he's a very talented comics writer. Second is DS launch title Project Rub, also 499, which I think one of you or a guest actually mentioned in passing on a recent episode.
All I remembered about it was the surprisingly horny box art and title. Still better than the American name Feel the Magic X Y slash X X. So I bought it on a whim.
I was surprised to find that it was A, made by Sonic Team, and B, far more surreal than horny. The humor and art style mostly make up for it being a collection of fairly standard swipe the screen and blow into the microphone early DS minigames. I was fairly certain that ordering it was signing my own games called Death Warrant, but having played it for 90 minutes or so, I think it's actually defensible.
NGC gave it 4 out of 5, and it did seemingly did well enough to get a sequel. If that doesn't persuade you, I'd just like to add that the same old DS game kick has also resulted in my picking up a copy of Hotel Dusk. I'd love to live to play it.
How many copies of this game have you sold in this podcast, Matthew? Thanks, Alastair. That's with ad on Discord.
We've got three games there, Matthew. Hotel Dusk, Project Rub and a Star Trek game I've never heard of.
Well, let's remove Hotel Dusk from the equation, because I don't really think that's what's properly on trial here.
So we've come back to a situation where there's one questionable thing and one... Well, I don't know if any of these are slam dunks, but I'm going to have to Google that Star Trek game.
I don't really know the Star Trek game. It sounds boring.
It was made by Simon and Schuster Interactive. That's like buying a game that Encarta made.
Who's your favourite game developer? Dawling Kinsley, of course.
Penguin Random House.
You led a sheltered childhood.
It's got a bit of the old Simpsons virtual Springfield energy to it. You might see it in the educational section, maybe.
Well, there's that. The thing is with Project Rob, that game actually has a really good Sega energy and it's like a pure Sega energy. It's the mad arcade bit of Sega, which doesn't get like indulged massively outside of Monkey Ball, which is quite stale now, I think.
You know, back then it's kind of hectic and silly and it looks a bit salacious, but it's actually just daft. I actually think that's the winner of the... well, hotel dusk aside, I think Project Rob's actually an interesting curio that is worth having.
It's the kind of thing you could crack out in the future because it is quite pick up and play and strange. And you might want to show someone a whim of like, you know, you may think DS was all brain training and all that, but actually look, there was this kind of stuff too and it was quite odd. I feel like I want to save them from the pulping because of that, even though that Star Trek thing sounded dire.
I will say I've looked up that Star Trek thing. Maximum PC listed it as one of its lemons of the year for 2000, saying it's worse than a hangover from drinking too much Romulan ale.
I mean, that is severe. Again, we've only got one person here, haven't we? We've only got...
It's not like I can put half of them in there. Wait, didn't he say the name of a comic book writer?
Yeah, Peter David.
We could put him in.
That's a bit unfair. That guy is like... He would have just done this as a freelancer, Simon.
He didn't commission the game.
Yeah, but he's more involved... If anyone is involved with the Star Trek bit of this specifically, it's him.
Yeah, but I don't think it's the Star Trek bit that's like the bad bit. I think it's just the game itself. It got 45% on game rankings.
Peter David's written like... He's a writer of X Factor, very good X-Men comic, and has some solid Spider-Man books. He wrote the book Fallen Angel, which is really good for IDW.
I can't let Peter David go in there, Matthew.
Oh man, save it for comic book court.
Is that also Matthew Castle presiding? Or your dad? Your dad comes for that one?
Yeah, my dad sits there and kind of pats me on the back and gives me moral support and agrees with me. Basil Pesto Sr. I mean, the thing is though, we can't actually defer to comic book court because he would already be pulped and you can't put a bottle of wine on trial.
So this guy is pulped then, yeah?
No, this guy isn't pulped. I really wanted to pulp the comic book writer, but you're right, it wouldn't be fair.
No, I don't think so. Okay, seven and a half. Then I think then, the worst that can go for me at this point, because eight and a half is technically half here.
So basically 50% is as bad as it can get for me, Matthew, because we've reached the final one here. So it's gone okay in the second half here. This is quite a good one to finish, actually, because it's a fucking load of DS games in a row.
This is from Jonathan, our exhibit. I think we're on? I've got the letters mixed up with the numbers.
This is just the last one, okay? Then the podcast is basically over. Nintendo DS Lite White, 1999.
It was filthy, but upon cleaning it, it's actually in mint condition, aside from the cursed, stained, covered pink case that came in in a Spanish learning game that was still in empty. Jesus, what an artifact that is. The games, in order of price paid, Cookie and Cream, £5.99.
Hotel Dusk, Room 215, £9.99. Dragon Quest IX, £13.99. Lost in Blue, £14.00.
Another Code, Two Memories, £14.99. The Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass, £17.99. Last Window, The Secret of Cape West, £34.99.
Time Hollow, £59.99.
Oh shit, Time Hollow, my god.
Pokémon Platinum version, £80.00. Brackets, I'm not proud of this. I would like to point out that the games were all in immaculate condition, with all the manuals included.
I'm sure the judging will be fair and reasonable, and accept in advance the sentencing handing and a down upon me. Many thanks, Jonathan Stave-Rothy on Discord. PS, I did finally complete Hotel Dusk, but the other games have remained unplayed in my cupboard.
Uh-oh.
There's a lot of wasted games, and expensive.
Thoughts, Matthew? I feel like the Pokémon Platinum and Time Hollow one-two punch there.
I like Time Hollow a lot, and I have looked at that, because I don't actually have a copy of that anymore, because we only had a review card of it. I've looked that up myself, and I'm always like, God damn it, it's so expensive now to buy. It's not like Phoenix Wright amazing.
It's only a 7 out of 10, I think I gave it in NGamer. But I do like it, a little time travel visual novel puzzle adventure thing. There's so many good games in the mix.
That is so expensive for Pokémon Platinum.
That is what it costs, though.
I know, but just don't buy it. Joking aside, when we push aside all the bullshit, isn't that fundamentally what Gamescourt is about? It's about whether we think the quality of the thing is worth its overinflated price now.
Basically, yeah. I mean, what is this episode format about if it's not for drowning young men who bought Pokémon games?
That's the superficial read on it. But it's about pulping young men.
I will say in a slight defence, right? Pokémon Platinum is considered the definitive version of that generation of those games. And the differences they made to it weren't incorporated into the recent Diamond and Pearl re-dos they did.
So it is kind of a singular thing. There's not really another way to sort of play it or enjoy it. So, I don't know, that's maybe a weak source of defence to you, Matthew, but I will point out that was probably the logic to buying it, but 80 quid is a lot of money.
The cover monster on Pokémon Platinum is so shit.
That's like a kind of wormy thing, right?
It looks like it's got an exposed rib cage, I think. Isn't it got lots of spokes coming off it?
It's no Bulbasaur. I'll say that.
Like, I like pretty much all of those games. I just don't care for Pokémon Platinum, because I don't really care for Pokémon.
What Lost and Blew is one we've not talked about? What's all that about?
Almost a precursor to the survival games, which are now massive. It's almost like a slightly rougher Don't Starve. You're washed up on a desert island.
I think there's a hunger and sleep meter, that kind of stuff, but it was sort of doing that before loads of other people were doing that, and it was about getting a little foothold and pushing deeper into the island. Lost and Blew, they're okay. They're a little rough around the edges, but they're kind of interesting.
That's one of the more interesting games in the mix. That and Time Hollow. Those are good pre-owned games, because everyone knows your Zelda is good or whatever, but it's the seven out of tens that we're interested in.
That isn't heinous. Read through your list again.
Okay, Cookie and Cream, $5.99.
Oh, fuck, whatever the fuck that is. I think I do know what that is.
Isn't it like, it's not terrible, right? Isn't it like a platformer or something?
That was definitely in a review to round up in NGamer.
Let's see, kind of like sixes out of ten, the adventures of Cookie and Cream. It started as a PS2 game, a from-software game, Matthew. Does that change your mind on it at all?
It got basically like sixes and a seven from Eurogamer on DS.
No, unfortunately, doing our due diligence, I just looked at the cover art and saw what the characters looked like. Just terrible, terrible character designs.
It's bumpy, it's no Elden Ring, let's put it that way. So we've got Cookie and Cream, £5.99. Hotel Dust.
No, that's dumb, that's in the bin.
Okay, so we've got Hotel Dust, room 215, £9.99. Dragon Quest IX, £13.99. Lost in Blue, £14.00.
Another Code Two Memories, £14.99. The Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass.
Another Code Two Memories, that's what I wrote when I went to interview, I had to do a timed review and that's what I reviewed in my NGamer interview.
Perfect, the kind of personal win bullshit that sways this court one way or the other, that's good. Phantom Hourglass, £17.99. Last Window, £34.99.
Time Hollow, £59.95. Pokémon Platinum, £80. The DS Lite was £19.99, which is pretty good.
That is so expensive for the Pokémon Platinum. I can't really get over that.
This is the one you're really going back and forth on. You're struggling with this one, I can tell.
Well, because it's got heat. I think there's just too many games in there. They've somehow found...
He bought so many good games that he's managed to counteract the... What I think is... But I wouldn't spend £80...
Oh no, £80 for Pokémon Platinum, I think that's mad. And people may say, well, that's what it's worth now. It's like...
It isn't though. It isn't actually worth that, you know? Just because the people have convinced themselves it is.
Like, the people are wrong. That is wrong. I should press it, but I'm not going to.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I am going to put Pokémon Platinum in the press.
Okay, not in the pot. Not the little pot man.
He doesn't get one. No, I wouldn't wish that on him. He doesn't need to have that in him.
Okay, so does that mean, does it count as a win for me or not?
That counts as a win. I mean, like it would be like a 0.1 of a loss and it doesn't, the numbers don't make any sense.
Okay, so we've got seven and a half dead. I actually do have one more here, Matthew, I forgot about. So this is technically the final one.
Love the podcast. This is from Isaac Gallagher. I love the podcast.
Figured I would send on my recent eBay purchase a 3DS XL Blue for 73 pounds with the recent announcement of Nintendo closing down the eShop. I picked this up to future proof myself. I think this is an astute purchase currently.
I should not admit this in front of Judge Castle, but I will be jailbreaking the hell out of it. Thank you. Thank you for all you do.
I'm a judge.
Looking forward to the Patreon coming soon. Cheers. I think simply three coins is reasonable.
I think the 3DS prices went out of control during the pandemic, Matthew, as all things did. So I don't think that's too bad. What do you make of that one?
Yeah, that sounds decent. It's a smart move getting one now so that you can buy all the 3DS games legally. You scoundrel.
I must admit, I'm not mad about the XL, the 3DS XL itself. I would probably take the regular 3DS over it. I'd go for a new 3DS if I can, but the XL itself, the biggest screen, yes, but everything gets blown out a bit and these games were a little rough to begin with.
They look quite rough, blown up, I think. I was never big into it. But that's a good price for a console which has got so much good stuff.
It's a gateway to a load of amazing stuff. Come on, we're not pulping that.
OK, fair enough. In which case...
You couldn't pulp the 3DS XL because it's so fucking big and unwieldy. You couldn't actually get it in the great press.
I've got a, incidentally, I think I've got a 2DS, a new 2DS XL or something these days, and that's a nice late hardware revision by Nintendo. OK, good. In which case, seven and a half are dead, Matthew, and the rest are still alive.
Another victory for the law firm of Samuel, Samuel and Samuels.
Seven and a half dead, that's a victory for you, is it?
Yeah, I think so, yeah. We've drafted the template to go out to the deceased family and the packaging for the wine as well, that's been arranged.
I think you should have to have those seven and a half bottles of wine on a shelf in your office to see if you can look at them and know what you did.
That's good, yeah. Well, that's good, because that makes me look classy, you know, because it's like Merlot and like a Malbec and a Ryoko.
Unlabeled, seven and a half unlabeled ambiguous bottles. People are like, oh, classy rather than sinister.
On Matthew Castle Island in my law shack, that counts as classy, so I think that's okay. So, yeah, victory for me. So Matthew, we now travel to Samuel Roberts Peninsula to put you on trial.
I have no idea what you've got to present here, but you said I want to put myself on trial this time. To give people the context of what it's like here.
Is this part of Matthew Castle Island?
No, this is like a separate island territory. It's next to Marlon Brando's Island. It's like, you know, it's kind of like a sort of like, just a kind of rogue state basically.
The entire place has been catamaried. So we're all living in a like hellish ball world where shit is stuck together. It's chaos trying to get here, trying to land at an airport.
It's just really hard because the whole, the airport is kind of like on the other side of the big ball thing. So that's tough for you coming in here. So, okay, so are you ready for who's in the courtroom, Matthew?
Please. Yeah, okay, so the pot man from Elden Ring is actually here.
He's gotten stuck outside the courtroom though, actually. Can someone go hit him in the ass with the greatsword? Cheers.
Thank you for that. We've got Walloweejee as a thematically appropriate counterpoint to Wario and Matthew Castle Island. Larry Butz from Phoenix Wright is doing community service here.
He sort of just helps around the courtroom. Johnny Sasaki from Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots, is at the back of the courtroom shitting in a barrel. And the elected governor here is Gene from God Hand.
Nice. I was going to say this is quite a classy island, but then I forgot that your courtroom literally has a man shitting in a barrel. So I take that back.
Yeah, that's tough on this kind of hellish Katamari world.
I'm actually feeling pretty good about Matthew Castle Island as I look around your courtroom.
The living standards are maybe quite low here since the Katamari disaster happened.
Because of the whole we're all in a ball. You can try and brush that under the carpet as much as you want.
It's suboptimal, I'll be honest. So the punishment, if you are found guilty, Matthew, you will have to complete Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy with a single life.
If you fail, you then have to complete the game again with a single life. For each failure to do this, it stacks. So you may spend the rest of your life doing this basically, playing Crash Bandicoot, the remaster, the trilogy, trying to beat it with a single life.
Any thoughts on that?
I would rather be pulped.
Well, we don't have any kind of like, pulp function here.
Why have you created yourself such an unpleasant place to live? I made a place where I was the king and could make it in my own image, and it's amazing. You've doomed yourself to like a horrible ball with it.
Well, no, because before the Katamari thing happened, this was a land of great culture and like, and art. And like, it was a beautiful, wonderful place to live with high living standards, but the Katamari thing just spelled disaster, really. And we're all kind of reeling from it.
I'm sorry. Yeah, it's tough. It's tough.
You know, like it's really hard to leave here as well. There's like, you know, you need a lot of permits to get like unstuck from the ball basically and be allowed to leave. So that's tough.
So Matthew, why don't you run me through your exhibits?
I bought an Xbox copy of Knights of the Old Republic 2 for £10. This was when I believe Knights of the Old Republic 2 came to Back Compat or I became aware that it was Back Compat on Xbox. I hope it's not in Game Pass.
No, it's not.
Phew. I haven't played it. It's been sitting on my dining room table for about six months now and I just felt I should play it because it kept coming up in the podcast and I don't have any wisdom to share on it and so I figured I'd give it a go to be able to have a better chat next time it came up.
Yeah, I kind of thought... So the Star Wars episode is kind of on hold till I feel like we're in the right place for it because it'll be a monster, that one, and I think more research needs to be done. For context, for the listeners, in the courtroom, basically, Johnny stopped shitting when Matthew said, he said, Cotor 2, but then he started shitting again, like, more loudly when you said you hadn't played it, so that's like a thing that everyone's having to deal with in the courtroom at the moment.
Oh, great.
It's bad in that barrel, man. Like, it's tough in there.
It's bad in that barrel. That is an understatement of the year.
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to forgive this one. I think that £10 is a good price for this, for an Xbox copy. I can see the appeal of playing on Xbox as well.
You can get a PC copy and a mobile copy quite easily, but there's just something about having the original, I think. That is a beautiful box art as well on that game. So you are forgiven, sir.
What's exhibit B?
It's a £3 copy of Sherlock Holmes' Mystery of the Mummy for DS.
Okay, so you've made a mistake here, which is you've established previously that there's only one good Sherlock Holmes game, and it is the Crimes and Punishment one. So you, again, like that guy in the case from earlier, you, in a Cloud Atlas style way, steal your own fate years ago when you made that statement, and now you must pay the price. Do you have anything to say in your defence?
We've got different law systems.
Well, have you got anything to say in your defence for this one, Matthew?
I haven't played it. I don't know if it's any good. Barrett Lee or Metacritic, it's not.
I'm going to say this was just a pure vanity purchase, because I thought, like, I missed the Nintendo, I missed the detective game. Wouldn't it be neat if I had this detective game on a DS as a talking point? It was only £3.
It's a Frogwares game. It was made by Frogwares, who would eventually go on to make a good Sherlock Holmes. But there's absolutely nothing to suggest that this isn't a Sherlock Holmes.
I see. I'd say that you've let your obsession with personal branding get the better of you here, thinking that you're somehow obliged to buy a DS Sherlock Holmes game. That's like a form of madness, I think.
But yeah, I think I'm going to have to call you guilty here, so you're one all, Matthew. You're like 50-50 now on whether you'll be playing Crash Bandicoot for the rest of your life. So how many exhibits do you have, by the way?
Only six.
Okay, interesting. So let's get to the next one. Exhibit C.
This was a £10 copy of Max Payne 3 on 360, which I bought after they announced all the Max Payne games were back on pat on Xbox One, which was not that long ago. I got excited and went out and bought it. So excited that I forgot I already owned it.
Oh no!
So I now have two copies of Max Payne 3.
This is interesting, actually, because I had bought this on 360 Digital Store years ago and never expected it to go back on pat. So when it did, basically my Xbox One could just suddenly download it and I thought that's really cool. I like the way that happens.
I would like to litigate this game in more depth at some point. I imagine it's going to come up in Best Games of 2012. At least in honourable mentions.
But I am fond of elements of it. It's quite frustrating, I think, as a shooter. But it's beautifully made, beautiful environments, as with all Rockstar games.
It has some quite nice feeling shooting. It manages to do both cover and bullet time quite well.
I think it misses the point of the tone, and it loses a lot of the charm of what made Max Payne great. It's what I'd say if I was the judge. But I'm not.
So yeah, it's good, isn't it?
I think you could argue that the tone of Max Payne probably needed to change when it was out of Remedy's hands. It probably needed to go in this slightly different direction, that Tony Scott-esque direction. You do miss the fun self-awareness, but I like some of the writing in this game.
I think it's quite fun, beautifully presented. Some people said at the time it was similar to Cana Lynch, but I think this was a classier join than that, personally.
It inspired the absolutely classic email that Andy Kelly famously got. A really angry bit of reader feedback about how much he hated Andy Kelly's Max Payne review. If you look up on Twitter, Ultra Brilliant and Max Payne, you'll probably find a picture of it.
It's really very, very funny stuff.
Yeah, it was quite divisive game, this, and I don't think it's held as a classic in retrospect. The fact that you own it twice, though, means that you're guilty on this one, I'm afraid.
Right, okay, I wouldn't let that make sense. I wouldn't let that slide in my court, so I actually have, like, I kind of respect you for that. And respect is in quite short supply on this hellish orb world.
Yeah, this court is, like, you know, has been excited about an opportunity to use your own logic against you, and so here we are where we can do that, so that's good.
I'm just like, man, how the other half live, this is terrible, what a terrible place.
Yeah, and the back of the courtroom right now as well, the kind of, like, Katamari ball logic has just caught up with the barrel, so, like, a floating barrel of shit with a man inside is now, like, a thing we have to contend with, so just going to get, like, Waluigi's try and deal with that.
Oh, man, this is why you have bailiffs, man.
Well, like, Gene from God Hand might also get involved, but it's tough, there's a lot of red tape to go through at the moment with all this. Tough times. OK, so next, Exhibit D, Matthew, hit me up.
I bought the original Nier, as in not the remake or not Automata, for £12 for Xbox 360, because again, it had gone back and back in the last big dose of back and back games. I think I've talked about this podcast before, reviewing this and feeling like I maybe got it a little bit wrong or I kind of underscored it a bit or didn't kind of completely click with it. I'm not saying it was like ahead of its time or anything, but it was maybe deserving of better.
And the copy I played originally was a review copy, so I don't have access to it anymore, which is why I bought a pre-owned copy.
Yep, so this court is lenient on Xbox Back Compat. We think that's a good program. We think Nia is a good purchase.
It was front and center of our game review scores. We got wrong episode. Nia Automata is one of my favorite games the past 10 years.
You could argue I had an active role in stopping it from succeeding and therefore making that sequel happen, so that's on me. You are not guilty, sir, of this crime. So you're two all now.
That's good. How much of it did you play, by the way?
The pre-owned copy?
Yeah.
I haven't played it yet.
Oh, we've already passed the verdict, though, so it's too late now.
Yeah, that's tough. Okay, so what's your exhibit E, Matthew?
Actually, I can't remember when this became Back Compact, but I only became aware of it being Back Compact recently, so I re-bought it. The original Xbox copy of Red Dead Revolver.
Wow, that's cool. I quite like that. What were you thinking here, then?
Have you played it?
Yeah, I did play it. I played it on PS2 back in the day and had quite fond memories of it. It was a bit more sort of arcadian.
It was obviously like linear levels. It was a lot more sort of self-contained back then. I'm really very different energy to what followed.
But it's got stuff I like, like shoot out in the little town and some like quirky boss characters. I've not played it all the way through. I have played a few levels of it.
So like I put it in the thing to make sure it worked basically. I think this is quite a fun kind of curio.
Yeah, this is a good win purchase. The court appreciates seeing Xbox era rockstar games coming to back compat. Like Manhunt, for example.
It's nice to see those future proofed in another platform. That's good. £10 is perfectly fine for a win purchase.
You are not guilty. So what's that? 3-2?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. So you can't actually lose here. If it's 50-50, you might have to complete like one Crash Bandicoot with one life, but let's see how it goes for this final one.
This is an interesting one. I bought a Wii U, but I only bought the base of a Wii U. No cables and no controller.
I just bought the base. Because I have lost my Wii U. I cannot find it.
Catherine is convinced, and this is like really going to hurt my Nintendo cred, that I traded it in to get a PlayStation 4 Pro. And the more she says it, the more I'm like, maybe that did happen. Like I can't find anything of my Wii U in the house.
And like, did I lend it to someone? So I was like, these shops come into a close. I need to get on top of this.
I thought, do I want to buy a Wii U? No, we've got all the gubbins, because you can link other controllers to it. So I only need the base.
So I bought just a Wii U base for £35.
Okay, right, interesting.
So it technically works. It's a bit bashed up. It's not going to win any beauty contests.
Wii U's famously being entered in beauty contests.
Also, weirdly, it's completely factory reset. But I think it must have come from a Mario Kart box set, because it's got Mario Kart 8 pre-installed on it still. So technically I got a free copy of Mario Kart 8.
The downside to all this is that I didn't transfer my Nintendo account when I got rid of my last Wii U, obviously. So I have now lost my Wii U account with all my games on it.
That's brutal.
So I've literally got no Wii U digital collection, which is what most of my games were on.
That sucks. That's tough.
I don't think you can reclaim it without having the original machine, which if I'd known, I wouldn't have traded it in for a... Oh my God, this is how much credit I'm going to lose. I traded it in for the God of War Special Edition PS4 Pro.
Wow. Which is just like, imagine a PS4 Pro, but with loads of really ugly runes all over it.
The Matthew Castle brand is unraveling in a single exhibit.
I was honestly weighing up like, shall I just gloss over that stuff? But I thought, no, I need to justify why I bought a Wii U base for 35 pounds.
Look, this court is not here to meditate on the merits of trading in a games console to get another games console that's got some bad decals on it. That is not what this court is here for. We're just here to try the crime in question of buying a Wii U after you trade a one in.
I suppose before I make a verdict on this one, Matthew, what are you buying a Wii U for in 2022? So you don't have a digital collection, like you say, and most of the games now are on Switch. So, for example, Mario Kart, that Mario Kart is worth very little because we have Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has all the tracks on it, and we'll soon have a load more DLC tracks.
So why did you need a Wii U in 2022?
I'm mainly using it for the virtual console function. I want to buy Metroid Prime Trilogy because I don't have a copy of that.
Yeah, OK, I sort of, I get that. It's true that when the store's gone, you won't be able to buy that in any other place.
Yeah, I just want to have the console with a few things on it. I want to buy affordable space adventures. I want to buy the Wii U version of Year Walk.
I want to buy the Pushbox game on it again. I just want to buy a few exclusive eShop games. And I thought £35 is kind of...
I'm willing to pay that as a shame on me for getting rid of my Wii U tax.
Yeah, OK, we've blown some good content there for our eventual games to download before the Wii U store closes episode.
Well, they're small than that. Oh, so sorry.
No, no, it's fine. OK, we're going to let that one go, because just because this court has previously enjoyed the Wii draft results where Metroid Prime Trilogy was arguably the thing that killed you. So the fact that you have now gone to buy a console, specifically to play that game, works in your favour.
It appeals to our vanity.
I don't want to get killed twice because of Metroid Prime Trilogy.
No, no, if you can get out of the hellish kind of like gravity pull of the Katamari Ball, you are free to return to Matthew Castle Island, a surviving man.
If anything, it's easier for me to escape the ball because I've only got to take the Wii U base. If I had all the cables and the controller, it would be a lot more bulk.
Yeah, for sure. And the copy of Crash Bandicoot in the same trilogy has been placed inside the pot man's head.
I thought you were going to say inside the shitty barrel.
No, no, we tried not to put anything in there.
I would put Crash Bandicoot in there, no problem. That's where he belongs.
Well, look, that's for you to say. This court doesn't pass verdict on the quality of Crash Bandicoot. It only matches that...
That's literally what this court does.
This court passes judgment on the quality of games.
What we do is we create Twilight Zone style ironic punishments for the defendants. And we know that this court knows that you, Crash Bandicoot, is like your worst nightmare. So we created a punishment that fit the crime, but you've been found not guilty.
So congratulations, Matthew.
My worst nightmare is actually living on your hellish spherical world. So, you know, I'm fine.
Well, that's good. So the episode comes to an end, Matthew. Very long and some might say tortured Games Court episode.
But I think it was kind of fun, was it?
Yeah, we had some good stuff. I like the creepy letter about trying to wheeze someone with the sins.
That was really good, yeah. Thank you for that. That was some good content.
And I think we got some good pulpins.
Yeah, it was solid pulpins. I'm going to enjoy those seven and a half glasses of bottles of wine on my shelf there to remind me of my bad lawyering. So the podcast is over.
As mentioned, we are launching a Patreon soon. The current plan is to launch on the 1st of April. If you back us at the £5 tier, at that point, you should be able to unlock Best Boss Battles, an exclusive episode that we're producing for that tier.
Just kind of going through the final bits and pieces of putting the Patreon together now. So hopefully that will launch without a hitch and that would be good. If you'd like to follow the podcast on Twitter, it's Back Page Pod on Twitter.
You can email us at backpagegames.gmail.com. If you'd like to join our Discord, just head over to the Twitter and you'll see a link there in the profile. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzill underscore pesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts and enjoy the full version of our new theme tune by Barry Topping after this episode. Thank you for listening.
Bye-bye.
