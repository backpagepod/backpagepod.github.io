Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. You have returned from a recent journey to the sky in a balloon. It's the one thing that I think our listeners, and by our listeners, I mean the 100 most engaged fanatics on Blue Sky want me to ask about.
So you went up in a balloon, what was the deal? How did it go down?
It was Catherine's birthday present for last year, which is why we were going up in a balloon. Yeah, we left from Victoria Park in Bath, which is quite a nice place to go from. If you live in Bath, you will often see hot air balloons above it, so I've always wanted to do it.
Was quite nervous in the run up, won't lie. Kept thinking about the beginning of Enduring Love, where there's a horrible balloon accident and a man dies. I just had endless images of toppling out of it, because I'm so tall and like leaning over the edge of a balloon and then just being toast.
Basically, all that went away. When we went to the park and they turned up with the basket and you saw how tall that thing was, I was like, okay, I'd have to really fuck this to fall out of this basket. It was great.
A little bit of initial nerves when it was taking off, but then it's really, really smooth. It's not at all bumpy. It's quite eerie how gentle it all feels.
And there is quite an amazing couple of minutes where the sound of the city gets sucked away a bit as you lift from it and it just gets quieter and quieter until all you can basically hear is dogs barking. That's the only noise from the ground that makes it up. You can't hear cars, but you can see dogs going ballistic in the garden as a balloon goes over it.
Because dogs are dumb and just like balloon, balloon, balloon.
Yeah, but if you don't know what the concept of a balloon is and you see something in the sky fly, that's quite alarming when you can't comprehend what you're looking at. You know what I mean?
Yeah, God, I'd hate to be a dog and not be able to comprehend a hot air balloon. Yeah, so, but there were so many dogs barking. It felt like, oh, I can hear all the dogs in bath and it sounds like there's thousands of them.
Right, so that was a bit of an eye-opener, really, because my brain is absolutely rotted by years of video games. Like, you can't help but compare what you're seeing to how open world games look from above or, like, how flight simulator looks. Because you've kind of seen this environment from the air probably in a game and so that you are initially like, wow, the resolution on this is amazing.
You can really see everything.
So, Bath compares well to Los Santos is what you're saying.
Yeah, well, I've flown over Bath in the last flight simulator and it looks way better in real life. Graphics have got some catching up to do. But you see things like fields of grass, you can see like the wind moving through it and like that weird kind of sheen.
You just notice all this stuff going on that you can't see from the ground. We flew quite low over some farmlands and you just see like all the deer and foxes or whatever running around. You can just see a lot of nature that's kind of hidden by hedgerows when you're driving around country roads.
Here's a thing which I thought was funny. At the start, before they take off, all the, there's several balloon companies gather in the park because obviously it's a good location and a good time for it. So there's like five or six balloon launches.
So you've got a big team of like balloonists, I guess. And they let go of a children's balloon to let it go up in the air to see how the wind currents are acting, I guess, to see like what's the air actually doing up there. But then you have all these quite serious looking dudes looking very seriously at a children's balloon flying away, which I thought was quite a fun image because they're all looking at it like, you know, secret science to it.
And me and Catherine were like, oh, look, some idiot let go of a balloon by mistake. And then you cut over to them and they're all like, trying to kind of feel like, are we going to die if we take off here? Like, is this going to just pile drive us into the Royal Crescent?
But I like that that's the science of it, is a small balloon and then the big balloon will do whatever the small balloon does. Also good, there's a bloke who like chases the balloon down on the ground because obviously you land wherever you land in like a random field in the countryside. So there's a guy like chasing below in a Land Rover to pick you up at the other end.
Oh, it's like Twisters, Matthew.
Yeah, it is like Twisters. It's really got that vibe because they're sending walkie-talkie messages. Now we're going south.
We're going south. You can sometimes see little glimpses of them, like gunning it down these country roads and stuff. I like the idea of Twisters, except what they're chasing is me and not a tornado, which is probably well, I find it more exciting than Twisters.
So certainly. So yeah, it was fun. It was really nice, really chilled.
Not many hilarious things happened because it was all very smooth and safe. I think you only get crazy anecdotes if something goes horribly wrong, which it didn't.
The funniest thing you told me is that afterwards you had to help pack it up afterwards, and you found that knackering CA big bag. That was the best bit.
Well, you roll it up, because you've got to imagine, they roll up the balloon and stuff it in this bag, and it's basically like, you know how hard it is getting a sleeping bag into its little pocket? It's like that, times a million, because it's huge. So it's kind of, you're like, well, I've never been able to pack up like, pop tents and things, so the idea that we're going to be able to pack up this balloon, but we somehow managed to do it, and then we all celebrated by sitting around and drinking some champagne and Thatchers, because their balloon was sponsored by Thatchers.
So they had a big box of the stuff. It was very chilled, it was nice.
Thatchers is good sponcon for Bath, really. That's the sort of thing that appeals to the locals, I imagine. Not me, but to the locals, you know.
Yeah, we should get a Back Page sponsorship on one of those things. Just a QR code.
Yeah, and it's just really fucking hard to get on a cloudy day, and it ends up being like a massive waste of money and time. I can imagine you up there, like I remember there's an anecdote from, I think William Shatner, he said he went to space and then looked down at our Earth and just and welled up because he realized how precious it was. I imagine you doing the same thing but realizing how precious bath is.
You're like, it's so tiny, it's so beautiful. Can I imagine you having a similar experience, Matthew?
It was more like my face turned into a sneer when I realized how many dogs there were.
Yeah, upsetting. You were like, damn, I'm really annoyed to learn how much nature was on my back door. My cats can go and murder basically.
That is lovely and I'm genuinely glad you had a nice time. How did you feel about the memes that came out of it, Matthew?
You can't do anything nice in our lives now.
Sorry.
No, no, it's fine. I'm honestly, it makes me laugh that I take a picture of having my mind blown by the glory of nature and like five minutes later someone's photoshopped a fallout mushroom cloud into the background.
Oh, yeah.
So listen, I like that people care enough about the podcast that they do those things.
Yeah.
I just think it's funny that there's the speed at which it happens and that there's just no barriers, whatever. I mean, it's still not as bad as Jeremy's wedding picture getting repurposed to call him a bitch.
That's probably a low for them.
It's just like an all-time bit of listener sort of shithouse-ery.
Yeah. That's like a bit of a did we go too far moment that one. I forgot that happened.
That was funny. He's back on again, the podcast next month, so we can ask him about that, how he feels about it, like a year or two on or whenever that happened. No, I'm genuinely glad you had a lovely time.
I could tell from the pictures you're having a great time. It was a wonderful evening for it as well. So you got lucky.
Yeah, that's good. I'm glad to hear it. Now back down to Earth.
We had a massive kebab when we landed as well.
What is your kebab joint of choice? You started going to this place quite regularly, haven't you?
Baba's Meze. It's absolutely brilliant. It's quickly becoming one of my top bar food places.
Yeah. Is it where that bakery used to be? Is it that building?
Yeah, Thoughtful Bakery. Yeah. You sort of sit in and it's like a Persian restaurant.
So just a big old chicken kebab and some saffron rice.
Yeah, it does sound good. Well, we've walked past it and we've noted it, so we'll come back to it. So definitely smells good when you walk past, you like it, it seems convincing.
Okay. So bringing Matthew back down to earth with a thud is this monster of a podcast, Best Games of 2005, which Matthew, this closes the loop on us doing, we would have done 2001 to 2016 after this one. So all the way back in the end of 2020, we did Best Games of 2006, and finally we've crept back around basically to 2005.
So I imagine there's probably quite a disparity in the tone between 2005 and 2006 pods with four and a half years of experience recording under our belts. But yeah, how are you feeling about coming back to this year?
As a general project, it's been fun doing these Game of the Year episodes. I'm sad that this stretch of them is coming to an end. I guess we've got 2017 and 2018 if we want to get into some dark times.
Yeah, 2019 as well.
But also, as they've gone on, doing this one 200 episodes in, we've just talked about so many games in so many different ways that when I made my top 10, I was like, all these games sound incredibly boring because we've talked about them so many times by now where a lot of the time these Game of the Year episodes were our first opportunity to talk about games on the podcast.
Yeah.
And it just seemed like slightly fresher, like kind of going, hey, everyone, heard of Metal Gear Solid 3 at this point seems ridiculous. But you know, you got to do what you got to do.
Yeah, I think to put a slightly nicer spin on it, I think that maybe people come to these podcasts for the first hour or hour and a bit more than like the list themselves now at this point. I think this is a great format to do in the early part of the podcast lifespan, actually. I think that was actually a really good call to start with that because it helped us set the stall out a little bit and we got to kind of tell chronologically our experience of working in media as interesting as that is to some listeners of the podcast.
So you kind of get, you got that sort of like dual thing of here's what was going on at the time working on the magazine, but also these are the games that defined these key years for me. So yeah, it does have a different air to it when you come back to it at this point. I do think the 17, 18, 19 ones will be quite interesting because those are like now, those are approaching sort of like middle distance in terms of history.
They're like a little while ago now. But again, a lot of the games sort of come up in different drafts or whatever. So yeah, I definitely think that's true.
But I always enjoyed doing them and I always enjoyed the Yannick boats from the from the times, even if even in the pre games media ones, which I was a bit wary of when we first did 2001. I thought is there going to be enough sort of meat on the bone here? And there was.
And I've really enjoyed this particular little stretch of one, two, three, four, five.
So, yeah, it's been quite fun kind of getting an idea of what our two teenage selves were like to each other. I mean, much the same as it is now, it turns out, depressingly.
Yeah, exactly. Just sort of like, yeah, at home, eating sweets, playing computer games.
Yeah, it's just like painting a picture of just a weird sort of 40 year old man, but as an 18 year old, in the 18 year old's body, walking around Winchester in 2001.
Yeah, very much so. So I guess that's what we'll start with, Matthew. 2005, what were you up to?
This is my second year at university in the beginning of the third year, and I was living in a student house. So I sort of think of this as my first taste of what living in, not my own property, but a shared property was going to be like, because in my first year at university, obviously, I was in dorms, which isn't quite the same, like you're not at home, but you're kind of in a, in quite a weird sort of managed building. And so this was my first proper taste of independent living, and the responsibilities that come with that, I, you know, being a bit more on top of keeping a house clean and not being like mothered or having, well, I say having all my food cooked for me by college.
I used to go back into college to have all my meals because I fucking hate cooking. My house, my housemates used to get a bit sort of arsey about that because they thought I was indulgent. Quite a lot of big things happened this year.
I was in Oxford a lot of the year, like, because as we had the house and you rented it through the holidays, I kind of stayed there most of the year, is how I remember it. So, yeah, I was kind of really there for like a good sort of six or seven months in a row, which was fun. I stayed there during the Easter holidays.
A good thing that happened this year, I passed my driving test. I had failed my test nine times in Winchester and was continuing to learn in Oxford. I finally passed, but with a driving instructor who I absolutely hated.
He absolutely hated me. When I went to take the test, the last thing he said to me as he got out of the car, he looked at me and went, if you pass this driving test, it will be the biggest fluke in history.
Fucking hell.
I went, cheers Pete. And then I passed and he looked genuinely shocked. I think I only passed because they got me to do the two manoeuvres I could actually do.
So if I had to parallel park, I wouldn't be driving still. So that was lucky.
And indeed you don't drive, you know, Catherine drives you around for probably for the reasons that you're outlining here.
I failed so many times that it just put the fear in me. And I know that sounds really shitty and it is really lazy of me. And one day I will have some like whatever like re-up lessons and kind of get to grips with it again.
But in my head, one in 10 people think I should be driving. Those were the stats I was kind of working with.
Right.
And even when I passed, the guy was so sort of incredulous at it, that at the driving instructor himself, that it didn't leave me with like a yes, I've mastered driving. It left me with a sense of, oh, this was an accident and I should still not be driving. Yeah, Pete really did a number on me, which wasn't great.
What a prick. I'm in there because he drove me back from the test center to where I lived. It was a bit of an awkward drive because we'd obviously had this disagreement beforehand and then he was just like, well, that was great.
Tell your friends about me. And it was like, well, I'm obviously not going to do that. This was quite an unpleasant experience.
But well, listen, I passed. I actually saw War of the Worlds the day before I passed, like in the evening. And so I wonder if that's just like a good luck charm.
I just wonder if like the magic of Spielberg, sheer competence of Tom Cruise rubbed off on me somehow.
I think that because I relayed my driving instructor experience, I think on a previous podcast, I can't remember why, because it was actually this year, when I started having lessons. And I just absolutely hated my guy. He's a right.
I think the problem is, I don't want to broadly draw a conclusion here, but he's an absolute charisma vacuum of a man. And he saw this as like, I've got you hostage to have to listen to my conversation. And so there will be probably for the hour that you pay for, about 40 minutes of driving.
And then I would say 40 to 50 minutes of him talking about bits of pop culture he's interested in. The Prisoner, Fucking Borat, which is why it came up previously. You know, him doing the impressions from Borat, which I'd never seen.
And him ruining that film because of the impressions. But, you know, many other people would do that impression and also ruin the film.
I just don't know how you can fold that impression into what a driving instructor needs to say.
Turn left. It doesn't really work, does it?
Oh, he's doing driving instructor as Borat.
No, I was floating the possibility as a joke that he would. He wasn't doing that.
Oh, okay, right.
It's very much delineated, I would say. And that's the thing, I think. I think because they have power over you, because you're stuck in the vehicle with them, they're like, I can treat you however I want.
There's a bit of that power dynamic, I think. And you're too close because of the intimate situation of being in a car. I think it just means that, I don't know.
That put me off driving so much. I've never gone back for lessons again. I hated this guy.
And when I was halfway through my lessons, my mom was just like, why don't you just ditch him and get someone else? I'm like, well, I might as well try and pass now. Didn't.
And then just abandoned it when I moved to Bournemouth anyway.
Nice.
Yeah. Which is pathetic, really, because it would be quite nice to be able to do. There are quite a few nice pubs you read about on Google Maps around Bath that you could only reach in a car.
And so I've missed out on some great roast dinners as a result of that lack of ability Matthew. So that's tough. Yeah.
OK, so driving aside and uni aside, anything else jump to mind when you remember 05?
I was running my film society at college. That was quite big this year. Well, it wasn't, I only had like a moderate turnout, but I quite liked being able to curate my own sort of film programme and force all my film tastes on people.
They're just like my core texts, like the kind of things that we've done on the XXL episodes, like the right stuff. We didn't do Dazed and Confused, I came to that quite later. Did Quicken the Dead, that was quite good.
Oh right, yeah, yeah.
The Spanish Prisoner, which I think I talked about in the Thriller episode.
Last of Sheila?
No, Last of Sheila I came to late as well, but that would have absolutely have been like prime film society territory. Yeah, I think we maybe did Saw as well.
Alright.
Maybe, oh boy, I think we did a few things that were like big via before and then we got them on DVD.
Saw doesn't seem very you, so that's interesting.
Yeah, I really liked being like a film guy. You know, I was doing the film reviews for the paper as well. I used to go to press screenings quite a bit, which was fun.
As I went up to go and see Flight Plan starring Joe D. Foster or something along those lines and getting very starstruck, you'd see like Mark Kermode there, Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian and all these kind of people. And I was just like, oh, wow, I've really made it.
I'm at the same screenings as all these people. I once went to a screening of Lord of War starring Nicolas Cage in a little screening room. And it was just me and Jonathan Ross watching it.
All right, that's weird.
Yeah, because he was doing his film show. And as I was going in, a really bleary looking Johnny Vaughan was leaving the screening room as well. And I remember thinking like, this is absolutely amazing.
I've really made it. I've seen Johnny Vaughan and Jonathan Ross within hours of each other.
I missed that film show. That was good. Jonathan Ross is really good.
Yeah, professionally successful then, probably to the detriment of my studies. By the way, it was like a decent year. It was a little bit of...
I won't go into specifics. It was a little bit of heartbreak this year, which was a bummer. I spent quite a lot of it moping around, listening to very cliched pop music, to try and cheer myself up.
Never really done that sort of woe is me, sort of emotional wallowing. This was the year I did some of that, which was fun. It was a bit of a bad hang for a few months because of that.
Being on lots of long bus trips to London, listening to sort of Rufus Wainwright albums and your Walkman and being sad. You're like, what a fucking cliché.
Peak 05 shit that.
But that's OK. You've got to go through these things. Oh yeah.
Just my heart hardened for the next decade. That's all that happened, so that was good. Became horribly emotionally stunted.
Good times. Watched a lot of Arrested Development. That was good this year.
Had some big fallings out with housemates over ridiculous things. Someone accidentally defrosted a fridge full of meat that someone was storing and that created a huge rift in the house. We had several meetings where I think there were like nine of us in one house.
Which is a lot of people and we had several evenings of everyone gathered in the living room for house meetings where there were very clear divisions between one group and another group. It turned out someone had secretly stored a load of meat in a freezer which none of us knew was on. Because our kitchen had this second freezer which we all agreed not to use.
Except one person filled it full of meats and then another person unplugged it to do their vacuuming. Didn't plug it back in and all their meats went rank. And it was like, well you never told us about your secret meats.
That's the fact that meat is extra funny.
I'd say that's on the person for having a secret meat locker and not advertising it. And then it all kind of soured from there.
Nine people. That sounds like absolute hell. How many toilets did you have?
Two.
Two. Fucking hell. That's just like, the stakes are very high.
Did you assign certain people to certain toilets? Is it like, you get to use this one, you get to use this one?
Actually, did we even have two?
Oh my god.
No, no, we had two. No, we definitely had two. The thing is, there was a shower upstairs and there was a shower on the ground floor, but it literally opened up onto the hallway, as in you open the curtain and you could see a fridge.
It wasn't in a room. It was just in an alcove. It's like you turn the space under the stairs into a shower.
And so no one wanted to use it, because if you walked past that thing too fast, the curtain would just move because of the wind. I did not want to be showering that close to a kitchen or next to the main through line of a house. Basically, one person who was brave enough to use that shower and everyone else competing for one shower upstairs.
That was quite hard work.
Wow.
There was an infamous falling out over... So, a couple of people had bikes which they stored in the back garden and if they wanted to get their bikes out, they had to bring them through the house.
Yeah.
I remember someone bought their bike through the house and left, I would say, a tiny amount of mud on the kitchen carpet and someone else went ballistic about this. They bought a tarp. I think it might be the same person here at the Secret Meat Locker.
They bought a big blue tarp, folded it up on the kitchen table and put a handwritten note on it and said, please put down this tarp when you bring your bikes through the kitchen. But it appeared one evening, I thought, oh, people aren't going to like that. You know, it's very quite passive aggressive just to leave this note.
And when I came down the next morning, the tarp was still perfectly folded on the kitchen table, but someone had ridden their muddy bike tires over the note on the floor multiple times. That's the kind of sort of territory we're in. I think there was a bit where people were only communicating through magnetic letters on a fridge.
That's a lot of work.
Oh, it was bad. Yeah.
Well, I mean, that's a lot of that is why when I moved to Bournemouth, I didn't actually move in with anyone. I just got a very, very nasty sort of basement flat to live in instead because I still seemed preferable to chancing it. In retrospect, I actually do wish I'd lived with a few of my imagined colleagues.
Like there was a few different house shares that looked kind of fun. Nine people. That's a proper powder keg that is for some disagreements.
And yeah, I'm delighted to hear about the Secret Meat Locker, Matthew. That's really good. I hope that Secret Meat Locker appears in a future games court one day.
That'd be good. Yeah. Okay.
So anything else?
What was your 2005 looking like?
Oh, God. Okay. So you know how the Queen had that year where she was mildly inconvenienced and she called it the Annus Horribilis?
She faced no threat of being homeless or not having a job like the rest of us do. She just had some mild personal issues, one fire in one of her homes. It's pretty low-stakes stuff.
I would say this was my Annus. I had a Horribilis Annus that year, Matthew. My Annus is in terrible shape, to be honest.
Oh dear. You need to clean up your Annus.
Yeah. I think I've told most of this in the podcast before, but probably in quite brief form. This was when I moved from GCSE into, in fact the year before this had happened, I moved from GCSE into AS level.
So this was the rest of the main bit of the AS level year and then a bit of my A level year. I switched colleges in between. That was because the sixth form I went to in my school was quite, they were quite smug about how much better their results were than their local competitors.
I think they thought that their secret to achieving this was the fact that instead of giving you all your free periods, like a college normally does, they had the study periods where you basically just go into a room and do homework or read in total silence. It was a bit of boarding school energy, even though it was obviously like a state school. So it was like, why are you doing this?
I think they thought by treating you like kids, that they were giving you more discipline than you'd get if you were at college or you got to be a bit more of an adult. And I didn't really enjoy that. But I would say that I hated so many of the people there, partly because a lot of kids from a school across town called Crofton came along.
I did government and politics this year. And I remember when the teacher weirdly asked like if you could vote now which party would you vote for? And he was like, conservative party.
And every one of those Crofton kids put their hands up. And I was like, okay, well, these kids are going to make the world a worse place. Like this, this sucks.
And there's like me and about four other people said, labor at the time. So I just thought, well, these are the worst kids ever. I heard they all had swimming pools as well, like quite affluent from across town.
There's loads of reasons to hate these kids. And so I felt like our culture got overwritten by their culture. I remember this one quite popular kid there who was like performatively racist and had a couple of mates who were like how racist he was.
There were a few kids like that from the school. This kind of compounded with the fact that all of my friends who I used to sort of like, throughout GCSE, we used to just go over to this field and play football and stuff at lunchtimes, stopped doing that and all we did was hang out in the common room instead, which was just like a bit of a tough hang. It was like being in a sort of, I would say like a doctor's waiting room or something.
There's loads and loads of like chairs, there's quite clinical space. That combined with the fact that I hated all the people who were running the college, and the fact I was academically not really interested in a lot of the stuff I was learning that year. It was just a very bad combination.
So I didn't do very well at AS level and I dropped out and went to another college across town instead called St. Vincent, which was much more like a normal college, and then basically just did that for my A level instead. Where I still didn't do very well, but I did slightly better than I was doing at my school sick form. So yeah, and so I think a lot of my present day biases are based on the kids I encountered from that school, and that sounds ridiculous, I realize, but that was where I just came to realize, okay, you have to regard the world like it's full of those people.
I think that I've lived ever since. Well, have you ever had a moment like that where you encounter people with such vastly different views from you, where you're like, well, that's so obviously wrong. You should so obviously be challenged on that, but you never have.
And then you grow up and then things like Brexit happen, or the Tories getting over and over again, or the Reform Party grows, and you're like...
Yeah, and the thing is, when you're a horrible centrist like me, you're just a bit close to everything really, so you're like, well, that seems reasonable. And then the other lot, you're like, well, that seems okay. So I've been a fence-sitter since birth, really.
Yeah.
But I do, yeah, I do get it. I mean, certainly you kind of... I certainly get kind of carrying forward how you experience people at this age.
But I think also judging humanity on the behavior of 17 and 18-year-olds is probably not a great bet.
Yeah, that's fair. But it is borne out a little bit by how things have gone in the United Kingdom, I think. It's sort of like the types of people you do encounter.
But I don't know. But also, it's that thing of like, you eventually do meet your people when you go into the adult world. And you do feel a little bit reassured that humanity is not totally fucked.
And certainly I had that working in games journalism. But I just definitely didn't have it at this age. I just thought, yeah, Crofton.
It was like the absolute worst. I just associated it with like the upper class kids from across town who just...
Does it make you think of Lara Crofton?
But the college I went to afterwards was interesting. So I felt like they were a little bit more on the ropes, but it was a bit more like a real place. So I realized I should have just gone there to begin with because being treated a bit more like an adult was, I think probably the head space to be treated like that at the time.
And a lot of the kids there just seemed like normal people, to be honest. There was a bit less in the way of like, yeah, I don't think many of the Crofton kids even went there. Maybe they had some kind of weird deal with our school, that they got to all go to the college I was from, I don't know.
But anyway.
Well, if you said like 90% of the Crofton kids were motherfuckers, maybe the 10% that weren't went to the other place.
Well no, there was like two, I would say like two to three kids who I became quite good friends with, who were from that school, and seemed quite reasonable. But there was just like a big popular group of them, when every now and then I see one of them pop up on Facebook or something, I'm like, God, they're still out there just being dicks.
Have any of them gone on to great things? That's always painful when someone you're not into or don't think much of, and then you see them on Facebook and they're like, running ITV or something, you're like, fuck that.
I don't think any of the people I went to school with have done loads of notable things. The most notable thing I can think of is that there was, this is from my school, Bayhouse, this filmmaker called Daisy Jacobs, I think was Oscar nominated for a short film she made. I think that's right.
I think she's like maybe a composer, weirdly like a composer who works in video games knows her. When I tweeted about, oh, someone I went to school with did this, I was like, oh yeah, I know Daisy. I was like, okay, well, that's cool.
She was always quite academically accomplished, so that makes sense. But none of them have really gone on to be like, it's not like the really performatively racist guy is now like, sort of an MP, which is sadly quite plausible, isn't it? But yeah, so honestly, that was quite a bumpy year.
I had a few teachers I didn't like either.
In hindsight, the idea of 17-year-olds doing government and politics at A level, it's like a recipe for disaster because it's people just coming. I know that the subject isn't actually about, you know, what's your own political opinions are. It's about like systems of government.
But it is a time of your life where people are developing their first proper political opinions. Everything's quite shaky. Lots of it's quite unfounded.
There's a lot of posturing. The idea of like encouraging that or bringing all the people who have those kind of attitudes together in a classroom. It should be like absolute death.
Yeah. I did politics AS level. That's the one I dropped when I went to A level.
Just because I couldn't really face it. I just wanted to have opinions on Quentin Tarantino. I didn't really want to have anything deeper than that.
Yeah, I understand that. I think that teacher made a huge mistake by even asking people that question. I don't think that was a good idea.
Yeah, that is weird.
And he shared that he voted conservative. He didn't comment on it either. He just said, yeah, I won't talk about it, but I vote conservative.
And I was like, why are you doing it? That was such a bad idea.
A teacher should be mysterious with regards to that.
Yeah, it did feel like a slightly different age for this stuff though now. But I think maybe because obviously this is before Cameron and before like austerity and basically the snowballing of-
Imagine being a young conservative in like the Ian Duncan Smith. Like, oh, I'm really into him.
Yeah, it's pretty uninspiring. So yeah, was it like Michael Howard around this time as well? I can't remember now, but it was certainly-
Oh, God, what a shower.
It was certainly that era. But I can't really remember how extreme that era of the Conservative Party was now, as the kind of like opposition party. I just remember how bad things got under camera, and obviously, I don't remember how much more unreasonable they were than the Labour.
Obviously, the Iraq War was the policy that killed Labour and justifiably so really, given the shaky foundations of that and all that stuff. Not to get too deep into all this. But yeah, it was like-
But by asking that question, basically, I just thought- He basically created, I think, a slight divide in the class because everyone who voted Labour would feel one way about the conservatives. I don't think those kids cared because they just thought they were right.
Anyway, I think it's something lighter that happened that year, but it was just so bumpy. I was like- There was a point where I was nearly expelled because I put a swear and an email to a teacher.
It was like I was emailing in my homework. I think I said the word shit in one line. Rather than just saying, hey, I don't think it's appropriate you put this in an email.
I think you should watch the way you communicate, which I think is how you should communicate that with a teacher. It was like a very, I would say, orchestrated campaign to try and get me out. I had two Spanish teachers.
I remember I got in one day and she was like, Samuel, I need to talk to you. She took me to a room and it's like, so I understand in this e-mail to this teacher, you used a certain word and I was like, what word? It was like this word and she wouldn't say it.
She wrote it down and I was like, oh yeah, I guess I did. I was like, oh wow, this is what we're having a very serious meeting about. Then I got put in front of the head teacher and there were two other motherfuckers who came in.
There were two other disciplinary heads who were like her cronies who came in and sat there glaring at me like, how dare you? I think they were like, go home and we're going to like, I will be in touch with further information basically, all for using the word shit in the email, which I think is like crazy. Basically, the only reason they didn't get away with this is because my mom was a senior teacher at Woking College at the time, and she knew what they were doing was completely bogus.
So she just she ran the head teacher and she was like, absolutely fucking not, basically. And so they had to completely reverse it, and then they all started being really nice to me. It was really weird.
I don't know what my mom did or said, but it was very much like I was very grateful to have a parent in my corner at that point, but you can imagine that I just saw it.
I like the idea of you going in, and they're all suddenly like, you're amazing, it's Spanish, Samuel.
But you can imagine that, to be honest, so much of my sort of perception of work and success and failure is tied up in this one year at college, because it was just so formative, because I have people trying to get me out for no reason. I'm surrounded by these kids, and I'm struggling because I don't think these teachers are really doing their jobs properly. Then when I got my results, I just felt terrible about it.
I was in such a terrible state with it. So it was honestly the worst year of my life, so bad. It's why a couple of years hence when I go and work as a staff writer, I was so grateful to find the thing that I was good at so early.
You know what I mean?
It's interesting. It feels like we've inadvertently structured this whole podcast project like a Christopher Nolan film, because the chronology is out of order. And so we've seen what becomes of you and the person you are, but it's only right at the end does time loop back around and we discover what the inciting incident was.
It's been quite well planned out.
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't deliberate. I thought I'd told all this in the podcast before, but it sounds like a lot of it is new to you, Matthew, so maybe not.
Yeah, all we've been doing this so long that I've forgotten a lot of stuff.
It's totally possible. I've probably told the brief version of it, but that's the long version, basically. It was like it was just not a good year.
And part of it was tied up in like me having a bad attitude for sure. Like I definitely should have let it go when those kids all said they were conservatives. But to me, it was like, they've confirmed what I already knew about these kids, basically.
That's just like classic Samuel Roberts stuff.
I know, it's ridiculous. Yeah, I know it's preposterous.
You've absolutely parodied yourself.
Yeah, basically. But it's so long ago now that it feels like ancient history. But every now and then I'll just have a moment in real life where I remember how I felt at that particular time.
And then I'm like, oh God, what a fork in the road that was. If I just had a good first year of college, would my outlook on life be completely different?
But it was like, I mean, this podcast might not exist. So I'm kind of glad that it went south for you.
Well, it's like there's like certain professional sort of like decisions I've made and like things that have happened, I think are kind of a byproduct of this year and this happening, where I'm just a bit like, oh, I don't think it was okay that you did this basically. Like I've had situations like this because of this one year, I think, which is ridiculous again, but just yeah, very foundational. Every year it gets a bit further away, but at the time it seemed like really serious and important.
But yeah, that was, it was weird to relive that. I don't think enough much jolly happened this year, but well aware that we're like about 50 minutes into this podcast, it's probably seeming quite indulgent because Best Games of 2005 and only one game has been mentioned so far, Metal Gear Solid 3 in passing. I will say it is the year I got firmly back into video games.
I had a pause, I would say, in most of 04 minus Spider-Man 2 and like the first half of 05. But when I went to this new college, I remember like a few friends starting to say to me that, oh, some pretty cool stuff's happening in games. Like I had a friend at the time who had played Resident Evil 4 on GameCube, a friend's house, and so, wait, it's brother's house.
And so he told me, oh, you wait until you play this game. It's incredible. And I was like, well, I've got PS2, so don't think I'm going to get to play it anytime soon.
And then, lo and behold-
Little did he know.
Exactly. Like just a few months later, it did arrive on PS2 and I got to play it. And indeed that was, I would say that was, that and MGS3 combined were the games that really just sort of locked me on the course to games media of like, oh, these games, those are the games that just really excite you and inspire you, get you sort of interested in the medium in this much deeper way.
I just, you know, I think it's like the story element of MGS3 first primarily, and then the gameplay element of Resi 4, which is just such a, you know, a beautifully designed game. First game I ever thought about pacing, not to get too ahead of ourselves, that kind of stuff. And so, yeah, I think, I think it just became a much more serious part of my life as a result of that.
And I was curious for you, because I know that when you went to uni, you had a bit of a lapse in video games as well. Did that change as a result of some of the games that came out this year? Or did you discover these games a little bit later?
No, I got them this year at Asnew. I rented Metal Gear Solid 3 from Blockbuster. I remember for a very, very good weekend.
And yeah, I bought Resident Evil 4. I played that over the Easter holidays. Resident Evil 4 and watching Arrested Development, those two things very intertwined as just like these two things are just the best examples of their form that they will ever be.
And thinking I'd absolutely hit the jackpot. Yes. And a great distraction from any woes that I might have had.
So I'd say through my university years, I wasn't endlessly playing games, but the biggies I was anticipating, I'd get them and play them as new. I actually, looking back over this year, I think I did play quite a lot of stuff in this year that did make my list. But definitely, I had to go back and pick up a lot of stuff.
A lot of my GPA journey and DS gaming, the early first year of DS, I kind of came to after the fact when I got my job, and I had to suddenly fill in lots of gaps. So yeah, a bit of both. I wouldn't say it was ever out, but yeah, when the biggies hit this year was properly special.
Yeah. There was also a point this year, I remember when I went to college too, where I remember picking up the first issue of X360 magazine, and just being curious about, I didn't even realize the new Xbox was on the horizon. But here was this magazine which had, I think, I can't remember if this is the exact feature, but I think it had a whole oblivion piece in it.
I think it just described an incident of you encountering an NPC, and then another NPC trying to arrest you as a result of an action that you did. It was kind of like a diary structure to it. And it was just so, it seemed so ahead of its time and engaging as like, oh wow, this is what next gen looks like, it's NPCs being this reactive, it's the world being this kind of vivid and amazing.
And actually having this very firm memory of going through the preview section of that first issue, and being like, wow, there's loads of like really cool looking games on this console that sound like they would have been PC games about five years ago, you know? It was really about things like Fear and Condemned and Quake 4, and just so much stuff. But I do remember reading that and sort of it changing my brain chemistry a bit of like, oh wow, okay, this is like something, this is kind of like the Xbox, what the original Xbox was kind of like pitched out but kind of pushing further.
And this was, I guess like at this point, people knew a bit more about what was happening on the PS3, but what the Xbox 360 was, was a lot firmer because it was releasing that year. So I remember that being a key moment. I bought that magazine Matthew and the greatest hits of New Order on CD, and that was a great time.
So yes, that was a thing that I did in this year, that wasn't just me academically crashing and burning and having a bad time. Because I'm aware that there's a lack of fun anecdotes there. The other main thing I was doing this year was, I was working one stop actually doing shifts there.
Probably the most interesting thing that happened this year in that respect was me thwarting the theft of some Budweiser from some teenagers. I basically just kind of muscled these teenagers out from like taking it by, there was this little like swinging door on the side of where the check out was and I swung it open and then basically like jumped out and sort of like barged one of the teenagers over so he dropped it and then the other one I just sort of like grabbed it from his hands and they both just like ran off and...
It's like the beginning of a history of violence.
Yeah, which is, it was just quite funny in retrospect. I think like my boss was like, I don't think you're technically allowed to like physically harm the customers, even if they're like thieves. But I was like, they're not going to sue, they're teenagers.
I feel ethically different about it if it was like, I don't know, a parent stealing baby formula or something, but they're just like buffoons, clearly. So that happened.
Important disclaimer there.
Very important, yeah. Yeah, that was funny. So yes, that happened.
It doesn't balance out the other sad anecdotes I realized, but nonetheless, some context. Okay, Matthew, pop culture from this year. We always talk about this in these episodes.
What do you remember about TV and film from this year?
I remember it being a pretty good year for film. I feel like there was some quite mainstream, but still slightly highbrow stuff. I like History of Violence.
I remember loving that. The Proposition. That was quite cool.
I really liked… There was an Italian film called Consequences of Love. I think it was a Paolo Sorrentino film.
I remember thinking that was absolutely brilliant. Giving that glowing five star review in the student paper. You know, and enjoying the blockbuster-y things.
I think this was the year Serenity came out. I was like a big firefly guy. You know, back then, it wasn't as cursed to like these things.
I remember really, really enjoying that.
Oh yeah, Serenity was huge for me this year, I forgot about that.
Yeah, I was really into the idea of King Kong. I was obsessed with King Kong because obviously, like, the Lord of the Rings trilogy had been so awesome that I thought, well, whatever Peter Jackson does next is going to be amazing. And I do quite like the film.
I think it's decent. But he did those amazing developer sort of diaries where they'd make lots of documentaries and put them up online. And I was just, yeah, you know, avidly consuming everything there was about King Kong.
So I was a big King Kong head for 2005. Yeah, lots of sad wallowing to Rufus Wainwright and being excited about King Kong. Weird year, very weird year.
This is like a peak comic book reading year for me actually. So when Sin City came out, that was a massive moment of like, oh yeah, it's like Frank Miller. You know, I was hugely into the Frank Miller Batman comics, of which there were only really like two, I think, and maybe started the third one that everyone hated this year.
That might be true. That's All Star Batman and Robin, for those curious, that was a notoriously hated book that he did with Jim Lee. That's the one where he says I'm the god damn Batman.
That was memed for a while. Anyway, since that he just seemed like so...
I mean, he's not wrong.
It's true. It's factually accurate. So that film, which was like obviously based so closely on panels of the comic book, was a huge deal.
Yeah, Serenity, it was a big deal as well. I think on a rewatch, I think Serenity is slightly too dour as a follow up to Firefly. It's just a bit too, I think it's a lot of the Joss Whedon tics at their worst, which is just killing off characters left, right and center.
He was a bit too into that, and that film is just such a bummer. I would never really rewatch it now because it's just too sad to watch these characters die when it's like you got to see him for like 13 episodes and now they get murked in this film. It's a bit unfortunate.
Revenge of the Sith was this year, Matthew. I think at the time I just got shrugged at it and thought it was like, yeah, that was by default the best one, who cares? But of course Batman Begins was this year and that was like enormous, huge, huge event.
So yeah, that comes to mind. Prison Break started this year. That was not a very good TV show, but I did watch it because I had nothing better to do.
Yeah.
Oh, Batman Begins is absolutely brilliant. I went to see it by myself in the day, like I think the day it came out because I couldn't like round up other people who were interested and then just raving about it to people. I thought it was so good.
I remember buying the soundtrack to this. I think the Batman Begins soundtrack makes perfect sense in Batman Begins, but isn't necessarily a great hang to listen to separately because it's just quite a lot of ominous drones and sort of like throwing noises. You can't really whistle Batman Begins, so that was a bit of a hard time on my Walkman.
It's like that the Dark Knight soundtrack is a bit easier to re-listen to I think. It's because a lot of it is sort of like five or six minutes of consecutive music, whereas Batman Begins is much more like this scene does this, so the music changes like this. You know what I mean?
It's sort of like...
Yeah, yeah.
I think it's just the way that they did it at the time. Yeah, I love Batman Begins. Again, as someone who is...
This is probably a peak Batman year for me as well. I was reading, just devouring every Batman comic I could get my hands on at the time. Harsh, long Halloween, year one, Dark Knight, Dark Knight Returns.
Sorry, Dark Knight, yeah, Dark Knight Returns and Dark Knight Strikes Again. I was reading Batman contemporaneously as well, the monthly comics and stuff, so I was hugely into it. Then Batman Begins was exactly as good as Nolan pitched it to be.
He was like, back to basics, kind of reboot, like Batman in the real world sort of thing. Then it was exactly as good as that premise, suggested it would be. Just a real...
I was so excited. I remember the six kids I saw it with, only one other liked it and then four of them hated it. They just thought it was so downbeat.
They were like, why is it so serious? But it was a bit like that. They just didn't really get on with the tone of it.
And so, yeah. But it was like the first time, I think, that anyone had really rebooted something in that slightly gritty fashion that I think people get used to after Casino Royale. You know what I mean?
That just became a bit more the flavor of the moment. So, yeah, that was pretty crucial. And so, yeah, that was a little bit on film, I guess.
So Matthew, were you ambiently aware of what was going on in music at the time? I mentioned this because it was my most engaged year of music consumption ever, partly because I worked in One Stop and so I had Radio One on like six hours, six to ten hours a week, basically. So I was listening to constantly to what was happening in music.
It was the event horizon for Land For Lindy. Did any of that happen to you?
No, not at all. I think there was a new Ben Folds album, Songs For Silver in 2005. I bought that and yeah, but it's mostly that the aforementioned Rufus Rainwright, Wallowfest and my usual, my usual bullshit.
No, I just, yeah, it wasn't powers with like music people. So, well, actually, I say that, I had a few friends who were into, you know, I wouldn't say mainstream music, but what was I, you have to fill me in on this because I feel like this is, this has passed me by this year musically.
Yeah, so this was, oh gosh, it was like, I was so into like a few bands from this year that ultimately ended up being quite embarrassing. So one of the best ways to sort of like measure what was going on in music at the time, or what people thought was going to be hot, was seeing who the BBC Sound Of polls would give the sort of like, but who's going to be hot this year. It was based, I think, on speaking to executives and music critics and all these kinds of people.
And they would like compile a top 10 based on that. And so this year, the top of the list was The Bravery, a New York band who did this quite a big single called An Honest Mistake and then basically completely flamed out. And the whole thing with them was they were trying to like stir up what seemed like a fake rivalry between them and The Killers, who had just sort of like broke out the year before.
But 2005 was like a huge, was the Killers year, basically. They were in the OC this year, Matthew, like enormous, enormous stuff. I think that was this year.
It's quite interesting to go back and read like what the sort of like what happened to some of these bands, but like Block Party were in Sound of 2005, they were number two. They did last a lot longer than The Bravery and were better. Kano, don't remember much about that guy.
The Game, who was like, I had the first album by The Game, who was a rapper, Matthew. That was actually a really good album.
Did you buy it because he was named after Games?
You got me, yeah. It was like he had a song called Hate It or Love It. It was absolutely brilliant.
I loved that. Then Kaiser Chiefs for this year, I fucking despise the Kaiser Chiefs. That must have happened to you, being to uni parties and stuff.
Well, I've heard of them, yeah.
I bet you were at some like shite uni gigs where like I predict a riot came on and everyone started going, it was like a, remember all that? Did that happen to you, Matthew?
Yeah, well it didn't happen to me. I remember it being a thing. Like I say, I wasn't going to like gigs or clubs or anything.
So I just didn't hear this stuff. If someone didn't bring it into the house and play it, I wasn't hearing it. One of my housemates listened to Keen a lot.
That was, I don't know if that was 2005 or earlier.
It was just one year earlier, I think. I think they were 04, but they were definitely huge this year.
Well, there was a big, definitely Keen aftershocks in our student house.
Right, because isn't like that bloke from Keen one of the people you get compared to, like looking like?
Yeah, back then. Because he was a bit fatter and then he lost loads of weight and you can't really see it anymore.
I still see it, but anyway, yeah. So yeah, I was like, but it was a year of the bands like the Cooke's who were just quite shit bands. If you had like a haircut, were quite skinny and looked all right in skinny jeans, and you could play like a few chords on a guitar.
You got a record deal basically.
I should have done that. I had long hair and was skinny.
They also, yeah, and then this goes away fairly quickly after, I'd say 06 it lasts for that in 07. It's just sort of like it disappears almost completely. But yeah, so this was, I just knew a guy who I was in my second college, just annexed to a guy who was mega engaged with music.
I remember him telling me what a huge deal like the Arctic Monkeys were going to be and stuff like that. He's like, oh, have you listened to this on MySpace? And you know me, I was just a bit like, no, I'm listening to Depeche Mode on my creative Zen.
You know what I mean? Just leave me to it, pal. So yeah, that's a bit of music.
I imagine that a lot of that kind of stuff will be sort of like memorable to our listeners, that kind of era of music. So I just wanted to check that, Matthew, before finally...
I just wanted to make sure you've got cred with the listeners.
No, not even cred. But I just remember this being such a distinctive like music being a huge part of the cultural moment, but the music being quite dubious, ultimately, and only really a few of those bands standing the test of time, so yeah.
I mean, I just think that I've just remembered why I was listening to Rufus Wainwright in the first place, and this is just a huge indicator of what a dork I am. It's because they reviewed 1.1, his album, on Newsnight Review, and I thought, oh yeah, that sounds good. That's where I got my music recommendations from, from fucking Jermaine Greer and Tom Paul and absolutely absurd.
That's so cunt.
Parody of myself.
It's like, you're coming to the pub, Matthew, you know I have to watch Newsnight Review this evening.
I had a huge falling out with some friends at university in this year because I wanted to watch Newsnight Review, and they were being absolute pricks and using the TV in the living room and pretending that they wanted to watch Jasper Carrot instead, and I just absolutely lost my shit, proper stormed out of the room, had to have a few days to chill off before I could talk to them again. Because that was my one thing, is I wanted to watch Newsnight Review on a Friday evening, and they were just fucking with me.
I watched Newsnight Review at this time too, and it was really good, it was really quite important, I thought. Where else could you get that kind of commentary on pop culture on TV? Yeah.
I discovered all my favorite things, Arrested Development, Rufus Wainwright, Shrek 2.
This must have been around the year that Charlie Brooker's Screamwipe took off as well, because that was obviously a huge thing for our generation, and the early seasons of that were just really good. I'll just double-check that, but no, I started in 06, completely disregard that Matthew.
He might have been doing his column in The Guardian still.
Yeah, The Guardian Guide was so good for so many years. That was amazing. But that was a great column for sure, so yeah, key stuff for sure.
Okay, finally, one hour into the podcast, we get to some video games chat, Matthew, proper video games chat, as we talk about what happened in the E3 this year, key events in games more generally, but we get to our top 10s, which many listeners will probably be able to predict based on what we've discussed already. So key events, Xbox 360 launches in November. Slightly controversial, I suppose, because the console, the original Xbox, was only four years old in North America and under four years old in Europe when it's launched, which is a really quick generational turnaround.
So they kind of left behind those players quite quickly. But at the same time, when they launched next gen, the most expensive 360 was £280 over here. I mean, even if it did fucking implode, as it would turn out that it did, the actual hardware, an amazing deal for the time, really.
£280, very, very reasonable. They really wanted to win that generation and made all the right moves, as we'll talk about shortly. The Game Boy Micro launches in September.
Matthew, very late in the generation, sort of GBA refresh, but quite a nice little curio. Do you have a sort of ranking of the GBA form factors, ones you prefer?
No, I like the Game Boy Micro. It just looks stupidly tiny in my hands, but they're all all right. I think if I was to boot one up now, it would probably be the Micro.
Yeah, because that's the one where I know where it is in it. It's in a quality street tin in a house somewhere, so.
Yeah, so that happens, keeping the GBA going. The PSP finally launches in Europe and North America this year. It's took 10 months to get the PSP from Japan into Europe.
That would obviously never happen now. But it did mean that when it came along, I remember Christmas of 2005 was actually was quite a big PSP moment in Europe. I just remember that being like the hot toy to have that year in the UK, and then it dissipating almost completely the next year, and then DS becoming just so dominant.
So yeah, we're before the DS light launching here, but just as a PSP launcher is launching. So it's a huge DS year as we'll discuss. It's like things are really firing up, and I think people's doubts about the hardware were just sort of like swept away almost instantly.
And I think Sony really did themselves no favors by taking this long to get the hardware shipped sort of globally. So yeah, Matthew, this is a pivotal E3 for next generation, and a lot of the events that end up shaping our careers to some extent, and certainly the content of this podcast all happened in this E3. Did you note that as you looked at my notes here for what happened?
Yeah, I mean, there's so much stuff. Though, I mean, I rewatched the Nintendo conference, was the only one that I actually rewatched, and like content-wise important, but like delivery, you maybe don't feel that importance in the moment.
Yeah, retrospectively, it seems like quite a key one, you know? So, yeah, as we'll discuss. So, we'll start with Sony, which I punished myself by sitting through, not the whole thing, because it was one hour and 50 minutes long, Jesus Christ.
So I did skip through parts of it. Really boring for the first 30 minutes. A lot of like cell processor chat.
Obviously, this was the big thing. They were touting with the PS3, and you know, ultimately the PS3's architecture ended up being wrong for the moment, and people make games better on 360, blah, blah, blah, you know all that. But quite a sterile reveal for a console.
Feels like we're in full, kind of like Sony has just done too well with the PS2, and so now it's a little bit self-indulgent wankery about the whole thing. Takes a long time before you get to some anything resembling gameplay, I would say. A lot of tech demos, probably because they just hadn't got the hardware in people's hands at that point, and they were just really kind of like winging it.
So you had, oh god, some EA stuff that was quite boring. There was like a key thing that was, a key thing was them showing Alfred Molina, a CG model of him under different lighting conditions. But I would say that there were many better looking characters on PS3, and this isn't that impressive.
But I think they were just big into showing off that they had that Spider-Man connection at the time really. I think the point was to show we can do film quality CG graphics in games.
I guess they just had a model of Alfred Molina to hand because of the film, right?
Yeah, that was it basically. They were like, oh yeah, we spoke to our friends in Sony Pictures or whatever, and got them to pull these files basically.
Imagine thinking that's going to be your big console reveal is here's Alfred Molina. I like Alfred Molina and even I think that's a hard sell. The man on the street is going to be like, what?
So yeah, I would say the second best rendering of Alfred Molina after Indiana Jones, The Great Circle, obviously. So yeah, it's like if you want to merge Alfred Molina with a jacket potato, this video really gives you what you're looking for. It doesn't.
So among the tech demos was the absolute bait bullshit of the Final Fantasy 7 remake video that's in here. I completely forgot this was this year. It was like he shows the video and instead of starting by saying, we're not making a game of this, but we want to show you what we can do with this hardware, they show the video and then Yoichi Wada, the then head of Square Enix says afterwards, please note that we're not currently making a remake of Final Fantasy 7 and the crowd just goes, oh, in this really audible way.
They don't respond like that to anything else, but you can just tell that the rumor like absolute. I would say this is a start of quite a NAF run for Square Enix, quite a not knowing what to do with themselves generation or just struggling to get games going on the console, because obviously it takes so many years for FFXIII to come out. So that's really NAF.
There's the Getaway tech demo that doesn't really amount to anything. A lot of tech demos don't amount to anything in this show, I would say. There's a fairly standard PR montage of developers talking about what the PS3 is capable of.
So you have the likes of Ted Price from Insomniac, Sam Houser, very rare to see a Houser in a video talking. That's like, I was a bit taken aback to see that. Julian Egbret from Factor 5, who would be doomed by the six axis controls with Leia.
It's like season one of Game of Thrones. All these people are going to get fucked by PS3 in later seasons.
Exactly. Hideo Kojima is there, obviously. Big PS3 guy.
And there's a bloke from Koei who weirdly announced Nioh, which would come out 12 years later. Cause it was based on an abandoned Kurosawa project or something like that, Matthew. I think it was called Oni or something.
That's what he says in the thing. And I was like, I'm going to look up what this game ended up being. And then, yeah, there's an actual, later on in the presentation, there is a teaser, video teaser for Nioh, complete with the blonde's main character and everything.
It just goes through development hell on Earth, it would seem, just to get to finally come out years later. Yeah. Then there's like a bit about the, I think it actually is Yuichi Wada who says this, the PS3 will be fully backwards compatible with PS2, so you can still be excited about Final Fantasy 12.
That was kind of like a bit of a lie, obviously. It was, the PS3 was initially backwards compatible, then they got rid of it to bring the hardware cost down. I personally don't think they should have done that.
I think they, or they should have created a cheaper model that didn't have it, but kept the original model that did have it. That's what I think they should have done with PS3. It's one of the reasons I think the console was a bit of a bummer.
And so MGS4 has announced the PS3, but it doesn't get shown until TGS later that year. Other stuff comes in a montage at the end like F1, the tiniest possible morsel of Devil May Cry that shows absolutely nothing. Some Namco, Gundam Nonsense, Tekken.
The earliest glimpse of Red Dead Redemption, like a tech demo basically of a Red Dead Revolver sequel. Obviously that takes five years to come along, but you can maybe see a tiny bit of like, it's basically just a Wild West town with a protagonist who looks nothing like John Marston, but it looking like next gen. But it's like, I would say at first sight, you know what you're looking at, it is Red Dead.
There's like a famously bullshit Killzone 2 demo from this E3 as well, which did turn out to be a nice looking game, but obviously didn't look anything like this. Gran Turismo HD. They then do another montage that's like new IP basically.
So you see some early footage of resistance, like hundreds of lads riding over a field and fighting some aliens. That is probably the most that anything in this looks like a real game I would say. That looks like plausible PS3 footage.
A lot of the rest of it looks like, oh, can you knock up a tech demo in four weeks because we've got to pretend this console has the juice basically. I would say there's a lot of that that comes after.
Did resistance already look brown as hell at this point?
Absolutely. It's funny seeing this so close to the Killzone 2 demo because you're like, oh, that's the defining color palette of this console basically. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You have this horny vaporware game called iIdentify with EYEI and it's horny because it's basically like two anime girls who are assassins who you talk to via the iToy. Very cursed, very of its time. I'm sure it never really existed in the real form.
Horny Project Milo basically. I think that was like the pitch of it, Matthew. What a terrible pitch it is.
An abandoned Sega game called Fifth Phantom Saga. I don't think this is even mentioned after 2005, so doubt it ever really existed. There was an FPS from Sonic Team, weirdly.
Heavenly Sword, which looks a bit like a proper game. I would say it's very tech-devil-y, but you can see them trying to position it as a cinematic Devil May Cry-ish kind of thing. You can see why it got the hype off the back of this.
Killing Day, more vaporware there, things that don't exist. And finally ends with the PS3 proper kind of reveal of what the hardware looks like, and that awful banana controller that was doing the rounds for a while, and like a mental amount of ports on the side of the original PS3 model they have later scaled back. Coming Spring 2006, apparently?
Nope, not true. I wonder how realistic that seemed, considering there's no gameplay really in any of this. But the proper big PS3 shit comes later that year at TGS.
And Metal Gear Solid 4's first trailer is the main one. That was a peak me logging on to gametrailers.com era, Matthew, watching that trailer.
gametrailers.com.
Yeah, exactly, some E3 2005. It establishes the first chapter of the game pretty well. It's that one that starts in first person, you don't know what it is, and then Old Snake appears from around a corner and sort of like disarms the guard.
And then it flips, like, this is no FPS, it's MGS. It's classic, like, Kojima sort of showmanship, fun nonsense. So that's Sony this year, Matthew.
We're well on the road to the PS3 being a very cursed object, having a bumpy launch. Any thoughts on this?
I just, you know, wasn't a big PlayStation guy, and it wasn't, I just wasn't following it, really. There was no question I was going to be buying this thing. So, yeah, I remember watching the ridiculous Killzone trailer and thinking, well, that looks amazing, you know, the density of it and then the final game looking really not a lot like that at all.
But, no, I was just, like, you're still pretty close to my Nintendo-only kind of era at the moment. So it's very, very hard to get me to turn my head.
Yeah, I think this is a year where people are sort of like a bit more open to what the PS3 was pitching. And then the next year when they announced the price, the 599 price, and I think maybe the Ken Kutaragi, you can pay $200 for GTHD thing also happens like the next year. You know, he was predicting the future, really.
There would be plenty of games now where you can spend that money and more on them. But, you know, that environment was much more like, oh, their hand is completely off the wheel here, and they are selling basically a dream factory rather than just video games consoles, which they were very, very good at previously. So, yeah, it's not quite going wrong, but I do remember picking up PlayStation Mags at this time and thinking, hmm, I'm not totally sure about why they're banging on about this cell processor and all this stuff.
Which, you know, the Emotion Engine with the PS2, they did plenty of banging on about that as well, but, you know, you kind of saw straight away that there were going to be rad games for the PS2, and with this, you were just a bit more like, not totally sure I'm pumped about this generation just yet. Xbox, by contrast, quite interesting their E3 conference. They are making headway with Xbox Live, which I imagine they were probably doing better than Sony on this.
I'm not totally sure how many people were playing Socom at the time, but they passed 2 million subscribers. It starts with a load of original Xbox stuff, Half-Life 2, which I think was quite a problematic port for the original Xbox, quite a demanding game for the old hardware there. They actually announced the 360 at an event earlier in May on MTV with Elijah Wood.
I actually completely forgot this happened, and then it came up on social media about a couple of weeks ago, Matthew, because we passed the anniversary of that event. Really strange event, really strange. Feels a bit more like a bit of SponCon than something Xbox really crafted because it's 20 minutes long.
It starts with a live performance of Somebody Told Me by The Killers, peak 2005, and then as Elijah Wood comes on stage, Jenny was a friend of mine, another Killers banger from Hot Fuss, the first album, not Hot Fuss, I'll point out a different thing. Elijah Wood comes on the screen, there's a load of marketing spiel about Xbox's digital revolution, and then we cut to another performance of Mr. Brightside, really strange. Then it would honestly be a better fit for the Xbox One reveal, given how that event ultimately ended up going.
Mr. Brightside's lyrics are very Xbox One coded, I would say. You have Tony Hawk, Need for Speed, Madden, Cameo, a tiny bit of Gears, Ghost Recon 3. What's weird is I couldn't quite grasp why Gears has not made a huge deal off.
It's not really necessarily positioned as like this is the game that will define the console in a way that I think that these manufacturers really identify now what their key games are going to be. It's just one game of many, which is funny because obviously in 06 it would be the game. There's like a really confusing bit where they pimp my ride guys, pimp out an Xbox and put like a screen on it and a load of like decals and stuff.
It's really weird and very 05. Then there's like a whole section where these like mega fans of Xbox have flown to Rare to kind of get a behind the scenes glimpse of Perfect Dark Zero, which is like the game they're making a big deal out of. Then it ends with a very cursed Perfect Dark Zero death match featuring a celebrity on each side, Will de Valderrama from that 70s show and Steve Hahn from Linkin Park, which really cracked me up to see is like deeply 05 code of choices.
Editors note, I meant Johan from Linkin Park. That's an embarrassing error considering how much numb on core I absorbed into my brain in 2005. It ends with another killer song, Smile Like You Mean It, which is quite a downbeat song, quite a weird thing to end a console sort of reveal on.
But the actual E3 conference, way, way better. So they announced the release date is late 05, 360 games on show there start with horny old Dead or Alive 4, which obviously Dead or Alive was a really important part of the original Xbox story, but didn't really end up being as important to the 360. Jay Allard shows off the old Blades and Xbox Live interface.
You just look at it and you're like, oh, so good that, like it was such a good interface that. They seem mega confident about what they've built. They're like, yeah, online is at the heart of all of it.
There's like replaceable face plates, ability to watch TV, stream music, all that stuff showing off. Then Peter Moore comes on stage to really talk about the games in more detail. I do enjoy Moore, he's sort of like, I still think, I still always like Bristle at the, when Video Gamer said Dead Space 4 was canceled and Peter Moore was really like, vehemently like, no, this is not true.
And then Dead Space 4 obviously didn't come out. So he then reveals Lost Odyssey of all things, then it's PG-Off 3, Gror is shown there, NBA, Cameo, Call of Duty 2, they show the D-Day footage, which is obviously amazing for the time. It is all running at about 15 FPS, but you can still see it's quite impressive.
Then Oblivion is there, obviously, I think they identify that's a big deal. Then yeah, a fair chunk of Gears of War. This reveal is so good, Matthew, because Sony is bragging about tech and using really stuffy language.
Xbox is down to earth and covering every base, like Western games, Japanese games, PC ass games, like single player and multiplayer. It's got a mix of everything. They know online is the heart of it, but it's not all of it.
The only duff note is Don Mattrick comes on stage, and I've got like an involuntary shudder I do now whenever I see Don Mattrick in a live stream on one of these things, because it's just, it's never good, you know what I mean, it's never good when Mattrick comes on stage. Some boring EA stuff. EA always managed to get into these conferences because obviously they make, they sell so many copies of games.
Square Enix are announced as a partner to First Generation, so again a Japanese focus, but the reveal of FFXI coming to 360 is a real duff note, super naff. But obviously significant later on, because 360 gets the launch of FFXIII simultaneously with PS3, which is kind of a key moment in these things going away, exclusivity deals. And a compilation at the end shows Condemned, Saints Row and Dead Rising among many other cool games.
This console just really cooking Matthew, any thoughts on all this?
Yeah, I definitely remember watching some of these things and the thing you were saying earlier about these were games that looked like they might have belonged on PC a few years earlier, but now looking as good as they looked on console, as someone who just was so far away from owning a PC financially, you know, a console was a bit more kind of achievable, so that was exciting. I was definitely more into this than I was PS3. My friend Cyrus, a good university friend of mine, pre-ordered a 360 and got one super early, so it just felt a bit like realer, a bit more kind of tangible and yeah, I was into it.
Yeah, getting out a year ahead was just such a good move by Xbox. They really, it must have like, they probably had to move heaven and earth to get there, but they knew that that was going to be their competitive advantage, and so they were right, and they really underestimated just how badly Sony would blow the generation, so it all kind of end up going in their favor. I wouldn't do Nintendo, Matthew, but I've been talking a lot here.
I've made notes here, you've watched it again. Why don't you take us through Nintendo for this year?
Yeah, so I watched this very late last night, and Ben and me and Catherine were laughing at how monumental a lot of the things were that they were saying. You know, they're basically outlining DS and Wii back then, called The Revolution, but it's a lot of talk and not a lot of specifics. There's very few games in this.
And then you start off with this compilation that shows Nintendogs, Maricard DS, Metro Crime Hunters, Twilight Princess, and you think, oh, we're in for a real run of games. But then you actually get, as is tradition for E3 at this point, more of a sales talk from Reggie. And I don't know, I'm not super into Reggie's whole deal, because I think there's a lot of fudging numbers to try and make the story look a bit more successful.
You know, they're like, we've sold 2 billion games over the history of Nintendo. And you're like, yeah, but what does that say about right now? I don't know.
They've got this lead on PSP, and they've obviously got DSL, as they can shout about. They've sold through 5 million, just twice as much, twice as fast as the PSP. Reggie's quite bullish about this.
Yeah, there's a great quote where he says, it talks about how they got to Europe before the PSP, and he said, oh, we got there when we said we would. That's Sony's issue, not my problem. And everyone's like, ooh, just they all like Reggie shit talking stuff, shit talking the competition.
There's that really awful bit at the start actually, where it plays like a, kind of like a, almost like a sort of, what I describe as like a dance track remix of Reggie's speech from the year before about my name is Reggie and about kicking ass and taking names.
Yeah.
And then Iwata appears and kind of responds to it and does his own riff on it, where he says, you know, I'm about my name's Iwata and I'm about making games. And but then he does say that he played Reggie at Smash Brothers the night before and kicked his ass. And he said, he said, I say to Reggie, who's your daddy?
And it's like it's it's just it's bad. Like Iwata is, I think, a very charming figure.
Yeah.
And goes on to do great things. But I don't like this, like pandering to like an obnoxious crowd. It's kind of embarrassing.
There's a lot of it in this era of Nintendo, I would say.
Yeah. I mean, this is just I mean, God. So after this tour, they have this terrible bit for Electro Plantain, which is a cool thing.
Experimental little music game on DS. But they get this DJ who I'd never heard of, David Hollands, who's like going to make a live track in Electro Plantain.
Yeah.
And it just goes on for fucking forever. And no matter how much he says about how rich the sounds of Electro Plantain are, it is just a guy tapping two DS's while these like blinky, blunky noises happen. And there's just no sense of energy in the room.
Like no one's like, woo! Or there's no clapping or anything. It's just a silent audience in silhouette watching a man play Electro Plantain for five minutes.
Yeah.
Bad, I'd say. It's quite a, quite a naff bit where they're talking about Nintendogs, which I think has already been out in Japan, but they've given like a localized version to Tina Wood from G4 TV, who I don't really know as a figure. She comes out and does a little presentation of this.
There's a bit where her dog interacts with Miyamoto's dog. And annoyingly, the feed doesn't show you what's happening. Right.
But the audience is laughing and they're laughing and in a bit of an embarrassed fashion, which without being able to see the footage, you're like, what the fuck's going on? Like, is Miyamoto's dog like mounting the other dog or the other way around?
Does that happen in Nintendo?
No, it doesn't. But like that's what's implied because they're like, oh, and he's like, Miyamoto looks like a bit embarrassed. Like, I can't believe this is happening.
But I'm like, well, what could that interaction have been?
You know, was this the only appearance of Miyamoto in this live stream, Matthew, as I was skipping through it? I couldn't. I don't know if I know.
Yeah, I think it was because this is still like back when there's like, this is Miyamoto's next game and Miyamoto has made this. And that means something, you know, they talk up like Miyamoto is working on something for Revolution and he's going to show it off, you know, next year. And, you know, there's quite a lot of buzz around that.
So, you know, I guess having him anoint one game as his feels like quite a sort of canny move. I think Nintendogs has a pretty good showing for like what it is. There's quite a bad bit where she tries to show how she's voice trained her dog to respond to the Legend of Zelda and the words Ganon and it does fucking nothing.
And she just has to like sell it like something's happening, even though it's not. I don't know, it's probably more impressive what they announce and show around the edges. You get a little compilation, you see Ace Attorney, Animal Crossing, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Advance Wars, New Super Mario Bros.,
Castlevania Trauma Center, Vitaful Joe.
Amazing.
The things which are going to give it an amazing end of 2005 and that 2006 where it becomes the DS, the important console. So, they're absolutely on the right lines. I just don't think they necessarily make it sound hugely exciting in the room.
You get this long talk about the revolution, which, like a lot of all butters philosophy of like opening up the audience to new gamers, we're going to have a controller revolution, it's going to have new online features. They specifically say it's going to be backwards compatible with previous consoles. They sort of announce the virtual console.
It's not called that at this point. But he's also very coy and says, I'm going to tell you about it, but I'm not going to say what it is. I'm just going to leave you with a lot of mystery.
They don't show the controller, they show the base of it, which it's quite small and interesting looking, but it's not necessarily the most exciting thing about the Wii. It's just like there's going to be a very different controller, but you're going to see it later. And there's several groans in this presentation where he's like, you're going to see this in a bit, you're going to see this in a bit.
The only things they really announce is that there will be an online Smash Brothers, there is going to be a Mario, there is going to be a Zelda. They show a teaser trailer for Metroid Prime 3, it just sort of says 3 and you see Samus jumping around on a gunship. That's about the most concrete thing you get out of this.
Watching it now, everything he says is true. And in terms of what they're trying to do with it, maybe their timelines are off. He says there will be an online Smash Brothers at launch, I think, which doesn't obviously happen.
And the online element of it isn't particularly good or interesting compared to what's happening with 360. But maybe these are just like the investor keywords you have to say at this point in time. Like everything now is fucking AI, everything then was like, yeah, we're going to really nail online.
But the key bit is like, it's going to speak to gamers. Old gamers, new gamers, and non-gamers. And that's obviously like, that's the thing that is the making of the Wii.
So, you know, kind of interesting rather than exciting, I'd say. And then you get a little bit of a sort of like, I would say, sort of sad fart of GameCube at the end, where like, you know, latter day GameCube, it's all a little bit Battalion Wars, Killer 7, which looks cool, Mario Baseball, Christ, you've written in these notes, Mario Strikers, I'll add Christ, that should be in these notes, Mario Party 7, Fire Emblem, Path of Radiance, fine, but, you know, Fire Emblem isn't really the thing that it is now.
Can we have one more Christ for Mario Party, by the way, Matthew?
Mario Party 7, a further Christ. And yeah, a decent chunk of Twilight Princess, which is exciting and it's probably the right thing to end on, but it's not a stellar kind of end to the GameCube story, really. At this point, I think I only bought one of these games that they announced, you know, I was only excited about one of those games, but, you know, this, I'd say this is like the last time for a while that Nintendo are like, maybe a little bit more on the back foot.
Like, 2006 E3, the Wii reveal is, you know, whatever you make of the final games, it's got a way more energy to it, and it becomes more like what I'd say that like modern E3 is. It's a bit more of a show. This is a bit quite low-key, quite boring.
Too much electroplankton. That's my assessment.
Yeah, I think it was, the balance of it was off, but there is so much amazing stuff, like you say, around the edges, that my eyes have lit up watching some of the compilations and seeing a bit of Ace Attorney or Animal Crossing in there and being like, wow, they're so close to absolutely dominating.
I mean, they have no idea as well. Yeah. Because there is something a little bit apologetic.
There's stats for the whole GameCube era and GBA, early DS. It's always a little bit, oh, well, it's actually good if you look at it this way, where eventually it becomes, this is undeniably good and you can't argue with it, so.
Yeah. I actually, I was much more pro the Iwata stuff than you are. I think you maybe correctly identify that there's little concrete to show here.
And that's like maybe a weakness of the presentation. But as a thinker about how games are sold and how games are made, like he talks about how the encroachment of eight-figure budgets, for example, and he sounds cautious about that.
That's a great shout.
He sounds cautious about that. And he says that basically implies that Revolution offers a different option because you can see that price escalation coming. I mean, what is strangling the industry right now is its budgets, right?
And so Nintendo has always been, I think, aware of that. And that's why their approach to making consoles has not traditionally, not since the Gamecube, been about being number one on sort of like tech hardware grunt, basically.
He does that funny bit, he says, well, I promise is, he says, even though I'm not going to tell you about it, when you see the graphics it's capable of, you will say, wow. And you're like, dude, it's a fucking Gamecube.
Yeah, that part is bogus for sure. Like, that is fair to balance it out. But I do like that the line he says I think is really key is like, this is a console where big ideals can prevail over big budgets.
And you're like, this guy was the goat, you know? He was just so good. So yeah, I do agree with all that.
The Gamecube thing is really funny to end on. I feel like that guy who they roll out at the end, like a Nintendo US marketing guy, is so like, he gets the real bum deal in that presentation. And yeah, yeah, the Nintendo thing I kind of agree with you, it's very rare to see a woman at one of these things for sure.
But it's also weird that it's just a journalist from outside the Nintendo ecosystem.
Yeah, you never see that either really, that's strange. But yeah, odd little presentation, but I would say that probably Nintendo by accident ties with Xbox for like the best presentation of the C3 because they have lots of stuff that's about to completely change the industry. But like you say, don't quite realize it yet.
Interesting stuff. Okay Matthew, well that is the very long preamble done. So with that in mind, let's take a quick break and we'll come back with our top 10 lists of 2005.
Welcome back to the podcast, Top 10 Time, after all that preamble, classic Back Page nonsense, Matthew. And like you say, a lot of these games we would have discussed before, so I imagine there'll be some slightly brisker chat for things we talked about in the past. But there's definitely gonna be some fresh picks in here too, I think, that haven't come up quite as much.
So why don't you kick us off with your number 10?
I'm gonna kick off with Call of Duty 2 on the 360.
Higher on my list.
Not bad. Not on your list.
No, higher on my list.
Oh, higher on your list. Well, let's talk about it when we get to the higher version.
Indeed, yes. I imagine there's gonna be a bit of that on this episode too. So, okay, my number 10 is Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories on the PSP.
It was basically the most amazing tech showcase I'd seen for a handheld console ever. And the idea of my favorite Grand Theft Auto's world being condensed onto a handheld was something I just had to see, had to get, and my parents very generously bought me a PSP this year. It was, you know, but for the time cost-wise, not too bad really, the PSP.
I think they had to actually import mine from Hong Kong, and it was like 190 quid or something, which is above the RRP because it's sold out in the UK. I think Sony were just struggling to get these things made. And even though it's a very also-ran GTA, there's nothing about it that's really new or fresh, and the old kind of PS2 formula for these games is getting a bit tired.
That screen on the PSP, combined with this game, was properly mind-blowing. Sort of like a lesser version of GTA 3, really, a prequel set a few years earlier, with the character Tony Cipriani. I was a bit disappointed they didn't go and patch in, like, being able to control a helicopter or something like that, just something a bit different into Liberty City stories.
But the point of it was just that they'd done it. They'd put PS2 quality GTA onto a handheld. So, very impressive.
I was wondering if you ever sort of heard about this or encountered this, Matthew, in the wild?
No, it's a huge blind spot for me. The handheld GTAs outside of Chinatown Wars. I don't know if they're even things I've watched videos of.
I think I've only ever really seen static screenshots. The appeal of that kind of 3D GTA in your pocket. I definitely get that.
Yeah, I imagine these are incredibly cursed to go back to now.
It wasn't quite as hard as GTA 3 and Vice City. I think they did soften the edges on it slightly. I managed to finish it with no cheats, for example.
So it can't have been that bad.
A game that hard and frustrating cannot be on a throwable console. That is just a recipe for a lawsuit.
You're speaking to a man who had to fight Choto Ghost on a Nintendo Switch recently. So I'm familiar with this level of frustration. It wasn't quite as annoying as that.
But it's one of my most vivid memories. It's being on holiday in Spain at Christmas. Turning this on, seeing the PSP menu screen for the first time.
Being like, wow, it's so beautiful. And then just seeing a bright blue sky in Liberty City on there. And being like, oh, I cannot believe this has actually happened.
And it was probably the last time anything like this was really the case. There's a bit of it with Breath of the Wild on Switch, perhaps. Yeah.
Is it the same kind of soundtrack as GTA 3? Or is it more like, as a later game, have they put a bit more like radio music in or?
I still didn't really recognize most of the music. I would say there was about, there was maybe like about, it was definitely more recognizable than what you had in GTA 3, which only really had the Scarface music and a few other things that were sort of known. There was-
I know that the handheld Vice City's got quite a distinct soundtrack of its own, right?
Yeah, it's nowhere near as good as that. I think what happened is, is they saw that this game sold really well on PSP, and so when they did Vice City stories, they were like, okay, well, let's invest in this, like it's a proper GTA basically, so you get an incredible soundtrack. So, no, it was a bit, unfortunately, this version of Liberty City was cursed with slightly lesser music, but still had its moments, had Free by Ultranate on there, had a bit of club music on there, had its own version of the Lazlo radio station.
It was okay. It was fine. But that's why it's a number 10, Matthew, and not higher on my list.
So, yeah, we'll see number nine.
My number nine is Fahrenheit.
Not on my list.
Quantic Dreams. I played this on PC. Very easy to make fun of this.
Obviously, the beginning of, like, the modern David Cage project in terms of interactive storytelling. The major weakness of this is the story it tells is complete ass. Starts off as quite an interesting on the run sort of thriller, you know, where you're cleaning up after a murder you don't remember committing in a cafeteria or toilet, but ends up being, like, an old lady, like, fighting the internet, who is a person.
It's such ass. It gets so overblown. But certainly the earlier bits where you are a man just trying to kind of cover up his crime and avoid the police catching you puts you in some interesting scenarios.
What I did like about it, though, and has remained, you know, a strength of David Cage's is its desire to put you in situations and experiences that other games hadn't done before. And whether or not they completely work, a lot of them are just quick time events or like quite math mini games. But they are trying to sort of show a bigger spectrum of emotional moments in a life than simply running into a building and fighting loads of people.
And I think that seems less impressive now where because of like the huge spread of indie games, so many different experiences have been turned into games and people draw inspiration from so many unlikely sources that actually Fahrenheit seems quite conservative. But at the time the idea of like this is a game where your first mission is to clean up a murder scene, that you're like, well, I've never done that in a game before. There's never been anything like that.
This seems really exciting. And you know, I can't, I will always have that initial excitement even though the game is quite like naff to go back to and sort of slightly diminishing returns with these games in general, I'd say. But yeah, naff, but I liked it.
I mean, I bought this game not too long after it released. It was like it was discounted quite quickly for whatever reason. I did, I actually think there was, there was like a lot I like about it.
I've dissed it as a as a PS2 draft pick, obviously, in recent history in this podcast. But I do think that it taking it trying to do something approaching adult drama or Fincher kind of style crime drama has is like it was it was valuable for the time. It was his attempt or their attempt, Quantic Dreams to to basically like level up the maturity of game storytelling.
That was like it was a I think a sincere attempt to do that. Whether you like exactly how the execution pans out or not, that is what I think David Cage has given to games is a net gain. You know what I mean?
Like it's aspiring to something, even if you don't get there. And a lot of people would argue he hasn't got there. And I don't love all of his games.
And particularly Beyond Two Souls, which I think is probably the weakest of the Quantic Dreams games I've played.
Yeah.
But I don't know. I was certainly going for it at the time. And there's like just touches in it like I think is it Marlena, Martina, Toppy Bird, Sandpaper Kisses playing in like one bit where you're walking around, I think the apartment of one of the police officers.
It's just like a bit of touches like that that just made it feel a bit like, oh, they are trying to do something a bit more elevated with this and...
Yeah. But it also has some very dumb touches. Like the fact that every time you do a negative or bad action, it affects your mental health.
And if your mental health ever drops below a certain point, your character kills themself. But the interactions that can trigger that can be like very mundane things. So there's a bit where if you go into it with low enough mental health to begin with, and you try and get a drink from a vending machine and the vending machine's broken, it knocks you down just enough that the guy kills himself, which is like obviously ridiculous.
But, you know, I guess these things are going to happen when you have a system like that.
Yeah. It's the fact they were trying to do a lot of like stuff with the sticks as well, the analogue sticks as bits of interaction. Like it was, I think, a bit ahead of its time in some ways.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you definitely feel it slipping into like a irreparable state of storytelling bullshit at a certain point, unfortunately. That's the thing, it's like it never gets back to what it was when it started.
That's kind of the tragedy of Fahrenheit, but I think that's why it belongs at the bottom end of this list, Matthew. Yes. I think that makes sense.
For sure.
Okay, my number nine is Amped 3 on Xbox 360. This is one of my all time kind of like cult classic 360 favourites, and it's only like number nine here because this is a fucking great year for video games, by the way, like loads of good stuff. So I was a huge fan of this because it is a snowboarding game, and I've talked about this before.
I can't remember when it came up, but it also has quite a lot of attention paid to narrative and sense of humour. And so there's a lot of weird pop culture riffs in it. There's an extended Final Fantasy 7 parody in it, and a large storyline with some quite affable characters, and some very sort of, like, I would say, kind of sort of scrapbook-y, stickery UI design and fun touches that just makes it feel a bit more than just, like, another snowboarding game.
And it was just so particular as an approach to making this kind of extreme sports game that it really resonated with me, and I just really loved it. And as well as being great to play, I think it just tonally found a sweet spot. It was like the opposite of the...
It actually feels like what it would be like if someone made an extreme sports game now. It would be much less like frosted tips, attitude and much more sort of like, it's a good hangs kind of game. And so that...
It's a republic.
And so, yeah, well, that's it. I mean, so it's... Which is getting turned into a movie, by the way.
Why? Why is it happening? I saw that.
Well, I wanted to know the backstory of all these characters.
Yeah, how did the mountain reach this particular... this particular sort of shape and status? Yeah, so I was a big fan of it.
It was like one of my early pre-owned purchasers I got from Game Station for the 360 and really got into. And I always recommend it to people, even though harder recommendation now is not backwards compatible, which is a real shame. But I love this game.
I don't think many people ever really played it. It's the last one in the series, Matthew. And so, yeah, you know nothing about it, right?
So, yeah, so nonetheless, I felt like a good pick for this list. If you ever, if you still have a 360 kicking around and you, you know, there aren't really many snowboarding games around. They don't make them as much these days.
Like, I think this is still probably among the best in class. Yeah, so loved Amp 3 and here it is. Still chuckle at the kid at my school who thought the first game was called Amped and referred to it as such during conversation with me.
I'm a big Amped guy.
I'm like a medieval guy.
Amped.
And verily he was well and truly Amped.
What's your number 8 Matthew?
My number 8 is Condemned Criminal Origins.
That's my number 8 too.
Oh, there you go. Great minds. Yeah, monoliths, grimy but properly scary.
So first person survival horror investigation game. A 360 launch game where you track a serial killer through grim tenement buildings whilst also on the run from the police. That's how I remember it anyway.
A bit like Manhunt. Very seven coded. Down and dirty, really sad, forgotten buildings.
Bludgeoning lunatic hobos to death with blunt instruments. I wouldn't say it's got an ugly attitude, but it's got quite an ugly soul, which is why I sort of liken it to Manhunt. It's sort of unapologetically grimy, but very atmospheric, very scary, solid visual showcase for early 360, lots of like fun light and shadow stuff, very kind of chunky character designs.
Kind of an all-timer scary bit in a department store with some mannequins. Bit of a cliché now, I guess, about the time. You know, you hadn't really seen these things.
And if you were, you know, I'd say if you were kind of in that sort of 18 to 25 kind of demographic and had loved 7 and whatnot, the idea of getting to explore these these kind of locations and smash people up with lead pipes, it just seemed quite kind of edgy and exciting.
Yeah, I love this game for similar reasons. It's got a very dark heart to it. I don't think they would make I don't think a big publisher.
I don't think Sega would make a game like this now at all. But it's as well as having Greg Grunberg as the main character, Matthew, a very important, yeah, very important. It's also the fact that it has like that's like a scanning kind of mechanic to it.
So it does feel like a sort of a bit of a detective game, even though it is mostly like about first person bludgeoning, like you say. Obviously, the bit of the department story is the kind of like the highlight people go to is like the scariest moment of the game is incredible. But in general, I think it is quite frightening.
And yeah, just a very cool, kind of 360 exclusive to get to kick things off with. It's quite a cool game to have in your sort of second tier of games to get people excited. And I think it's one of the ones that has like maybe people have the most cultural memory of.
I don't think anyone really talks about the second one or remembers it that well. Second one much more Saw inspired, I believe.
Right.
And only on 360 and PS3. But yeah, it's this game was just super cool. It had that first person physicality that games were getting better at where there was just this like it felt more like what you were doing was really happening.
And Half Life 2 is a key thing in that that sort of transition.
But it just went to be a dick as well a little bit.
Absolutely. Yeah, really a huge part of it. So games went from being like first person games went from being like shooting galleries basically to just feeling like you were truly immersed in the world.
And that was obviously a huge generation for first person games and those genres moving forward. And this is kind of like the parallel sort of like melee horror track of that. And yes, it's a cult favorite for a reason.
And despite all that, never get some fun DLC in Monkey Ball. It's not the only Sega franchise. Why isn't there a hobo in a ball?
Why wasn't in those Sega Sonic Racing games like Greg Grunberg in his little car with his bludgeoning tails, Matthew? Why did that ever happen?
Or at least just a level set going around like a department store, just a generic warehouse of which there are many in this game.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's not very long either, Condemned, and it is backwards compatible on Xbox Series X, so that's cool. Okay, my number seven.
Wait, no, your number seven, Matthew. What is it?
It's Fear.
Ah, not on my list, but only because I didn't play at the time. Talk on it.
Yeah, I mean, I guess a Monolith double build this. Good year for Monolith and Scary Dark Buildings. This was PC FPS, that's why I played it anyway.
My dad had quite a capable PC of playing games, so yeah, I could enjoy this in all its cutting edge glory. Maybe a bit of a weird game in hide sites. You know, a first person shooter with very meaty weapons, had a bullet time mechanic, which, you know, as we've said many times on this podcast, was sort of a holy grail of video game design in the early noughties.
Anything that could make you feel like you were in the Matrix, even a tiny bit, was very, very cool. This was like a particularly handsome version of it in slow motion, with all bullets going off and whatnot. Very responsive, reactive AI just kept the pressure on you.
The guards would have lots of interesting behaviours, be able to like run around the environment and thank you and whatnot. Just felt like very sandboxy. One of those games where if you die in Trireme again, the fight's probably going to play out a little differently, which is quite important to enjoying these things.
But I think what makes it unusual is while there is that side to it, it's also sort of stitched together with this quite spooky J-Horror campaign where, you know, as well as the enemies you're fighting in these various buildings, there's like a lankhead kind of horror sprog jumping out. Is it Alma? I think her name is.
Yeah.
And the game has a lot of fun with, you know, where your first person perspective is, suddenly having her come around corners, there's a nightmare bit where you climb up a ladder and then she's at the top of the ladder and whatnot. And so it's quite a good combination of, of like scary exploration, punctured with these like blistering firefights. I think between those two, manages to distract from the fact that a lot of this game is set in some quite drab environments.
Like I don't know if it has a huge amount of identity outside of like the firefights and those horror sort of jump scares. It just feels like a little bit like with Half Life 2 the year before, this is a slightly different kind of shooter. It's not like as narratively heavy.
It's like quite pure. It's not quite like Doom 3 in terms of just firing through waves of enemies, but it's kind of like a quite a nice halfway house. Not too high for looting, but you can sort of still enjoy it.
And looked absolutely amazing on PC. Was never as into the sequels which I played on 360, but this one, yeah, you know, it was cool. Monolith having a good year.
And again, you know, boohiss what happened to them eventually.
Shit, isn't it?
Oh, rubbish.
So yeah, that was rubbish. I agree, Fear, amazing. Only reason it's not on my list is because it didn't play at the time, like I say.
I think though that what you say about the levels is true. They're not like mega distinctive, but the actual approach to set piece design in them does feel very handcrafted in a way that it doesn't feel like you're just emptying out loads of boring officers. It feels like the pacing is quite considered and why you're there and what you're looking for and what you're being led to next.
It just feels really tightly designed in that way. I actually quite like the quiet confidence of, oh, the environment is going to be super normal, but what actually goes down there is going to be the thing that messes you up. That's probably more interesting than what Fear does, which is lean right into the supernatural high-concept stuff and then kind of loses identity in that journey, you know?
Yeah. It becomes quite a lot about that Alma character and they think they've got quite an iconic figure in her. And you're like, do I really care about the ongoing story of this thing?
Not really.
This is a famously good 360 port as well and a famously stinky PS3 port, Fear. It's one of the Hall of Fame bad PS3 ports.
That's an episode.
That's a Patreon episode. That's the XXL tier Patreon episode. Okay, my number 7 Matthew is God of War.
Is this on your list?
It actually is on, which is maybe bad.
Well, you know, I kind of get it. We did the rankings and it was the lowest of the non-handheld ones, right? That was where we put it ultimately.
But this is, as we said on that God of War episode years ago, out of nowhere, this game is fully formed pretty much what it is from that first battle with the Hydra on the boat, where it's a very angry man with these cool blades, who basically is going to smash up some big monsters. It's going to look amazing, it's going to sound amazing. It's going to be very, very silly, and a very fun interpretation of Greek mythology.
The worst of these games in the sense of the pacing is a bit off. It's quite slow in places. As I bitched about previously, the desert where you have to go and find the sirens, go looking for them, so boring.
There's a few bits to it where this puzzle's going on for about five minutes longer than I really want it to, and you're kind of keen to get back to the action, which later ones, particularly God of War 3, of course, our beloved Curse game, is just phenomenal at pacing. This game is not, but it is still. All those action mechanics are here at the gates, the abilities are just super, super good.
It's exactly like, I imagine this is such a surprise at the time for something like this to come along and feel so confident. It's just everything that kind of like the series does is pretty much here, as just enough variety to kind of keep it going. And the character, the Kratos character, you know, an actual successful attempt to make quite a distinctive sort of PlayStation mascot, I guess.
So yeah, I still think of it quite fondly, even if it's not one of the very best of the year. Hugely significant, though, that it comes on long at this point, Matthew. What are your thoughts?
Yeah, I'd agree with all that. I think it's got a couple of like very, very smelly difficulty spikes, which I don't like. Climbing up that fucking rotating spike tower in the hell section, that's quite rough.
Yeah, some of the puzzles, some of the box kicking or pushing puzzles are not hugely fun, but yeah. The opening half hour of this game is kind of like everything God of War sort of should be and will ever be, and it's a great introduction to the character. The second you see the first sort of like finishing quicktime event button hovering over the sort of Hydra thing that you fight at the end of the first level is a real like, oh, this is cool.
Like this is kind of like a slightly next level way of doing this. So yeah, I was all in on this series to begin with. I just, it's been surpassed a bit too much by the others.
It's true. It's cool though that even from the start, they know that the Zeus Fury lightning ability is like, just really cool. And like using Medusa's head to turn enemies to stone.
That's an amazing ability to come up with in your first attempt at making one of these games. It's not like it's super pedestrian and then it gets really wild. It starts wild and gets more wild.
I do agree with you though on difficulty spikes. It was not the most fun to go back to, but the fundamentals of the series still hold up very, very well. So yeah, what's number six, Matthew?
Killer7, Capcom's Gamecube weird game with maybe Suda51 with some assistance from McCarmy. Probably the game I like the most that I understand the least. Very, very confusing.
Like Suda51, before he becomes just like mega goofy toilet humor guy, I think his earlier games are a little bit more highbrow and complicated and philosophical and sort of artsy in a way that I don't necessarily understand. You play as the split personalities of a wheelchair bound assassin running through sort of 3D environments, but on a fixed track, occasionally anchoring yourself to go into first person shoot, at which point sort of feels a little bit like a light gun game, because you're kind of locked in place, enemies are walking towards you, you've got to hit very specific targets on their bodies. So it feels like it's pulling from all kinds of different games, different genres.
There's a hefty dose of Resident Evil in it, from the fixed camera angles on the environments. There's some quite cryptic read shit puzzles, which are Resident Evil-esque in terms of just like nonsense logic. Very very stylish, always looked absolutely amazing in screenshots.
Kind of a game that once you saw it on the pages of NGC, you're like, well I'm gonna be playing that and I have to have that regardless. And I think you may be put up with some like uneven difficulty and moments of confusion and not having a lot of fun, just because it feels so distinctive. And it feels like something you kind of you want to be in on just because it's so different and so cool looking.
So maybe a bit of a kind of postures game, saying that, you know, we've got some friends who are like super into it. So no shade on them. There is a boss fight where you shoot a man's evil possessed Afro, if I remember correctly, which is which is quite stupid.
Yeah. And a story that, like you said, I don't understand. Even after reading the wiki synopsis of it this morning, I was like, what the fuck is this about?
Like the ultimate style of a substance game. But I kind of I was I was pleased it happened at the time.
Yeah, I wish I should really play this at some point. This is definitely on my list of like GameCube kind of curios to sort of tick off over the years. And it's on PC and I believe it's very easy to play on PC with a with a mouse.
So that's OK.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I think it basically breaks the game to play with the mouse.
So, yeah, it's I've always meant to. And, yeah, so beautiful looking for the time and just one of that selection of Capcom games. It was like, it's cool that the GameCube got that, even if like it didn't sell too well.
And, yeah, but it really kind of cements the cult of Suda this game, doesn't it? It kind of sets them up to be to have some actual commercial success on Wii with No More Heroes.
So that's cool. I do think his sense of style and silliness is better paired with sort of likely like baser stuff. I think No More Heroes is a better marriage of gameplay and ascetic and general style.
His wanky storytelling is like my least favourite bit of his earlier games.
I think that's probably fair. Yeah, I should really go back to this. I remember Tim Clarke on PC Game was always very big on Killer Settlers.
So yeah. Okay. Good pick, Matthew.
So even though it's not a draft, I don't know why I said pick. That's weird. Okay.
My number six is your favourite game of all time, Star Wars Battlefront II, Matthew, by Pandemic. No different energy to that name in that studio these days, I will say. But I wonder if they had to have changed it if they were still around.
I don't know. So yeah, something to think about. This is a weird year, actually.
I think this is the year that, for some reason, Pandemic and Bioware merge as a kind of entity, like they get combined as a company and then sold to EA at some point. That was weird. But anyway, Battlefront II.
Like the first one, which came out one year earlier, rough around the edges, multiplayer Star Wars shooter. The difference with this one was they added space battles for the first time. So you basically had one giant ship on one side of the map, one giant ship on the other, a few smaller ships in between that you could go blow up.
And then the game was basically, can you land your spaceship on the other spaceship, get into their engine room without the other player really noticing, and then blow up as much stuff as you can, then go off while they're incredibly annoyed to see that all their fucking life support systems and shit have been blown up by you just tossing grenades at it from within. That's basically what it amounts to. What's funny about all of Pandemic's games, as I don't think they were ever great in mechanics, they were just like very fun, silly toy boxes in an age before multiplayer games became super, super refined.
That said, I don't know if there's like much in it between the likes of Fortnite and these original Battlefront games. They're fairly like imprecise feeling things. They're quite casual multiplayer kind of PVP experience.
But nonetheless, very much enjoyed it Matthew, because some of the Revenge of the Sith stuff they added was kind of fun. There's some good maps in here. They added a mode called Hunt.
We have to fight loads of Ewoks or loads of those ice creatures like the Whompers. That's it. And just really dumb.
It's like one of the silliest Star Wars games ever, but still deliver scale in this really, really exciting way. And yeah, I know you don't really like these games, but here it is.
I just don't have much experience with them, but I like hearing your stories about them and the colour is always sounds great. So I'm sad to have not been there at the time and miss these.
Well, I think people still like these more than the EA ones as well, despite the EA ones being objectively better first person shooters. So yeah, funny that it's just, I think there's just something about the chaotic, slightly comedic nature of the original ones, the idea of all these toys being smashed together, that people appreciated more than like, oh, look how shiny this Frostbite Engine Snowspeeder is. So yeah, and that's why that classic version that came out, people still bought it, people still enjoyed it.
And yeah, I frayed my relationship with my brother off the back of it, so good stuff. What's the number five, Matthew?
My number five is Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow.
Not on my list.
This was the first DS Castlevania follow-up to Aria of Sorrow, I think, on the GBA, like quite similar to some of the GBA games, but I think everything was a little tighter. I think it's got an all-timer of a castle to explore. I love that it's set in, like, modern-day, so it's all kind of, you know, traditional Dracula's Castle on the inside, super gothic and scary.
But outside, there are, like, vans parked. That's, like, quite a fun juxtaposition. It looks amazing for a DS game, beautiful sprite work up front, often using sort of, like, sort of polygonal castles in the background, just to give you a sense of scale, often very, very impressive.
Huge bosses, giant boss sprites, you know, stretching over several screens. There's an absolutely brilliant bit. We spend ages climbing up this tower, fight this sort of fleshy demon thing at the top.
I can't remember its name. And as you fight it, it kind of tumbles through the floor, and then you go flying back down through the castle, sort of chundering through all the floors. So it has a bit of an eye for spectacle and sort of set piece as well, which I really liked.
Mechanically richer than some of the GBA games has that mechanic where you harvest souls that give you new abilities, which is definitely they've done before, but slightly improved here in that the more souls you harvested of a single kind, that power would level up. So there was, you know, there was like a reason to churn through enemies and repeatedly backtracking and fighting back over all ground. You just naturally level up all these things, which is quite cool.
You could forge weapons from the souls that you didn't think much of as well. So yeah, just a good game with lots of lots of little tweaks and improvements. Very handsomely made.
You know, some people think this is the beginning of just like a killer trilogy on DS. I was never that into Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesius, the other two. You know, they're solid.
But I thought this one really delivered on like, here's a big castle, loads of powers, some slightly ropey touchscreen finishes on the bosses. But I always thought that was a tad overblown, the kind of push back against that. So yes, a really, really good, really, really good game.
Dawn of Sorrow.
Yeah.
DS of course.
Of course.
They're hidden in its title.
Played this a bunch for the DS draft that we did. And yeah, very, very handsome 2D art. It's always nice when you go back to a DS game and realize they've done really good pixel art instead of slightly shit 3D art.
So yeah, that's always very welcome. And so yeah, these are very, very handsome games. So a good choice, Matthew.
OK, cool. Castlevania it is. OK, my number five is The Warriors.
Is this on your list?
Didn't make my list. No, I just contemplate it.
Betrayal. Well, it's a game we talked about loads of times. It's been drafted in two PS2 drafts, probably came up in the Xbox GameCube draft as well at some point.
Anyway, Rockstar's brawler based on the 1979 film? It's something like that. So old film anyway about a gang whose leader is framed for assassinating a bloke who's trying to coordinate peace between all these different gangs and who basically have to get back to Coney Island, their base of operations, while being hunted through the New York night by lots of themed gangs.
A very, very fun film to watch, extrapolated into a very detailed kind of like brawler by Rockstar. Very unusual that Rockstar's only licensed game is this, but very them, very of this time, kind of like decision for them to make. And super, super cool.
Has very much its own kind of soundscape inspired by the film. Does a great job of setting up the different conflicts between the gangs. Gets most of the actors back to make it sort of sound and feel authentic.
And just really fun as well. Like really, like the most, maybe other than Bully, the most accessible kind of like version of these PS2 Rockstar mechanics just got pretty good at the actual like hand-to-hand combat in a way that GTA 3 and Fire City were just like nowhere near this good at those things. So yeah, and would actually be great if they did a HD version of it, because I don't think there are many games like this you can sort of play entirely in co-op and kind of go through a story.
It's a bit like playing something like Double Dragon, I guess, or that sort of thing. It's deliberately, by design, like that, but it has the kind of slightly more Rockstar-y explore the area, your base, around your base a little bit in between. Yeah, great stuff, Matthew.
A real kind of like one-off from this generation. Any thoughts?
Yeah. A kind of mode of Rockstar, it's sort of sad that we'll never see this sort of size project from them again, unless things really change, which they won't.
They won't.
So you know, rest in peace. This era of Rockstar.
It was good. Yeah, it was good. Much as I'm excited about GTA 6, it was cool.
They made things like this around the sides. OK, what is your number four, Matthew?
It's WarioWare Twisted on the Game Boy Advance.
Ah, not on my list.
Yeah, well, it never came out in the UK. It came out in the US and Australia and Japan. I bought this a few years later on a press trip to San Francisco.
Famously has a gyroscope cart, so it sort of sticks out the top. Very very satisfying. I mean, it's WarioWare with a gyroscope, which I'm sure you can imagine, you know, quite similar to some of the ideas in WarioWare...
Move it? Shake it? The Wii one.
Whichever. Smooth Moves. That's the Wii one.
In that all the games are controlled by tilting the Game Boy Advance left and right. I think, if anything, it like works better than some of the other kind of motion or like the Wii remote ones they did. Just because the cart is built just for this game, you know, just for the input required for this game.
The cart also has like a little bit of like rumble in it, so it kind of clicks in a very satisfying way. It's incredibly tactile. I'd say it's actually got a nicer motion sort of like feedback than, you know, any of the other motion controllers Nintendo have ever made.
But, you know, that's what happens when you make a bespoke cart for one game.
It's cool.
You know, if you can imagine things like Super Mario Brothers, World 1-1, except it's now on a sphere and as you rotate it, Mario runs around the outside. Those, you know, that's an example of the kind of thing that they do with the gyroscope. It's a lot of WarioWare classics reimagined with tilt control, so you're swinging things around or rotating weird designs.
I thought actually the spherical element of this game and the fact that they put a lot of things on like rings and hoops and whatnot gives it quite a surreal touch. Like there's a lot of classic WarioWare games, but now they're kind of circular and slightly kaleidoscopic. Just yeah, really fun.
Great selection of little unlockable trinkets, toys and mini games. I think a slightly more generous package than the first WarioWare, but you know, a good model of what they'd go on to do. Just take a good idea and just absolutely like throw 300 dumb ideas so they can see what happens.
So yeah, a real shame this never came out. If you ever get a chance to buy a secondhand copy, I would recommend it. It's really worth playing because you can't emulate it very well without that card.
It just wouldn't capture the experience.
That sucks. That's lost the time. You know, like I'd love to play basically a fresh WarioWare game with that mechanic.
Well, you're more welcome to borrow my copy. That's an offer to you, Samuel, not the listeners.
I appreciate that. That's like an extension of the me being on the Castle Switch Online plan. Get to borrow real life Nintendo games from Matthew's little quality.
I kind of do want to play that, actually. Like I might... Let me get that thought, Matthew, when I come back to you.
That's cool. Yeah, can't believe that... So they could even replicate it in like the gyro controls of the Switch or the DS3DS or anything like that.
Is it really just...
Well, I mean, actually, I guess they could, but they haven't.
It's not in like the WarioWare Gold or anything like that, any of the minigames they do.
I don't think so.
Damn it.
But like the whole thing, like all the menu and everything, like it was all based around this sort of rotating thing. It was, yeah, they just really, really commit to the bit in a way that I really admire.
A bit like how you tilt the controls in the certain dungeons in Tears of the Kingdom, sorry, Breath of the World. A bit of that energy to it, Matthew.
Yeah, a little bit. Not as frustrating as that because it only lasts for three seconds, so.
Yeah, not trying to basically do impossible things with a ball to make it reach the other side. Yeah, okay, cool. That's a great pick.
I really wish I'd played that. And I don't think it's come up much of the podcast before, actually, so that's actually a nice little bonus, kind of new recommendation for people.
Finally, some new content. Two hours and 20 minutes in.
Okay, my number four was earlier on Matthew's list, I think Matthew's number 10 is Call of Duty 2. So really just incredibly impressive first-person shooter that came to 360 as well as PC, which is where I played it on 360. It was one of the first things I went and bought in 2007 after I got my 360 because I had heard that this was basically like the best World War II game of all time, that it was even better than Medal of Honor Allied Assault and really built on the ways in which it simulates the idea of loads of other men in battle with you and the idea of being part of these larger set pieces that feel very populated.
It was just really great at conveying that. It also just did just tons of amazing stuff with bouncing around the world, showing you different parts of the campaign and letting you inhabit different characters, and it felt very all-encompassing in that way. The shooting was just great, of course.
Even I think it looks like next to Modern Warfare, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare, there's quite a gulf in terms of what they could visually achieve. I think actually there's still some of the slightly, not freeform, but slightly less rigid set piece design to Call of Duty 2 that I really liked that was lost a little bit with the Modern Warfare entries onwards. They become much more regimented, run from scripted event to scripted event kind of games.
And I think that even though there's definitely tons of that in too, it really, yeah, there's every now and then, the feel of the mission styles is a little bit more old school PC FPS design and a little less hit all the beats at the right time, Matthew.
So it's giving me that thing with GTA where people are like, do you remember Call of Duty 2, which was a fully open world sandbox, first person shooter, and you're like, no, you are misremembering that.
No, it's not really that, but it's just the pace of it is ever so slightly different. And then obviously a multiplayer mode that almost ruined your university education, Matthew. You want to speak on it?
Yeah, that's why I included it on the list. This was the last local split-screen shooter that I properly played for a long time. Yeah, almost scuppered our final year of university playing four-player split-screen, running around Karen Tan, listening to the best Danny Elfman.
I don't think you can really appreciate the sights of real World War II battles unless you can hear the Midnight Run soundtrack playing in the background. Really powerful memories for me. Like I say, if I ever hear any of those bits of music that we ripped onto the 360 out of context now, it gives me flashbacks to World War II, which wasn't a war I was involved in.
But yeah, great. I love these multiplayer maps. Occasionally one of them will get resurfaced in a newer Call of Duty, or form like the bones of a map, and you'll be struck with this, oh I've been here before.
I've walked around these corners and these houses, but they looked different at a different time. So yeah, it's nice to have one proper war memory.
Yeah, you've served in your own way, you know. Yeah, I believe that.
I don't think that's stolen valor.
No, will they remember you when it comes to sort of remembrance day, Matthew? Will they, your sacrifice, will that, you know, I hope that they do, you know. It seems like a pretty important part.
I don't think many other people's war memories are set to the ever-incisor hands, but there you go.
The weakest part, I remember, of Call of Duty 2 was the Northern Africa campaigns, like where you're going across the desert in a tank and stuff, like the European theatre stuff was always the more interesting thing about it.
Yeah.
Basically building on what Allied Assault was, right, and I assume what the original Call of Duty was, I've never played the original Call of Duty, but yeah, it's like a greatest hits package of everything you can do with a World War II first-person shooter and it's probably why they're never interested in revisiting it in Infinity Ward, because it's kind of like their last word on it, isn't it? So yeah, good stuff, Matthew. What's your number three?
Donkey Kong Jungle Beat.
Not on my list.
Maybe this is a little high, I don't know, but I'm thinking a lot about this game at the moment because this is Tokyo EAD, they of Mario Galaxy, Odyssey, 3D World, 3D Land fame. This is what they did between Mario Sunshine and Mario Galaxy. Obviously, we think they are currently making Donkey Kong Bonanza.
Hasn't been confirmed, but quite likely. So the idea of them going back to Donkey Kong, you know, not actually completely out there. A lot of their leadership worked on this game, you know, in like a director, producer capacity.
Koizumi, who is quite a key figure in Nintendo now. You see him in a lot of directs. He directed this.
Heishida, who is the director of Mario Odyssey and Wonder, was like the lead programmer and level designer, maybe, on this. So it's got amazing pedigree, 2D Donkey Kong game that you play with the bongo drums, peripheral. You can't play it with traditional controls.
You had to have the drums for it. You hit the drum, one drum left or right to run in that direction. You hit them both at the same time to jump, and then you clap to do like a stun attack and to activate sudden objects.
So quite a minimalist control scheme, which they stitched into a movement system that was all about doing things in these amazing combos. Kind of a halfway house between a rhythm game and a platforming game. Because once you're up in the air, it starts building a combo that breaks the second you touch the ground.
So you're really encouraged to like use like barrel cannons, and swinging vines, and wall jumps and whatnot. Which obviously you end up being very rhythmic in your claps and your drum bangs to pull off. Very tactile, very much its own thing.
No other platform would quite like it. Though, I think you can definitely see a lot of the design sensibilities of those later 3D Mario games in it. It's definitely made in the same engine.
There's a lot of textures and effects, even gameplay mechanics like swinging along flower stalks to fling yourself up, which are then in Galaxy. The behaviour of certain things. You know, when Galaxy switches into 2D and Mario's swimming through bodies of 2D water in space, there are similar things with Jelly in Donkey Kong Jungle Beat.
So, you know, if you do love particularly Mario Galaxy and you have the ability to play this, I think it's a really interesting stepping stone. You know, a step away from Mario Sunshine towards like, what their new kind of design sensibility. So, a really interesting history lesson, also just really fun in its own right.
Very, very colourful. Giant bosses, some really amazing camera work where the camera pulls right out and you suddenly see this like epic scene and Donkey Kong like rides various creatures and gets chased by like huge snowballs on one of my insect pieces. Just a very, very cool game played by very few people because of the whole drum situation.
A very diminished port on Wii which got rid of the drums and had you do it with the Wii Remote. I think it's like quite poor played that way. So yeah, you should definitely try and play this.
I looked at the Wikipedia page for it. Apparently they tried to advertise it when it came out by getting 20 runners in the Los Angeles Marathon that year wore Jungle Beat branded clothing, carried DK bongos and kept chanting the game's title as they ran. Which seems like quite a demented thing to do.
It's up there with Des Lynam dying his moustache purple for the launch of the game tube.
If I was watching the marathon from the sidelines and just a load of people ran by going Jungle Beat I wouldn't be like, oh I better buy a game. I wouldn't know that's GameCube game. That seems confusing to me, but whatever.
Well it's funny because I think this is a proper, this is one of the ultimate real heads know Nintendo games, this one, because I don't think I had even heard of it or knew what it was or knew that it was significant or knew that the Mario Galaxy people worked on it before doing this podcast with you. That's how memory hold I think this game is because probably the bongos are part of that, but also it was near the end of the GameCube era, so that too is pretty bad combination really for a game's discoverability, plus the terrible marketing as you outlined there doesn't help either. So yeah, I always like hearing you talk about it though, and I guess very similar to WarioWare Twisted in the sense that you will never get to experience this the way it was intended to be experienced again probably because why would you buy some very yellowing bongos on eBay?
Couldn't they have done some Labo bongos, Matthew? Is that not a thing they could have done? Oh god.
A cursed proposition for you there.
It is interesting that like, because if you consider the Mario team, particularly the 3D Mario team, like probably one of the most important teams at Nintendo, it's like them and the Zelda team, the idea that they would make a bongo-powered Donkey Kong game as like their main project, that's quite an interesting move. Rather than like a Sunshine 2, they were like, well let's do this, this is the thing. But I just think people will also forget that they have steered Donkey Kong before, like they have previous form, they've made a good Donkey Kong game.
So...
Well you're the one who's down on it. I'm excited.
I'm not down on it, I just, like I said, it's needed to be like, I need it to be a 10 out of 10 Astrobot killer.
The real narrative that merges, I can't wait for that. I will ask you at the end of the year, did this kill Astrobot, Matthew? That would be funny, that's really funny.
I love that. So my number three, I don't think can be in your list. Mario Kart DS is not on your list, Matthew.
It isn't.
That's why, so Fahrenheit's on your list, but not Mario Kart DS. This was like an all-timer, break the handheld market open game, Mario Kart DS. This is not on your list.
What's the, what's the thing there?
Yeah, I just didn't have a huge relationship to it.
Right.
Like, I don't know if like, you know, because I got a DS when I started on NGamer, and by then you were just sort of swept away with like trying to keep up with what, you know, what was brand new on the magazine.
Yeah.
And it's one of those things where, you know, I've played it, I've played it online, I've played it with friends, and you know, I absolutely get it. I just, I just didn't have like a super close relationship to it. So I was unmingling and ah-ing about it.
I know actually in hindsight, the second you said Fahrenheit, I was like, oh yeah, it seems dumb. Dumbness, not on there. But it's just more about like what it means to me at the time, I guess.
I mean, I get it. It's kind of similar to what I fear wasn't on my list, I guess. Yeah.
So I fucking love Mario Kart DS, and I thought it was such a step ahead of Super Circuit on GBA, which was a tiny bit of a bust, I think, because playing on my mate's original GBA with a dark screen, and then the sprites being good for what the GBA could do, but just not quite getting as close to what Mario Kart 64 was, as he wanted it to be. And then playing this, and it looking better than Mario Kart 64, and just a lot smoother, and just being a 3D Mario Kart of just doing everything you wanted to do, and also having the wireless multiplayer, just amazing shit, just so, so good. And it was a time where I had so much spare time on my hands, I could just chuck hours and hours at it, and I got so good at it, I played loads of it with my little brother, I played loads of it with my mates at the time.
But this and Animal Crossing were my go-to sort of like play multiplayer, DS games together kind of thing. And that was definitely, that and PictoChat, Matthew, huge deal for me, multiplayer-wise. And yeah, I really just really loved it.
It just did everything that you wanted it to do and had that mix of like fresh tracks and then also tracks that have taken from the previous games. And so it just felt like they've done a slam dunk Mario Kart again. And it was the first time since the 64 that a Mario Kart was everything it needed to be like visually and also gameplay-wise, without the kind of like distractions of what they tried to do in Double Dash.
Yeah, just wonderful. And I still think is, you know, they definitely build on it. There's no reason to go back and play this one over, you know, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and obviously Mario Kart World.
But, oh man, just to experience this on the DS at the time, you can totally see why the DS becomes so huge off the back of this. What a great advertisement for what the multiplayer capabilities of the handheld are. And yeah, just so uncompromised is the word I keep coming back to, Matthew, thoughts?
Yeah, no, I'd agree with all of that, absolutely. I think maybe a little part of it is like even now with the newest Mario Kart, you know, I have more of a split-screen local multiplayer thing with it. You know, I've never gone like all in on online Mario Kart.
Yeah, I will forever associate it with being a slightly more local communal experience, even though you can have that with DS, I recognize that. I think that that's maybe part of it. Yeah, but I absolutely get it.
I do feel a bit dirty for not including it.
No, it's okay. It's just, you know, when you talk about like the DS like taking off, properly taking off in this moment, this game is just such a key part of that story.
Yeah, I've not done a very good job of representing DS in my list, you know, apart from Castlevania, like there's no...
Electroplankton Snubbed.
The Mary and Luigi game, Partners in Time, Kirby Power Paintbrush, you know, all very much in contention, but not quite in the list.
Well, a lot of our defining DS games come to Europe in 2006, so we covered on that episode, like I think Trauma Center is 06, I think.
Yeah, Ace Attorney.
Ace Attorney, yeah, Animal Crossing, Wild World, so yeah, that's part of it, I think.
Oh, and Dan comes out in 2005 in Japan, I think.
Oh, right, yeah. So, oh, fuck, maybe I should have put, oh, no, I didn't play that till much later.
No, we've talked about it. Everyone knows Owen Dan's good.
Exactly. Okay, speaking of games that people know are good, what's your number two, Matthew?
Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater.
My number two as well.
Oh. Yeah. I was gonna say, yes, there is a slightly better version of this Danmaline, but I also think Kojima games are maybe never more interesting than they are, like right at the outset, that first time round, discovering what does and doesn't work mechanically, what the weird boss fights are gonna be like, where the story goes.
You can only have certain experiences for the first time, and this one was full of them, and particularly with Kojima games being just so rabidly covered in games magazines. If you read PlayStation Mags or Games Master or whatever at the time, it was quite hard to get to Metal Gear Solid 3 without having the whole thing kind of laid out for you. I managed to have a pretty good run of it when I rented it from Blockbuster, and I got to see stuff that I didn't necessarily know about.
The incredibly long ladder with the weird song. Those things just sort of hit different the first time. The fight with the end.
Just having kind of like, you know, mind blown by the scale of that and how much they kind of commit to the bit. You know, a game I have grown to like, appreciate even more on replays down the line and like maybe just being slightly better at the game, being able to kind of enjoy the stealth of it. I think the first time around, I just wanted to see the story and all the shit that was going to happen.
But I remember that being a really, really great time. And I was amazed at how well it held up when we did go back to it for that episode. So yes, I just didn't think it was ever getting me as good as this.
I really thought it was going to be slightly throw away. I thought the whole 60s thing and the James Bond kind of prestige was going to be like mean. It was sort of frivolous enough where actually it's maybe like the most coherent he's ever been.
Yeah, I don't have like loads more to add on this because we talked about it so much on different episodes, but I agree with everything you say there. And yeah, the 60s thing, I remember too, I was like, my hype for MGS2 was out of control. My hype for MGS3 was non-existent.
I was like, well, that's not going to tell me how the Patriots died 100 years ago, is it? That's the only thing I fucking care about. So get on with it, tell the story.
What happened to Olga's baby? All that kind of stuff that ultimately ends up being quite inconsequential. But yeah, like I remember a friend in the first Curse College I went to saying to me, no man, you've got to play this game, it is unbelievable.
And yeah, playing it and then just not realizing this would be the peak of my kind of like, I guess like Kojima's games having an emotional impact on me, you know, in terms of the storytelling being as good as it is. So yeah, and soon to be perhaps a third version, like a second better version of this coming along Matthew. So no doubt we'll discuss that later in the year, which leaves us with a number one that is quite obvious.
What have you picked Matthew?
Gunstar Superheroes. Resident Evil 4.
Yep, indeed.
How could it not be? Probably like one of our most discussed games on this podcast. Yeah, a formative game.
You know, at the time, I couldn't be more hyped for something. I never, you know, I didn't think a game had ever looked better on the pages of a games magazine than this did in NGC. And playing it and see it absolutely deliver, I just couldn't believe it.
Playing this over the Easter holidays when a lot of my housemates had gone home and just not having anyone to like share it with and to be able to like point to it and go like, do other people not see it? You know, can you see what I see? Because this is like, this is like next level.
There is nothing else quite like this. And yeah, the pacing of it and the variety of it and the consistency of it is so, so good. Yeah, very hard game to like endlessly we're on about because, you know, we've done it.
I think people know.
Yeah, they know. It's like the do they know the Batman meme, but they know Matthew, they know. Yeah, it is wonderful.
And actually, like, it's so good, the original version of this, that in like recently pondering, playing it again for something, I did think about just playing the original in VR, because I've not finished that version of it. But much as I really like that remake, I think it's fantastic. And I would say most people should just go and play that.
I mean, the original was set standards in terms of pacing. You know, it's the way it did over-the-shoulder shooting, contemporize all third-person games, hugely significant. And so that means it holds up very well, I think.
Yeah. And just like you say, amazing to discover in the moment, like kind of like gives you the feeling that a next-gen game kind of makes you feel, because you think about how the gulf between what they could do with Code Veronica and what they did with this. And you really see the fruits of Mikami and company scrapping what they had and starting again so many times.
Yeah, like hugely bold and impressive game.
And wonderful.
Ever see a leap of its kind again, you know, like if there's another series has got a leap like this in it, you know, just don't see it, you know, just feels like we're all the, you know, all of the sort of like mechanical fundamentals of how games work were figured out in the basically like this year in the five years to follow, right? In terms of what first person shooter would be, what a third person shooter would be in terms of like bringing cover systems the next year with Gears and so much of, and like, you know, oblivion the year after sort of doing the kind of like, this is what an RPG will feel like in years to come. And it's, yeah, all the rules get figured out in the years to come here and they never really change again.
And so games are kind of in a bit of a bit of a weird stasis of just kind of like endless refinement and nicer graphics, Matthew. But until Donkey Kong Bonanza reinvents the 3D platformer, we can only hope or at least hope it just kicks Astro Bot's ass anyway. Speaking of which, I fucked it, by the way, Astro Boy Omega Factor came out this year in Europe and I fucked it.
I thought it was an 06 game. I should have had that at number five and kicked down all my other entries, booting Liberty City Stories out of the list. Fucking great game.
I'm sure I've talked about it before. Just a game that you have to repeat. You have to play through like four times to see every bit of it, but it's such a rewarding journey and it's a treasure shooter.
So the combat is unbelievably good. Amazing sprite art. All-time a GBA game that I bought on play.com for $9.99 this year.
Fucking great stuff. So love that and I fucked it. But nonetheless, Matthew, those are two very solid top 10 lists.
Very much enjoyed that. And it closes the loop on all these years. And don't worry.
I'll cut out most of the therapy chatter of mine earlier in the episode. So it's a bit less depressing for the listener. And it gets to the games a bit quicker.
But it's been fun, hasn't it, doing all these episodes?
I like that there was more talk about the hot air balloon than there was Resident Evil 4.
I think just people just know at this point, they're right. They've been on this journey with us. They don't need to hear the same few things over and over again.
You all know what Resident Evil 4 is like. Not all of you know what a balloon trip is like.
I think it makes sense to give more time to something like Amped 3 or like Fahrenheit or Condemned than it does to…
I absolutely agree. We've got a whole episode on Resident Evil 4.
Yeah, and there will never be a whole episode on Fahrenheit. We'll never get that desperate.
Well, I don't know. That's got like year 12 energy.
Well, okay Matthew, I've very much enjoyed this and we will come back. The two giant men will return with The Best Games of 2017. That will be the next one that we do.
So Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on BlueSky and Letterboxd and things like that.
Yep. And I'm Samuel W. Roberts on those platforms as well.
The podcast is at BackpagePod. If you want to support what we do financially, patreon.com/backpagepod. Seems like everyone who runs an independent media outlet these days goes, support independent media.
But we are, you know, technically independent. This podcast certainly supported me this year when I was looking for work. So very grateful for any support that we have.
And we are always blown away by the support that we do have and really appreciate it.
It keeps me in balloon trips.
And yeah, and you get two additional podcasts a month this month. That is Metroid Prime, Two Giant Men Play, Metroid Prime Remastered and an upcoming podcast, The Mission Impossible. So good stuff and we appreciate it.
Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
