Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how are those January blues treating you? Were you shocked by the amount of Velvetizer feedback you got from the episode last week?
I was surprised of all the things that happened in that episode, that's what people Zoomed in on.
The funny thing is, we did get good feedback for that episode, but there was a point in the middle of last week where I said to you, Matthew, I think this might be the worst episode we've ever done. And yet, the listeners did not mind, that completely shows I am out of touch with what the listeners actually want, so that's good, reassuring. So yes, this week, though, is the Now Playing, so that's fun.
And Now Playing, it's not called a Now Playing, what we've been playing, sorry, Now Playing is the old PC gamer format. I've got a big mid-January brain going on. Actually, I didn't really ask you about your January blues, how is January treating you?
Yeah, fine, isn't today the saddest day of the year or something?
Oh, Blue Monday.
Isn't that a thing?
Yeah, I guess so. I feel like I've had sadder Mondays than this, but...
Oh, yeah, oh, definitely, definitely. Yeah, I mean, I've had some terrible things happen like in the course of my life that didn't happen today. Like the saddest thing that happened to me today was I saw Boy in the Heron yesterday and thought it was merely fine and was thinking about that and thinking, oh, that was a shame that I didn't like it more.
That was the saddest thing that happened to me.
That's not too bad, really. What's the saddest thing that happened to me today? Oh, yeah.
Well, actually, this is a several-day sadness now, but my new favorite sandwich joint in Bath is Taylor's Bagels. And basically, they have renovated. It's like a fancy bagel shop.
It's like a fist of bread, basically. It's like eight quid for a bagel. It's a serious business, you know?
And they have been threatening to reopen. I think it went last Thursday and Friday, and they still weren't open. It turned out it was Saturday they were opening.
And then I forgot they're closed on Monday, so they're not open today.
That's quite a little walk from your flat.
Yeah, but I like to do… I try and do… Not to get too into it, but I try and do like 30 heart points on the old Google Fitness every lunchtime.
So I don't mind doing that. It's almost a mile, yeah. So a power walk over there.
It's a very exciting life I live, Matthew. So yeah, but the bagel shop was closed. That was the saddest thing that happened to me today.
I can think of Sadder Mondays in recent history that really topped that.
One of my colleagues lives above Taylor's Bagels.
Oh, right, really?
Which I think would be terrible for me to be that close to that. It's a bit like The Velvetizer where I said it was like having my own meth lab. But I think having a huge bagel shop underneath me would be even worse than a meth lab.
It's probably more like the relationship between the palace and the evil temple in Temple of Doom. You know, where you just go downstairs and some like really evil carb shit's happening. I'm not pulling my heart out.
I'm just clogging it with crap.
Wow, I didn't even know there was like an apartment above there. It's true because they make their own bagels. So you would have the waft of like warm bread constantly.
I could work from home.
Yeah.
I'd be like, I have to get away. I have to go have a pret in like the city or whatever.
Your clothes. It would just become infused in all your clothes and everywhere you walked people would be like, that person smells of bagels. Is that a good or bad thing?
I don't know.
There are worse smells for sure. Like when I was in Japan, I got this, I guess slightly embarrassing Mount Fuji t-shirt from Uniqlo. And I fried a steak last week and it just smelled of sirloin for like, you know, like I'm talking like, like, well, basically till I washed it, it was just like, I didn't realize that beef could just soak in like that into clothes.
So it was a very unfortunate moment for me. So yeah, okay. What kind of weird little January so far.
Hey, this is an interesting thing for you, Matthew. This is the first podcast I've recorded where I'm wearing glasses. I mean, I know the listeners can't hear that.
I think you're going to say clothes.
No, I mean, I have fully clothed. That's quite rare, actually, that I've got trousers on to record one of these. So, you know, but that's January for you.
It's very really fucking cold and bathed. So it is what it is.
Wait, you sometimes record these without wearing trousers.
Yeah, I wear underpants. I'm not like, you know, bare-bottomed or anything, but I'm just, you know.
Wait, for real? Like you're sitting there in your pants?
Yeah, well, with a t-shirt. Yeah, yeah. That's like, that's just my hanging...
That's weird.
There's nothing erotic about it. It's just, it's functional, isn't it? It's like pajamas, basically, because we normally record this in the morning, don't we?
So, 10am. Are you fully dressed at 10am on Saturday mornings? That's not my vibe at all.
I get fully dressed for the podcast.
Do you really?
Like I was going to work.
Damn! That's like got big sort of like...
Dress for the job you want. Dress for the podcast you want to host.
Yeah, I mean, a podcast is like famously well dressed, I don't really know, but I feel like I've really appalled you with that information, so...
I'm just thinking back on all those takes and just imagining coming from a man in his pants.
They do seem less credible suddenly, don't they? It's like, if you know that now, can you take anything I've ever said seriously? I'm not sure you can.
Just cut to a man in his pants going, fuck, I just lost Tie Fighter. And it's like, I think you've got bigger problems, my man.
Yep, so some shocking news there on the lore of the podcast. That's completely rewritten everything. Let's just assume from now on I'll wear trousers to the podcast.
Bullshit, they're fine.
Well, you know, at least pajama bottoms. Is that fine? It's like, all those sweatpants.
Is that acceptable? They're kind of trousers, don't they?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm wearing like tracksuit bottoms, like hugger pants.
Right.
You know, like hugger, like the Nordic, you know, hugger.
Yeah, those are just words I never thought I'd hear coming out of you.
Well, well, well, well, Catherine always refers to them as hugger pants, so I'm assuming that's what they're called. Anyway, I feel like we've really buried that you've got glasses.
Yeah, I've got glasses. That's basically it. I'm wearing glasses now because my eyesight has been fucked for a long time.
So I'll tell you what, I'm really shocked to learn that video games look pretty good. I was like, I popped them on. Just played a bunch of things on my Xbox and I was like, wow, I can't believe how bright and shiny this looks.
It's just wow. So yeah.
This explains why you go back to every review you've written in the last 10 years and in pros and cons in the score box, you're like very blurry.
Yeah, it looks like.
Very blurry again. Again, a very blurry 4K game.
Games have got to stop using this Vaseline filter. That's kind of like my thing. Yeah.
So that's fun. All right. This episode, then we got a bunch of games to get through for the what we've been playing.
I would say there's a big sort of like January energy to the list of games here. You know, there's not much out yet. Me and Matthew try and keep on top of like new releases, but and there are a few of those in here.
But I would say that in general, there's a little bit of January energy to the selection. Do you think that's fair, Matthew?
Yeah, I think that's fair. A little bit of January energy, a tiny bit of glimpsing to the future, glimpsing towards the exciting future.
Well, that's it. Matthew's just got the inside track on so many more games than me, as all become clear in this episode and has been clear, I think, for the last year, really, but nonetheless. So Matthew, let's kick off then with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.
So you know, a really interesting one to revisit because, you know, there was obviously there was a redo of The Last of Us last year that was very extensive. This game does not really require the same facelift because it already looked pretty good on PS4 and then when the PS5 came out, they patched it with a 60 FPS patch, which is how I played it, which is a really nice way to experience it. I understand there's some other interesting bits and pieces to go along with this one.
So what's the deal? How come you decided to give this another go? It's such a long game, such a relentless game.
I know you weren't the biggest fan of it when it released, so what's the deal?
In truth, I booted it up just to see if it looked radically different to how I remembered it. And it doesn't. Like you say, it's on par to my eyes with what the original looked like at 60 frames on PS5 anyway, but it was already an amazing looking game, so that's not really a thing.
But yeah, I played an hour to see how it looked and then I found myself playing two hours, three hours, four hours and yeah, the next thing I know it pulled me through all the way to the end and I played about 30 hours of it again. More testament to the kind of relentless pace of that game and the way it pulls you into constantly new twists on encounters. I think there are two headlines this game.
One of them is playing it a second time. Once you know what's coming and you're not thinking too heavily or as heavily about the story developments as they happen and you have a better idea of like where you are in the campaign and how the game behaves, I think you can just enjoy it more on a stealth mechanics level. You know, I was less hung up on, oh my god, I've got to look after every single one of these things because I kind of understand the economy of the game a bit better.
I know that it gives you lots of stuff for crafting and so actually I could kind of throw Ellie and Abby at these mad situations and kind of just appreciate more the sandbox that they'd built. And I guess the second headline is that, along with the slight visual upgrades, there's a lot of behind the scenes stuff that they've added to this. Director's commentaries on all the cinematics and these three levels, lost levels they call them, which were levels that were cut from the original game and you get to play them in their semi-unfinished form hilariously and unfinished Naughty Dog level still looks and behaves much better than most finished games.
Which is quite galling, I would imagine, for other developers, but they each begin with Neil Druckmann on camera going, what you're about to see is basically a horrible piece of shit so don't think of it as like the final game and then you play it and it is just really very fine. So, yeah, it sucks to be everyone else, but that side of the game, that's been great, you know, I'd kind of liken it to, it's like an excellent DVD special edition as they used to be, like, just going in there, hearing all these stories, there's a fair amount of actually back patting going on. Any of the cutscenes which has got Troy Baker, there's a lot of talk about like the craft, but when he isn't around, which, spoiler alert, is most of this game, you can just hear them talking about the technical craft or little decisions that were made or little insights into just the naughty dog process and that side of it's been fascinating.
And considering you can get this remastered version as an upgrade to the PS4, you can pay 10 quid if you own the PS4 game and get this PS5 version, like it's probably worth it just for the behind the scenes stuff, I would say. If you are into that side of how the sausage is made kind of side of gaming.
Yeah, interesting. So yeah, I can't think of anything like this where they've done a sort of like off-cut of a level. Because the weird thing is that, you know, levels in Last of Us 2 are kind of like continuous.
They're continuous. They can last for like, you know, around 45 minutes or an hour. So the idea of like these individual chunks of them is quite odd.
And 3D games in particular, I can't remember if it's Sonic 1 or 2 where there's like a lost level they added back into it for like more recent editions. I think that was something that happened about 10 years ago. I vaguely recall that.
But I don't think anything like this has really happened with like 3D big budget games. So it's quite an interesting thing. What are those levels like, Matthew?
In terms of like how long they last?
Very like the Sonic Cut levels. One of them is Dr. Robotnik's mad acid factory. So that was wild.
I can see where they cut it. It just doesn't sit anywhere in those emotional arts.
Yeah, in downtown Seattle, it was a bit of a weird total.
I don't know if you remember, there's a bit where I think when you're on the way to the hospital as Ellie, she gets pushed out of a window and then moves down a river and then kind of washes up near the hospital. One of the levels takes place during that trip. She gets washed into the sewers and then there's a level in the sewers, which was cut.
So you then emerge at the hospital. You wouldn't notice the cut in the original game. And the other two levels, they're actually in that kind of end section at the farmhouse, establishing more emotional beats.
They kind of cover Ellie trying to sort of settle into home life, I guess. They're more story beats rather than like complicated action levels. But you can kind of understand why they cut them.
They just slowed the game down way too much. But what's really interesting is that you play these levels and they're dotted with commentary points themselves. And even for these bits they cut, you can hear like how they went through like seven, eight iterations and the challenges that they were trying to deal with in each one.
So like one of them is about hunting an animal and basically the whole kind of commentary journey through the level is talking about the struggles with the animal AI and making it realistic. It's kind of a riff on the deer hunt from the first game, but with a boar instead. They have all these problems, they come up with solutions, but they still cut it, you know, and it's that level of like even the stuff that doesn't make it has been through so many parts of the kind of overall process.
A lot of these things get cut for the broad, it just slowed the narrative pace. Naughty Dog, I'd say, are like reasonably open. I'm sure I've said this before, if you watch any of their GDC talks, they're absolutely amazing.
There's a great one on like the open world section of Uncharted Lost Legacy, where they talk about how to kind of pace a narrative where you can go in many different directions and things like that. And, you know, I think they are open about some of the mad processes they go through, but I'll kind of take as much of that stuff as I can, really. Here's a fact that you will love at the start of the game, when they picked Seattle, they basically planned how they were going to use Seattle by Sucker Punch gave them their 3D model of Seattle that they made for Infamous Second Son.
Oh, I love that.
And then they looked at that and they use that to work out how geographically it would all work. That's stuff like that I really like.
That's cool trivia. I want to hear like the same thing when someone next makes a New York game and they just use the Spider-Man 2 New York. That's cool.
I like that idea.
In the past, when we've talked about The Last of Us Part 2, I was definitely a little cooler on it than you were. Did it not make my top 10 for that year?
No, it did not. 2020.
That annoyed you maybe. This was early on in the podcast.
No, it didn't annoy me, it just surprised me. I wondered if it was some kind of statement from you because Ghost Tsushima didn't make it either. I was like, is it AAA games with wild accessors in terms of length or scope or maybe they're overstretching?
I wondered if you were punishing it a little bit for being just so... It's such a long game, isn't it? I know you've still got some issues with the pacing from our recent pizza meeting.
It definitely moves faster on the second playthrough. Like I say, you're less hung up on stuff and I think the game definitely benefits from being played at that pace. I think my big issue with it is the Seraphite stuff.
Totally, it's just one step into silliness a little bit too much. I know it's fundamentally quite a daft game in the meds about mushroom zombies, but it's very grounded and it sells you on that vision of the world. Certainly part one sold you on that vision of the world very well.
I found their weird little island with their viking huts and their violent but perfectly safe society too far removed. It's definitely a game which is more interested in the human conflicts rather than the underlying threat of infection as much as the first game. The infected are certainly there for most of the game and they get a lot of set pieces, but it's way more interested in these factions and it's almost kind of like, oh, we've gone beyond the infected, enough time has passed where we're not bothered about it.
Someone put it today actually that everyone who survived to this point probably has proven themselves a hardened survivor and might be less concerned by that basic baseline of danger, which I kind of see, I think that's a pretty decent take. But the Seraphites, just the idea that with all this shit going on, you've still got time to build this kind of crazy Viking colony. Those priorities feel a little off to me still, but that's really the only place where I tripped on it.
I thought it was pretty amazing the second time around and mechanically, as a stealth game, there's not masses to it, but it's so slick and exciting and the way it sort of sells the desperation of every situation and the AI is always penning you in, but in this quite organic way. I thought that was really good. Had as much fun picking off some of these levels as I did villages in Phantom Pain.
It's almost that slick as a stealth game.
Yeah, I think that is the other big thing I had. I think it, relative to the first one, is kind of what Uncharted 4 is relative to the rest of those games. It's that real step forward in terms of like, I feel like I'm playing a best-in-class version of this genre as opposed to something maybe where it's a little bit rougher around the edges.
I didn't think the original Last of Us had incredible stealth or amazing set pieces. I think this game is just a much more accomplished, well-rounded stealth game and action game. And it's really good at both those things and it's really good at empowering you as a player.
It feels fair as well. It feels exciting when it goes wrong. I didn't really find it frustrating.
There's definitely some bits later in the game where it gets trickier and maybe I found those sections a little bit more, I don't want to say overly difficult, but they find ways to ratchet up the tension and what the enemies have at their disposal to see off some of the tactics you get used to using. And in the very last section of the game, I think they take it to its logical conclusion and you realize there's nowhere further they can really take the stealth design of the game. But that's okay.
I think it's just really nicely done and you just get the feeling they just explore everything you can do with those mechanics and it's just really cool and there's just some, you just sometimes go into a wide open space and you see loads of people stretched out in the distance or like you know what's around this corner going down this street and there's more enemies and you just realize you're covering like what feel like square miles of enemies as you're kind of making your way through the city. Really, really cool. And then punctuated by those big kind of more scripted Naughty Dog moments as well.
You know, so it's it's a nice I think it's a nice balance. I think it's a masterpiece. I think I liked it more than you did.
But yeah, I don't know if I don't think I'm ready to revisit it though. It was only two years ago for me. So yeah, a bit more time maybe, you know.
Revisiting it, you know, just a year after replaying part one was definitely to its benefit because you realize how many of the mechanics aren't in part one. She's so kind of like lithe, the way she can throw herself around and very quickly go prone and then suddenly you're scampering under something. It really sort of sells you as this kind of like nasty malicious little murderer, kind of legging it around, stabbing people up.
Animalistic, you know.
Yeah.
A sort of scrawny kind of like, like a starved predator or something, you know.
Yeah. Yeah, that's, it's very nicely done. I rate it a lot.
And I'd say if you've not played it, you know, I think, I think it sells, this game is going to sell new for 45 quid or something, which, which seems fair for one of the better games of the last few years. And like I said, it probably, if you go out and bought a pre-owned version of this and then paid tenor to update it, that's probably the route to take, I'd say.
Yeah. And that's like, you know, you know, the market's flooded with copies of that game, it sold so many copies. So yeah, I think that's, I think that's pretty fair.
I think it's just, the key thing is, I really do think it's like, for them, it's can we get this game on Best Buy shelves, or Walmart shelves in the US, you know what I mean? So it's like people who have seen the TV show, just see it, like, it's very unlikely that a four year old game is going to be in stock now at these places on a format that is not for sale anymore. I honestly do think that a big part of it is just, can we get this game on shelves in front of people who wouldn't have encountered the game before?
So you can see why on that level they've done it, you know.
All the people who saw the announcement that Caitlyn Diva is going to be Abby and they're like, I want to know who this Abby character is like. Does she look much like Caitlyn D? Oh no.
No, Caitlyn Diva looks like Ellie, which is confusing us. So yeah, lots to think about there. Yeah, sort of like I don't stand by how I felt about that show.
I just don't think it was all that. Apart from the very sad episode with the two guys, that was like the real great episode and the rest of it was like replaying the game except you couldn't actually play it. That's basically what it was today.
I think playing part 2, there is a way to kind of slow that story down and turn it into more of a traditional TV show. There is an ensemble cast to it. Weirdly, maybe more so with the WLF than Ellie side of things, but if they decided to break it up into multiple seasons and like establish Jackson as a place with these kind of main characters who then become kind of side characters in a third season which was more about the WF side of things, that would make sense to me.
I think if you try and do that whole arc in one season it's going to feel very rushed, which is kind of how I felt a little bit about season one.
Yeah, I think I did too. I remember when we did that pod, I think three episodes had come out and we were like, how are they going to cram the rest of this game in? And the answer was, it's because they didn't, you know, like the episode in the, where, where Joel's injured in the, in the snow, the winter section of the game, that episode did not leave any impact on me.
In the same way, think about how much that people talked about that moment from the first game when it actually happened, that people didn't talk about that episode like that. They all talked about episode three like that, you know, and like I, I get why, like that, you know, that was the execution was just so much better. And yeah, it just felt like, I don't know, it just, it just kind of came and went in the TV show, which feels like a sign that it didn't quite land to me.
Like if you can't get the audience response that the game did, then has it succeeded as an adaptation? Anyway, there's a, I'm sure there'll be more chance to discuss this, but yeah, okay. And I'm glad, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Do you think actually, you know, because I think at some point we have vowed to go back and do the 2020 redux pod where we do, like Hades can be put on a list and so on. So we'll save that discussion for another time then if you, if it'll ever crack your list again, Matthew. I kind of want to pay the 10 pounds and just see the cut levels.
That sounds rad. I, yeah. I wonder how much extra polish they had to do to get them into a playable, sufficient state.
Does they say much about that? Like, are they just, it can't just be as simple as, oh, we just dumped it on the game disc. It must have been, they must have done a little bit of polish around the edges to make it work.
But yeah, like one of them doesn't have voices in and the other two do. Which gives you an idea that two of them were much closer to being finished and then one of them has got very like unfinished canned animations. Yeah.
Barely moving bottles up to her lips and then not quite working. Like I said, still pretty good to my eye.
I've got a question for you. Can you think of any cut content from a game you like that you'd like to see added back in in a similar fashion that you could...
What like a famously missing...
So for example, I'd be curious to see what the original end of MGS2 was before they had to cut it down after 9-11 or the bits of the tanker where Snake's running away from the water that appeared in all the E3 trailers, like him escaping off the tanker. I'd be curious to see those bits added back in if they ever remade MGS2. But yeah, I don't know.
Is there anything for you that you remember as like, oh yeah, a section that was famously in a magazine or something like that that didn't make the cut?
Well, this probably isn't the same kind of thing, but having heard Shotokumi talk about prototypes of Ace Attorney that didn't work with very different character sets, I would love just to see what that looked like and how it sounded and behaved. That will just never happen. But just to see like a different set of characters entirely in that roughly the same situation.
Yeah, always comes back to Shotokumi with you, doesn't it, Matthew?
Always.
Yeah, there was, I guess like, there's a lot of the discussion of that. I still don't really buy into the idea there was more MGS5, much more than there was actually released. So, yeah, not so sure about that one.
And yeah, the only other thing I could think of was the little island in Dam in Golden Eye that people were fucking obsessed with where you get like an action replay so you could scoot over there and look at that little turret and then come back and it's like, that has had such a disproportionately large amount of conversation for something that was probably like made and then like half finished in like about three weeks and then forgotten about forever.
So I just want to see you go into that level and it starts with a video of David Doak saying, listen, I have no fucking idea why any of you freaks want to go to this what is clearly a nothing burger of an island. But here it is. And then you it's just like nothing is exactly what it looks like.
Nothing at all.
Yeah, yeah, that's good. Okay, so let's move on to the next game then Matthew. So I've been playing Marvel's Midnight Suns, fresh release from the end of 2022.
So I heard a lot about this at the time because I think it came out right at the dead end of the year. So neither of us got to it before game of the year really. Did you ever play it at all?
Three or four hours of it. And then I just had work and life and it was clearly going to be huge.
So yeah, you were correct, you probably hadn't even really seen the full shape of the game play out by that point. And yeah, so essentially what it is, is a combination of sort of like XCOM style turn based gameplay where you control the character, these Marvel superheroes using cards, and a layer of, I guess, like slightly persona ish, like life sim interaction based stuff where you're at this kind of like weird big old house in Salem, Massachusetts and all the Marvel superheroes have moved in, they basically all have dorms there, and you sort of hang out with them doing various activities, fishing with Blade, having drinks with Magic from the X-Men, etc, etc. So it's an odd little combo.
And yeah, so I remember like quite a few people at the time be like, oh, this is super good. But then it was like, it was too late to get to the Game of the Year episode. And then before we knew it, 2023, and it's some relentless onslaught of new games had arrived.
So I just kind of forgotten about it. But it has some like really deep discounts, so I think this is still true by the time this episode goes live. It's in the humble choice at the moment.
So if you pay nine quid, you get a key for this massive game. I bought the version that has a DLC in it because the DLC adds a bunch of characters like Deadpool and Storm and Venom. I've only had a lot of Deadpool so far.
What is odd about it? Well, a lot of things are odd about it, I think, is that it's like it's a game that's got Marvel superheroes in it, and then there's like an extended period where it's like, collect mushrooms in this forest, and then it really pushes the boundaries, I think, of what you would obviously do with that IP. So you'll have an occasional battle in the first few hours, but what the game is actually doing is slowly drip feeding in all these different elements.
Like, there's this forge area where Tony Stark can break this coil thing open, and it will have new cards for you to equip into the deck for each character. Or like, Doctor Strange will break open this artifact that will have all these different currencies you can use to synthesize cards together to make more powerful cards. It's got loads and loads of systems.
It's just stacking in and stacking in, but it takes its time to show you what that full range of stuff is. When it does, you eventually break into this, what I would say is a Persona 5 style, structured day of, well, I know I'm going to nip down to the forge now. I'm going to go out into the yard and train with Blade, and then I'm going to go pick some mushrooms because I know they spawn once a day or whatever.
And then go check my messages from these superheroes, arrange to hang out with them in the evening. I'm going to give Spider-Man a compliment because there's a compliment system in the game. All your different superheroes have essentially their own progression system for combat, but also a progression system for friendship.
So as you progress that, more and more activities kind of unlock with them and they get closer. There's no romancing though, which I think actually was one of the criticisms leveled at the game is, why can't some of these characters just get on and I sort of understand because If you could romance any of them that are in there currently, who would it be? I've got to be careful not to show my hand too much.
Well, I picked the female Hunter. That's the other thing. You play as an original superhero, which is always a very risky thing to do.
But I think it kind of works because you're not really a superhero. You're sort of like you're someone who was like a demon hunter hundreds of years earlier and you've been resurrected to basically help fight the return of your mother, this evil monster thing. And it just so happens that the knights of the modern day are basically Avengers.
So that's kind of why that's happened. So I think it works quite well. And it means that you get to build all those relationships on scratch because it wouldn't make sense if you played Spider-Man and you were like, go be friends with Captain America or whatever.
But I didn't ask you a question, did I? I think a magic from the X-Men is the obvious Samuel Roberts pick if I'm giving the game away. But I will say that I love the depiction of Blade in this game.
You've got Michael Jai White, the actor who can do loads of martial arts. And you probably know him from The Dark Knight if you're more generally. He's like one of the gangsters at the start that the Joker just messes up to demonstrate.
Oh, look at these old school gangsters who can't contend with this maniac basically. That's the point of that, isn't it?
And thank you for that little bit of Dark Knight analysis.
It's a great film. But yeah, I just find that performance, he's really charismatic and funny and has some sort of great hidden layers to him, I would say, as a character. So I would say you sense a lot of passion for that particular character from the writers of the game.
A lot of it's got into that. It's quite a peculiar game though, I can sort of see why it didn't do mega numbers. It might just be, you know, there might be a bunch of reasons why that's the case, like the time of year, the fact that it's a turn-based game, all that kind of stuff.
But I think it's because it just doesn't resemble a superhero game in the way that Spider-Man does or even like Guardians of the Galaxy did and the Avengers game did. It's just like it asks quite a lot of the audience to go along with it, but I think it's super good. Like the combat really accomplished it, so there's a lot of like using the environment like chucking stuff at dudes, there's a lot of like sort of like pinging one dude into another dude and like creating sort of like cascading this guy ping-pongs into this guy and he smashes into like a sort of like an exploding barrel and then a bunch of enemies die and it's about like how cleanly and efficiently you can get enemies off the board before more reinforcements turn up.
Like a dude domino rally.
Yeah, basically.
A dude and dude and no, no, anyway.
I appreciate the effort. But what is interesting about it is that each superhero has a completely different sort of like profile of how they behave on the battlefield. So Blade does have some like, you know, suck the blood out of an enemy, steal their life and his HP can go back up.
And that makes sense for that character. And he can cause like a bleed effect. So characters lose HP over time.
That makes sense. Magic from the X-Men who I keep bringing up, it feels like a whole thing now. But she can, I feel like she was added because of what she can do as a superhero in the comic books, which is she can open portals.
And so you can like ping one dude out of a portal and then appear on the other side of the screen, then barrel into another enemy. That sort of thing. And that's cool.
And then like this, she can also create like drops in the environment. So just like an endless abyss, you can like boot an enemy into basically. That's pretty cool.
Because her whole thing is she can like open a portal to purgatory, I think it is. It's she's quite a goth character. They've all got stuff like that, like Spider-Man can do, can zip across the environment and has this great chain attack where if you can KO one enemy or like if you can KO multiple enemies in a row, he can take more enemies off the board than any other character basically because of how quickly he moves across the environment.
It just feels like they thought closely about how can we make something a little bit XCOM-y, but it like everything you do matches the skill set of these characters and you play on the offensive more than you do in XCOM where you're often in cover and worrying about percentages and things like that. It's much more go out and get them and feel like a superhero. It's really fucking good.
Really, really good. I've played like 16 hours of it in about 9 days. That's quite a lot for me these days.
So I'm enjoying it a lot.
Do you think the whole kind of setting up chain reactions between enemies and the environment, do you think that's more the focus than other mechanics that let you extend turns into like ludicrous kind of chains?
You have like quick moves where basically if you instantly KO an enemy, then you'll get that card using a card back basically. You'll get some items that, well, that's the other interesting thing you can do is that when you use part of the environment to hit an enemy, to hurt an enemy, that doesn't actually count as when you're using a card because you're not using a card. But you do, you will often use a move to get across the environment to do that.
But there's like a separate, there's like a heroic points currency that you have to be aware of as a player. And what that means is you can't just like get a handful of cards and then like spaffle your best moves in a row. You basically have to like build up your heroic points and then cash them in with the like the mega abilities, are you cashing them in?
So there's a bit of a curve to it in that sense, like some cards add heroic points, some cards cost heroic points. So you're balancing that the whole time you're going. So I think that means that you just have to think about the game tactically and the order in which you do things.
And yeah, there are ways to just extend your turns like I got I got achievement last night for like killing seven enemies in a turn. That's quite hard to do. But it's it's cool that it just lets you chain together all this stuff.
Because again, that's not really what the XCOM experience is like, except in very rare situations, you know. So yeah, it's good.
I do need to go back to it. It was just clear that it was taking its time to kind of introduce its ideas. And, you know, I don't have like a massive connection to whatever the Midnight Suns are.
I don't really know what that corner of the is that a big corner of comic book lore? Is that a thing just secretly very, very popular?
No, I don't think the Midnight Suns have not existed as a going concern. I don't think in the entire time I've been reading comics. So we're talking 20 years.
So my understanding is they're very 80s and 90s kind of like concern, which might be why Jake Solomon was big into them. That might have been when he was reading comics. That's my guess anyway.
I've not read much about about that. But yeah.
Where this does have superheroes that are maybe bigger pools like your Iron Man or your Spider-Man, do you think this suffers at all from where some of these games have suffered? The knockoff Avengers, as opposed to the Marvel Spider-Man. People kind of accepted it in a way that they didn't with some other Marvel takes.
Funny thing is, there's a big tone difference. Like it's going for, I think everyone's identity. A lot of people have identified this more of a Saturday morning cartoon goofiness than a MCU mashup of like, here's what Robert Downey Jr. actually sounds like.
And Joss Whedon's script writing, which is basically what the MCU tone is. So, yeah, so I think that helps. One thing I couldn't get out of my head is that the way the Iron Man, Tony Stark looks and sounds in this game reminds me of Paul F.
Tompkins, the comedian. So he's a bit like, Hunter, what's going on today? And I just couldn't get him out of my head.
Like there's an episode of Community pops up and I just couldn't get out of my head. Because obviously he has a mustache in real life as well. So there's like the occasional thing where I think like maybe a little bit of that.
But where it makes up for it is it does such a good job, a stellar job of capturing the way the superheroes behave in this like arcane sort of like card game, you know, sort of like, you know, system that you sort of like, you can't help but go along with how they've done it because it doesn't feel like it's just lifting from the films. It's a bit like, okay, we've made a combat system where you just have to send guys flying around this map. So like, what are they all going to do to send some guys flying, basically?
And so on that level, you kind of enjoy it. And like the situation in which your place where everyone's living in this house is so odd. I think it kind of ends up avoiding many MCU comparisons for that reason.
The other interesting wrinkle is that the Spider-Man in it is the same Spider-Man from the Insomniac games. It's Yuri Lowenthal. Yeah, yeah.
But it's not suggested it's the same version of the character because he talks about like, you know, the Green Goblin and the Venom in the game is Eddie Brock, not, well, I won't spoil Spider-Man 2 if people have not played it. But yeah, so it's but that's that's quite a nice touch as well because, you know, he's like that's obviously a great voice performance. It's quite cool to have him here.
But yeah, I think it is. I think it helps as well. There aren't that many MCU characters in it.
It's like it is an odd little mix. You know, it is like it does feel like we've picked our favorites or we've picked the ones who fit this particular combat system we had in mind. So yeah, it's interesting.
A lot of people told me though, you're thinking about length, that that is the main problem with the game that is so long. There's so much of it. And I can see it stretching out and out.
Like the map screen, you can only do one mission per day. The map screen has fucking tons of icons on it. So it does feel like to move things forward.
It's going to take a while. So I can see why that would maybe not be for everyone. And that's very similar to XCOM in that respect.
I think that sort of day by day management of these different layers things. So, yeah, I'll see how it goes because it's just, I don't feel like there's loads else fighting for my attention in January. And it just, it feels like a spot on.
There's a lot of like lying in bed with a steam deck at the moment because of the weather, Matthew. So, yeah.
The weather made me do it.
So that's my main game, a game from about 15 months ago. I hope it was at least interesting to the listeners who might have been thinking about checking it out.
There is a definite resurgence in chat around this game at the moment. But just today, I saw Jake Solomon engaging with chat where people were saying, you could have been playing this amazing game a year ago. Why didn't anyone play it when it kind of, you know, quote unquote, mattered to play it?
He was like, listen, it's fine. As long as you enjoy it. I believe in it.
I, you know, I think it's a good game that we made. So if you discover it a year later, that's fine by me.
That is the odd thing about it. It's that it seems like it was just this flop, right? Because there were layoffs and then it felt like when they announced Raxus were like, we're making Civ next was a kind of like immediate course correction of, we're making something that we're guaranteed to make money.
That's what it felt like happened with that. And yeah, so it's nice of him to say that. But I do think it is cool for it to have like a resurgence to Second Life.
It's a mighty gift to give that game away with that humble choice. I think that's like an amazing get for that service. So it's a really nice thing to just own for nine pounds.
So it's really good. So yeah, yeah, it's nice that there's been a resurgence. I'm determined to like ram it back into the discourse.
That's my thing with it. Oh, okay.
You're going to use this podcast to push it back into everyone's minds.
Yeah, I've been trying, you know, my limited sort of Twitter reach. I've been trying the same thing, but yeah, we'll see how it goes.
I think I've sold more velvetizers than I have video games.
That's my legacy. I think you've sold more copies of Hotel Dust than velvetizers, but all other games you've sold more velvetizers. Yes.
For.
What's your next game, Matthew?
Super Mario RPG, which we both got for Christmas.
Yep.
Have you played any of this yet?
Nope, I have not. I failed to play it. Yep, because I finished another Mario game at Christmas.
I didn't want to rush into the next one, basically.
I've only played a couple of hours of this myself. I know we're near finishing it, but this is my single observation, so this might be a short bit. I can't play it for very long, because I find it so simplified as an RPG.
There are so few meaningful choices you get to make in any particular session that 20 minutes is all I can take. In a 20-minute session, you might go to an area and fight the three enemy types that are there over and over again. And that may sound like all RPGs, but because it is so stripped back and it is so clearly designed as a My First RPG, I struggle with it a little bit.
It's very, very hard to return to that, especially given that Nintendo has worked with that formula in the Mario & Luigi games and Paper Mario and done more interesting things with it, or done the more refined version of it, or the faster-moving version of it. You know, something I really like about, particularly the Mario & Luigi games, is I think they're very well-paced in terms of like, there's always a new ability, there's always a new thing about to happen, there's a new enemy type, there's a new boss, there's a new story element. And this game, everything is just like five minutes too long, you know, it's like five minutes too long of fighting this one enemy type, or listening to this particular tune in this area, or just the fact that the areas themselves, while visually attractive in terms of the paths that's been done on them, they're so simple to look at, you know, the pathways through them, they're so old feeling.
I'm finding that a bit of a struggle.
Yeah, it's interesting because you are, you're quite, I would say you're pretty engaged as it goes with the RPG side of the Mario games, like I think that's something that you are, you know, I don't know about a specialist, but you know, you've paid close attention to those games over the years and the ways...
They've got bigger, they've definitely got bigger cheerleaders than me for sure, you know.
Yeah.
Like I think they're, I think it's like an eight out of ten strand of Nintendo spin-off, you know? Where there are some people where like Paper Mario is their hot well, Paper Mario a thousand year door is their whole personality. And that's like an eye roll from me, unless of course you're reviewing it and the Fantasy Critic League demands that you give it a ten please.
Oh yeah, that is what you nominated, wasn't it? That was funny. People pointed out actually, I think, was it every single game we nominated was a Japanese game in that, yeah, that was completely unconscious, but yeah, that's a, you know, Japan is going to have an amazing year this year.
And also, like, I know all the kind of freelance weebs that review all these games for every outlet. Like, you can just trust them to throw around the tens like nobody's business.
Yeah, I was chatting to Jay Bayless about video game profitability and he said that if I have to, I will single-handedly make Unicorn Overlord profitable. And I was like, well, that's, that's kind of like where people are at with those games, isn't it? That game is destined for like nines and tens basically.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So the other thing that you said to me, though, that I thought was interesting is, didn't you say to me that you thought this looked better in the hands and it seems to look in the trailers they put out for it?
Well, I think this with a lot of Switch games, I don't know if it's just the OLED effect, because I've felt this way with things in the past with the older Switch model as well, that often the resolutions they're made at or whatever, they're made to be played on the Switch, not to be viewed on my massive PC monitor or whatever. And when you put them where they're meant to be, they just kind of click into place in a way that isn't a very sophisticated way of putting it.
But there is a secret source that doesn't happen. And the most famous example of this was Metroid Dread, which I thought looked really sparse and odd in the trailers. And when I played it, I was like, this is an amazing looking game.
It moves so well, there's all this detail you just don't catch in a trailer. And it's kind of similar, Super Mario RPG has a bit of that as well, like the kind of odd art decision, you know, the kind of squat characters and things like that are still kind of a little creepy. But it just, there's just like a level of gloss to it.
And it's also smooth and fast moving and just really sharp and the colors really pop. That might be the OLED actually. And actually Metroid Dread was OLED.
So maybe it is, maybe that's what I'm talking about. Maybe the secret source is I'm playing it on a better screen.
No, I played the, I played Metroid Dread on a regular Switch and it still looked really nice. So yeah, yeah, it's all good. Yeah, interesting.
Well, I will play at some point. I tend to, now I tend to treat Mario games as like a sort of safe harbor in a, when I've played like a 60 hour relentless blockbuster game made for 18 plus audiences. I just, I'm just, I just need a bit of Mario therapy basically.
So I'll save this for then. Or maybe I'll try and chip away gradually like you have. And see where it goes.
But you know, I could see, it was like totally the, I think it's totally the right thing to do to salvage this as a kind of like curio. Like I think it's, it's interesting to give this a bit of a facelift and put it in front of people again. Because I do think it's probably age worse than any other SNES game that was published by Nintendo just because, because the art style was that isometric style that has not always dated the best.
And yeah, I think it's yeah, I'll come back to it. All right, well, I guess we, I should have done a tangent when you talked about Metroid Dread, Matthew, because I've been playing a game that's a lot like Metroid Dread.
That's a good tangent.
Briefly anyway, Prince of Persia The Lost Crown. So I'm going to play the demo of this. So I haven't got the full game, full disclosure.
But Matthew has, is that right Matthew?
Yes I have, yeah. I've been playing other things for review.
Oh yeah.
Which are time consuming.
Yeah, to say the least from what you told me about it. But yes, so this game then, I think that it was hard to gauge what the reaction was when it was revealed last year. Because I think there was a little bit of like, oh Prince of Persia is back.
And then I think we kind of assumed it was like a 20 pounds kind of game, or like something sort of a bit smaller. And then it's kind of like it emerged, it's actually like a 40 pound game or a 50 pound game. And you know, like it's, although you can get the physical version for pretty much like 40 or slightly less.
So there are ways to do that. And I think that the production values of it have actually taken people by surprise. It's sort of like, it's definitely like a relative of Metroid Dread in the sense that it is a Metroidvania style game.
you go around this environment with unlocking new abilities and reaching new parts of the world, exploring, going back to places you've already been to, to see what's what with your new abilities. But at the same time, it's got quite a lot of like narrative in it, like nicely presented narrative. It's more so than Metroid Dread has, has like voice acting and things like that.
It feels like they've just, it doesn't feel like it's, you know, it costs anywhere near what an Assassin's Creed would, for example, but it does feel like they've spent a bunch of money on it. Like it's a really nice looking game. I've been playing on Switch, the Switch OLED, and I was a bit like, I was slightly wary because I, I was like, oh, you know, not all Switch ports in recent years have been amazing, right?
And so you're wondering how this game will run, but it runs at like 60 frames and really smoothly, looks fantastic, just really like bright, colorful, lovely game. It feels like a relative of the Sands of Time sort of games, a little bit. There's like some sort of like objects moving around, like forward and backwards through time to unlock kind of new areas, that sort of thing.
So that's a welcome touch. At the same time, it's borrowed loads of like the best bits of Metroid Dread, like the slide, that lovely slide that Samus has that just feels so fucking good in the hands. They've basically borrowed that.
At the same time, they've added more kind of like slightly cinematic powers to it. They've got like a, cause obviously the prince carries two swords. There's an absolutely lovely parry in it as well.
So when you go like got these melee attacks, you have to be wary of that. You also carry a bow as well as you can do sort of like long range attacks, but it's less powerful. I think it's a really nicely judged kind of like a sort of like sort of reprieve for this series.
And I'm really keen to play more of it. I'm sort of like, I'm weighing up which format to get it on. I'm going to give that a few more days, but I was just quite, I was pretty, pretty impressed by it.
The reviews have been super positive and I can see why. It's just the kind of thing you want to see big publishers do more, which is just that sort of like what this is kind of like a version of a mid-level kind of like AA kind of game that I think people actually do want in their heart of hearts and it allows them to do something a bit different as well. That's not just like, you know, like an open world game or whatever.
What do you make of this one, Matthew?
Game actually reminds me of the most is Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Mirror of Fate. In terms of, you know, it has that kind of metroid-y structure. This obviously has much nicer platforming than that, but they have slightly more fully featured melee combat systems than other metroid-y games.
Like this has quite a lot going on. Beyond the slide and the parry, you have air launchers and aerial combos and weird sort of you can slide and then kind of hit an enemy from behind. I don't know if you got to the kind of the bloke who does like combat tutorials yet.
I don't know. Is he in the demo? I don't know.
I don't know what the demo covers.
I don't think so. But I mean, you got to mess around with the tree thing where you can change the amulets that give you different powers. So there's a little bit of that.
It must be nearish that. It's quite near the beginning. There's this guy who basically gives you tutorial lessons if you want.
Yeah, I did actually. Sorry. Yes, I did.
Yeah. Well, if you do those, you realize there's like a little bit more going on with the system and different enemies react to moves differently. You know, like heavy enemies can't be launched, but you can kind of push them back.
And there's elements of like where you punch an enemy. So you can knock them up and then across, so you can knock an aerial enemy down. And then it comes into like knocking enemies into each other or onto spikes and things.
So there's like a little bit more going on on the compared to something like Blasphemous, say. That then opens them up for boss encounters, which can feel a bit more like duels and have this kind of great anime energy. It's almost like, you know, manga-ish the way these kind of jets of colour kind of appear on the screen stuff.
It's really like elegantly done. Always love a big publisher throwing their weight behind Metroidvania games. I know that they're very well catered for in the indie space, but I do like my Ori's and my Mirror of Fates and I'll add this to the list.
Yeah, there's definitely room for the big budget ones. That's the thing. That's like, there aren't that many of those specific Metroidvanias.
So, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very nice.
I love the, there's that mechanic where you can take a photo of the screen and pin it to the map, which seems much more elegant than we're going to mark the map with like, here's the green door, which you come back to with the green power. That's not a gimmick I've seen in other games. So, you know, always nice to move the genre forward, even if just a tiny little bit with a quality of life function.
Yeah, and I think it only has like, I think you only have a finite number of them as well. So you can't just like completely span the screen with them. But yeah, I thought that was I thought it was nice as well.
And it does sound like the the exploration side of things does sort of like, it does have enough substance to it to, you know, to make it feel like it's not just superficially a Metroidvania, that it fully goes in. So, yeah, I agree. Like a great great January release.
I'm sort of like the retesting my resolve of like not getting any games, new games in January, which is something I was trying to do this month. But yeah, I agree. Cool way to kick off the year.
And I just apparently runs great on everything as well. Like, what more could you ask for, you know, great start. OK, Matthew, your next game is the not at all controversial Suicide Squad Kills The Justice League.
How has this been tricky? Have you killed Batman yet?
No, so I got to play this at a preview event last year, about a month ago now, at Rocksteady, went to Rocksteady, which was exciting. Had a lot of soft drinks from their drinks cabinet. You'll be glad to hear and was really very greedy with the catering.
But great, a great spread. Congrats to the caterers. Yeah, we got to play the first three hours of this.
They then jumped us ahead and we fought The Flash. Obviously the title of this game says you're gonna kill The Justice League, but it feels kind of spoilery if you say whether or not you do kill The Justice League.
Right.
I won't say whether or not we did kill The Flash. We certainly fought The Flash. I think it's a really difficult game to demo, which I think maybe explains some of the negative sentiment around it in the kind of batch of previews that came out.
I think this is true of all looter, shootery, action RPGs, but they are games that to me only make sense when you start at the very beginning, take a character through it, are introduced to all the systems, learn what you like about that character, learn what skills in the skill tree make sense, learn which kind of weapons you want. You begin to take certain routes through it. I think if you get dropped in a slightly later save file, where a lot of that stuff's established already, which is basically what happened for us.
You're at a preview event, you want to play the game, you don't want to sit there for half an hour reading everything on the screen going, okay, so this does this and this does that. That has been true of so many games. I remember playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey at a preview event, where they put us into the end game content.
And you're like, this just doesn't make, I just have no relationship with any of this. I don't know what this character, how this character is meant to behave or what these powers mean to them. So it's just a curse of the genre.
I think these things are destined to kind of suck in previews. I actually thought when you kind of got your head around it and, you know, in the stretches where we had a bit more time for it to bed in, it was fun. Kind of Borderlands meets Sunset Overdrive.
The way the kind of skill tree works is very Borderlands-y in terms of stat boosts and your core kind of powers and the way that you can kind of pile upgrades and buffs into those. So they you can kind of conjure all these kind of mad builds out of it, which is pretty more Borderlands-y than it is anything else. But then the actual action itself, you know, because it's in an open world and because it's very kind of acrobatic in terms of movement, that's where I get the sort of Sunset Overdrive vibe from.
It also hinges a lot on the combo meter as it's going up. It triggers a lot of your powers in your skill tree. So, you know, the further your combo goes, the kind of much the more powerful you become.
And so things really begin to escalate, which is another Sunset Overdrive-y kind of trope. You know, it's kind of it sort of feeds you very well. And there's actually like I was tempted to try and spin her.
Actually, there is some Arkham thinking in this, but it's quite far removed and people don't seem to be up for that. People have made their minds that this has like nothing in common in Arkham. But that game was also like when Batman hit certain chain combos, he could do certain amazing things, which inevitably led to like higher chain combos.
Like I can see a bit of that in this, like the way things almost unlock in tiers as that combo is going up. Also, it has like a counter certain enemies when they are about to do a very dangerous move. You've got like a projectile that you lob at them, which can like instantly sort of fuck them up.
Which again, is that this game's countering, Batman's counter, like are they trying to add a bit of that kind of responsiveness into it? Maybe you think that's over generous. There's something else going on in there though.
Like it definitely has mechanics and thoughts of its own, which I don't think did come through a lot of the previous. I feel like people either didn't understand those or just overlooked them, because it maybe doesn't fit the narrative that this is a bit of a mess. But I think there is stuff which, given time, feels like you're going to be able to get your teeth into it.
I mean the movement alone of the four characters is very different. They have very, quite tricky rhythms, which isn't satisfying out the box, but does give you the idea that there's going to be space to learn this and master this, which I think is good? I don't know.
Like I don't… Well, as in, do you want 100% mastery in a game that you're potentially going to play for tens and tens of hours? Probably not.
No.
You maybe want more mastery than you're afforded at the start of this. Harley Quinn, particularly, I really struggled with her. She's basically got Batman's grappling hook, so she can pull up to higher points, but she also has this thing where she sends out one of Batman's bat drones and can grapple off that, and I could never quite get into the rhythm of that.
When I played as Captain Boomerang, he's got the speed force or whatever it is the Flash has. He's nicked that. They've all nicked something off a hero, basically.
It lets you throw a boomerang out and then teleport to that, and that I did begin to click with. You can get around the arenas quite fast, and it allows them to make the set pieces and the big arena fights quite massive-feeling in a way that you probably can't with other games of this ilk because you don't have that kind of level of movement. So there's definitely positives here, but it is also extremely easy to dunk on it because it follows all these trends which are just very out of step.
I'm sure you've seen doing the rounds, the screen of one of the weapons, whichever one was like, look at this fucking, all the modifiers and all the currencies and all the terminology and it's like, well, a lot of games look pretty fucking confusing out of context for the first time. You have to trust that the game will introduce its ideas properly if you play it in the way it's meant to be played. But that stuff is out there.
I mean, you can't stop that. That stuff is in the game. There is a lot of number crunching bullshit, but that was in vogue once when this game was being made over the last nine years, you know?
Yeah, I think you've done your best there to give it the full appraisal of what everything it's trying to achieve. I guess to pull one thing out there, the movement thing I agree with you, you don't want to mask that out of the box because Spider-Man is about understanding the momentum of swinging around. With Batman, it was about how you use the glides to keep moving across the city.
I think you do want some mastery there for sure and that's part of the, I guess, those characters I don't necessarily associate Harley Quinn with her movement as such, but playing as super-powered characters is something you expect to be in the game, so that I get. The loot thing is tough, it is true that the world has sort of, there's been such a backlash to those games, like when people were angry about them when Avengers came out, you know, it was like the sort of destiny, destinification of games, I guess, that's a terrible way of putting it, but it's very tricky to unpick, there was no way for them to strip that out of the game, that's core to the game. All I can say is I'm going to go into it as open-minded as you've been, you know?
Like I think that's, I think you owe it that, because the thing to keep in mind is it's still a game made by a studio that's made three of the most important games in the last twenty years.
There's really interesting stuff in it. It's well written, genuinely funny in places, which most games aren't. How the flash fight resolved really made me laugh, actually.
There's the excitement of seeing, you know, Rock City take their whole kind of creative approach that you saw him in Arkham and the, you know, the Batman universe, to like the far reaches of DC, like Justice League opens up a whole lot of stuff in the way that every time you played a new Arkham game, you were like, oh, I'm interested to see, interested to see Rock City's take on this villain who we haven't seen before, or that villain. There's a similar thing here. You're like, what is the Rock City Lex Luthor?
What does Lewis Lane like in this world? You know, how weird is it going to get? Like where are they going to kind of push us to in this?
Because the game like opens with you arriving in the Hall of Justice and it's selling you on the might of the Justice League, the punchline being, you now got to go and kill these fuckers. There's a lot like that in the Batman games of glorified walk and talk moments, I guess. But like the foreshadowing and the setup is elegantly done.
And there is definitely the conflict of playing a game which has all this writing and character work and banter, but then playing it in co-op with people on headsets, talking over it or wanting to skip cutscenes or whatever. Those two things, I don't see how they ever really go together. You can play it single player and the other three people be AI controlled and you can actually skip between them at will so you can play as all of them if you want.
And I feel like maybe that will let you enjoy the highest highs of this game, which is probably going to be the story. But then I don't know if when you start hitting the moment to moment mission content, which is very looter shootery, it's very like go to this place and defend it for five minutes, fight waves of enemies. That is livened up by having friends there being funny on comms or whatever.
Difficult thing to square really. It's tough.
It's been like, you know, obviously it's been development for a long time. It's been in the public eye I think since the end of 2020 I think they revealed it properly. So, you know, I remember it was like during one of those DC sort of like pandemic livestream things they did.
And like, I think they had, I think they were the same one. They were like, we're making the Snyder Cut or whatever. That's how long ago it was.
And, you know, like, I think as well, this game's made me think quite a lot about, about discourse and how it kind of poisons everything. And I'm not saying that like the game is like, is perfect and people are wrong at all. And, you know, I demand people be open minded, but it did make me think about how the discourse can just like put you in a frame of mind for something and nothing can break that and how you get washed up into this consensus thinking, like where you have you just adopt what that consensus is without really thinking about about it.
And then it just unconsciously affects you on all these different levels in terms of how you perceive things. And I just think about that. That's just true with everything.
Like whether it's like a meme pullout, people pull out of like a game, something like funny or cultish they've kind of latched on to or like just all this stuff that just kind of or like the sort of like when we were talking about The Last of Us Part 2, I kind of circled back to the like Joel was right thing. And I was like, well, that's something that's only in my mind because I've like spent too much time on social media. And like it just, but I mean, what I mean is that like, yeah, it's this game's just for whatever reason, this game has made me think about it more than anything else.
I'm like, do I actually know anything about this game other than like, I know who the characters are obviously, but like the menu screens, like that people are sharing on social media, do I know anything else about it apart from that? And I'm not, I'm not sure I know a lot more about it until I like hearing you talk about it and like the movement and stuff like that. But like all that discussion means that people will never be interested in how good the movement is or like how interesting the movement is or how high end the narrative presentation is.
Or they'll be like, oh, it's the game with all the currencies in the top right hand screen. The legendary fire penguin acts or whatever.
And like, oh, and it's, it's so cemented already. You know, like if you say positive stuff about it, people reply with, oh yeah, but look at this inventory screen and you're like, oh yeah, but I, yeah, but I played for four hours and these are my thoughts. You know, I've actually interacted with it.
You've interacted with this screenshot, which you think summarizes nine years of work. I mean, yeah, I also don't quite understand why it feels like if you're, if you're part of a legacy in this genre, it's still allowed.
Yeah.
Like Diablo 4 is allowed to be that the game it is, which is every bit as convoluted and daft as this really. Like if you took any of its inventory screens, you'd be like, what the fuck does this stuff mean? It's like, there's all these buttons that don't unlock until these things have been achieved.
There's always weird tiers of currency. It's daft, but you're like, oh yeah, but the fans like it. And it's like, well, I imagine those fans will probably enjoy this too.
Like I don't really, yeah, I, you know, I have to temper this because there's a chance that I'll play the full thing and it will be a disaster. You know, like I'm just trying to sit on the fence a bit at a time when lots of people are like, no, let's go on the negative side of the fence and kill everyone who made it. And it just, I don't know.
I just don't, I didn't quite, I didn't quite get it. Instant games of service now instantly equals we hate it when actually loads of these things are really popular and the quiet majority are just getting on and enjoying them. It's quite puzzling.
Yeah, you're right. I mean, it's like the games that are cemented just get to stay there. No one's like, oh.
Yeah, when Borderlands 4 will be allowed to exist if they make it, that would be allowed. But not this isn't allowed because it, what, because it isn't just the thing they were making already, or what, you know, maybe it's that. Maybe it's the disappointment of like, would you like another single player Batman game from this studio?
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
You know, obviously.
That is true. That is the other part of the perception about fighting, isn't it? And it's like, and it's true, it's so, you know, we are now nine years down the line with no sequel to the best selling Batman Arkham series.
So that that seems strange on paper. And then obviously people would describe that to like, you know, sort of like bean counters making the decisions, but I still want to like go into it with an open mind. And I think you kind of you kind of owe any game that a little bit, but it's increasingly hard to do that.
Interesting to hear your take on it there, Matthew. It's nice to hear a bit of take on it.
I know I may be eating these words in like three weeks.
This section will be deleted from the podcast in three weeks. No, no, we'll see.
And replaced with just a gif of a fucking fire axe inventory stream.
Okay, my last game then of the episode. So Assassin's Creed Nexus VR game on MetaQuest. I don't think this is on PSVR, is it Matthew?
Yeah, it's quite interesting. So I think I assume that Oculus had some kind of like hand in it being made. Quite an interesting game in the sense that it's sort of like a compilation of the different assassins from across the Assassin's Creed series, but put into this like, sort of like basically like Mirena Baccarin, who you may know from Firefly or she played Inara or what else has she been in Matthew?
She was in Homeland, she was in, yeah, she was in Daniel Lewis' wife, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you, you, she's like very striking looking, you probably know what, who she is, like just from those descriptions. She's sort of like, when you see her in the game, you're like, oh yeah, I recognize you.
I know her from season three of the OC, because of course, yeah, basically like, there's like this element of you're, you're helping Abstergo to unlock some kind of mystery by going back into the memories of these different assassins, basically like what all the plot of the Assassin's Creed games are, but with more of a best of compilation feel. And what it means is they've translated all of Assassin's Creed's core mechanics, like the platforming, the combat and the stealth into first person VR gameplay. So there's a surprising amount of like chucking pots across the room to get like enemies to sort of like go over and investigate them.
And as you might expect, like with these lovely motion controllers, you can do the, you can sort of flick your wrist and get your hidden blade out and then just like knife a guy and then walk off, which is really cool. I'll tell you what this game is a lot like, because I think the presentation is really nice. Like I think this is one of the sort of signature big quest three games where they've given it like a really nice sort of like visual sort of like it just it looks almost like I would say looks almost like PS4 quality up close, but obviously the resolution is higher because you've got a headset on.
So you're, you know, you look really, really up close. It doesn't look like mega texture sort of like, you know, massively next gen thing. But I would say it's a really nice crisp looking VR game.
It's good. It's like, yeah, I would say it definitely like ticks all the boxes and the Assassin thing is interesting because you start as Ezio and it's Ezio voice by Roger Craig Smith. So you get like the little bit of fan service of that.
If you like that character, then you get to be him and you get to be in this world and there's like a bit of like going along Venice and going and looking at fireworks in the sky. That's basically the intro of the game and that sort of thing. But the sword combat is really nicely done as well as, you know, first person, you have to respond to the direction of the swipes, that sort of thing.
And then like it dawned on me what they've made is a really fancy good Wii game. And that's right. That's basically what it is.
Like it's all the things you do in it. Feel like it feels like Wii games sort of like gameplay. It feels like kind of I guess like a relative of Red Steel kind of thing.
But at last. But I think that's a pretty cool thing to make these days. Like it's it's like I think it's about seven or eight hours long.
I've played about an hour and a half of it. And I've so far really rate the way they translated the different mechanics. I think that none of it is too complex.
But you'll do a bit of puzzle solving. When you're climbing, you can add this like if you've got vertigo, you can add like this little grid below your fit, your character's feet so you don't like get sick when you look down or whatever. And I think it's just a really nice translation of what Assassin's Creed does quite well.
And like, yeah, it's just cool to see something that resembles like a big budget VR game. But the the we the we part of it is kind of what delighted me. I was like, oh, wow, this is like a parallel universe where we games still exist.
Yeah, really, a really nice thing to check out on Quest. Not that expensive. There's the old like referral thing you can do to get like a third off it as well.
Like I think it's a really nice little demonstration of what you can sort of do on there. You got those smoke bombs and projectiles like it adds and gradually more mechanics. All the main assassins appear in here.
Your favorite character, Connor, Kenway, Matthew, he's in the mix. So yeah, I think it's just a cool idea. And then every now and then it just like has the sort of cinematic flourish you expect from an Assassin's Creed game, except you're playing it in VR and it's just nice to see this level of effort go into something like this.
So yeah, it's a cool thing.
Is it knackering?
It's not really. It's not like the most intensive VR game I've played by any means. Like it's like, but you do have to like do quite a lot of that.
You have to actually like pretend you're climbing to climb basically. Like you just put the controllers up and go up. But even compared to like Beat Saber, it's not nearly as intense.
You use the sticks to move around. And then you can like look around the environment sort of manually. You can sort of like, you know, sort of like look in close at something, pick something up, look at it close and then there's a lot of like chucking stuff in this game.
I like picking things up and then throwing them aside in this game. That's fun to do.
But yeah, I love a game which just gives you a lot of physics subjects in VR just to like fuck around with.
Yeah, yeah. I was like, I was kind of there thinking, I don't remember Ezio chucking many pots to distract guards, but I like that I'm doing this. That's quite fun.
Yeah, just not that intensive, but just a really nice little slice of Assassin's Creed built on a layer of fan service, I guess. So I assume at some point they might bring this to PSVR 2 with a bit of visual upgrades. But yeah, I would think for people like me who are just looking for things to play on Quest, side note, because I wear glasses now.
I basically just, and you can basically wear glasses while using the Quest 3. It's one of the ways in which they design their headset. But I felt very much like a clockwork orange where that guy's eyes are just like, sort of like Alex's eyes just held open basically, while he's watching the propaganda film.
That's how I felt a little bit with my glasses on. I felt very, very close to the action. So yeah, that's a cool little thing I've played Matthew.
So what's it like hidden blading someone in video?
It's really nice. It's not that precise. You sort of like, I'd say like the motion of getting it in and out is actually like more satisfying than actually killing people.
I've had a few instances of like my hands sort of floating. I'm like, oh no, come back here. I'm trying to knife you kind of thing.
And then just kind of like going, just sort of like swiping, pushing towards the air. And then they just sort of go down instantly. It's quite nicely done.
Like why you even like holster your sword? You have to like actually put your sword away. And there's been a few instances where I've just like dropped it.
I'm like, it's not very Etsy.
Everyone's turned around to look at what the noise is. And you're like, sorry, sorry, everyone.
Yeah. So yeah, a cool little game. I can see why it's sort of like quest owners are quite excited about it.
So yeah, it's good. Okay. You've got one last game to discuss quickly, right Matthew?
The tiniest shout out for Foamstars, which is the PlayStation exclusive Square Enix game 4v4 competitive shooter, which a lot of people saw and went, oh, this is just a Splatoon ripoff because you spray foam everywhere and it covers the arena like the paint covers the arena in Splatoon. And I too saw the trailer and went, oh, okay. Someone is someone's ripping off Splatoon.
That makes sense to do that because it's incredibly popular, isn't it? Still. Yeah, I played it and actually it's not that Splatoon-y.
Like it has its own ideas, own things going for it. The persistence of the foam in the arena and it being like a navigational benefit to you in that you can only surf on your team's foam. And if you surf into another team's foam, you know, you move slower.
So it actually makes sense for you to cover the arena in your foam to make it sort of more friendly to yourself. But the actual gameplay isn't like territorial control. It isn't like who can foam the most arena.
It's it's more like traditional deathmatchy ideas or objective based gameplay. Like there's one we have to ride this giant disco duck by standing on its head and dancing. And then it starts moving towards the enemy base.
It's kind of like a tug of war between two bases, which is which is quite good fun. I didn't mind actually. I thought I thought this was OK.
And it's been announced that it's a PS Plus game for February. So, you know, if everyone who's got PS Plus gets it as one of their monthly games, feels like it's it's maybe trying to do a bit of a, you know, like Rocket League or Fall Guys where you kind of give it to everyone and hope that sparks the kind of collective interest in it. I don't know if it's got the absolute purity of one of those games where you're just like, oh, I get this.
This is going to work for millions of people. You know, it's it's a little more complicated than playing football in a car. But I am I'm intrigued to see if this if this takes off and becomes like the next big thing.
Yeah, intrigued to see what I was playing it. We got to talk to the developers. You know, you ask them about the inspirations or where, you know, how they settled on foam over, you know, but basically dancing around the.
This is a bit like Splatoon, isn't it? Because I'm because I'm, you know, a coward. They were like, oh, yeah, it's because we really like foam parties and foam parties are like a big thing.
And he told this story about the director told this story about being a foam party and seeing turning around and seeing like an old lady in a wheelchair covered in foam. And he was like foams for everyone. Let's make a video game.
I've never been to a foam party. I always thought they were quite sordid affairs, and I just wanted to check with you that I was like not saying you're Mr. Foam Party in the way that I'm not Mr. Chips.
Back to that, no, let's not. They're like, oh, it's nice and innocent, like a foam party, which I always thought was like students basically having an excuse to get incredibly sticky with each other in a dark room.
I'm nominating that anecdote with the wheelchair for the Didn't Happen of the Year Awards.
That's what I take, but, you know, I appreciate that that's probably like they needed a really good answer that wasn't like, yeah, Splatoon is pretty cool, isn't it?
They love foam parties and some naive on such things. I just thought they were, I just thought that was a sordid scene.
Yeah, I mean, I've not been to one in my adult life, you know what I mean? There's never been like, I've never been, you know, I don't go to clubs generally, but like, you know, it's sort of not something I've encountered. So yeah, maybe.
I think what is interesting, though, is the PS Plus thing. I think I agree. That's the sort of thing that can supercharge a game out of the gate.
So if it's the right game, and it really clicks, and that's like, that's a really good audience to find with it. And it's been a little while now since one of those sort of like, multiplayer successes has taken off out of nowhere on console, you know what I mean? Like, I think we're probably due for another one, so, yeah, yeah.
Well, maybe it'll be this. Certainly worth like checking out for a few rounds if you've got PS Plus when it comes out in February, whenever that is. Yeah, I thought it was all right.
Just the foam party stuff, I was like, I have to ask Sam about this, because I don't know about these things.
Oh, that's actually quite sweet. You thought I would know more than you, but sadly I've missed Chelsea these days.
Well, you've lived a little bit more than I have.
I don't think that's true. That can't be true. I just lived in Bournemouth for a few years, which is slightly gnarlier than Bath, but there were no…
I mean, Bournemouth is just going to have more, like, it's going to have seafoam. At least it has that, you know, you are closer to water reaction than I am here in Bath.
Yeah, but I feel like that would have happened more at the sort of bars I avoided in Bournemouth, which were like the, what's the bar, the Australian themed bar? I always avoid that one at all costs. That feels like somewhere where they might hose you down with foam.
But, it didn't happen at 60 million postcards. They only got foam all over the postcards, Matthew, who would have been no good, do you know what I mean? Oh, lots to think about there.
Yeah, so, there you go, you know, any listeners have any good foam based anecdotes, do let us know.
Yeah, obviously The Back Page live show will be a foam party, so look forward to that. Yeah, we will be foamed live on stage. That sounds filthy actually, let's just move on.
So Matthew, the podcast is over. That was a chunky little now playing, now play, I said it again, what we've been playing to kick off the year. So yeah, so I wonder if the next time we do this, we'll have a few more of this year's things to talk about.
Well, I suppose you have talked about a couple of games from this year, but yeah, it's a Suicide Squad will be out by the next time we do one of these. Yep, and as will another game that you may or may not have been playing, so we can talk about that at some point as well. And I don't know what I'll be playing actually, I'm not sure what's sort of like on the horizon for me.
Will you be playing the Another Codes double bill that comes out this week?
No, I don't think so, but it feels like the sort of thing I would buy and then it would just sit in my little switch box for like the next five years, but then it would gradually gathering value on eBay. I can't think of a... Are they releasing it physically or is that a digital thing?
Do you have to buy it digitally?
I think they're releasing it physically. Most first party things do, don't they?
Yeah, it feels like it might be a nice thing to have. I've got loads of stuff from last year still to play and I'm waiting on it.
It feels like a thing you'd be able to sell on eBay in like 20 years' time.
Yeah, I'd quite like to give the listeners... Thing is Matthew, this year I'm thinking about doing more playing What's in My Backlog than buying hoarding new games. I don't know if that will make for an interesting podcast.
The thing is, if you keep on top of the new games as you normally do, then maybe it doesn't matter if I don't do that as much. But I know it would be quite nice to be able to tick off Alan Wake 2 and Baldur's Gate 3 and things like that. You know what I mean?
Rather than feeling like back on the treadmill, it's time to play Persona 3 Reload or whatever. So yeah, I don't know. I might do a bit more of that this year and have some old takes.
Would that be good podcasting? What do you think?
Listen, I'm always up for old takes.
Okay, cool. Well, you know, Last of Us Part 2, I guess, had a little bit of that, but yes. Okay.
The podcast is over. We're at twitter.com backpagepod.com if you want to follow us on there. Same on Blue Sky Backpagepod.
patreon.com backpagepod if you'd like to support the podcast financially. Matthew, where are you on social media?
I am MrBazzle underscore pesto on Twitter or MrBazzle pesto no underscore on Blue Sky.
Oh man. He's still not posting on there. Do you read Blue Sky as well, Matthew?
No, because like I say, it's just Jim Rossinger.
And me. And us.
And occasionally you.
Yeah, that's about it.
Just sort of focus testing your spicier material before you take it to the big leagues.
Yeah, basically. It's highly embarrassing. Okay.
Well, I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both platforms. Thank you so much.
Next week's episode is the best Sega games with Ashley Day. And the week after that is the best games of 2002. So that's coming up.
And yes, we'll see you next week.
