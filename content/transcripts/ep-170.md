I'm Samuel Roberts, joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we're joined by another special guest. This week's guest is Steven Messner, former senior reporter at PC Gamer and PRO Communications Lead at Blackbird Interactive, and most importantly, a very nice man. Steven, how's it going?
It's going really, really well. Thanks so much for having me on the podcast, you guys.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I remember you being an extremely nice man. Do you think that's a fair characterization?
Do you think of yourself as nice, or have I misremembered there? What do you think?
Yeah, you know, it's really hard to say. I think we might have to take like a wider census and see, I think, in order to get like an authoritative thing. But yeah, I think it's a safe argument.
What I like to think is I spend so much time worrying about whether or not I'm a nice person. And I feel like that's probably a good sign.
I think so.
Not nice people probably don't worry about it.
Why is, so I often hear people mention the idea of Canadian nice. Yes, and it get the rough idea of it. But like, is that is that like a legit thing?
Or is that just like a meme? Oh, it is a thing, right?
No, like, and I'm very aware of it. And it's funny, because people call me out on it all the time. And like Canadian niceness is just like bending over backwards to essentially like apologize for everything.
At least that's how it manifests with me. So it's like the funny thing of like, you know, someone, you're in a grocery store in an aisle and someone's trying to get by you. And you're like, oh, I'm sorry.
And it's like, why did I say I'm sorry? Like, I'm just, you know, occupying space. I haven't like really inconvenienced this person.
But it's just that kind of the knee jerk reaction to say I'm sorry for everything. Which, yeah, I'm actually I'm fairly certain also that with Canadian legal system, because like in the American legal system, there's a lot of stuff around like, you know, don't say you're sorry because that admits fault. Oh, and in the Canadian legal system, and I could be like, this might be like kind of like a wives tale type thing, but I'm fairly certain that we have like some clauses in effect that essentially say like apologizing is not an admission of fault, because it's such a knee jerk reaction for so many Canadians.
Is is this this Canadian niceness? Is this a thing that kicks in when a Canadian is outside of Canada? So in the US or it because presumably if everyone is like this in Canada, then no one ever has to apologize or you're all apologizing to each other.
How?
Yeah, we're just constantly all apologizing to each other.
Right.
Yeah, it's it's it really is quite troublesome. And we have a hard time getting stuff done as a country.
But I'm glad we brought you on to explain the concept of Canada to people. That's a useful service, Steven. So the few reasons I wanted to have you on, Steven.
So you've you know, you worked as a reporter on PC Gamer, and that's just something we've not really talked about on this podcast before. And so, you know, I just I remember you were just a very sort of affable presence in meetings when I worked on PC Gamer. And I just thought he's Steven's a good guy.
He's got an interesting history working in media and now working in PR. So he'd be like a great guest. So excited to dip into some of that, and particularly as we get to the second section of the episode here.
But to start with, I wanted to know how you got into video games and what were your sort of key techs growing up? Did you, were there certain games platforms you had access to? And did that determine the things that you're interested in?
Yeah, for sure. I mean, gaming, I think probably, you know, it's a common answer, but it was always just something I was very obsessed with. Like as early as I could remember, I just was absorbed by the concept of games.
So, you know, when I was a little kid, I think we had an NES, was probably one of my first. Actually, I remember having like a family friend that had an Atari 2600 and just wanting to be at their house all the time to play it. Like not even a veneer of like, hey, let's hang out.
It was like, let me just come over and play your Atari, please. And then, you know, we had the Nintendo consoles growing up. So growing up, I was very much like a Nintendo kid exposed to the stuff there.
And yeah, it was just from as early as I can remember, games basically took over my entire life. Many years later, I realized that I have ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD.
And that explained a lot of things, because for people with ADHD, video games can often be like they have trouble regulating their their relationship with video games, we'll say charitably. And it's funny because I'm like, I look back and I'm like, how were my parents not more concerned? Because it was very much like from sundown or sunrise to sundown or bedtime, I would be just playing video games if I could.
In terms of like key texts and stuff like that. Yeah, like I said, I was really big into the Nintendo stuff early on, just because it was the most accessible thing. It was kind of like, you know, my parents were like, I guess we'll buy this kid a console.
What do we buy them? But I think when it comes to like the key games that had the most kind of formative stuff on my life, I would say Harvest Moon actually is a weird one. Harvest Moon 64 specifically, which was on the Nintendo 64.
I just I rented it from the video game store one day, just took a chance on it. And that game took over my life for like a good several years. But funny enough, like purely through this relationship of renting it for three days at a time, I would rent it on the weekends and play it for basically every waking moment of the day until I would go to bed and I would just manage to beat it in a 72 hour period.
And then I would return it to the video store and a week or two would go by. And I would repeat that process again and again and again.
That's kind of fitting given the game and its routines.
Exactly. But I think, yeah, from a very young age, I was just always like so, you know, enraptured by video games and what they were, just like these, you know, mystery boxes you could plug into this machine and be teleported into this entirely different world. And it didn't really matter to me what world that was.
I just found all of them, like, you know, incredibly compelling.
So, yeah, damn, I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that that particular Harvest Moon game was so important to them. It might just be because it's kind of like near the end of the Generation N64 game. So it wasn't picked up that much.
Like the GBA one, I hear people talk about a lot of the Game Boy Color one. But yeah, yeah, like, it's that's really interesting.
That one is, yeah, it's a bit more obscure, right? I ended up buying a copy of it years and years later, and it's one of the more rare carts for the N64. So I had to shell out, you know, the price of those fluctuates.
But I think at the time, just for the cart, not even the box, I shelled out like 80 bucks.
Wow, game school.
But I was, yeah, it felt right to that I had to own a copy of that game. So it was it was money well spent.
Yeah, I'm sure it's only gone up loads and loads since then anyway. So post pandemic with the big boom in retro prices. So, yeah, that's right.
The way I see it, it's my kid's college fund. Just, you know, in a nice, cute little package somewhere in the basement.
Was it a big deal for you when Stardew Valley came along, Steven? Did that really happen for you as a game?
Yeah, like it's so funny because, you know, I don't know how big Harvest Moon was at that time. And so it's kind of I've always been fascinated by the way Stardew Valley seemed to tap into this appeal because it almost felt like that game was tapping into this collective desire that everybody had from playing Harvest Moon games. But I just know that's not the case because Harvest Moon games were fairly niche ish, you know?
But yeah, like seeing that game, it was I was so excited about it when I first discovered it. And I discovered it actually even years before launch. When I was a freelance journalist and I messaged Eric Barone and was like, let me write a story on this, please, please, please.
And he was very like he was very nice, but he was like, I don't want to do any kind of hype building for this thing. So I'm going to have to pass. But I I followed its progress all the way up into launch and then reviewed it for Rock Paper Shotgun, actually.
And it was just a very, like, surreal experience, a to kind of finally be playing it after so many years of watching it. But then also to see this thing capture so perfectly the essence of those games that defined my childhood. And then also then become, you know, this enormous cultural zeitgeist that it became at the same time.
So, yeah, yeah, it still is somehow like a yes. A couple of weeks ago, there were some patch notes kind of like, you know, sort of fun that Eric was having that again, set the Internet kind of haywire. And yeah, it's an old game at this point.
It's like eight years old, I think. So, yeah, amazing. It's still it's still got that footprint after all this time.
So, Steven, we have belabored the Canadian point. So I do apologize for that.
But you are our first Canadian guest. And I was curious if there was anything distinctive about the Canadian games landscape versus the rest of North America in the North East. I know you're slightly slightly younger than me.
Maybe three or four years younger than me. So did you have your own sort of games culture there or games press, that sort of thing?
Yeah, I mean, Canada always kind of struggles with like American cultural imperialism, where the borders are really blurred a lot of the time. So I would say like a lot of it, the games culture was just defined by what was happening in the US. But we did have some pockets and some like influence sort of, you know, vice versa, where I think we had some influence on the American game scene from a media perspective.
And that was like largely down to this this one guy. Oh, my gosh, now I'm totally blanking on his name, Victor Lucas. Victor Lucas is like this Canadian journalist.
I don't know if you guys if that name even rings a bell.
It sort of does, but I can't say why.
Yeah, I think if you were an American, it would it would probably be, you know, he would be more recognizable. But he was a TV personality, essentially. And he had this show called Electric Playground.
And another one called Reviews on the Run. And they were both like mainstay features of sort of this golden era of gaming TV that existed in North America, where it was this channel called Tech TV, G4 Tech TV. And they just pumped out a ton of stuff like Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb with like X-Play and all of these iconic shows.
And Victor Lucas was a part of that, but he was Canadian. And those shows, though they aired on Tech TV, were also syndicated on a lot of the local Canadian networks. And so he's always kind of the person I point to as like, this was our mark on sort of the games media, you know, tapestry is Victor Lucas and these shows that he was producing, which were, yeah, reviews on the run was amazing because it was like very weird to me to be a young teen.
And there were times where we just didn't even have access to cable growing up. And so we were watching, we always called it Peasant Vision, which is probably a bit rude. But, you know, to be like the standard channels that you just kind of pick up.
And it was so incredible to me to be able to tune in to gaming content on a local station and watch something like reviews on the run where they basically were just, you know, doing rapid fire five minute reviews on games. Yeah.
Yeah. So I've realized now I have met Victor Lucas. He was on a press trip I did for Assassin's Creed Odyssey about five, six years ago.
So, yeah, I literally did meet him one day.
So, yeah, there you go. He's a very nice man. And I mean, he's still doing his thing.
I think obviously like the rise of digital media probably through a wrench in some of the plans that he had for his little like TV media empire. But he sort of transitioned everything over to that. And so he still has, as far as I'm aware, like a podcast and a YouTube channel called Electric Playground where he's still talking about and reviewing and talking about games and stuff like that.
So yeah, he's always like my slice of like Canadian in the games industry that I'm proud of.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think we had a similar thing here where you'd have one or two TV shows that would talk about games and they seemed incredibly significant because they were legitimate media in your eyes. And yeah, like normal people could stumble across them in a way they wouldn't necessarily go to the home page of a major website.
So yeah, I agree that was important here too.
Are you aware of the existence of Games Master, Steven?
It's a name that like I've I know I've heard before, but I don't feel like I have a great understanding.
So the face of our games coverage in the UK was they took a famous astronomer like this old guy called Patrick Moore, probably in his 60s or 70s. They gave him a monocle and they kind of CG'd out his body and his floating head was like would dispense games tips to kids who and you'd have to like beg him. That was the sort of format of it.
You'd beg the games master for help and then he'd sort of, you know, Dane to help you. So that was the state of UK games coverage.
Yeah, kind of like Modoc from The Avengers. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Please, sir, could I have a games tip?
The phrase was, you should have say, I desperately need your help. Say, games master, I desperately need your help. You know, is there a level select for Sonic the Hedgehog 2?
And then this old guy who'd never played a game in his life would be like, you know, you have to press up, down, left, right, left, right, A, B. Now get him. And he'd say, get him out of my sight.
Yeah, that's fascinating. That reminds me of that recent thing. I don't know if you guys saw for for Tekken where they had on.
I'm blanking on his name. Yeah, yeah. Brian Cox doing like the history of Tekken.
And it's like, yeah, I love this idea of taking people. Yeah, people who have absolutely no bearing in the games industry and making them, you know, talk about the absolute worst excesses of it. Yeah.
Yeah, that's it as well because Brian Cox also hosts it. Like he is Logan Roy on one of the fictional succession TV networks, you know, or like delivering an investicle in the universe of succession. So it just happens to be about, yeah, like sort of like Paul Phoenix or whatever.
Yeah, kicking people out of helicopters into volcanoes or whatever. The weird like meme with Tekken is.
Yeah, exactly. So I guess you've hinted at it a bit there, Steven, but is there any other games media that you consumed when you were growing up that ended up being influential or important to you?
Yeah, magazines were like the other big one for me. In fact, I would say magazines, especially when I was younger, that was like the way I accessed it because the TV stuff was more, you know, in my teens and around then, like the Internet was starting to take off anyway. So there was a few different options.
But like as a kid, it was magazines big time. So like Nintendo Power was a big one. And then as I got a little older, I finally managed to convince my mom to start buying me PC Gamers.
It was funny because I actually grew up in a very strict evangelical household. And so my parents were very conscious about the type of media that they were allowing me to consume. And with the PC Gamers, my mom resisted very hard against it because, you know, especially in the 90s, PC Gamer was like very, you know, edgy and racy and the ads were, you know, very tasteless to put, you know, not to find a point on it or could be tasteless.
Not all of them. It's not like across the board, but probably from her perspective, it certainly was. And so what she used to do, actually, and I did not know this for many, many years, but she used to buy the magazines used from some local bookstore and cut out all of the offensive pages.
And hand me this bastardized version of a PC Gamer. And I was too young to realize, which is kind of funny because I think back on it now. And I'm like, what did I think was happening when I was in the middle of reading an article and I would turn the page and that article was just like done.
Shoddy magazine production.
Totally. So, but I don't think I cared too much at the time because, of course, you know, I wanted to read, wanted to read the articles and the reviews especially, but I also just loved pouring through those magazines and just seeing games. I think that's what it was to me.
It was like fantasizing about this, this, you know, all of these worlds that existed and it was so wild to just, you know, get this book or this magazine and open it up and turn pages and just see, you know, wildly different experiences that were out there. And I think I used to just spend so much time looking at them and then fantasizing about what those games actually were like to play beyond sort of these screenshots or these few words that I was reading. And so both of those were like very formative to me.
Nintendo Power used to have this thing where you could write letters to the editor, but they wanted you to decorate the envelope, like draw on the envelope and draw like Mario characters or Kirby or something like that, Nintendo characters. And I was obsessed with doing that. I feel like I sent them so many envelopes.
And I wasn't enough of a regular subscriber. So maybe I got in one day and managed to get my because they would display the envelopes in the magazine. Maybe one of my envelopes got on display, but I must have submitted like at least a dozen of them.
I've also had a conspiratorial thought where I was like, what if this is like, I don't know, it feels like it's like a cliche from like war movies where like the mom kept all the letters from the person's lover as he was like on duty. And I'm like, what if my mom just never sent those those envelopes? Yeah, I'll put this in the mail right away, son.
And it just went straight in the bin.
The same draw with all the all the racy adverts.
I feel like I'm painting a very negative photo of my mom. She's a wonderful woman. If you're listening to this, mom, thank you for supporting me.
But, you know, I have my suspicions. I'm on to you.
Out of curiosity, Steven, is that how you ended up being like a Harvest Moon person? Did you want to play Perfect Dark, but you couldn't? And Harvest Moon was a little bit more palatable to your family, maybe?
Or am I kind of like misjudging there?
Yeah, like with a lot of games, like it was weird because I, you know, I did say like my parents were very controlling on the types of media, but then they also were not technically literate. So it was also very easy to kind of sneak in games that I wanted to play. So I never really had to like, yeah, like the short answer there is no.
I think Harvest Moon. I don't know what it was that just absorbed me about that game, but like I was so obsessed with it. I just loved, I think, like this romanticized life of farming and the the gameplay of it, like just living in this world, talking to these characters.
I had played the Super Nintendo version a little bit on an emulator at a friend's house, and that was actually like my first Harvest Moon kind of experience. And then once I had an N64, Harvest Moon 64 was just the way to kind of tap into that. But like, yeah, like I have some like very embarrassing things to demonstrate, like how obsessed I was with Harvest Moon because like I had a journal and I would, I would document my imaginary days in Harvest Moon.
Not like what I actually accomplished when I was playing the game actively. It was like a thought exercise where it was like, and on Monday I'm going to wake up and water my crops and I'm going to give Ellie a gift and I'm going to go to talk to the mayor and like, like just kind of like fantasizing about what I would do in the game if I couldn't be playing it at any one time. Yeah, I was a weird kid.
I don't know.
I think that's very weird.
I don't understand why your mother policed you like this.
I think that's actually very sweet, Steven. So just to offer a bit of balance to Matthew's comment.
Did you live in a city or a countryside?
I lived in like a small town that was close to a city. So a city was very accessible.
I was just curious if part of the rural idea was not being in it.
Yeah. I think I was right on the line. Where I live in Canada, it's the Midwest, so it's very cowboy country.
I often joke that Alberta, the province I'm in, is the Texas of the North, which is surprisingly apt for good and evil. So I think I was just on that threshold of enough exposure to that rural farming culture that I could see the appeal of it, and then this game allowed me to dig deeper into it. I even remember, I was so obsessed with it, I just was telling my parents I'm going to be a farmer when I grow up, and my mom used to buy me farming trade magazines.
Did she cut the adverts out of those, too?
Yeah, you want to talk about racy ads, man. Farming magazines were, whoo!
What I like is that I can tell Matthew is forming his impression of what Canada is in real time on this podcast. Yeah, so that's super interesting, Steven. I actually really like hearing you talk about Harvest Moon.
I think that's extremely wholesome, you discussing that. I remember as well, when I was talking about where you live now, we were in a meeting at one point, and you said to me, oh yeah, we're covered in like four feet of snow or something, and that's it for us now for like weeks. And you seemed so chill about it, and it sounded to me like the most stressful thing in the world.
Is that something you contend with, just a lot of snow year round?
Yeah, it's funny that you say that because over the past three days, we have had like four feet of snow, so I'm actively in that situation right now, Sam. And I'm doing okay. I'm holding in there.
Yeah, it's just like a weird reality of living where we do, where we just get a metric ton of snow during the winter months and you just kind of deal with it. There's definitely always a part of the year in spring where the weather turns and you kind of go outside and it's like the first day where you can maybe like wear shorts or a t-shirt. And it's really actually not that warm out.
It's like maybe six degrees out. But relatively speaking, you've just come out of, you know, a deep freeze. So it feels like tropical, balmy summer weather.
And there's always just this moment where I feel like I shed seasonal depression like a snake sheds its skin. But it happens like in the course of a day where I... And then I realize that I'm like, oh my God, for the past six months, like, is this how I was feeling?
Like, this wasn't how I was feeling. It's like this wake up call of like, oh man, seasonal depression is a real thing. But yeah, it's just part of being Canadian.
Yeah, fair enough. So I kind of wondered if I maybe got this wrong, Steven, but I always associated you with MMOs when you worked at PC Gamer. Is that accurate to the sort of history of your games taste?
Or was that something you became interested in, you know, because you knew it was a way into games journalism? What relationship did MMOs have with you as a younger man, I guess?
Yeah, yeah, no, MMOs were definitely a part of my life fairly early on. My first MMO was RuneScape, which, you know, obviously, Jagex is from the UK. But yeah, RuneScape, I had a friend that played it at school and got me into it, and that was my first real experience, like playing sort of this online, massively multiplayer game.
And I feel like the word obsession is going to be used a lot here, talking about my relationship with video games. But I also was obsessed with RuneScape to the point where, you know, PC Gamer, we published some pretty funny stories on RuneScape over the years, and a lot of them felt very close to home because I was that person who was like waking up at four in the morning, actually. Like, again, I don't know why my parents didn't intervene more strongly into my relationship with video games.
But RuneScape, I was like waking up at four a.m. I was like, you know, a nine year old and sneaking into our family office and stuffing, I had this whole scheme set up because I'd been caught a few times and I had developed ways to mitigate that. And I was stuffing a pillow under the door so you couldn't see the light under the door if my parents woke up because their room was like right across from the office.
And then I would bring another pillow and I would hug the computer while I connected the modem to the Internet because it would make that, you know, god-awful noise. My only way of dealing with it was to try and muffle it by, like, you know, doing the shh-shh-shh to my computer as I, like, stuffed a pillow over its head. I was like, stop making this noise.
And then praying that my parents did not hear, you know, those boops and beeps until I was online and could then play RuneScape for four hours before I'd have to go to school. And that was, like, my daily routine. And I would just sit there, not...
It's funny because, like, RuneScape... I don't know if you guys have played RuneScape.
A tiny bit.
A tiny bit. Yeah, like, I would spend those four hours just clicking on, like, a coal vein and filling my inventory with coal and then going to the bank and depositing the coal and then just doing that again. Like, it's really sad looking back on it because it's like, how is that?
But in my mind, I was like, I'm a coal baron and I'm going to sell all this coal for millions of dollars and get the nicest armor in the game. And so anyway, RuneScape was like my first MMO sort of passion. And then I think really sort of prototypically like when World of Warcraft launched, that was the big one that got me into MMOs.
And from that point on, I think I was always just very fascinated with MMOs and the potential they held. I mean, especially at the time, right? Because MMOs were like the original social network.
It's easy to take it for granted today because we have Twitter and Facebook and all this other stuff. But like back when World of Warcraft or RuneScape or any of these early ones were first launching, there wasn't a lot of easy ways to connect with people online, friends or strangers. And back then, obviously, I'm not saying the internet back then was totally safe, but it was definitely a lot more wholesome.
I think people back in the day were just, the novelty of it was so charming, and people were just genuinely so excited to like talk with a random person online. And that concept was like just so baffling to people. So they were very genuine about it.
Whereas like today, I feel like you kind of, if you meet a stranger online, like the default is to assume they're an asshole until they prove otherwise, you know?
Yeah. Yeah. I do remember that moment before Facebook and when MySpace existed where, wow did feel like the center of the universe of like all things.
Yeah.
And I imagine for a younger man, it was very exciting to be a part of that. Did you keep up with wow consistently for years or was that something you kind of dipped in and out of?
Definitely there was probably like a solid gear and then I kind of dipped in and out of it. It's funny because I never, I played it a lot, but I never like really broke into that layer of like hardcore raiding or you know, any like that kind of group activities that people often associate with like, you know, high level World of Warcraft play. I was always, I guess, probably just a lot more social.
I just really enjoyed leveling in that game and hanging out with people and just kind of existing in that world.
Were you a coal baron in wow too?
I was, absolutely. No, I was killing cobalt for like cloth scraps that I would then sell on the auction house. Yeah, it definitely was like a social thing.
Like it was, World of Warcraft was funny because it was like the great equalizer at my school where it didn't matter if you were like a jock or a cool kid or we're into skateboarding. Like whatever the kind of stereotypical clicks were, everybody was playing wow. And that was kind of a cool thing to see.
So it just felt like this thing you had to be a part of. And I think for me it was like, yeah, this combination of like doing it to spend time with my real life friends, but then also being really obsessed with like the concept of just being able to meet people online and play with them as well and just kind of have those those random social interactions.
Do you think that there's a connection between the types of stories you'd end up telling as a reporter, which are kind of like these, these human stories in MMOs and, and your way into WoW as someone who just enjoyed the social side of it?
Yeah, absolutely. Like, I don't think it was ever an intentional thing. But I think it was just born out of, like with writing and stuff, I think I was just always honestly trying to write stuff because I found it interesting.
And so it wasn't sort of like a strategic decision by any means. It was more of just like, well, this is kind of what I know and this is what I think is cool. And I just was very lucky in that other people agreed.
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, that's super interesting. We'll come back to the MMO stuff in the second part.
But no, I was curious if anything else changed with the types of games you were interested in as an adult, were there other types of games that kind of entered your sphere as you got a little bit older, you had access to everything?
Yeah, you kind of hit on it, right? Like getting access to everything. Like once I got older and kind of had more money to spend and I wasn't as beholden to my parents to get access to games.
That's when I got into PC gaming much more passionately, I guess you would say. I had a friend in my 20s who was really into PC gaming. And when I say PC gaming, I mean kind of like how we think of the modern culture of it.
So it's like shelling out thousands of dollars for a really nice rig and playing on Steam, which I bought a gaming PC to play WoW, but it was like this crappy $400 one. Like gaming PC is charitable. I bought a PC to play WoW.
It had 128 megabyte video card in it. But that friend introduced me to the more modern concept of PC gaming to the point where I ended up buying my own machine. And I think that ended up being this portal because at that time, Steam was really blowing up.
And that was really my portal into the wide world of video games, not just sort of the stuff that I was playing on Nintendo or AAA gaming, which up until then I was kind of chained to. But that's where it was playing Amnesia and Team Fortress 2 and everything kind of in between. And so I got really obsessed with that, and I never really had much of a preference towards anything.
I just kind of love all types of games. I mean, there's definitely genres I don't really spend a lot of time with, but I was just kind of interested in trying out a little bit of everything. And so that's kind of, I think, was the dominant focus of most of my adult life.
Now I am a dad and I have two children. And so as you can imagine, my ability to play games is much more limited, or my time to play games is much more limited. And so like MMOs is actually probably the one big thing that I've mostly just given up because the time investment there is just exorbitant.
And I also just don't have the same sort of like, the social element doesn't appeal to me quite as much anymore. Just because I think I'm far more kind of wrapped up in my family and wanting to spend time. Like my kids, that might sound a bit sad, but like my kids are like a big social component for me now.
I kind of get that social element from them.
Yeah, you're like, I'll create my own friends.
Yeah, that's the next level, right? Like, yeah, screw having a guild. I'll make my own guild.
I mean, that is kind of the dream, obviously, one day. To be able to play some kind of game like that with your family would be really cool. But yeah, so MMOs I think has really just kind of fallen away.
At the same time, I think that genre has kind of stagnated it in a disappointing way, I would say. It felt like in the early aughts, it had unlimited potential. And I think the genre just has failed to kind of expand that potential or even capitalize on it or evolve the potential, I guess you could say, over time.
And I think MMOs also have just been sort of gobbled up by other games or other genres, I should say, where they're kind of like, oh, look at what MMOs were doing to keep people coming back and playing them for years at a time. What if we just incorporated that system into our game? Yeah, absolutely.
Survival games, first person shooters, et cetera.
Yeah, Destiny is like a classic example of that, which obviously that game is very much like an MMO hybrid. It's not like the first person shooter that kind of stole pieces of MMO. But it was always when I first played it, I remember playing Destiny 1 and getting into it and seeing the faction system where you kind of had to grind reputation with these different factions and was like, oh, they just straight lifted that out of World of Warcraft and some other popular MMOs.
And I think daily login bonuses if you want to get really cynical on the more marketing or dark pattern side of it.
Did you see the writing on the wall for like, oh, this is going to be the way of things from now on? Having experienced it in MMOs, you're like, oh, of course, because as someone who didn't play MMO, I've never really played a proper MMO. And I only know them through this new generation where it's now like, it just seems like, well, of course, of course, this will make sense.
I don't think I was super aware of it as it was happening. Definitely kind of hindsight is 2020. Like you look back and you go, oh, of course, right?
And even just the way that genre also became like a graveyard for so many games and like big IP games. Like there was this era, right, of like post World of Warcraft. Everybody saw this enormous success that World of Warcraft had and wanted to, you know, take the throne.
They wanted to kick it off the throne and take it for themselves. And so all these kind of claimant games rose up to challenge World of Warcraft and like most of them died. And it was just this very kind of surreal time.
And so I think also just like the economics of building these games proved to be kind of unreasonable and so unsustainable. And so it just kind of makes sense that instead of, you know, you know, the World of Warcraft killer that everyone's been talking about for decades actually coming around, the fabled Messiah, instead it's like no other games have just kind of gobbled it up. Done, I think, part of what MMO, like, taken what made MMO special and just kind of found ways to incorporate that in their own genres.
Much like, you know, roguelikes are kind of this genre now that exists as like an ingredient that you add to other genres. Right, right. I think MMOs are kind of the same thing, where it's like a cake base, and then you just add the flavor on top.
Yeah, that's a really good way of putting it. I think I, yeah, I think I largely agree. I just remember that just like every single one, like even when I started editing PC Gamer, there was like WildStar and Firefall, and they were just like, they go away so fast, even though people seem to really like WildStar.
And, yeah, the people who liked it really liked it, but it just, yeah, became such a difficult economy to sort of crack, essentially. So, yeah, it's tough, but yeah, super interesting. I guess it did prepare you for this episode.
I did always love reading those death of an MMO articles, or like reporting from like the last hour of an MMO. Like I've never played it, but I will always click on those, because I just like the idea of like everyone sort of standing together as the lights go out.
Yes. Oh my God.
Me too.
Yeah. Well, the idea of like these worlds existing, but also just being kind of empty, is like so tragic and like fascinating at the same time. Like even MMOs that are kind of still around today, but no one's really playing them.
I just, I love like going into those, you know, cities and seeing like the desolation or the like the lack of people. And it just feels like, you know, you're walking around a ghost town and there's just, there's tons of them out there, really. Like there's just all these virtual ghost towns that either just never failed to kind of realize their potential or, you know, had a kind of golden years.
And then it faded as people moved on to something else. And I just, I'm very obsessed with that concept. I know there's just something very emotional about that experience, I think.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I remember reading a good one on Star Wars Galaxies at some point. I can't remember where that was.
It might even have been PC Gamer, but yeah, it's, I agree. It's a great sort of foundation for stories, these kind of stories.
You might be thinking of, yeah, I think Chris Thurston wrote an iconic bit about galaxies shutting down.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah, that is right. And the atmosphere, as everyone kind of gathered together to watch this thing.
As all the Wookiees disintegrated.
Yeah, yeah, Marvel style. Just pixelate off into nothing. But yeah, my favorite one was actually The Matrix Online because what they did, a few different developers over the years have done kind of fun, cheeky stuff with their games shutting down.
But with Matrix, they went for like straight body horror because when the game finally shut down, I think everyone's avatars basically like compressed in on themselves, like imploded into like jagged limbs and like just real kind of like creepy and like screamed in pain and then the game just shut off. So it was like, you know, it was like this beautiful end moment punctuated by this moment of like sheer horror before the game was just like server offline. And then Planetside was one that I actually did document.
And I was a freelancer at the time, and it's my like one claim to YouTube fame because that video has close to a million views on it. But I documented the end of Planetside and joined in a Discord server. And I wasn't really much of a Planetside player, but I joined a Discord server and just kind of like did a ride along with these people who had been, you know, diehard Planetside fans and just kind of experienced like the last big epic battle together.
And so everybody kind of had like this one last big clash before the servers were going to end. And then when the servers were just about to be shut down, enormous meteors started falling from the sky. And so I had all this great footage of everybody on the server or everyone on this Discord server.
And there's probably like 40 of us or something in this chat channel losing their minds because it felt like the apocalypse. And I think I think that's the appeal, right? Like you're getting to witness these like mini virtual apocalypses.
And it feels very like it feels real because you're actually losing something like this thing is going to disappear forever after that. And so it kind of has maybe not the same gravity of a real world apocalypse, but certainly like a small simulation of it. And there's just something kind of tragically appealing about that, I think.
Yeah, if I compress it on myself at the end of the real world, I'll be really, really upset and cross.
Yeah, I don't want that one to be clear. Meteors, I could take a roof, but yeah, please. You know, let's not all turn into like balls of goo that have compressed on themselves.
Well, that feels like a good night to take a quick break, Steven. And we'll come back and ask you a bunch more questions about MMOs and working on PC Gamer, sure.
So it's time to ambush Steven with a whole bunch of questions about his time on PC Gamer. No doubt we'll talk about some more cool MMO stuff because as mentioned, Steven's really good at finding those stories, talking about those stories. So excited to get into it.
So we're always interested in reporting Steven. It's an ancient art in journalism, but a bit of a newer phenomenon in games media. What prompted your interest in it?
Yeah, it's funny. I simply wasn't. When I was in high school, actually, I was very kind of aimless.
I didn't know what I wanted to do, and I had a friend and somehow we settled on this pact of like, we're going to go to journalism, we're going to go to school and get journalism degrees.
Totally forgot about that until years and years later when I actually was a journalist and he brought that up and was like, hey, isn't that funny that you came full circle on that? I was like, oh, I totally forgot. But I never really had a specific interest in reporting.
No, I definitely was kind of interested in this concept of like talking about video games and being in games media early on, especially I think a lot of that was informed by YouTube actually. I'd always consumed games media, traditional media, PC Gamer and Kotaku and Polygon and all the temple websites. I think YouTube was where I first was like, oh, this is cool that people are making videos and doing critiques or essays or talking about games or even just Let's Plays.
I'd always like video work, so that was my first introduction to it. And then eventually it kind of like was this winding path that led me into writing about games, which then led me into it was only kind of after the fact that I kind of realized that I was a reporter. And then once I realized that I was kind of already doing that, I took ownership of that identity and then was also like, okay, now I need to be very intentional in like sharpening the skills of a like the sort of traditional skills of a reporter.
That all kind of came later.
Mm. Yeah, that's what were you doing before you became a freelance writer?
Absolutely nothing. It was a dark time. Yeah, no, but for real, actually, like, I was I was 25, I would say, when I like kind of started this shift.
And I had graduated high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do, I couldn't really like commit to anything. And so I ended up moving to the West Coast to work with my cousin at a bakery he owned on this like very small island filled with Vietnam Draft Dodgers and hippies. Wow.
Very weird place. Yeah, there was like maybe 3000 like full time residents on that island.
That sounds like a like a modern indie game. Like you set up a bakery for war vets.
Yeah, like a bakery for war vets. Totally. Yeah.
Yeah. It's like coffee talk. But you talk about Vietnam and drugs.
Yeah, it was like a really weird place for me to go. It was meant to be like a summer thing. And I ended up staying there for God, like two, three years maybe.
Probably more that I just didn't have the inertia to go anywhere else. So it was sort of like, I don't know. And then I had moved back to the city in sort of my mid 20s under the guise of moved back home under the guise of going to school and then still could not bring myself to do that and ended up just kind of getting a job.
I was working in oil and gas records digitization, which I actually promise you is more boring than it sounds. I would sit at a computer all day and we would scan paper documents and just turn them into digital documents and I would sit at a computer all day and just press the down arrow and listen to podcasts.
Out of interest, what was the internet situation like on that island? Was it like bad sort of like connection? Could you play MMOs out there?
How good was the internet connection in that place?
It was actually pretty good. There were islands, so it's called like the Southern Gulf Islands and there's a bunch of them out there and there's definitely ones out there that had like off the grid living and there were people that would live on those islands and basically be entirely off the grid. Salt Spring, the island I was on, was actually fairly well connected.
It wasn't totally roughing it. It had a grocery store and restaurants and a fairly kind of vibrant culture. So we had I had decent internet.
I could play games.
Salt Spring is even a good name for an indie game.
The more you say this, Maddie, the more I'm like, this is the game I'm going to pitch. Salt Spring, it's a farming simulator or maybe not a farming simulator, but it has very Harvest Moon-esque.
Yeah.
All the pieces are coming together here.
Do you maintain any of your bakery know-how? Do you make good bread or cakes?
Yeah. Sorry. I definitely should have been more clear.
I serve coffee.
They did not trust me with the bread. I know that if I could make myself amazing cakes, I would have been dead by now, I think.
Right. Yeah. No, I was not trusted with the baking.
I was trusted with talking to the customers and then handing them the baked goods.
That's still cool.
Yeah. Thank you for tolerating our forensic questions about the Ireland you lived on many years ago, Steven. It's appreciated.
Your patience in this difficult time.
It's like a weird era of my life. It's the kind of thing where you're like, it's nice to have people interested in it because I always am like, what a weird chapter of my life. I certainly don't want to be that person that's just like, well, actually, let me tell you about this thing totally unprompted.
Yeah, yeah. No, absolutely. It is genuinely fascinating.
So yeah, thank you for the detail. So how did you break in as a freelancer after that?
Yeah. So working at that job, I definitely started to succumb to, I guess, the equivalent of a quarter life crisis or whatever, because all of my friends, most of them were probably graduated by that point. And they were starting careers and you know what I mean?
Everybody felt like they were growing up. And I felt like I was making just above minimum wage, doing this very boring, unskilled job. And that really started to eat away at me.
And I, to be honest, just really started having this existential crisis where I was like, oh my God, I'm in my mid-20s. I feel like I've wasted a lot of years of my life not doing anything. And just sort of had this, I think it's sort of like a coming of age moment where you're just like, life does not just hand you opportunities.
I mean, it does for some people, but at least for me, in that moment I was like, life's not going to hand me anything. And so I'd always been really attracted to writing. I always had dreams of being an author and doing creative writing and stuff like that.
And then I always liked video games. And so I was kind of like, and then like I said, I was always like kind of listening to these video gaming podcasts and stuff when I was at work. And so I was sort of came to this idea of like, well, what if I became like a games journalist?
Like what if I could work at IGN or something? For whatever reason, IGN was like the website that was always in my head at that time. My conviction was like, if I don't know how to get a job at IGN, I'll just make my own IGN, which the hubris that 25 year old Steve had had was off the charts.
But I'm kind of glad that a young, plucky me had the audacity to think such silly thoughts. But that's exactly what I did. So I had a friend that was very into the concept of startups and the entrepreneurial space and wanted a business to run.
And he and I got together over drinks one night and I was just lamenting things and talking about these aspirations I had and he was talking about his aspirations that he had and we just kind of realized like, well, what if we work together and like started like a gaming blog and just treated it like deadly serious. Like it was a company, like it was a business. And the kind of noble goal of it was like, we don't know how to do this stuff.
Like we're outsiders, I don't have this experience. I'm not a games journalist. I don't know how to become one, but maybe we can bring in some other people who maybe feel similarly and we can all kind of work together.
And like critique one another and, you know, workshop and hopefully grow as a team. And maybe we would have a shot at doing something. So we launched this blog.
It was called Pixel Attack and I was like the editor in chief of it. And I spent, you know, four months like building or heavily customizing this WordPress theme that I had bought to make this thing look really pretty and kind of, you know, official. And we pulled together this team of writers that I just found.
It was like a montage from, I don't know, what's that new Zack Snyder movie where you're just like going around the different, the solar system being like, you know, recruiting people and being like, come join our.
Rebel mood reference on this podcast. How exciting.
Yeah.
I'm glad I could provide this service to your audience. Yeah, so, you know, putting together this crack team of writers and which was, you know, in reality, we were all just like, you know, bumbling buffoons who didn't know what we were doing, but we're like, we'll figure it out as we go. And we launched this blog and really, that was like my first time writing.
And I think like, you know, as someone now that has had a career in writing, you know, when I talk to people who want to get into it or whatever, I think one of the most common obstacles or struggles I see people having is not actually writing. And maybe you guys feel similarly, I'm not sure, but there's so many people I think who have these dreams and these ambitions, but they never really sit down to actually put the pen to the page and start. And I understand why, right?
Because when you're not a good writer, but you want to be a good writer, that's like the most painful thing in the world, because you're aware of how terrible at writing you are. And you know, the gap between your aspiration and your execution can be, it's just, it's hard to swallow for a lot of people, and it was for me as well. And so essentially I built this like elaborate apparatus that was essentially just a gun to my head to write, because it was like, now I had these people, I was an editor in chief, and I had, you know, this team of other, you know, fledgling writers who were kind of looking to me to set the tone, and it accomplished what I had struggled so much with up to that point, which was to actually just start putting the pen to the page and writing stuff.
And so that's kind of what happened. And Pixel It actually did like pretty good for itself. Like I think by the end there, when I eventually stepped down from it, about only eight months later, it was a pretty short tenure that I had, which I'll get to why in a second, but I did that for about eight months.
The issue I eventually had was being an editor in chief meant that I was spending a lot more time editing and managing than I was actually writing. And so, and you know, we made some mistakes there, I think with like bringing in volunteers, but then not, you know, it's kind of an awkward space to be in because these are people who are, you know, giving up their free time, just like we were evenings and weekends to contribute. And so we kind of felt very like beholden to honoring that and not exploiting that.
Like I really didn't want the website to, you know, we never made money off of it or anything, but I was like, this can't be something where we're like profiting off of other people. And I think we almost took that too far where it was like people that weren't working out. We were too slow to kind of cut them loose because we felt bad.
Right.
Right. Because they were, you know, they were volunteers, but we just had people that, you know, we were basically like pulling in strangers, anyone that had an interest, we would sign them on and try them out. And I think we were just too slow, but that led to a lot of burnout on my part because, you know, you're kind of trudging through editing articles from people that just really either, you know, don't care to improve or just, you know, for whatever reason, right?
And not being paid yourself to do this.
Yeah. And that's all detracting from why I originally started in the first place, which was to write myself and spend more time writing. So eventually there was just a mismatch there.
The kind of big turning point for me was I found this book. Actually, it was this ebook by a gaming freelancer named Nathan Mignet called Up Up, Down Down, Left Right. But right is like write an article.
And it was like, if anyone's listening to this and is like, oh, I want to be a freelancer. This is like the freelancing Bible that this man wrote. And he was like a fairly accomplished freelancer too.
And this thing laid out every aspect of freelancing that people just don't realize. And it's kind of not obvious. But it was everything from like how to pitch a story, including examples of successful pitches, to like major websites.
Like I think there was like a pitch to Polygon in there that had been accepted. So you really got like this deep insight into like what you needed to be doing. Talked about, you know, taxes.
It talked about, you know, how to manage relationships with editors, what types of stories to pitch, what types of stories not to pitch, like, you know, types of articles you can write. Like, it really just was a comprehensive, like, freelancing for dummies guide. And so I read that and had this revelation where I was like, oh, my God, I could have been making money at this the whole time.
And so not to, you know, not that I was just like, you know, all right, screw you, Pixel Attack. But it was sort of this perfect moment of like, okay, well, I'm not super happy with Pixel Attack anymore. You know, I built it up.
It's kind of accomplished this thing that I felt like it had for me. It was time to move on and let someone else who wanted to step in, you know, steer it. So I stepped back and then was like, okay, I'm just going to start freelancing.
And that's it's like a weird thing because it's like, you know, yeah, how did you break in as a freelancer? I just was like, read this thing and was like, okay, I'm going to start doing this now. And so I pitched I pitched an article.
And actually, Sam, I looked at this the other day when I when I was thinking about this podcast, I was like, I want to look at the receipts here. So I went and dug up the email. You know what I'm talking about, right?
I'm glad you brought this up. You tell your side of it and then I'll explain.
You've already kind of outed yourself here. I was intentionally going to allow you to not have to dig into this part, Sam, because I don't think you need to answer for your crimes quite yet. Before God, maybe, but not right now.
I'm just kidding. I'm totally kidding. Anyway, I finally was like, okay, I know how to do a pitch now, so I guess I'll just try pitching.
I had sent one pitch to the Polygon, generic pitch email. That was a really bad pitch and I reread it on the weekend or yesterday and cringed at it. And then two weeks later, I sent the pitch that I think you could say broke me in as a freelancer, which was a pitch to none other than Samuel Roberts himself when he were the editor at PC Gamer.
And it's funny because that moment is so clearly etched in my mind because I was at work and it was fun to kind of look at this email again, but also look at, I sent it at like 9.46. So I remember getting into work. It was the morning.
I'd had this idea. I'd put it together. And then I was like, OK, I'm going to send this email.
And at 9:46 a.m. I hit send. And of course, it was vibrating with the nerves and the energy of it.
And I was like, oh, my God, you know, I'm going to be sick. But also was like, you know, don't get your hopes up, whatever. And then started working and five, six minutes later, I had this reply from you in my inbox.
And you were like, that's a killer pitch. Like, you know, would you take, you know, X amount of dollars for it? And that sent me into like a full on panic attack in the middle of my office, where I was like, I had my head between my knees, breathe, like trying to control my breathing because I felt like I was going to pass out.
And I was also like trying to prevent myself from hyperventilating because it was such an enormous euphoric rush of like, oh, my God, I just pitched a story and an editor likes it and wants to publish it. And I just couldn't believe that that had happened. And it was, you know, crazy enough, like my second pitch ever.
And so it was it was like a really, really surreal moment to me. And that really kind of kicked me off on this path.
Yeah. OK, so the sting in the tail is that. OK, actually, why don't you just tell your side of it first?
Then I'll apologize.
I feel bad. So far, I don't see what the problem is.
Well, I feel bad because it's like if I add this extra part, it's only going to make it seem worse.
You should. You should add to the end.
But it's funny now. I've told this to you so many times, but like zero hard feelings. I mean, now that I've been on the other side, I totally understand how that stuff happens.
And, you know, it's always regrettable. But it's like it's just where editors are very extremely busy people. So, yeah, no hard feelings.
But anyway, the funny part about that is so I sent that pitch to you. You accepted it. I was like, oh, my God.
And I had such a strong conviction of like, this is what I want to do with my life. This is this is my path. I have just found this.
I'm going to quit my job. And so like a week or two later, I sat down with my boss and I was like, I'm quitting. And my boss was like, oh, really?
And he was a really nice guy. And so he was very friendly about it. And he was sort of casually at the end of that meeting was like, so where are you going next?
And I just looked him dead in the eyes. And I was like, I got a job writing about video games, which was a lie because I did not have a job. But I was also like cognizant of like, I didn't want to admit that I was just abandoning my job to like go chase this whimsy.
But I also wanted to be like, no, I'm going to go make something of myself. Like I want to have my cake and eat it too in that moment without looking like an idiot. So I abandoned my job and then you never emailed me back.
Which is OK because I, you know, around that time, once I sold that first pitch, it's like pitching is like an addiction or it's not an addiction, but it gets it's very addicting. The rush of it and the thrill of like putting together a story idea, packaging it up into a paragraph and sending that to somebody and having them be like, yes, I will pay you money for that is like an incredible high, especially in the beginning where you're like you never even consider that you could get paid to write about video game articles. So, you know, it's not like that was the one pitch I had had very quickly.
I had started to gather kind of a bit of work and I wasn't like reliant on that pitch to make that decision make sense. It was more I was like I had some money in the bank and I was like instead of like taking a vacation and burning all this cash, I was like, I will use that money to fund a runway for myself and I will. I'm very privileged and lucky because I know a lot of writers don't have this type of opportunity available to them but I'm like, I had family, I had people that supported me.
I wasn't going to end up homeless if I ran out of money. At the time, at least, it was quite easy to just get a job in general, sort of in an economic sense. I just wasn't worried about it.
It wasn't like I was abandoning a career or something or a dream job. It was more like I needed to burn the ships because I knew that that would be the thing that would compel me to move forward with just deadly seriousness. So anyway, I don't know if you've ever told me your side of the story.
So if you have a side of it, I'm so interested, even just your perspective.
It's time for the perpetrator's testimony.
I'll decide who's the asshole at the end of the story.
Trust me, it is me. So, you spoiler for the ending of this. But yeah, it's me who's the asshole.
Subconsciously, I'm concerned that I might have invited Steven onto the podcast to apologize to him for this. I'm genuinely interested in your career. I think it's a really good episode.
But this is this is funny to talk about because it is a what happened was I basically okayed to EVE Online pictures at the same time. One was from one was from a freelancer cast who was already on our system. And I was this sounds stupid, too polite to email you back going, okay, I've messed up.
This is a good pitch, but we can't run two features two months in a row. I'll need to circle back to this in a few months. That's what I should have said to you.
But I was too cowardly to send you that email and didn't. And me, I had I didn't know until this podcast that you quit your job because of my job. I mean, holy shit, that's very irresponsible of me in retrospect.
No, no, no, no, it's very irresponsible of me to get one positive email. It wasn't like I signed. There was no signed contract or anything.
Yeah.
Do not you know, you don't you don't have to take on on more guilt than you do here.
It's OK, because I remember, you know, seeing your very quick rise in freelance after that. You were just someone who had a perspective and subject matter that, you know, where you had these these angles, you know, MMOs being that that subject, you know, for most of your pictures. And it was really strong and I very rarely would send an email like that to a to a new freelancer who I'd never spoken to before.
But it was just it was just really good. But yeah, that was the reason I just didn't follow up. And it was it was poor form, because I imagine I made it sound like, well, the next thing is let's get some paperwork sorted and then failed.
And then in parallel to that, you started working with PC Gamer US more and you became more prominent. And I was just I remember just being really like quite awkward in my interactions with you for ages because I felt like I just really failed you. And that's the honest truth of the whole thing, Steven, is I just yeah, I didn't follow up appropriately.
It was a really good pitch. But yeah, I mean, man, that's yeah. And so I think it's good to talk about this stuff on the podcast because we try to be honest and we're trying to be yeah, we try and like own our shortcomings a little bit.
Yeah, you're going to feel so much lighter today as you go through the next chapter of your life.
Yeah. This is sort of like, let's see in the list of bad things I've done, this is somewhere in the middle, I think. So it's, you know, I can I can I can live with myself.
But yeah, that's that is well. But it's good to talk about, because yeah, that is that's one way in which I kind of failed you. But because the awkward thing was, I remember you a few years later saying, because you sent me that email, that motivated me into like, getting into this career.
And I like I could not take pride in like, half assing, like, you know, sort of prompting you into starting a career. It's like, because I did half of my job and not my whole job, you were like, this is my future. And that just that just makes me seem like such a fucking moron, which is like the sort of there's an episode of Mad Men where Roger Sterling is too drunk to remember that he hired Don Draper.
And I feel like that's like, this is my version of that, basically. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's funny, because you like, you know, I understand, I would feel the same if I were in your shoes, too. Totally, because you're right, like you want to endeavor to be better. And when I was an editor, I certainly like, you just drop the ball sometimes.
And it's tough, right? It's also hard to say no to people sometimes. And so I've definitely done similar things.
And I don't feel great about them either. From a freelancing perspective, I think, A, I don't really remember ever having like super negative feelings about it. I'm sure I was like disappointed when because, you know, I even when I was reading through all this or sort of, you know, checking the receipts on it all, I saw the follow up emails.
But I never I don't have like a distinct memory of like being upset that I didn't hear back from you. Probably because I was probably pretty well aware of that being a reality. Like, you can't catch like with with freelancing, especially you just can't count chickens until they hatch.
Right. And I certainly learned that lesson later when just dealing with, you know, a bunch of different editors, like it just becomes it's such a reality of freelancing that this was an act of Canadian niceness in it. Yeah, yeah.
So like, I almost see it as like you were kind of like I see it as an opportunity where it was like, you know, I just I don't know, I still attribute it as like, yeah, it was the thing. Even if you feel, you know, kind of mixed feelings about that, I still attribute it because it was it was it was that email and that rush and that excitement. And like, even if the story didn't pan out and the money didn't arrive in my bank account, that is not what was important.
What was important was having this moment of like validation, even if it like, you know, even if it was just this one email and you feel guilty because you didn't follow through on it. Like that one email and being seen and having like someone say, wow, that's a really good pitch. Like, let's do like, you know, whatever.
Like that gave me so much courage to then keep doing that. And I don't know what would have happened if, if, you know, you had, for example, just never replied to that email.
I think we're letting Sal off the hook here a bit. Let's go back to how disappointed you were. I enjoyed.
Yeah, I might just, I was very sad. I might just pay pal you 360 pounds, Steven, to make myself feel better. There's your commission, eight years late.
Yeah.
Oh, this is great.
Yeah, this is really good. This is good pod content. I think as well, there was last bit of defense to myself when we get Matthew's final verdict on who the asshole is in this story.
I think we know the ending of that one. It's just that like, that was a time where I was doing everything on PC Gamer. I was the reviews editor and the features editor and editing it.
And it was it was just yeah, it was logistically. It was quite it was quite a bit of a headache. No, no excuses.
Matthew, who's the asshole in the story?
That was a little bit. Don't hate the play. I hate the game.
That's what I was going to say, though, right? Like that's the that's one of the issues, I think, with games journalism is that you have these people who are in positions where they are, like, frankly, holding far too many spinning plates than they should be. Yeah.
But because the economics of it are just so tight. And it's only natural that you would then, like, make bad calls because you're so stressed out. You're dealing with so many things.
And I, like, I can be very sympathetic to, like, this position of being like, I have so much else going on and I'm stressed out with it. And I'm also now stressed out about this interaction I have to have with this, you know, like bright eyed bushy tailed freelancer. And I just, I can't bring myself to have that.
So I'm just going to avoid it and hope the problem goes away. And I did not go away. I haunted you for basically the rest of your career.
I love it. That was my vengeance was I was like, fuck this guy. I'm going to.
It was like, fuck this guy. I'm going to get a job at PC Gamer and then just hold it over his head.
That's incredible shit.
Yeah. You might not have noticed, but every single one of our stand up meetings, I was staring.
Yeah, you really play the long game on that one. Very impressive. So I remember you breaking in with the kind of EVE Online stories that most editors weren't equipped to write.
And I was curious if you sussed out that knowing MMOs gave you a bit of an advantage as a writer, because I think sites in the sort of 2010 started to look for freelancers who just had a specific skill set and weren't just generalists, which is a bit of a shift from print to online. I think his online became more beats driven. And certainly on PC Gamer, we became way more beats driven as the years went on.
So do you realize that MMOs was kind of like a, that was like a USP for you as a freelancer?
No, absolutely not. Like, again, that was kind of a hindsight thing. Because getting into it, I was just, I was, I didn't know anything.
I didn't know what I was doing. I was just faking it until I made it. Right.
So it wasn't until I think I was still a freelancer when I started to kind of clue into into it. Because I think part of that was and I hope this doesn't sound like I'm patting myself in the back or whatever. I feel so weird talking about my career sometimes because I never want to come across as like I'm not like deeply appreciative or cognizant of like the the the people who didn't email you back when you pitched them.
Yeah, no, I meant more like the privilege that I had because I like especially in freelancing and some of the people that I have been friends with and stuff like that their situations like it's a really tough job and I was very fortunate to kind of be able to come into it in a way where everything was in my favor both in terms of like I could dedicate it full time like I I'd had that little nest egg saved up where I could treat it like a full-time job which meant I could devote so much more mental and mental energy and time into it early on and that then contributed to a much quicker kind of rise through the ranks than I think a lot of freelancers can experience because they're doing it sort of you know evenings and weekends or like in their spare time and they have all these other you know stressors in their life and so it becomes much harder for them to kind of gain that same traction that I was able to do very very quickly. But yeah at some point I at some point I definitely started to like clue in that like MMOs was like a thing that I I kind of specialized in and other people didn't seem to have those skills yeah and I or like didn't seem to have like the time or the inclination I guess and then specifically with like kind of the the community reporting that I did like that was never intentional like that first EVE Online pitch I sent you was like there was a mafia in EVE Online that was extorting miners for payment money for protection money they had like an extortion racket going around and I pitched doing a ride along with them because from that book I had read you know they talked about like the value of like interviews and stuff like that so I was kind of like oh like how do I pitch something that has more value than just I don't know me like just writing an article you know what I mean um I wasn't wrong that is a killer pitch yeah so I was sort of like okay well these guys are really cool it seems very controversial and also like you're blowing up you know hapless miners.
I have never done anything that I thought was interesting, and then was just very fortunate that that also aligned with, at the time, at least what editors thought was interesting as well. And then at some point, I was kind of like, oh, okay, I should devote more and more of my time to this, because I definitely spent a lot of time as a freelancer pitching everything I could under the sun, and some really embarrassing, bad stuff. There's definitely, I have an inbox full of pitches that they just haunt me to think that I actually sent that stuff to an editor, because it was just so misguided, or just such a bad, obviously bad idea or take.
And so I think when I didn't find as much success with that kind of stuff, but was finding success with EVE Online and MMOs and community stories and stuff like that, I was more like, okay, let's just stick to what works.
Yeah, absolutely. How did that lead to you getting hired at PC Gamer? My memory of it from the inside was, I think Evan was like, this is someone who brings something we don't have to the team.
And that was very much, it really made sense as a kind of piece of the puzzle on the website. But what was it like from your perspective?
Yeah, I think that's pretty accurate. I think for me, my perspective on it was just for whatever reason, PC Gamer just felt like the crew that I like, meshed with. Like obviously I was pitching all sorts of websites and working with a bunch of different editors and stuff like that and building relationships sort of across the media landscape.
But the PC Gamer people just kind of felt like, it sounds like so like sappy to say it, but like they felt like family like early on, like I wanted to be friends with you guys and be closer with you. And so we just had this really great working relationship. I was pitching more stories and those stories were leading to more more work, but then also introducing me to like more of the team.
Because sometimes, you know, someone wouldn't be able to take that story personally, so they would hand it off to a different person or something like that. And so I just slowly started building relationships. I think like the big, the initial sort of kickoff.
So like I pitched that you story to you, and that obviously didn't materialize. I don't think I wrote anything for PC Gamer until later that summer, because that was back in March of that year. And then that summer, Evan had put out a call on Twitter being like, hey, we need freelancers to help cover PAX West.
And I had absolutely no plans to go to PAX West and saw that and responded to it and was like, I'll cover PAX West for you. And again, what was funny about that was I, you know, Evan wanted information about, you know, your portfolio and stuff. And I'd written for a lot of small MMO sites by that point and had like kind of a stable workflow or like a stable amount of work coming in and out.
And so I was like, oh yeah, you know, I kind of specialize in MMOs. And to your point, Evan immediately was like, oh, that's interesting. We need more of that on the team.
And at the same time, he like handed me some PAX assignments was like, can you also take on like this interview assignment unrelated to PAX that was just MMO related because they just needed somebody for it. And so again, I just was sort of like, oh my God, I'm so lucky. But I went to that PAX and that was obviously like a big transforming moment for me because I feel like you haven't really been a journalist until you've done convention coverage.
Maybe that's like a bit gatekeeper. I shouldn't say that. But like to me, at least that was like where I felt like I transformed from being like somebody who just writes words online to having or at least experiencing a situation where you really have to use a bunch of different skills, including like just interacting with people one on one.
And you know what I mean? Like just convention stuff is like a very unique kind of atmosphere to be in. And so yeah, from there, it just really like built and built and built.
And then eventually it's weird. Like I don't want to get like super into the personal part of it, but like it does kind of matter. But I think I become just like a really stable freelancer, PC Gamer.
Like I was just routinely writing for you guys. And at the time I was going through a pretty hard period in my life because I was going through a divorce and was just as you would imagine, in a low place. And I'd been talking to a friend about just, you know, everything.
And I just kind of felt like, you know, freelancing stuff, right? Like it's very, you don't know where your money is coming from. You know, there's these wonderful periods where like Playboy is like, we're paying $300 for a feature and we don't give a shit what that feature is.
Like you can pitch anything and we'll give you money for it. And it was like the land of milk and honey for two months until some accountant at Playboy was like, what is happening here? And like shut the whole thing down.
And then you're like, oh my God, I'm destitute. And so it was just a very tough lifestyle to be leading. And I was struggling a lot with it.
And I really wanted to move up into like a staff position somewhere and was frustrated, increasingly frustrated by what felt like my inability to do so. And so I had been talking with a friend and I was kind of like laying it all out and I was like, I really just want to work at PC Gamer is what I said to him. And my friend was like, why don't you just like call up your bot, like call up Evan, the editor in chief, and just say that.
Like, what do you have to lose by just saying that? And I was like, that's actually kind of good advice, you know? Like there's sort of like a life wisdom there.
And like there's no harm in asking for things that you genuinely want because the worst thing someone might say is no. As long as you, you know, you're not an asshole about how you ask for things, right? Yeah.
And that's what I did. I said, I, you know, I sat down with Evan and I was like, I just laid it out on the line and I was like, you know, it's, it's a really tough time for me right now. And I just, I think I do good work and I think there's something special with this relationship and effectively was like, you know, let's put a ring on it.
And Evan, you know, I'm so grateful to him, but like he just agreed. And at the time there wasn't an open staff position because obviously, you know, working in at a media outlet, like those positions are very like few and far between. And so Evan basically, but we worked up this whole thing where I was still technically a freelancer, but I was given a title and I was brought into the team and I had all of like kind of the cultural benefits of being a writer at PC Gamer, even though they couldn't quite make like the job component of it work.
But they really like put together this amazing package for me. And that was sort of my first, you know, I wasn't technically hired at PC Gamer at that point, but I was in spirit. Right.
Yeah.
Commitment was there, at least editorially. And then, I don't know, several months later, like not all that long after in the grand scheme of things, we did have a position finally open up and I was I was very honored that like it wasn't it didn't really feel like it was even a question of like, you know, putting out a job posting or something like that. It was very much just like, OK, this is like, here we go.
You're like your seat's at the table. And yeah. Yeah.
I'm glad you finally had a good editor experience at PC Gamer. You deserve that.
I almost spat out my tea. Yeah, it was a big relief, right? Because for years I was just like, what am I doing working with these guys?
Sam just really.
I just remember you just contributed so much to the site. I just think that it just became richer as a content mix straight away from having you there. Just because you would just dive into the FF14 community or WoW or all the stuff that just no one else on the team was equipped to write about.
I think we were just slightly ahead of the curve on that because now I think sites are just so driven by that specialty side of things, whether Battle Royale is your thing or Shooters in general. Even just one game, even if you're just the one person who can write about Fortnite, but a bunch of outlets can use you, then that is also still viable. But yeah, yeah.
But also, I just think you were really good at finding the right kinds of stories. So what were some of the more interesting or challenging stories you worked on at PC Gamer, Steven?
Oh, my God. So many, which like that's not to say so many because I'm like, oh, I'm so proud of my body of work. But like the way I kind of look at these stories that I've written over the years, like a lot of them, they're not my story, right?
Like it's different when you write reviews or or like an opinion piece or something like that, because like that's kind of all from you. But so much of the stuff I was working on was like other people's stories that I just happened to find and then have, you know, the opportunity to kind of tell and platform. So when I say like, oh, so many, it's it's it's more because I'm like, how crazy that I got to meet so many interesting people and tell so many amazing stories.
Like it just feels like such a wild privilege to me, to be honest, like it's just it's very surreal. I think the stuff that really like stands for me, especially now kind of being out of the industry and out of it, like stuff I really hold on to is a lot of the human interest stuff. I remember I did an interview with a guy he had posted on Reddit.
It was always crazy sometimes how these, you know, such small things could turn into such an incredible, like deep story. But I remember maybe it was Wes, someone at PC Gamer like messaged me one morning and was like, check out this. You should talk to this guy.
And it was a truck driver, a long haul truck driver who had built like a PC gaming rig in his truck and had just posted it to like the PC gaming subreddit being like, check this out. And so there, you know, there's just kind of a fun novelty there of like, you know, truck driver driving his truck, playing PC games at night.
Tell me he played Truck Simulator.
Of course, of course. Yeah, yeah. The meta layers, the opportunity there was not lost on him.
But so, you know, you just reach out to this stranger. I have no idea who this person is or what. And it turns into this like, at least for me, you know, I don't know if other like our readers found it as enchanting as I did.
But, you know, I get to meet this guy and I, it was one of my favorite interviews I ever got to do too, because I interviewed him while he was working. He was driving the truck. And at the end of the interview, I asked him, like, at the beginning of the interview, I asked him where he was and at the end of the interview, I asked him where he was.
And it was cool that like this distance had been traveled over the length of our chat together. And it was something I like included in the story because I just thought it was such a like, I don't know, just this weird little facet of this thing to bring home that this was his like lived experience where he was just. But the crazy thing to me was that this guy was, his name was also Steven and he was like 22.
Like when you think of truck drivers, right? At least me, I think of like, you know, old man, you know, kind of like curmudgeonly doesn't maybe fit into society super well. Maybe these are like harmful stereotypes that truck drivers would really like hate.
I'm going to get some truck driving hate now from this. But like that's just sort of the stereotype that pops in my head. And instead it was like this young guy who, you know, we got to chatting and we talked about PC gaming and stuff like that.
But really it ended up becoming the story about this person who felt like he didn't fit into society all that well and just found solace being alone on the open road, which is, you know, a very kind of romantic thing in a way, even though the reality of it can also be like very lonely. And we talked about that, too, and isolating. And so like it was just this I think that's one of the stories that I just still like kind of marvel that I like got this opportunity to share with people because it was like, who could have assumed like who could have thought that that would have come out of this, you know, Reddit post of a PC gaming rig?
And those were always my favorite stories where, you know, it was anchored in gaming, but it quickly turned into something else. Because I think that's what makes games so special, right? Like in and of themselves, I think games are incredible.
But the way that they reflect and connect like people and the way that they shape their own stories outside of the game and stuff like that. Like, that's the stuff that I always just found like so profound and like, frankly, like a little bit inspiring. So yeah, stories like that.
And there was just, you know, I was lucky to be able to do that so many times.
I want to actually ask about the EVE stuff, because I've been reading a few of your EVE stories this afternoon. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole.
Sure.
A game I've never played, but what I find fascinating and what I love about the best EVE coverage, which you are 100% part of, is that it's really, really complicated. And the art of like bringing people into it who are outside EVE, I'm kind of interested in that side of it. But I'm also interested in, like, on paper, these are epic stories of like space bureaucracy, where people are like imagining themselves as these like leaders of these like international, these intergalactic federations and things.
But also throughout the pieces, there are constantly, I think, quite wry, you know, amusing references to their like real lives. You know, like on one hand, they're commanding a fleet of ships, you know, like six different ships at the same time. And then they're like, well, it's good because I can also do like my work spreadsheets on another screen.
And you're like, oh, man, it's just it's that kind of collision of the like about as epic as it comes and the truly mundane lives that I think a lot of these people live. Like, just kind of interested in kind of treading that line where I think there is humor in it, but you're not like, like demeaning it or undermining it at the same time. And how you kind of judge where to kind of place those those stories, I guess.
Yeah, I think that was just really born out of this, like, genuine fascinate. Like, that's just a fascinating thing that some dude is like, you know, his coworker looks over and sees that he's like working on spreadsheets and is just like, oh, yeah, that's, you know, Doug, whatever. You know, mundane Doug doing his thing.
And what they don't realize is like that dude goes home and leads an empire of 30,000 players into battle. And like the most, you know, or goes home and hatches the most dastardly schemes, like just truly like, you know, skullduggery at its finest. But then is like the most placid, you know, kindly man in the real world.
And so it was like this duality of like egos that could exist with people. Where and even line was like the only game that like I think has really or MMOs specifically, that's like really achieved that almost like by design.
Right.
As you play that game and you play it sort of you have to take it sort of seriously. Like you have to, you know, be playing that game. It's just like this natural byproduct of like people forming this who they are in the game and who they are in the world in the real world.
And because the game really kind of celebrated conflict and betrayal and like all of these things that weren't aren't exactly celebrated in the real world, at least, you know, not in a in a positive light or by positive groups of people. Like the gap between that, I always found fascinating. So to me, it was like, yeah, I was always trying, you know, to be careful.
I never wanted to stray into like, you know, look at this basement dwelling nerd. Because I just that kind of punching down never interest me. And I think even I don't know, I always tried to see what made people special.
Because like, this sounds like so weirdly, like, I don't know, like a bit like fluffy or whatever. But I'm like, I genuinely with these stories was like, I just think people are fascinating. And I don't want to cast judgment on them as I have to.
Or there's like a really strong, compelling reason to because people are just really complicated. And I just so I just loved kind of representing people. And with Eve, I just always found it kind of fun to establish this persona that they had.
And then if I could give people a window into how that persona different in the real world.
Did you ever get annoyed that you were covering these amazing epic happenings, but all the character names were just so inherently dumb because they were gaming avatars? Because you're writing this story about like, you know, betrayals, which are kind of as good as like the Red Wedding in Game of Thrones. The main protagonist is called Boneless Steve.
And you're like, damn it.
Boneless Steve. No, I actually always loved that, to be honest, because I thought there was nothing funnier than something that sounds so deadly serious. And then you're right.
Like it's perpetrated by like Boner Guy. Like it just totally. And there was, I wish I could think of specific examples here.
But like there was definitely times where I was like, that username needs to go in the headline if it's absurd enough, because it just is so like funny. And so I always just, yeah, I never resented it. I always saw it as like a really good opportunity for like a bit of comedic relief and an absurdity.
And I think the absurdity is what adds to the charm of that type of a story, because it's just such an absurd story to begin with that, you know, adults are dedicating. Not that adults shouldn't be playing games. That's not what I mean.
But like, you know, people really like their entire lives are wrapped up in this fictional space war. And yeah, you know, you know him as Doug, the IT guy. And then in real life or on EVE Online, he's Boneless Steve, the captain king of the LOSEC or whatever.
So I'm curious, Steven, if you see being a reporter as something of a badge of honor in games media. I do think it's a more elevated skill set or at least a more traditionally journalistic one than just writing about games personally, which is why I kind of envied people who do it. Do you think that's true?
And what do you think the downsides are of reporting?
Yeah, I, I definitely think like it's it's a very unique skill set. And so it kind of stands apart from a lot of other things. And by virtue of like just feeling very distinct, like, of course, you know, there's a part of me that I was kind of took pride in that because it felt like even just in the sort of games journalism sphere of all these people that we kind of knew and peers and stuff like that, it felt like the reporting crew were just kind of a little bit of like a different breed.
I never really felt like it was like a badge of honor or anything like that, because I think even though it's like a different skill set and it can be very unique, I'm not sure if it's any more intensive or demands anything more than some of the other skill sets. Like, you know, I was always very envious of people that could write incredible reviews. And I think there's a really profound skill set there that maybe just doesn't feel as apparent, especially like either to the reader or even to people that are in games, because maybe they're just it's more normalized if you're kind of someone that writes personal essays or, you know, opinion pieces or reviews, critiques, that kind of stuff.
And I think also just that type of skill set, like writing those types of stories, doesn't benefit much from the way that sort of the Internet has shaken out and how that is also like the most accessible type of writing. So I think it kind of blurs the line between like the truly like the actual like art of it and people who are just like, you know, vomiting words into a blog online. You know what I mean?
Does that make sense?
Yeah, it's sort of like it's not like those stories are the stories necessarily driving the industry. Then again, I guess like some reporting like Jason Schreier or whatever does. But that's like a different kind of reporting, isn't it?
So, yeah, yeah, that was always envious of that reporting, right? Like I even almost had an imposter syndrome a little bit. And I certainly tried over my career to branch into that more like business reporting.
But never, to be honest, never really successfully managed to do it. I think in part, like, you know, you kind of have to be like boots on the ground and building those relationships personally in order to kind of get that level of access that people like, you know, Schreier was getting, is getting. And so I was always very envious of that kind of reporting because I felt like, you know, what I was doing maybe was philosophically similar in process and approach, but very different topics.
Yeah.
And I think that kind of reporting, honestly, I do think is like very special. And it's a very like the fact that, you know, there's only a few people in the industry that you can kind of count who do that kind of, you know, major expose or they get the level of access. They have the the Rolodex of people willing to talk off the record to get these types of stories published.
Like those people are very few and far between. And I think that speaks to an incredible level of skill that is not common. I don't ever I never really necessarily felt like I had that.
Maybe I had, you know, the potential or something like that, but I never got to that level. Right. But yeah, I think like, I don't know.
The other thing I'm always like cognizant of is like, you know, I always felt very privileged at PC Gamer because I was put in this position where I really like you kind of you touched on earlier. Like I got to kind of chase my my whims because I had, for whatever reason, you know, been given the trust and had proved that I could be capable of it. But that also didn't mean that I didn't like, you know, turn in some clunkers or stories that just for whatever reason did, you know, zero numbers.
And I was always very cognizant of the fact that I felt like my ability to do that was bankrolled by other writers on the team who were like in the mines doing SEO work or, you know what I mean? Like the less, maybe the less glamorous or like the less, you know, kind of I had the privilege of being able to publish a story and it was sort of like the ooh, ah, like, you know, it trends on Reddit or something like that. But there were people that were doing incredible work and doing it with like a devotion and persistence that I found really like amazing, you know, writing guides and things like that.
And those people are the ones that are keeping the lights on at editorial publications, right? And so I always was like, you know, sure, it's nice that I get to, like, get the upvotes or whatever. But at the same time, like I, I tried to always be very aware of the fact that, like, I was only able to do this because somebody else was doing work that was actually more valuable when it came to dollars, you know?
Yeah, I didn't mind updating those anthem guides, Steven. That's OK. Like, as long as you're having a good time.
That's your penance for your initial snafu.
And I mean, the nice thing at PC Gamer, everybody, it wasn't like there was just one guy that, you know, had to, like, bear the brunt of all of our sins.
Oh, yeah, it was spread around.
We all kind of pitched in and everything like that. Yeah, exactly. But it was always kind of like we had to do.
There was work that you had to do to keep the lights on in order to fund the stuff. And I was always in a position where I felt like I got to do more of that reporting and stuff like that and kind of chasing these stories where it could take me weeks. And then I might publish that story and it might do like zero, like just nobody read it for whatever reason.
And that's just, yeah. In terms of downsides, like the second part of your question downsides to reporting. Yeah, like there's a lot like that's a very intensive job.
I think for me, one of the big ones was like it was very emotionally draining. I think, you know, I like I said, like I really kind of when I would interview people and be telling their stories, especially when it became like a very personal story. And sometimes I got to tell these stories that were like very deeply personal.
And it was always a bit nerve wracking because you're like, I want you to tell me this thing. I'm scared to ask about it because I don't want to be prying into your life like everybody deserves privacy. But I also have to chase my nose and think that there's a story here.
But I and I also know that you're trusting me with that story and I cannot fail that. And that was like a really heavy emotional burden that could, you know, really scale up quite significantly. Like, there was one feature I wrote about a group of women in Final Fantasy 14 who were accusing sort of like a well-known community icon.
It was basically like Final Fantasy 14's like Me Too movement in their community where this person had been very abusive and gross to a number of women. And they finally kind of had the courage to step up and come forward. And they're telling me the story, their personal experiences.
And it's a really tough line to walk when you're a journalist or a reporter and you have to be like vetting the facts that they tell you, which naturally makes you come across as like skeptical. Because you have to be. But at the same time, like wanting them to also know that like they can trust and feel supported by me.
And then to then take that, like they tell you all this information and you have to take all that information and condense it into an article that essentially like summarizes that information. But in the process of doing that, like there is so much room for error in how you summarize those experiences that people have. And if you do it wrong and you kind of, you know, I don't know, like worst case scenario, like re victimize somebody or even just do it in a way that is not authentic to what they wanted or told you or felt like that's to me always felt like a really big crime.
And so that responsibility was very heavy. Like, I feel like there were stories I wrote where I just like was losing hair. Like all my hair thinning, I feel like I attribute to my moments at PC Gamer where things were just really tough and I felt kind of crushed by this responsibility.
Yeah.
Yeah. Oh yeah. Super, super challenging, interesting line of work.
But yeah, I could see why, why it would have that effect on you. But what made you want to move away from Gamespeedier ultimately?
Yeah, I think it was I even today am very like conflicted about it. And Sam, I'd honestly be interested to hear your take on it too and how you feel about it. But like for me, I just was dealing with a growing discontent that kind of over the course of a year before I kind of left was just growing.
Like and I just felt like I wasn't as excited or motivated as I had been. And I wasn't sure why. And even to today, I still struggle to like fully understand it.
But I think part of it was like as challenging as freelancing was, it wasn't like finally getting a job like a stable job was any better in certain respects. Like it's just also a grueling line of work to be in, whether that's, you know, dealing with kind of the online hostility that can really run rampant through online communities quite frequently. Even though like, you know, I was very lucky to be like a white, you know, heterosexual guy.
So I'm like, you know, the least desirable target for people. But even just seeing friends and stuff like that have to experience the brunt of that stuff really takes its toll on you. Down to just like the churn of it, right?
Like it's a grind in a way where it just kind of has to be, you know, like I would spend all this time, like a month or whatever, weeks, putting together this incredibly emotionally draining feature and, you know, publish it. And then the next question, even though, and this wasn't, I'm not saying anything bad about like the editorial teams that I worked with because they were always like, everybody was always super great and understanding. But it was, there was just kind of this question of like, okay, what's next?
And you're like, what's next? Like, I just look at what I just put out there, like, give me a break, man. But it was, you know, maybe that was partly me.
Like, I just didn't pace myself well or something. But like, eventually that churn of like, you got to just always be writing and publishing something. And that led to this feeling of like, with EVE Online specifically, I reached this point where I felt like I just told the stories I wanted to tell.
And I started to feel like I was having deja vu sometimes where I was writing stories and I was like, man, I've written this line before. And that was kind of demotivating for me as a writer, because fundamentally, like I was pursuing it because I found it creatively rewarding. And I was just lucky that it turned into a profitable career.
Yeah, I felt like I was just repeating myself over and over again. I just it felt like I kind of said what I wanted to say. And I didn't want to be I think one of the this is like my hot take for gaming journalism.
But like, one of the things that always really irks me is that it's such a small industry that it's so competitive. And so I get always like, especially kind of grumpy about people who I think just sit in a spot of privilege or power and then are just aggressively mediocre.
You're talking to two of them.
No, that's not what I meant at all. Well, that's why Sam left, right? But so in having that sort of outward opinion, when I saw that happening almost to myself, I'm sure that's not the case necessarily.
I'm being probably a little bit too too uncharitable to myself. But I felt like that's what was happening where I was like, I'm losing the thrill and the motivation and the drive. And I don't want to just be that person who like hogs an opportunity and does like a really just like bleh job at it because I don't care anymore.
When someone else could come in and do that better, which like it wasn't as altruistic as that. There was a lot of factors, but that was one of them. And so I've gotten into game development and stuff, too.
And so I felt more of a calling towards the other side. I had tried applying to like other games media jobs and didn't get them. And that was also really kind of dispiriting because it felt like the industry was just so competitive.
And I kind of was like, my God, like, you know, if I wanted to be a Jason Schreier, what would that take? What would that require? What would the sacrifice be?
And to be honest, I just looked at it and I was like, I don't know if I have it in me anymore to achieve that, especially, you know, as I got married. And we were talking about having families like my priorities were just all shifting. And so I just my heart wasn't in it in the same way anymore.
And it wasn't where my like my aspirations were. And so eventually it became this thing of like, OK, well, what could I do instead? And the idea of like sort of jumping sides and being closer to game development would be creatively rewarding, but also just a different skill set and a different kind of context.
And yeah, all of that just seemed really appealing to me. And so eventually that's kind of what led me to, I think, applying more towards marketing and other other jobs on the other side of the fence, so to speak.
Yeah, I totally get you. I think for me, I was I had like there was the end of 2018, early 2019. It was just a really exhausting time on the UK side because we for a long time had a really small UK web team compared to the US.
And then just as I left, they hired all the people they needed to make that more manageable, which is unfortunate. But it's truthfully, though, looking back, I think I maybe I was maybe in a similar position to you where perhaps I didn't have much more to offer. And I was I risk being one of those mediocre people sat in one of those those seats.
And, you know, I definitely always did a good job. But now that I'm in PR, I'm stimulated by the idea of doing new and different things. And I didn't realize how much I needed that until I got out of media, you know.
And, yeah, it's like it's nice to wake up and do something a little bit something you've never done before. And, yeah, I just forgot what that was like in the early days of working in games media, where it was like the first time I'd write a feature or go on a trip for, you know, like a cover of a magazine or something. And PR has loads of that.
So, yeah, yeah, I think I kind of see you kind of did you reach the same point I did, but you did a lot quicker, which I think is I think is healthy. And working online, working online as well, I think people who just are able to do it for years and years to have a stamina that I don't, I think. And so, yeah, I admire the PCG guys who are still there.
I work with they're all incredibly talented and I really respect the fact they are. They can still do it. And yeah, yeah, it's sort of like I think they just built differently to me, you know.
So, yeah, yeah, 100 percent.
I feel like the reason why I was saying like I still kind of feel so conflicted about is because there's just this element that I haven't been able to shake of feeling like I gave up or like, you know what I mean, like I failed because I didn't stick it out longer. And I know that's not true. Like the logical part of my brain is like, that's not the case.
Like, it's totally fine to change what you want to do in your life or, you know, to your for your dreams to change or to have different priorities or whatever. But there's still just this element of feeling like what did what did the people have that are continuing to be so successful in this and to put out killer stuff that I just lacked. You know, it's I sometimes struggle with not to this podcast is going to end on like a really somber.
But you know that it was just a very kind of a real thing that I still kind of I think I'm trying to work through in my brain where it feels like there's just days I think where I wake up and I feel like I had to throw in the towel versus like, you know, a more like dignified like, no, I'm retiring and moving on. You know what I mean?
Yeah, absolutely. And you know, you are working on some cool stuff now. So why don't you tell us a bit about about that and how's Homeworld 3 coming along?
Because that's a Blackbird Interactive game. And obviously, you know, I'm a big RTS guy going back years and just always like seeing that genre thrive. I've seen how many wish lists it's got on Steam.
But you work on a whole bunch of different stuff. So why don't you tell us a bit about what you're working on now?
Yeah, so I do PR and communications at BBI, Blackbird Interactive and Blackbird Interactive is an independent Vancouver studio. If you don't recognize the name, you might recognize, yeah, like Homeworld 3 or Hardspace Shipbreaker was another game we did, Minecraft Legends last year. So kind of like a lot of strategy sim, very like PC Heartland stuff, I would say.
And it's fantastic, like what you were saying about, you know, being in PR and the different ways it stimulates you, like that's what I love about it is, especially, you know, being in a mandate where I kind of do communications. That means, you know, I'm doing more kind of like editorial stuff sometimes, like a newsletter or something like that, that kind of feels more in line with what I did at PC Gamer. But then it's also like managing our social media, also doing the PR stuff.
So it's like getting to have, you know, all my fingers and all these different pies is great. And it's a really fun job and it's a really exciting company to be a part of. And yeah, with Homeworld 3, it's wild, to be honest, just because, you know, that is a game that is 20 years old, Homeworld 2.
And so that's a long, long time, and it feels like an enormous privilege to be making a game where an audience is like that invested in it to this day after so long. And yeah, it's going along great. The game was delayed back in February to May, and it's been really encouraging seeing the team like rally and with that extra time, what they've been able to accomplish.
And I think we're all really excited about it and excited to also finally get it into players hands.
So that's awesome, man. I'm so happy for you that because we kind of moved into marketing, there's marketing side at the same time. I kind of see your career in parallel to mine and sort of cheer you on.
And I know you cheer me on. And it's cool, man. It's nice to see you out there thriving, you know.
So, yeah.
Yeah, likewise.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for coming on, Steven.
It's been really great to talk about your career. You've been really generous with the, you know, with the stories you've told. And obviously, highlighting my shortcomings as well.
That's just great stuff. But no, it's been an absolute pleasure.
It was worth it just for that. No, I really appreciate you guys having me on. And, you know, it's fun to reminisce.
And yeah, it just it means a lot. So thank you so much for having me.
Yeah, absolutely, man. So where can people get you on social media?
Oh, man, I was not prepared for that question. I'm not on social media much these days. But you can find me on Twitter still at Steven J.
Messner. Or I think Blue Sky is the same one. And those are like maybe the only two places that I visit.
You can also send me an email at StevenJMessner at gmail.com. That feels insane in 2020. Your point of contact being a personal Gmail address.
But I'm like, genuinely, if you wanted to actually reach me or say something to me, that's actually where I would reply. Because these days Twitter is just such a hellscape. So I don't spend a whole lot of time on social media unless it's for work.
So, yeah, I would say listeners do not send Steven anything weird over email because it makes us look bad. And I've got a few listeners in mind. Just don't do it.
Discord users, don't do it. I know that you're tempted to. Don't.
I will tattle to Matthew if anyone sends me anything.
Don't be weird.
Don't be weird.
So you can reach Steven.
You can be a little weird. I appreciate a thin veneer of weirdness is OK.
That's good. Do you have a fax number, Steven, as well? Is there any other unconventional ways to contact you?
Well, if you guys have homing pigeons, that's probably the easiest. I'll just give them my personal phone number. What could happen?
What could go wrong?
Yeah. You find Steven on a legacy City of Heroes server.
You can find me on the Matrix Online emulated server, continually being turned into a puddle of imploding goo.
Amazing. Well, thank you so much, Steven. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
MrBazzill UnderscorePesto on Twitter and MrBazzillPestoNo Underscore on BlizzGuy.
Excellent. I'm Samuel W. Roberts and the podcast is Back Page Pod.
Thank you so much for listening. I'll be back next week.
