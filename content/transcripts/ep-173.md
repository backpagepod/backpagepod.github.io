Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Whoa, this is high energy. You've been doing different intros recently.
Yeah, I just wanted to break the monotony for listeners, so they don't just sort of tune out straight away, and they're just locked in. They're like, wow, it's like I'm watching Channel 4, you know, that sort of thing.
If anything would keep me subscribed to Patreon, it's that lively bellowing of my own name.
patreon.com/backpagepod, but no time for preamble. Matthew, we've got 27 Games Court entries this week. So we should fire through them, I think, and focus on that because that's going to take up so much time, so much fucking time.
That is a lot of entries and I am beginning to curse past Matthew for not letting Games Court happen sooner.
Yeah, this is the longest time we've ever gone without a Games Court since its creation in 2021. It has been seven months, which is a long time. We've only done three in the last calendar year.
So I suppose I'll start with that, Matthew. How do you feel about returning to Games Court as a format for the first time in all that time? Do you regret putting it off?
Do you think that you're kind of hyped up for it? Have you built up enough Matthew Castle Island lore to really make this thing tick along?
Well, we'll soon find out. Yeah, it'll be okay. As always, I like to stay upfront.
This is not a serious endeavor. If you're looking for deep analysis of the trade in market and the true worth of classic games, that information is not known to me. So this court operates on vibes only.
If you are someone who is reading a future narrative designer application and you've gone back and listened to this, it's not a true reflection of our values or skill or talent. So just good to keep that in mind, I think.
Yeah, I got a bit of a cold on the go, so, you know, add that into it as well. No, it'll be fine. It's funny you said seven months.
What popped into my head was, you know how there's like 21 days later?
Is that the film? 28 days later.
Oh, 28 days later and then 28-
Does it still work as an analogy?
And then 28 weeks later.
Right.
And the idea that if you leave something long enough, when will the zombies die? That's the point I was getting to. There's this concept in zombie fiction of like, how long before the zombies starve to death?
I'm a little bit like that with Games Court. I thought if we push it far enough and not doing one, will the concept just like shrivel up and be forgotten?
Yeah.
Seven months, clearly not enough to kill it. I will write that down in the book.
I think people like this because it is our most unhinged kind of magazine style bullshit. Games Court is like a one-off magazine feature that we've stretched into a kind of ongoing series.
Yes.
And people have made the point that this is the most original thing we've come up with. We haven't just lifted this from other podcasts.
Yeah, like everything else.
Exactly. This is something we actually created. So I do see that point.
And I do want to do slightly more Games Courts this year. Probably like, let's not go too crazy. Four, like four Games Courts, I think.
One will be just mine. I think the next one will reverse roles again. So I'll be the judge.
That'd be good, I think, to do that again. And I don't know what the last one will be. We'll just see how it goes, I guess.
Maybe it'll just be three, but yes. So yeah, I mean, obviously, you're talking about the 28 Days Later series there, Matthew, but those movies are just known as brackets untitled on Matthew Castle Island, of course.
It's 28. It's really confusing. Exactly, yeah.
Because people are like, is this 28 or is it 28? And you're like, don't worry, it's 28.
Yep, so a recap of what Games Court is if you're new to the podcast, because that does happen. People just listen to an episode. And someone did say to me that the hour and 20 minutes we spent in the best games of 2003 talking about ourselves and our lives, if you're a new podcast listener and you think you're just tuning into a list of games, what must you think of that?
It's like become, I do worry, it's like reversing down this whole of being so cultish, it's basically impenetrable. So I thought I'd just explain what Games Court is, Matthew. Basically, a few years ago, during the pandemic, I went through a major buying spree of secondhand games.
This is just as that retro market boom was happening and everything was becoming too overpriced. So I kind of felt like it was a race against time in some ways to buy like bleach on DS or whatever. So that was part of what I was doing.
Everyone was just trying to get bleach to cure their COVID and you were trying to get it on DS.
Yeah, exactly, very good. So I was sort of doing some major DS and 3DS collecting. And you know what?
I'm pretty happy with my collection at this point. It's got some absolute bangers in there. I drew the line at Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor, which is something like 200 quid on DS.
I'm not going to be paying that. That's ridiculous. So I've got some boundaries on this.
But basically what I did was read them all out and Matthew decided whether they were good or bad purchases. And as it's gone along, we've let listeners sending their own entries to be put in front of Games Court and judge Matthew Castle. And Matthew decides whether they're guilty or innocent.
And then dishes out some kind of punishment, some kind of comedic tinged punishment if they are put to death. So is that basically what Games Court is, Matthew? Anything to add to that?
Yeah, that's basically it. It's just a bit of fun. And again, I reiterate, don't get cross if I don't understand the true value of a game.
It's just a bit of fun. And I do no research. I go in completely blind to this.
Yeah, that's good to know. I try and talk around it, try and offer some insight as somebody who pays a bit more attention to secondhand games, prices than Matthew does. But even then it's a bit of a wild west out there.
And sometimes you just get some awful bullshit. And so, you know, obviously we have to sort of come down hard. So that's tricky.
Okay, so, I mean, like, to kick us off then, Matthew, what's new on Matthew Castle Island? Again, for maybe new listeners, this is a fictional location where the trial takes place. There's a kind of a courtroom there, filled with all kinds of colorful characters.
But the island itself has got its own storied and rich history. At this point, if it was like a fandom wikia of Matthew Castle Island, I think they'd have about 80 different pages. Most of them would be stubs, but there would still be plenty of pages in there.
So Matthew, what is new on Matthew Castle Island?
The dictatorship continues, of course. People often wonder what the values of this dictatorship are. Two key things you have to remember is that we don't have the Internet.
In fact, the concept of the Internet is unknown to the people of the island. And similarly, time doesn't exist on the island, or rather, the concept of time is denied to the people of the island. You just have to remember these two things.
Yeah, so in some ways it hasn't been seven months since the last Games Court, because no time has passed at all on Matthew Castle Island, because there is no time.
That's right.
So that's good. So what's been going down?
Yeah, so, you know, with things heating up on the global stage, to say the least, I've decided that it's time to... Oh, sorry. I've decided we're ready to open our ports and take part in some cultural outreach.
Inspired by the success of National Theatre Live, which is where you go and watch national theatre productions in the cinema, we are now broadcasting Games Court Live to cinemas across the world. So a big hello to everyone at the Odeon in Basingstoke.
It's funny because you pour so many times during that joke. I was waiting to know which one was the punchline and I thought, do I laugh now? Or do I wait another 30 seconds?
No, I had a cough. Let's make these other ones quicker. You will know when you can laugh.
Thanks. I appreciate that.
I've also convinced the good people at Orson Games Done Quick to launch a new event, hereby known as Orson Games Done. I personally can't wait to see someone do all those games.
Very good. Very good. I like that.
I've decided to rebrand my dictatorship as an island wide series of Taskmaster. People suffering at the whims of a giant man. It's not a huge leap.
Very good. Sorry, was that a too cold a response? I don't know.
This is about what I was expecting as I wrote these at lunchtime, sniffing into a hanky. We also hosted our inaugural video game awards, the MAFTAs. Game of the Year is of course Hotel Dusk.
Well done to them. Best online game was accidentally mentioned on stage. So let's just say that those two announcers have been re-educated into two bottles of wine.
Best game that accurately reflects the mood of the oppressed people of Castle Island, Tears of the Kingdom.
Amazing.
I'm not really sure why we have that award. Lifetime Achievement Award of course went to PS1 Hagrid. That's it.
I always like it when you go, the jokes are over, please leave at the end. That's good. And then Matthew coughs and splutters off into the background, summing up the overall mood of the Games Court energy, so that's all good.
Okay Matthew, I appreciate that. That's a good effort. I think that's like a solid workings for a lunchtime, that's not bad at all.
Yeah, I think I'd describe this as six out of ten observations.
Yeah, it's sort of like one of those six out of tens, very much so.
I liked the idea of saying hello to the people at the Odeon in Basinstoke. That's funny to me.
But there we go. That was funny. I just, again, that was the one where you took many pauses during the actual telling of the joke and I didn't know when the joke was.
Well, I got nervous halfway through it. People didn't know what National Theatre Live was.
It's a very bougie reference, I would say. It's sort of like, you know, the man on the street sort of like buying his chicken nuggets from Iceland. He's got no idea, you know.
Now that people have heard of it, I'm just going to read that one again. This is how it should have been said. Inspired by the success of National Theatre Live, we are now broadcasting Games Court Live to cinemas across the world.
So a big hello to everyone at the Odeon in Basingstoke.
That's very good. I mean, you know, like Jerry Seinfeld doesn't get it right first time, you know what I'm saying? And you are the same as him.
So that's good. All right, Matthew. Very good.
So that's a big chunk of the work done there for you. So who's in the courtroom today? We always have a variety of colourful characters joining us to sort of liven up the mood.
It's basically like Harvey Birdman sort of situation really.
Yeah, we got some good jurors. I am now thinking about the thing you said about people coming to this podcast for the first time and being confused. But anyway, let's push on.
So the jurors, we've got that weird heart from Dishonored that reveals the secrets of people's souls. Big hello to the weird heart. We've got Sticks the Goblin, but specifically the one from the film Elle.
Okay, that's the best joke so far.
We've got Asterion from Borders Gate 3, but I've picked so many bleak dialogue options that he's now not horny at all.
No, so you chased Asterion.
Yeah, chased Asterion.
Chased Asterion.
We've got Commodore Matthew Perry from Rise of the Ronin. We've got Sean Connery from From Russia with Love, but he only says bilateral.
Oh, nice. Is it the PS2 From Russia with Love game? Oh, excellent.
Even better.
It's a PS2 60s-era Sean Connery, but he only says bilateral.
Bolartral. Have you played Bolartral yet?
I haven't, no.
It's pretty good. Anyway, carry on.
And finally, oh, this is where you can tell the lunchtime blues really kicked in. A digger from Construction Simulator.
Okay, very good. I like that. I appreciate that.
I was sort of vaguely considering pitching that I bring in some sort of, I guess, like surprise witnesses. And I was going to do, like, the only one I came up with, it's just like an empty word document that just says, Eric Banner from The Hulk on PS2. That's all I had.
And I just thought, you know what, I need more time to put into this. So yes. Okay.
Key thing there, Matthew, how will defendants be punished if found guilty?
So obviously, another piece of news from Castle Island is that we have been inflicted with the Dragon's Plague from Dragon's Dogma 2. It's spreading amongst the people. It's very, very hard to tell if people have it.
If they do have it, you should probably drown them to cure them. I say cure them, you know, to end them and end that example, that instance of the plague. And so, yeah, inspired by that, I'm going to be chucking the guilty, who I find guilty, into bodies of water, ala Dragon Stogma 2, because the water around Castle Island is like that water, you die if you go in it.
Excellent. That is very good. I appreciate the work that's gone into that, so excellent.
Okay, so last up then for a bit of like, you know, world building, I'm sort of like the, I guess, Jimmy McGill style, sort of like shady law figure. I'm brought in to defend the people who are on trial. So I've got a little speech that I give, do lawyers give a speech at the start of the thing?
They don't really do they?
They do in every single drama. They definitely did in, they did, I was about to say, in a recent finale that I don't want to spoil for you. Yes.
Is it Ripley? Huh? Is it Ripley?
No, it isn't actually. No, no. Yes.
This is a commonly understood thing, the lawyer that gives the opening speech, the opening argument.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. So, you know, basically all on anatomy of a four-wheel as well. That's kind of like what my sort of legal training mostly comprises, just watching that three times.
Oh, that's what I should have done. I should have done a big anatomy of a four-bit.
Oh, that's it. Yeah, you'll get pushed out of a window while 50 cents playing. That would have been really good actually.
Is it too late to do that? I don't know.
Maybe you get pushed out of a window into a body of water.
Do-do-do. And then you see a splash in the background. That'd be good.
Okay. So, ladies and gentlemen, after seven months away from the courtroom, apologies, I forget months are a concept you have little familiarity with here. Judge Castle has emerged from his bath of Rio to grant justice to the festering boys and occasional girls who buy rancid bullshit on eBay or similar services.
And even if the global political environment has really become too heated to make cheeky gags about North Korea, Judge Matthew Castle still remains number one on Interpol's most wanted list. No, not the band. Justice is a dish served cold or hot or whatever condition it is whenever Judge Castle reaches for it from the fridge at 2am.
But I ask you, how can we trust a man whose avarice got the free samples at Eat A Pitter in Bath taken away? How can we trust a man who once pitched the Xbox on channel should be renamed Xbox Off in honour of his attempts at creatively sabotaging it? And how can we trust a man whose insufferable Dragon's Dogma 2 porn is still giving people the game's equivalent of an STD, even after Randy Newman's dozens of ceremonial drownings?
Does he think we were born yesterday? Again, I know that's not a concept you're familiar with here. This is a man who's just one big cheeseburger away from having Reddy injected directly into his bloodstream.
This man thinks Baron Harkonnen was the hero of the Dune movies. This man thought Kiddas of the Flower Moon was a documentary about his own attempts to steal Matthew Castle Island from its indigenous people. I hear he's banned the upcoming remaster of Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door to upset its political rivals.
Even denying their pitch to rename it Paper Mario the Door to appease Matthew Castle Island's notoriously straight ratings board. All I can say is this. The only people that have more contempt for the judge are the people on trial who have hired me for eight Matthew Castle dollary dos an hour.
Thank you, Your Honour. Did you enjoy that, Matthew?
I enjoyed that. I particularly loved your own laughter at it. That's what I like to hear from an opening bit.
No, it's because I could hear you laughing in the background and it was making me laugh. So yeah.
Yeah, see, I didn't experience a lot of that.
Yeah, see, I heard you. Yeah, I spared you that. I was just, you know, laughing at my breath.
Thank you for sparing me your laughter.
Yeah, I could hear like a combination of laughter and spluttering and it just cracked me up, I've got to say. So I did apologize for laughing at my own jokes there. And The Killers of the Flower Moon was the one where I thought, is that okay?
And I thought, you know what, yeah, it's fine.
I don't think anyone important is listening to this.
Definitely not. So yes, by definition, they are not. So let's take a quick break, Matthew.
We'll play the music that Adam Saucier, the listener, composed for our last Games Court episode. You've probably forgotten this is a thing, but it's a very nice little ditty that's a bit Phoenix Wright-esque. So we'll play that and then come back with the exhibits.
Thanks watching!
I was quite happy with that speech, actually.
That was good. I wish I had some better castle island lore.
I thought, but I didn't want to make too many food jokes about you, because I don't think of you in that way. It's just what came to mind, I do apologize. Maybe it's because I was hungry.
Okay, I'll jump back in. Welcome back to the podcast. So, we have 27 exhibits here.
It's going to take fucking ages. Matthew's still got to have dinner, so let's get on with it. Exhibit A, Big Chief Zangief.
A few years ago, I bought Paper Mario Color Splash directly from Nintendo. It didn't arrive on time, so I emailed Nintendo to let them know. They replied with the download code for the game by way of an apology.
When the game arrived in the poster the next day, I traded it in for a GameCube. My first buy from eBay was an absolute belter. 20 pounds of free postage, I got this bundle.
Metro Prime, Burnout, Resident Evil Remake, Eternal Darkness, Super Monkey Ball and a few other eBay highlights were Resident Evil 2, 18 pounds, Resident Evil 3, 19 pounds, Code Veronica, 18 pounds, Tales of Symphonia, 22 pounds, Beyond Good and Evil, 15 pounds. I wanted all the Resi games for the GameCube. Once I had a full set, I sold everything to an independent shop for money to pay off my credit card and about 100 pounds of Switch eShop credit.
When I had my GameCube, I really wanted Skies of Arcadia, but wouldn't shut out for it. I did find a strategy guide for the game in a charity shop for one pound and sold it for 30 pounds on eBay. Bloody hell.
So there you go, Matthew, a bunch of pretty great GameCube stuff there.
There was a lot of buying and selling and numbers. It felt like a fucking monologue from Casino.
Yeah, or whatever that Ben Affleck version of... Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
I didn't come to Games Court to watch Boiler Room or listen to Boiler Room be reenacted, except it's about CEX. I'm never into the whole, I managed to bring this together so I could sell it.
Yeah.
Like, that isn't the spirit of the thing, is it? Like, I can't really keep track of what he fundamentally ends up with.
Yeah, I've never really bought things to sell them. I did it, like, one time I sold something of that nature was when they had to reprint a Batman comic where he showed his willy and Fox News properly and all those kind of like right-wing opportunists just completely like shat their pants about it, as you might expect. So they had to reprint it and I sold the willy version of Batman Damned Issue 1 for something like 40 quid on eBay.
So, yeah, did that. And then I later bought the hardcover collection of that same book for like 10 pounds. So it's like, well, that's fine.
I think that's okay.
Did you at least take some pictures of the willy page before you sent it?
I did like peruse the willy page. Yeah, certainly. But by then there were many scans of it on the internet.
I don't know if I'd want to see that.
What, the picture of Bruce Wayne's willy?
No, I don't want to think of Batman in that way.
Yeah, I think that was kind of like where the tension came from. But at the time it was meant to launch like a new adult line of DC books. They were meant to be quite, you know, sort of mature.
They were aimed at like an older audience, so aimed to be sold in bookstores. Like I think it was actually quite a nice initiative and Batman was like the right kind of character for it. But yeah, people are just so mature about this stuff, aren't they?
And so, yeah, it is what it is. So going back to the games that we've seen so far. I think like the actual, the thing that sort of like tips us over the edge is that 20 quid for like a bundle of Metroid Prime, Burnout, Resley will remake, Eternal Darkness and Super Monkey Ball.
I mean, that's pretty great. You know?
Yeah, that is good.
Yeah, and the Resley thing is like a nice completionist thing because obviously they released them all on GameCube. Yeah, that's true, actually. Yeah, that is crap, actually.
Oh yeah, the reselling is the thing, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the first thing I've bet. I can't really picture what he has at the end.
Yeah, so paid off his credit card and got about 100 quid off.
I don't really care about that.
No, but like it's sort of like, it's a bit anti-games, isn't it? It's a bit like, oh, you know, it's sort of.
The art form has been bartered with for some other financial gain. You aren't appreciating what you have. You're just treating them like trading chips.
I mean, literally trading, you know. Yeah. It's a tough one.
Like, there's no question the quality of the games, the prices are interesting. I thought this was going to be about Color Splash. I thought we were going to get to litigate Color Splash, which is like interesting.
It's like one of the only Wii U games, which is only on Wii U. Yeah.
I mean, that must have come up on the Wii U Hall of Fame episode. I don't think it made it onto the 10 that we spoke about there.
If someone had bought that, I would be interested in talking about that. But alas, they didn't. Yeah.
I mean, the general quality of the games, I think I'm willing to overlook the kind of selling of Resident Evil, which is just a bit, yeah, always a sour end to an anecdote. I sold a load of stuff or I'm doing this to sell it. It never really works in Games Court.
So yeah, that's okay.
So is that innocent or guilty?
Oh, that's innocent, not guilty.
Fair enough. Innocent. All right.
I'll just put an eye there.
I just heard the heart from Dishonored pipe up. He says, I think the judge is thinking too much about Batman's junk. That's weird.
I don't know what our heart's talking about.
I smell a comedic conceit that's going to repay itself over and over again as the podcast goes on, Matthew. That's very promising. Okay.
Exhibit B is from Vegetable Tart. As my 30th birthday draws closer, brackets, I'm 28 this year, but I'm also incredibly dramatic. So I am desperately trying to cling on to my youth, which sent me to the world of eBay and the PS1 games of my childhood, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, 12 pounds 74, the birthplace of PS1 Hagrid.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, 9 pound 45. I adored these games as a child and spent many a Saturday afternoon with my friends, playing through these, so a true heart purchase indeed. Rugrats Totally Angelica, 9 pound 80, Rugrats Studio Tour, 4 pounds.
No defence for these. I then came to my senses and stopped buying PS1 games. I have a PS1, but it's in my parents' loft, so these might be played at Christmas.
But maybe old bad PS1 games are the secret fountain of youth. Yes, so thank you there, Vegetable Tart. So we've got two Harry Potter games, famously uncontroversial series to discuss in 2024 and Rugrats.
So I remember playing one Rugrats game on PS1. That was the platform where they brought out time with the original movie they did. It looked all right for the time, but I don't think any of them were much cop.
The Harry Potter games, I've played Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to completion. Me and my childhood friend Donald rented this one. We were slightly too old to be doing that, to be honest.
We were like 13 or something and blasted through that. I thought it was actually of the 3D Harry Potter games, the early ones. It was probably the best one, but the true Harry Potter, good Harry Potter games or the Game Boy Color ones for the first two movies.
That's what I was looking for, the old, the truth of the Harry Potter games.
Yeah. I mean, not many of them were good. I always thought that they were such unimaginative looking things, considering how much potential there was for a universe.
It's got loads of creatures and shit in it.
But anyway. They have finally nailed it and made what is by all accounts an amazing game, but at a time where it's just so hard to... So these Harry Potters, they come from a simpler time.
I don't think they become retroactively cursed.
No. That's the thing. They are contained in their own era.
I think there's something to be said for getting over Harry Potter when you're an adult. I will say that. I've moved on.
It's fine. I just sort of obsess over other dumb bullshit instead and it's fine.
Yeah. In the Rugrats games, I've not played, but when I think Rugrats, I think a game getting 42% in Games Master, which I think is probably the vibe of all those games. If I'm wrong, then apologies for pushing you out the window.
But yeah, out the window, you shall go.
Tough to see one of our 5% of female listeners get executed there, but what can you do?
Oh, well, I am sorry. Don't worry. It doesn't last.
It's not personal, anyway.
It could be respawned at a rift stone. That's how it works. When we say guilty, we should play a short little blast of the steel drum song from Anatomy of the Fall.
Well, it's like a piece of 50-cents music, so there's sort of licensing issues maybe, but I do like the idea of doing that, so I will cut it in here.
I think, if I remember anything from copyright sessions, seminars, future, you can vibe your way through copyright.
Yeah, you're right, actually. You can just use a still from a movie, and as long as no one who owns a copyright looks at the magazine that you've printed it in, it's fine.
I don't see Larry David going after all the people who put the Curb theme tune in their videos.
Yeah, but that's because he got it from an advert for a bank. That's where he first heard it, so it's a piece of music you can probably get from some library or something. Yeah, hardcore Curb fan here, sorry about that.
Okay, exhibit C then. We've got one guilty and one innocent. Ah, no, so exhibit C from Ryan Plugs.
Donkey Kong 94.
It's got a Michael Caine soundboard on your defense desk.
Exhibit C, Ryan Plugs. Donkey Kong 94 for Game Boy. What's with the 94?
Is it like FIFA? Have they swapped out the teams or something? I don't understand that.
For Game Boy with manual, £13.25. I'm receiving it, the battery on the cartridge is dead, so it won't hold saves unless I solder a new battery to the board and inevitably break it. This is why I've not gone into collecting Game Boy games, by the way.
The Yakuza Dead Souls for PS3, £36, that's an interesting one. Case, disc and manual in decent condition, but put into an Italian GameStop case that is black instead of clear plastic. That's cursed.
That's definitely cursed, especially on PS3, it's extra cursed. We'll have to get my PS3 out of its current home, a Sainsbury's bag for life in a cupboard. Brackets is a very nice Sainsbury's, which I know the judge looks kindly upon.
Okay, Matthew, so we've got Donkey Kong, £13, but it doesn't save, do you need to save in Donkey Kong though?
Donkey Kong 94 is the puzzle game, which kind of blows out, so it's not a port of Donkey Kong. It's, I guess, the kind of halfway house between original Donkey Kong and like where they would go with March of the Minis.
All right, sounds like the man who should be doing a Game Boy draft, yeah.
Yeah, it's one of the good Game Boy games.
Eight of them, you know?
Yeah, so I think that's, the battery thing is, I don't know, you hear a lot of that, don't you, with the...
It's a bit of a roll of the dice, you know?
Yeah, yeah, that's why, well, one of many reasons I don't go in for it and I'm also like terrified of plugging in anything in that I do own just in case it's now sort of shit and worthless. At the moment, they're all like, I've basically got a tin, a quality street, full of game cartridges and it's like Schrödinger's games collection. It's both functional and non-functional at the same time.
Yeah, yeah, this mythical tin I look forward to having a rifle through that one day.
Oh yeah, it's got the Game Boy Advance Micro in it.
Oh, beautiful. I mean, this is a little old thing, isn't it?
Yeah, it's tiny.
Yeah, spot on.
I'll blow your eyes out. So, Donkey Kong 94, feeling good about that. What was the second game?
Yakuza Dead Souls on PS3 for £36, but the case is a bit dodgy. It's like an Italian case, and it's black instead of clear plastic, which is just incorrect for PS3.
Yeah, that does resonate with me. I've never played Dead Souls.
I think it was a bit of a six out of 10. I don't think it was beloved. In some ways, I think it only got released here because they saw the success of Undead Nightmare and similar kind of like Halloween-themed DLC, and I think that they thought they could roll the dice on it because not all of these Yakuza games on PS3 got a physical release.
I think Yakuza 5 skipped physical release here. I think three and four got one, I think, but yeah. So I think that's kind of what drove it, and is it telling that they haven't gone back and remade this or really brought it back in any form?
I wonder, I get it if it's because you've played all of them and you want to play this one. Like in some of the nostalgia trip stuff in Infinite Wealth, Kiryu sees these things, which like remind him of his past, but they remind him of his past in all the mainline and spin-off games. So he sees stuff and he's like, oh, I had a crazy dream once that I was fighting all these zombies, that was weird.
And I know enough about the game to know what it's referencing, but I haven't played it. And I do wonder if like the true Infinite Wealth experience is having experienced every minute of Yakuza and then fully enjoying that sort of catharsis at the end. But is that worth 30 quid in a dodgy Italian case?
Well, it typically goes for about 70 quid. So I can see why you'd want to seek out a cheaper solution. Obviously, I don't think you can buy this on any digital store front now, because that's gone, I think.
Listen, if it works, it works, right?
Yeah. You know what though, this game had a much better title in Japan. It was called Like A Dragon Of The End.
So I think that's, I love that. I think that's great. Yeah.
Yeah, Yakuza Dead Souls is a bit like, oh, Dark Souls is doing all right, isn't it?
Yeah. Of The End sounds like a very polite sort of Japanese way of talking about zombies. Like, he has something of the end about him.
Yeah, okay. So a black case as well. I think though for the price, personally, I think this is all right.
It's sort of like, for a curio, I think 40 pounds is as high as you should go for a curio. Anything above that has got to be something you really love. So I don't think it's too bad, Matthew.
Yeah, you're honest talking about the battery problem, but I think the intent is right with Donkey Kong 94. So I'm gonna say not guilty. Excellent, okay.
No licensed music, no push from the window.
Yep, exactly, just carry on with your life. So yes, Exhibit D is from Michael.
You still have to, you are up in the top of the house. You still have to walk down through the house listening to that very obnoxious tune.
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that you've changed like what the method is. And I keep thinking, how does that relate to Dragon's Dogma again? I remember now it's been redone.
Yeah, it's Dragon's Dogma, but the house from The Matamy of the Fall is in that world playing that song.
And they're being pushed into the water from the window, is that right?
Yes, there isn't snow, there's water. It's now a coastal property.
Excellent, okay, it sounds like something AI would come up with. Exhibit D is Michael, no further information on Michael's name. Oh, this is, okay, it's a bit of a weird one, this, but quite interesting.
Coming up to Christmas 1999, I was always going to ask for a Dreamcast, having eagerly read about it for months in gaming mangs and on teletext via the Digitizer page. However, there was another game system that I coveted that year, the Neo Geo Pocket Color. I prioritized the Dreamcast and planned to ask for the Neo Geo for my next birthday, by which point it had unfortunately already been discontinued, having been on sale in the UK for only eight months.
I've fancied one ever since, but the price that used systems that especially games go for always put me off. That is until early this year when, having paid off my student loan, I decided to treat myself to a frivolous gaming purchase, which brings me to my games called Entry. Number one, a Neo Geo Pocket Color, modded with backlit IPS display, glass lens and aftermarket clear shell, 220 pounds.
Number two, Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Color, 18 pounds, car only. Number three, Puzzle Wobble, 24 pounds, car only. Number four, Neo Turf Masters, 12 pounds, car only.
Don't know what that one is. Five, repro copy of Cotton, Fantastic Night Dreams, 15 pounds. Please forgive the repro cart, this sells for close to 120 pounds.
Unboxed for a genuine copy. Total cost, 289 pounds. Neo Geo Pocket Color, something we've never discussed in this podcast, Matthew.
I don't know much about it.
I've never seen one of these things in the flash. Yeah. This is what I dread on Games Court because it's basically like a, it proves your ignorance, the episode.
Yeah.
So, you know, I feel like, you know, when you've got nothing to go on, you can't kill the person, right?
No, I mean, I mean, they have Sonic on it. You know, that's what you can go on. Interesting thing is, this was, so I sometimes get, because like, you know, I think people are probably aware of what our knowledge focus areas are now.
I occasionally get mixed up between the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the WonderSwan Color they did, that had a few Final Fantasy games on it, but I think the Neo Geo did come out here, as noted in the entry, and the WonderSwan never did. I think that was only released in Japan. So, yeah, what is interesting though, is this is kind of a precursor to Sonic Advance, those games, because it's developed by a team at SNK, who later go on to form Dimps.
Yeah, so that's kind of good, some good knowledge there. It's a very nice looking game.
Somewhere at SNK, there's a guy in his head, he's thinking, oh man, I would love to get to splice together some Sonic music with a Martin Luther King speech. Is that something I could one day do? I should probably part that thought, that will never happen.
Well, Neo Turf Masters is just a golf game, as you might expect.
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Puzzle Bobble is, that's a bit of a banger, Puzzle Bobble. You must at least understand why that would be good on a handheld, Matthew.
Yeah, yeah, not a big, big Puzzle Bobble guy, but that's okay.
Would you like to know what the Cotton Fantastic Night Dreams is? I think I've got that right. It's a...
Yeah, it's basically like a side-scrolling shooter game. It's quite a nice-looking thing. It looks very sort of like...
Yeah, it's kind of like a... Looks a bit witchy. Sort of like fighting kind of like big evil trees and ghosty stuff, and it's quite a lot of dark backgrounds.
It looks all right, looks pretty good. It's sort of like a game that, if it was DSiWare, you would have given it eight out of 10 in NGamer or something, you know?
I thank you for putting it in the context that I would understand.
No worries, pal. And that's all the games there. So is £280 acceptable cost for something that they dreamed of having for many years, Matthew?
It's so specific, isn't it? I feel like if you've got it into your heart that you need this incredibly specific thing, you know, who am I to judge you spending sort of any amount of money on it, really? If anything, the more money you spend on it, the more convinced I am that you have to have this in your life and so it's a good thing.
Yeah.
A lot of these, you know, when it's like a lot, but not like, you know, a hundred pounds plus or whatever, you're kind of like, is this just an extravagant, lazy purchase? Is there anything truly in this? But that there, like you can't deny, it's a very sincere entry.
It's a good selection of games as well. That's like, you got some bases covered there. They're all different genres, those games.
Yeah, I think I can, I think I'll let it go. That's, yeah, well, let it go. I mean, let it descend the stairs safely and I'm not, I am dangling all these people out of the window by like a tie.
So I'll pull them back in and let them go.
Beautiful. Okay, well, that's three innocent to one guilty so far.
Maybe good entries, you know, like, I can't question it, I'm a fair judge.
I think that so far, I think we've got to the point where people are kind of like doing this mix of, I know this is bullshit, but I'll see how it goes anyway. And this is something I genuinely wanted, which is kind of like how my thing started. I did want a lot of those games, and then I bought a lot of them alongside.
See Bleach, for example. Okay, Exhibit E, it's from XBlasterX. Having recently raided some charity shops in my local town and managed to score a few bargains, City of Heroes Special Edition.
I know the game in MMO is now defunct, it's 2012, but it was complete with art book, full color comic book, full color map, it even had the receipt of the previous owner from 2004.
But it wasn't complete with a game you could fucking play.
For 50p, I couldn't leave it there. Naval Assault, The Killing Tide. This isn't an Xbox 360 game I'd ever encountered before.
It's some sort of submarine naval warfare game. I don't actually have a way to play it, uh-oh. But again, for 50p, I couldn't leave it there.
Tales of Grace's F PS3, no idea why I bought this, bit more expensive than the other two at 199, but had a nice cover. Never owned a PS3, no intentions to. Well, I think we got to the heart of it here, Matthew.
I'm looking at this killing tide game.
It looks like Battle Station specific, but worse. It's got like four out of 10 for my GN, basically.
It looks rank as shit. Um, yeah, no, this is bad, even for 50p. I think throwing 50p just over a fence would be better, because then you don't have to have it.
This box would be cluttering up your house. I would pay 50p to get rid of this box. Whoever was selling this was like, thank fuck, someone finally took the killing tide off my table.
Well, I will say about City of Heroes, it is a very beloved MMO.
Yeah, which you can't play, right?
I think there are legacy servers you can go and play. You can basically go and enjoy the experience as it was. It's been preserved by some players.
I can't remember what the deal is, but I think it's maybe an NCsoft game. Whoever owns the actual license, they've got some tentative deal with them and it's fine.
So it's an image now of a superhero, a cloaked Steve Mesner flying around this place, interviewing people about what it's like to play it, long beyond its sell-by date.
Poor Steve. His name has been uttered on the Games Court episode. That's it now for his life and his career.
His prospects are done for, Matthew. So, yes. Okay, so should we say guilty and get on with it?
What do you reckon?
Yeah, I'd say, yeah, that like just the... Oh, it was only 50p, it's no defense. Like I see all day, I see things which are only 50p and I don't just buy them because I happen to be able to afford 50p.
Like I'd end up with all kinds of like nuts and food and bits of string and all kinds of stuff.
I don't believe you can buy nuts for 50p in this UK.
Oh, you can buy a thing of nuts for 50p. I could buy three walnuts for 50p. I bet somewhere I could buy three walnuts for 50p.
But I don't do it because I don't have 50p. I don't like... Oh, well, I may as well.
They're only 50p.
That's very inspiring. OK, so yeah. Do, do.
Excellent. Go watch Anatomy of a Fall to understand what the hell we're talking about. It's on Amazon Prime in the UK.
OK, Exhibit F is from Jamie Smith, guest of the podcast, who's been politely plugging in awareness on our Discord. And I think I'm being a bit too curt towards him, Matthew. And I'm going to aim to be a bit nicer to Jamie from now on on the Discord.
So look forward to that, Jamie, in 2024. Hi, both. I'm going to do this from memory.
But here are a selection of memorable purchases I had made over the years when trying to amass an N64 collection. Each was an individual pre-owned box purchase except for the bundles, which were new and have further context outlined. Now, Matthew, before I read this out, I do have to commend that Jamie's formatting of this entry is excellent, actually, and it's copied and pasted perfectly into Word, which none of them normally do.
So just want to commend that. Great use of bullet points.
That's like saying like, here's this guy in court. He's killed five members of his family, but man, he had a nice haircut before he came in.
Fair enough. Okay, I'll get on with it.
Formatting? When's formatting ever swung in a thing?
Someone did say, I hope the judge goes easier on you, is leading on you because of your nice formatting.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Okay. Fair enough.
Okay. So 15 pounds, Turok Dinosaur Hunter and Rumble Pak, my first ever pre-owned purchase from Chips. However, the unboxed Rumble Pak was not compatible with this game as I later found out.
Okay, tough. 33 pounds, Competition Pro GamePad plus four-layer memory pack. See attached image for reference.
I didn't attach the image, I'll be honest. Purchase from Electronics Boutique. The pad is arguably the best of a bad bunch of N64 controllers.
Meanwhile, the storage helped to save the England player names on ISS64 that I've painstakingly edited every time I booted the game up until that point. 40 pounds bundle, Mario Kart 64, Yoshi's Story, 1080 Snowboarding Blast Core, purchased in a day only, £10 per game deal from Curry's around Summer 98. More than doubling my collection at that stage.
I mean, this is a long time ago now. But, I mean, £10 a game, pretty good there, I would say. They're all pretty good games as well.
£50 bundle, Space Station Silicon Valley, Carmageddon, Buck Bumble, Mission Impossible, Body Harvest. Unless you're about this.
Oh, and that's like all those sevens.
Yeah.
That's the those sevens anthology. That's how that would be bundled up now by limited room.
Yeah. And Mission Impossible.
Those sevens and Mission Impossible. Maybe Buck Bumble. Is Buck Bumble that good?
I don't know much about it. It's come again. The scene is a bit of a trashy sort of treat, isn't it?
But in my head, I kind of mix it in a little bit too much with Jet Force Gemini in terms of style. Maybe that's unfair.
Well, you know, comparing anything to Jet Force Gemini, you just got to be very serious when you lower a game to that level, I would say. These are random punts from HMV, selling for £10 each. I've since worked with Devs from at least two of these tiles.
I'll let you speculate which two. I guess that would be Body Harvest, the space station in Silicon Valley, right? Because those were UK developed, I think.
Anyway.
So yes, those two are definitely, as you described Matthew, those sevens for the time. £10, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, found in pristine condition within a game station bargain bucket in summer 2000. The first I made at that store after I had completed Majora's Mask beforehand.
This has a tiny whiff of didn't happen of the year awards because these prices are just so good for N64 games.
£10 in 2000. It's still a new game in then.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a thing. It's sort of like, yeah, it's a weird one, but hey-ho.
I guess they were trying to clear out for the Dreamcast, PS2? I don't know. Anyway.
Overall, that's a grand total of £148 over a three-year period, close to £270 in today's money, for 11 games plus three accessories. Worth a reminder, this was at a time when brand new releases were typically £50 each. If that trip down Games Shop memory lane wasn't enough to save me from walking the plank, if only that was your death here.
I'm afraid there's some 50 cent on in the background, my friend. Please don't let me get poked to death by a cursed flock of turkeys from South Park 64. Jamie, not Jeremy Peel Smith.
Okay, so some good bargains there. This is so far back, I almost lack context. The thing that jumps out to me, Matthew, I don't know if you agree, is that the cursed third party gamepad and memory pack, those always like maybe break out in hives looking at those things in like friends' houses.
What do you make of the whole deal here?
Yeah, I mean, they were always a devil's bargain, like even new, because it was like they'll be cheaper than the official Nintendo versions, which are all quite pricey. But, you know, they will probably break or feel horrible or fall apart in a year's time or something. So, you know, like that's new, like the pre-owned version of them feels extra cursed, like a pre-owned third party N64 controller.
You know that controller's like seen some shit?
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
Let's not point the dishonoured heart at that controller, because I think what would come out of it would be just truly harrowing Mario Party sessions on that thing. Yeah, there's too many kind of cultish castle faves in there.
It's almost too nicely manicured as a collector.
Yeah, it shows Jamie to be ahead of the curve in that he was buying things which are widely considered to be cult classics, maybe before they were understood as such. So that's quite good. Bonus points for the foresight to buy these things.
Yeah, I think the good outweigh the bad. Even the things which are a bit whiffy here, Mission Impossible, it's an endearingly strange thing. It doesn't really exist in many other playable forms.
So yeah, I think I'm going to let it go.
Alright, fair enough. Then we move on to Exhibit G, Gildia 44. Recently got an analog pocket, so I've been trying to buy some Game Boy games.
So if it pleases the court, Tetris 1199, brackets I gave my copy away years ago, James Bond, a Back Page favourite, 1999, Wario Land 1234 and WarioWare, £38.40 for all. Fairly sure these are fake, but they work fine. Hotel Dust 799, well I can't endorse that.
Not for the pocket, but I've never played. That's the entry Matthew, nice and short and sweet there. Yeah, I don't know if those are fake.
I don't know about paying 38 quid for them, but I don't know if they do work then.
If they do, they serve the purpose right? Then who cares?
Yeah, there is a subreddit where they will tell you if they're fake or not. I recommend going on there. I took some DS games on there and guess what?
My copy of Apollo Justice is legitimate Matthew. So that's a great day for me.
You should get it sealed in one of those little plastic bags like they do with comic books.
Yeah, so James Bond is a really good sort of Zelda riff, just a fun, cool little game and a great thing to sort of discover in the Game Boy back catalog. Tetris is an old classic. You love the Wario Land games, right?
So this would appear to be innocent. Is that right, Matthew?
Yeah, this is good. I must admit like there is something just so boring about like Tetris on Game Boy. You know, it's just so standard.
You're like, yeah, it doesn't like anger me, but it really doesn't get my blood pumping either. Like almost verging on being like, should we just send a message to other people? Like, don't give us obvious classics.
You know, don't give us Ocarina of Time or Tetris. Of course, those are good games. But, you know, the whole premise of Games Court hinges on drama.
Yeah, we haven't had much so far.
But it has to exist on an ice edge and Tetris just doesn't do that. So let this let this be a warning to you.
The only Game Boy game I think about buying, Matthew, because I think about buying like a analog pocket sometimes. I've always wanted the DX version of Link's Awakening. I never owned it.
And it's maybe one of the nicest sort of like color jobs they did on that handheld. It's still a beautiful looking thing.
But that I might one day buy and submit for a Games Court of my own.
It is, but do you remember how beautiful those old Game Boy color cartridges were? Like the kind of like C3 ones. Just really nice looking things.
But I know you're not really an owning things guy.
No, that's so... Yeah, that's all right. My little screed about boring popular games has been met with lots of positive hum-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-n From the jury, hum-num-num, bilateral.
We've got, yeah, I think we should go back to using more Felix Wright sound effects in these episodes, actually.
That was always so novel. I did, there was a period where I tried to put some on, and they just sounded so shit. Like, they were just so clearly existed in a different audio universe to what we were in.
They clearly, they massively fuck with the levels in Audacity as well, because they're just like the loudest things in the world, so they're very annoying to calibrate.
I just don't want to blast someone's ears out with the sound of a Phoenix Wright gavel. And then they crash their car. You know, we'll leave that to your laugh.
Yeah, fair enough. Shattering the windows in the car park. We come to my favorite entry of this month, Matthew, or this seven months, I should say.
But this is on James Alone, exhibit H. It's so good, just you wait. So, in 2014 to 2015, I was very sad and lonely.
Oh, cry me a river. But also did a very unsuccessful video game podcast with a friend. We got talking and shared a love of cool 90s design, namely Wipeout.
I said, hey, we both love this. We should do a documentary about Wipeout. I then started a quest to buy each and every Wipeout game.
And so a horrible adventure began on eBay, Amazon and various CXs around the Southwest. Brackets, I had to request my eBay data to get some of these prices. I love the idea of doing like some kind of like freedom of information request to just get your own prices read back to you.
Okay, Wipeout on Saturn, 14 pounds 70, brackets don't own a Saturn. Wipeout PS1, four pounds. Wipeout 2097, banger, 10 pounds.
Wipeout XL PS1, three pounds. Brackets noted, I found this in an Oxfam in London. And yes, it is the US version of 2097 and I can't play it.
Wipeout, WIP3 out, how the fuck you say Wipeout 3? PS1, 15 pounds. Wipeout 3 Special Edition PS1, 34 pounds.
Yes, they went with both WIP3 out and Wipeout 3. Wipeout 64 and 64, 15 pounds. No, I don't own it N64.
Wipeout Fusion PS2, 12 pounds. That was quite a boring game if I recall. Wipeout Pure PSP, eight pounds.
Wipeout Pulse PSP, six pounds, 45. Those are bangers. Wipeout Pulse PS2, 24 pounds, 67.
Brackets, yup, same game, just on PS2. Wipeout HD Fury PS3, banger, 15 pounds, 80. Brackets, I also own this digital game.
Listen, are you saying banger or is he saying banger?
Oh, I'm saying banger, that's my commentary. Just a cheeky bit of color to give it a bit of life. Wipeout 2048 Vita, banger, eight, 15 pounds.
Wipeout Omega Collection PS4, 1999. I also own this digitally. Finally, I also bought a PSTV, which an older boy made better so I could play 2048 on my TV.
That cost 35 pounds. So in total, that is 232 pounds 61 on a game series where I'd say only four of the games are actually great. I also never made the documentary and the podcast is now erased from Planet Earth.
I mean, that's got everything I want in a Games Court entry. It's got things that will make Matthew angry. It's got like pointless purchases, massive outlay and a completely dumb reasoning behind the entire ordeal.
So I mean, full marks, just a great job. Matthew, your thoughts?
Yeah, you'll have to see it.
Oh man, if there's anything I'm not, it's a wipeout guy.
Yeah.
And we really have gone over this on the podcast several times. It's just not for me. And it's one that I just don't see the appeal of it.
Like it's so far removed from something I'd be interested in, you know, boring F-Zero. Just what I think.
It's got such a UK specific following.
Like the story behind it and the success of it and just how much of it there's been and the fact that it lives in all these different forms. You know, like it is one of the great PlayStation homegrown success stories.
They're not even like zone mode in Wipeout HD. That is so cool. Like as a kind of sort of like time, sort of like you have keep going and it keeps speeding up.
That's a cool idea, I think, but hey.
Yeah, I just, if you're not driving fast spaceships over a giant hand and a little robot goes, three, two, one, go. I'm just not interested in your spaceship racing game, I'm afraid. Oh, and it's just, it's just hopeless, this entry, isn't it?
Like the amount that you can't play. Like, yes, by the number of times you said banger, I'm assuming some of these land for you, but.
Yeah, like PSP and the Vita Wipeouts are really good.
But buying just everything, just buying everything with like no control, no focus to, I think that.
Yeah, you kind of only really need the Wipeout HD version they've got on PS4, which comes with the Omega Collection, which I think has the additional tracks they did on Vita. So you can kind of get it all in one digital place. And would you play the PS1 ones when you can play the HD modern one?
I don't know about that, but yeah. Guilty, Matthew?
Yeah, it's not for me. I was never into its soundtrack, but I tell you a soundtrack I am into, it's 50 Cent. Ba-ba.
I kick that one out like in 300 when he kicks him off the cliff.
I can't really picture you doing that.
No, I know that is bullshit. Yeah.
I want to believe though.
I would seriously put my back out doing that.
Exhibit I from Scott V. I submit this to you not for defense, but because people have to be put on trial even though they're clearly guilty. I submitted a variant on this before, but deleted it before it was used, and I now have several months hindsight.
Sorry, that's Discord-only context, so listener doesn't need. When the film Highlander came out in 4K, I decided I needed a 4K player. Wanted to kill two birds with one stone.
I bought an Xbox One X and the following games intending to play all of them. Xbox One X was £100 after CX of credit was applied. GTA V was £15, Sunset Overdrive £3, Star Wars Squadrons £5, Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2, The Pair for £8, Fallout 76 £2.
Rare Replay £5. Aside from Squadrons, I have not played any of the others. And as a sad conclusion to the tale, due to a known firmware issue, some 4K discs do not play in the Xbox One X.
Highlander is apparently one of them.
I had to buy a separate 4K player anyway. Yeah.
That's good, that's a good entry.
There can be only one 4K player that actually plays Highlander.
I just like the idea that the film where you're like, fuck, I've got to get into 4K is Highlander.
Highlander is such a dad sort of choice.
But it's not even one of the truly good ones, you know? It's like enjoyable, but there's no one who's like, oh, Highlander is like a five star classic.
But it may not surprise you to hear that my dad had Highlander 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on DVD in the noughties and expressed interest in watching the TV show or so-called Highlander. So, you know, just wanted to put that out there, Matthew, give people more of a picture of my dad and his whole situation.
I do have expressing interest in watching a TV show, like announcing that I am formally, announcing that I'm interested in this, that I am in on Highlander. The whole not playing these games and so many of the like, a lot of these games, they sound like Game Pass games now.
Yeah, I think they are. But then this is, I see them before Game Pass, because it's an Xbox One X, right?
The prices aren't horrible. Like Sunset Overdrive for £3. I'm into that.
That's a great game.
Yeah, so that's a really good, fun little game. And Rare Replay. You know, if you're into the Rare thing is obviously a treat.
Yeah. All these games are backwards compatible as well, so you can just keep playing them on modern formats.
The problem with this one is it opens with the context of why I want this thing, and then the thing fundamentally doesn't do the core thing you bought it to do.
Yeah.
Which is, I would say, grounds for execution.
I would say so.
It's like the opposite of, I set out to buy the Neo Geo Color Pocket at any cost, and that's what I did. It's I set out to do this at a weird low cost, and it failed.
Ah, no. Okay, excellent. So got a guilty there.
Excellent. Exhibit J, just from No Genius Slash John, had some DS purchasers from, wow.
If you watch the opening 15 minutes, they certainly make a lot more sense.
You just need literally those first 10, maybe even five minutes to get it.
I would say it's actually required viewing to understand this episode.
Okay, so this is from No Genius John, exhibit J, had some DS purchasers from CX a few months ago. Another code, £12 plus £3 delivery, Advance Wars Dual Strike £20 plus £3 delivery, Civilization Revolution £4 plus £3 delivery, don't know why I play that one these days, you can get to see loads of different stuff. No pubes in the box, but the Dual Strike box had a bit of green mold on it, so I had to disinfect that and see if...
Oh dear. I bought another code just after the remakes were announced, played it and loved it. I only played a few missions in Dual Strike because the DS draft got me to playing Latent 3 and then continuing a bit of Latent 2, which is maybe a bad idea because 2 really felt like a step down from 3, but I really enjoyed 3.
And Civ Rev was just for being a Civ fan. Haven't tried it yet, but no massive expectations for it. Why did you buy it then?
That's the kind of question I have there.
I remember Nick Ellis, editor of NGamer, he loved Civ Rev on DS, and while you're right about there's loads of other forms of Civ, but if you wanted to play a weird handheld version of it that was good, it is that.
I think I picked it in the DS draft. I played loads and loads of this game. It's just very pared down visually when you could play Civ on Switch or Steam Deck, whatever.
That's all I'm saying.
If you can live without 4K Gandhi, DS is the place to go.
I think it's also backwards compatible on Xbox. It's like an identical game, but it just looks nicer basically.
Yeah, these are okay. Another Code, I don't know, the original Another Code is the same game I'm not massively into. I own it quite a lot because I wrote about it in my interview for NGamer, so I have a fondness for it.
I'm playing the collection. I got the collection on Switch, which is obviously quite a redo of the original game. So you can't really judge the DS game based on the Switch version, obviously.
But it does feel like they're working with quite thin material. So I think Another Code is one of those games that I kind of won't go back to. Let it remain a kind of reasonably happy memory.
How much was it again?
That was £15 including delivery.
Yeah, it's got some DS-only puzzles, like some lid closing shenanigans. Which can only happen on DS and will only ever make sense on DS. So as like a curio, if you had a big DS collection and you one day wanted to show future generations how wacky dual screens could get, Another Code may do that for you.
So yeah, I think I'm okay with this.
Yeah, okay. All right, so a sped then. I think it's just about solid enough.
Like Civ Rev for seven quid is a tiny outlay. Advanced Wars, you do always pay a little bit more to get hold of those. So yeah, no real.
Yeah, I can't throw Advanced Wars out the window because Chris Schilling will never forgive me. He really likes Advanced Wars. And you know, I'd quite like to get more work from Edge in the future.
So you can complain about it this podcast, Matthew, playing a 50 hour RPG in January.
It's a double-edged sword, so to speak, yes.
Exhibit K. This is Jamie Smith again.
Oh, we left it so long, he was able to come back with a second post.
Not that I would like to have this litigated bracket see my N64 post further above for that instead. I recently purchased a boxed Sega Mega Drive and two controllers for £11, but I'd be curious to know of where that ranks in the tier list of all-time Backpage pod bargains. The truth is, I own a Mega Drive, and I don't place loads of value in buying a new one.
And I feel like for a long, long time, you could get a Mega Drive for about this price. You know, like everyone was selling them in like the late 90s, and that's probably what my parents paid to get hold of the one I had. But yeah, I don't know, it's sort of like, I don't get, it doesn't get a blood pump in a Mega Drive for 11 quid, but I guess I can't complain, Matthew, what are your thoughts?
A Mega Drive for 11 quid. Games?
No games, just two controllers. We're going to look up the going price of a Mega Drive on eBay, because that's kind of like hard work that we do on this podcast. So we have Mega Drive console, we set you back about, you can sort of like buy one for, it would seem like roughly 25 quid plus.
And most of them come with games, to be honest, so I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at a Mega Drive mini untouched.
Oh yeah, I forgot you bought that. That's probably worth a bit of money now.
Yeah, it's never been out of the box. If I, a huge Sega head, can't get excited for that, how excited can someone get for just a Mega Drive by itself with no games?
Yeah, fair point.
This is weird because he's been saved once, but now he goes out the window on a second crime.
Yeah, so okay, so you're saying they're guilty. That's it.
Does this mean I get all the N64 stuff from the first one?
Yeah, sure. So, Space Station Silicon Valley, that's yours, my friend. And da-da.
That's done. Guilty there. Sorry about that, Jamie.
By the way, Matthew, your Mega Drive Mini 2, I just looked it up on eBay. That's selling for about 200 quid on there.
Oh, yeah.
You could flip that.
Now look up the Borderlands Top Trumps.
Actually, I will do that because it will be funny. I promise it will be funny. Borderlands 2 Top Trumps.
I assume you always look this up every month to see if the value has changed. £9.99 or best offer.
£10 quid, but I've got like 30 packs of them.
Yeah, but no one seems to be bidding on any of the ones that are up there, you know.
Some people don't know they're up well. Let's wait for the film to come out and for Borderlands Mania to truly sell in.
Yeah, any day now. So good. All right.
Okay. Exhibit L. This is from Pollyrath.
These are all in yen. The yen is not worth much these days, so I don't know what these actually cost. So we'll just go with it.
Final Fantasy Tactics 400 yen, Warcraft 2 2480 yen, Wizardry 7 2180 yen, Valkyrie Profile or Valkyria Profile. No, Valkyrie Profile. That's right, isn't it?
2280 yen. All Japanese editions of the games on PS1. These are mostly bought to have an excuse to play the games on an emulator as other than Warcraft 2, frankly purchased for the sheer audacity of having a PS release.
I do see the appeal of that. I do not own physical copies. Final Fantasy Tactics is long been a favourite game of mine and while I have always been more into my magic over Wizardry, I thought it could be a fun delve.
I also believe Wizardry only had console releases in Japan so it feels like an interesting artifact. All I ask is that as Valkyrie Profile was purchased for a friend, brackets also a listener, they share my fate, however cursed it may be. I think these are quite interesting purchasers, Matthew, but what I can't grasp is whether they can actually play them.
Can they speak Japanese? Are they playing like a fan translation? That bit is a bit obscured.
But weren't they buying them so that they could then emulate them and feel okay about it?
Right, as in you've got a copy of it there for it's okay to have a backup copy of it.
That's what a lot of people pretend to do, isn't it?
Yeah, 400 yen by the way is £2.80.
Yeah, so I got a little bit distracted trying to work out what the yen value of these. Can you just go through the game names again?
Yep, so FF Tactics, Warcraft II, Wizardry VII and Valkyrie Profile.
Yeah, I just don't know why you...
Have you ever played any of these games, Matthew?
A tiny bit of FF Tactics.
Yeah, I had that on PSP, the version I did for that.
But never enough to properly get into it or kind of understand it.
I've played Valkyrie Profile because they did the PSP version for that, and it was at a time where there were no other RPGs on PSP, so I bought every RPG I could get. It was okay, so I have a side scrolling kind of oddball Square Enix kind of sort of back catalogue thing. I think it was recently ported to PS4 actually to coincide with a recent sequel they did.
It's sort of like a, I don't know, it felt like a bit of a B or C tier sort of JRPG to me, but maybe people disagree with that, I don't know, but yeah. What are you thinking Matthew?
I found this whole entry very confusing because of the Yen not being translated.
Yeah. Let's check them out of the window.
Okay.
Good. Right then. So great lawyer saying good there.
Exhibit M is from Raspberry Brain, who I think is the person who composed the theme tune for Games Court. Kind of ironic if they get pulped, isn't it? I didn't buy this, but it's on Facebook Marketplace for $150 and has this description.
I should buy it just to get pulped. I allowed this because I thought it was quite funny, Matthew. So it's a Sony PSP designed around the God of War series.
So it's red and has some Kratos shit on it. And it comes with two movies on UMD. Click with Adam Sandler and Superbad.
Very much of the time there. Games, God of War Chains of Olympus, comes with charge instructions and GameStop case. Note battery needs to be replaced.
So, yes, $150, they didn't buy it, Matthew, but they submitted it. So their lives are on the line, as it is with any other entry. What do you think?
I like the game, but I can picture this gaudy device in my head. And the price, that seems like quite a lot for something which is like a battery problem. I think this is bad.
Those UMDs are definitely bad.
Yeah, that's cursed, isn't it? You don't want those floating around the house, I would say. So not in 2024.
Who wants to sit down and watch Click on their PSP?
Someone did at some point. No, one ever did.
Someone who can show me anyone who ever got true joy from watching any UMD on PSP, I'd be amazed.
It was like the pre-iPod video phase. I think it was about the same time, really. And so I do remember watching Advent Children on my PSP and thinking, it's cool that this can play movies.
But I don't know if I would describe that as true joy. True joy was elusive. Superbad is a very UMD-esque film, I would say.
That's funny. Okay, so guilty there, Matthew?
Yeah, for sure. That's the image of someone holding a PSP, chuckling, loving to themselves.
Yeah, it doesn't seem plausible, does it?
Out the window and the device too.
P-I-M-B, okay, good. Let's move on then. Ah, no.
Exhibit N, Ryan Plugs. I've done so much reading in this episode, Jesus Christ. I recently found my lime green DS Lite I bought when I was 16, which has been in a box at my parents' house for at least 10 years.
It still works, but unfortunately, there looks like some dust has found its way behind the screens. I will be taking it apart to clean at some point, but was really struck by how much sharper the screens were on the smaller DS compared to my DSi XL. Because of this, they have a bit of Fisher Price Energy, the DSi XL, I would say.
Because of this, I've bought yet another DS, a regular black DSi. Comes with a copy of brain training already owned in brackets and a charger, but is missing the stylus, £29.99 plus £3 postage. This now brings my total to two DSs and two new three DSs.
I know buying duplicates is frowned upon upon Castle Island slash Samuel Roberts Peninsula, we don't talk about that place. But the DS is my all time favourite console, which may explain this questionable purchase. Edit for the sake of transparency.
I had to change the touch screen on the DS as it was scratched to all hell, and the seller managed to disguise this in the photos. All went well, except a single cat hair got stuck behind the screen without me realising. I went to open it again, but managed to strip the screw on the battery compartment.
I've now bought a spares and repairs DS for £13, so I can salvage the back plate of that one for my working DS. Could I have bought a fully working DSi for the Grand Turtler £43? Possibly.
But I would deny myself hours of swearing to myself while hunched over a desk with a small screwdriver in my hand. Edit to, I've just got the cat hair out. So, nice enter to that bit at least.
When are you going to fucking sit down and play this console if you're just spending all the time fiddling with it? That's like a waste of time. This is me saying this.
What do you think, Matthew? So, he buys, he finds one, but it's got some dust behind the screen, so he goes, oh well, I better buy one instead. That has a fucked touch screen, so he has to take that apart.
I just don't understand why he didn't take apart the original one, and fix that in the moment, rather have to fix the later one. I mean, I would never open one of those things, because I know I would break it in some terrible way instantly. So, I am impressed by your confidence with these things.
But also, why are you doing it in such a hairy, dusty environment?
That is the question, I think.
You need to be in an operating room or something for this. You don't open up a body if there's loads of shit in the room. You need to start thinking like a surgeon.
This story was kind of cursed. It was kind of confusing. I feel like you just end up with loads of slightly compromised duplicates of a handheld you probably only need one of.
I think this is bad.
Guilty it is then, Matthew?
Yes, it is guilty.
The dog has come up. The dog from Anatomy of a Fool. He's looking sad.
The one who was banned from the Oscars because he was swinging the vote too much.
The heart from Dishonored that tells you the inner truth would be incredibly useful in Anatomy of a Fool.
Did she do it?
Matthew, what do you think? Well, I can't spoil it because it's completely ambiguous, isn't it? No.
I don't think she did.
I think she was morally compromised.
I don't think she did, but I feel like the messiness leading up to it definitely compromised her in the eyes of her son, so there'll always be a kind of weirdness there. Yeah, I think it's my take.
Yeah.
Thank you for listening to this month's XXL episode on Anatomy of a Fall. I hope you've enjoyed it. It's been a good one.
Exhibit O. The Halu Bikimi. That was hard to say.
The reveal of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle made me get a huge nostalgia trip for the hour spent playing Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb as a teenager on my mate's PC back in Bishop's Waltham. Very Indiana Jones-esque location.
I grew up near Bishop's Waltham.
That's where Indiana Jones are forged, IRL, isn't it, Matthew? So I bought an Xbox copy for £26.95 to play via backwards compatibility. It arrived yesterday and I excitedly spent 90 minutes playing it last night only to realise I don't actually like the game.
I just liked hanging out with my mate. I thought you meant Indiana Jones for a second there, but I think he meant his friend when he was a teenager.
With me old pal, Indiana Jones.
Yeah, Henry Jones Jr. So, you can get this digitally. So, I would just have bought it digitally, personally. I mean, I got it for free through the Xbox Live Gold.
Yeah, I think most people have this because of games with gold.
Yeah, it was a really nice little giveaway. It didn't come up in Best Games of 2003, but this is a bit of a favourite of yours, isn't it Matthew?
No, it's alright. It's not the Infernal Machine. Maybe it's got a bit of the energy of where Tomb Raider Legend would land in terms of it's a bit more linear.
There were some rotten bits where you had to run along corridors and then jump and quick time events to swing across gaps and things. Yeah, I like this one in that I like Indiana Jones stuff and have a kind of fondness for that. That pulpy area translates well to games, I think.
I don't think there's ever been... Of the Indiana Jones games I've played, even the 6 out of 10s, which this maybe is, have an endearing indiness to them.
OK, fair enough, but not indiness in the way that an indie game has indiness.
Oh, no, no, no, no, not independent spirit.
Yeah, OK, so is this a guilty, then, Matthew?
Yeah, sure.
Excellent, OK. OK, guilty. Yes, I am going to do that 27 times, just to be clear.
Sean Connery has broken from saying Bellatron and has just shouted, Junior!
Very good. Tiny whiff of Mrs. Doubtfire about that, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
I've got a cold. Why don't you do a good short quarter at the best time? I'm not an impressions guy, I believe, is what we're learning across this podcasting project.
No, there are some impressions you do quite well. Your Michael Caine's pretty good. What are the ones you've practised that your Christian Bale's pretty good, as we've gone over before?
It kind of catches the spirit of it, rather than the specificity of it.
Dory, dory, dory.
I've never been able to recreate the Whispering Man from Mission Impossible.
Oh, yeah, that's a tricky one.
Sean Harris.
Sean Harris, you did a good job with that one. Was it the Mission Impossible part you did?
I did an accidentally killer impression.
Yeah, it was good. Sean Harris. Quite a mediocre villain, if you ask me, but what do I know?
I'm much more of whoever the guy was in Dead Reckoning Part 1. He was pretty good, wasn't he? Our beloved Mission Impossible movies, Matthew, thank you for listening to another Excel episode.
We move on now to Exhibit P from Martin T. These are from the last couple of years and are either from eBay or CX. Link's Awakening on Switch, £28.11.
A Link Between Worlds, £12. The Last of Us Remastered, £5.50. The Last of Us Part 2, £10.05.
Skyward Sword HD, £21.70. Disney Illusion Island Switch, £23.60. It says, Unfinished, Ashamed to Own.
About Disney Illusion Island.
Yeah, yeah, Bahaosh. Really catching a stray there, Disney Illusion Island. Dark Souls 3, The Fire Fades Edition, £14.92.
Castlevania, Lords of Shadow and £3.64. Unplayed, but was bought after hearing Matthew praise it. Tomb Raider HD Trilogy, Legend Anniversary and Underworld on PS3 for £10.
Sadly, I've only played Legend and half of Anniversary so far. Prince of Persia HD Trilogy, PS3, £15. I've only completed Sands of Time.
That's fine though, isn't it Matthew, from that collection?
Yeah, you've played the best of it.
Ring Fit Adventure complete with Already Used and Sweated into Ring, Con and Leg Strap. Maybe it got hosed down first before you tried it on. Slightly Cursed Pre-Owned Purchase this one, £22.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on PS2. £6.82. This is a repurchase.
I had this game as a child and had very fond memories of it. I no longer have my copy of it because one day I found my younger brother posting various game discs and DVDs through the floorboards of our old house. This is one of the casualties.
I asked it recently if he remembered doing this and he said, Yes, I do, but often no further explanation. I played it for a few hours when I repurchased it and it doesn't really hold up too well. I wonder if the future owners of the house have ripped up the floorboards and found the bounty of scratch discs sitting there.
I mean, great story. I had a good time there.
So like the character of the brother was so, so fully realized.
Yeah.
Yes, I do.
Yeah, it took me on a real adventure there. So basically a bunch of Zelda games. The Last of Us, we pretty much agreed those are classics, haven't we, Matthew?
And yeah, Castlevania, Lords of Shadow, Dark Souls 3 and then some HD collections. Yes, they are on PS3, so fundamentally cursed, but the games they were collecting were pretty decent. The thing that really brings it down is the Ring Fit Adventure and the Sweated Into Ring Con and Leg Strap.
Now, there was a time where that was a big deal. That is probably thousands of these sitting in UK homes from the pandemic times, you know? But what do you think?
Does the good out balance the bad here?
There is a lot of good. And, you know, he's made an effort to play a chunk of them, which is good. I'm a little bit insulted by the...
I bought Lords of Shadow because, you know, I respect your take on it enough to buy it, but I haven't actually tried it. You're like, well, that's that's that's meaningless, isn't it? It's you got to play the thing to see.
Like, it's OK if you don't like it, but you've got to play it. The sweat. Look, another person's sweat.
Like, not to be precious about it, but just in in the, you know, the post covid age that that kind of feels a bit grim to me. Yeah, I'm not. I'm really not into that as a thing.
OK, so you're saying guilty or innocent?
I mean, there's a lot of good games to chuck out of a window there.
Yeah, that's tough, you know.
Yeah. It's a weird collection of games. Like, it's kind of Last of Us, Zelda, a bit of this, bit of that, bit of Switch stuff.
It's kind of impossible to judge, really. I'm not. I'm feeling generous.
Oh, we'll let him go.
There you go. That's what happens when you have Skyward Sword in your collection. Well done, Martin.
You are free to go. Exhibit Q, Jay Higgins. Just a quick one.
I picked up both Fire Emblem Fates games as I saw them calling to me in my local CEX. Birthright for £22 and Conquest for £28. Please, Judge Castle, let me live as I see one tier come down PS1 Hagrid's face.
And it's rather off-putting and I don't want that to be my last memory as a free man.
That one tier is because he won Lifetime Achievement Award at the Mafters.
Not the Bafters. What are they called here? The Mafters.
The Mafters. Do you remember how you laughed about that about an hour and 20 minutes ago?
It was good. That was my favorite of the six out of ten gags. I thought it was good.
I thought that was an eight, I thought. Okay, so two Fire Emblem games, Matthew. Not sure how familiar you are with these 3DS ones.
They sort of, the second, they did two on, they kind of got a bit drunk on their own success of Awakenings, right? And they just did two of them Pokemon style.
Yes, and then you buy the third one, is that right?
Yep, and you can no longer buy that because of the 3DS thing closing.
Well, when everything was closing down on 3DS, I bought these. So I feel like it would be gross hypocrisy to chuck them out the window for having these.
That's not bad for 3DS either. If you pay under 30 quid for like a good 3DS game, that's pretty much always worth it.
These things hold their price. They're good. They're good games.
Yeah, that's fine.
Innocent then. There you go. Enjoy life.
Okay, exhibit R. Robert Augusta-Mayer, Matthew's favorite listener. Got these 5 for 13 euros.
Yeah.
I've always thought Alpha Protocol was an interesting concept. Would love to hear your opinion. Just to explain here Matthew, you gave me a picture and I had to fucking do the work of writing down what the games are.
So I'll read them out after I've read this little bit of testimony. Would love to hear your opinion. Oh, and I beat the first two Halos on Legendary just to see what all the fuss is about.
Honestly, I didn't find the AI to be that smart and the mechanics just made me want to play Tribes. That's such a fucking...
Oh, look at this. Just trying to use Games Court as a soapbox for all that bullshit.
Yeah. La-dee-da-dee-da. But Halo 3 got an Edge 10, so I must play it.
OK, these are the games. So these games are all bought 5 for 13 euros. I think this is pretty unimpeachable.
Fable 2, Crackdown, Halo 3, Gears of War Slash PGR, Double Pack. So that all came in one box and Alpha Protocol. Now, Matthew, I will say that dissing the AI in Halo and saying they prefer to play Tribes, I would push for an execution personally based on that.
Big Halo fan here. Just want to say that's unacceptable. Halo 3 is an all-time classic.
Yeah. So what do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, there's all good games. I like a lot of these games. You know, I feel like this whole entry was designed to make a political statement about Halo's AI.
Yeah, I hard agree, yeah. And to ask this about Alpha Protocol...
Would you kind of enjoy as an entry? I mean, that's a fun way of doing it. But it's tricky, good games.
I haven't really got beef with any of these games, but...
They're all pretty great. Alpha Protocol was the...
It's the attitude, Samuel. So, turn up the boombox.
Okay, perfect. Okay, guilty. All right.
Exhibit S, sorry about that, Robert.
It's a game which is widely accepted to be one of those sevens, but of those games, it's the one I disagree with. I think it actually is shit.
My take is it's quite interesting. I think if I was going to play an Obsidian RPG, there's probably a couple of others I'd check out before that.
It's got too many problems. I don't think what charm other people seem to be tapping into doesn't shine through for me.
There you go. That's the take you're looking for, Robert.
It's just accepted. In certain circles, everyone's like, of course we all love Alpha Proto School, right? You're like, no, not really.
I must admit, I enjoyed it recently when the Saboteur went on sale again. Everyone was talking about it like it was this cult classic. I don't know who it was.
Someone was just out there going, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a dumbass Assassin's Creed game that's not as good. It's best known for having a load of digital breasts in it. I quite like that someone was like, actually, you can't talk about this like it is a cult classic.
Yes, it's nice it's on sale again, but it's not really, yes, it's not all that.
It's just the desperate race to have the more interesting take. He said after denouncing Alpha Protocol 7 out of 10, this week.
Okay, let's move on to Exhibit S. I didn't write down who this is.
Unnamed Grave.
Oh, I know who it was now. Someone gave us a list of about something like 120 games they bought in 2020. I said, I'm not reading that out, so condense it down to five, and so he did.
That person is called Martin, so here you go, Martin.
Martin's 120 games.
Martin with a Y. I just had to vent to clear my conscience. Okay, so we have a PS Vita with two 4GB memory cards and the following games.
Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified, which I think is a notorious stinker. Uncharted Golden Abyss, FIFA 13, F1 2011, Football Manager 2014, and Mod Nation Racers for £116.25. Now, we've talked about the Vita before.
I like the Vita and I think that's okay for a Vita. 2021 as well, the price is now out of control. Uncharted is a game you want on there.
Not sure if the rest are all that, to be honest. But Uncharted and a PS Vita, I can't really explain.
That sounds like a bundle that they trick your nan into buying with Vita and five games. Five of the hottest games and you're like, you get it and you're like, oh man, no. These are all the bad Vita versions of the good games on console.
There's never been a better time to play F1 2011, Matthew.
F1 2011, a bad call of duty, FIFA 13. I guess it's a fun time capsule of what was happening in football in 2013.
Was it though? Is it though?
No, I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah.
It feels like you just have to put all the games aside and just put the Vita on trial.
You like the Vita, right? That was something we talked about.
Yeah, I do like it. I've got more fondness for the Vita than I do the PSP.
Yeah.
Which I think is a little overrated as a handheld goes.
This might be interesting. I could not coax Matthew into doing a PSP draft with me. He wouldn't do it, which is unfortunate because I'd be well up for that.
If you ever take a week off, Matthew, you might get another co-host to try and do that one. Unless you'd feel greatly aggrieved by that, in which case you'll drop the idea altogether. I'd like to do it with you, but I don't think you fancy it.
I don't want to research a load of PSP games. That just doesn't interest me.
Okay, tell me how you really feel.
It's a lot of research for me because I only owned about four PSP games.
Fair enough. Innocent or guilty?
Let's say guilty. The games are just stinking out of the joint.
Yeah, look it up. You can get a PS Vita for 99 quid by itself.
Oh yeah, without all that shit.
Okay, got guilty.
I'm just saying it now because I like hearing you do that.
Is it still funny or is it getting less funny? Or is it like a Stuart Lee game where it gets funnier?
What you can't see is that every time you're doing it, I am doing a little dance.
That's good. I wish I could have that as a gift, that would be nice. Exhibit T, this is from Saku in Finland.
Long entry here but they were very nice so I thought you know what.
I'm like Paul Martin who's turning it into five or fuck off.
I mean, you know, there's a tiny bit of truth to that. And then he still got kicked out of the window. But like I did say include the five most interesting ones and there were two football games in there, you know.
It had me over a bow, you know. Okay, hello large lads. Thank you for the hours of entertainment.
I've happily supported you on Patreon since the beginning. See Matthew, this is why I included the whole thing. I used to run a 3DS but at the time I hadn't played it that much and I traded it in for the Switch when it launched.
A couple of years ago, probably mostly inspired by your DS episode, a classic with Joe Scribbles – that's me saying that. I started to regret selling my 3DS and bought a used one for 170 euros. Since then I've been gathering a collection of 3DS games I thought would be worth owning last year I started buying DS games as well.
I have now bought a pile of 3DS and DS games in physical form for various prices and feel like I have most of the games I would like to own. I won't list them all for your judgement but I thought I could bring my most recent DS games I bought just last week to court. A couple of these were some of the most expensive ones of my purchases so I'm curious to hear your judgement.
Ninja Gaiden, Dragon Sword, €8. Star Fox Command, €16. Aliens Infestation, €65.
Mario vs Donkey Kong, €1, €20. Mario vs Donkey Kong 2, €19. Last Window, The Secret of Cape West, €80.
Unopened in plastic. That's like one of Matthew's Horcruxes to use another cursed reference. My 3DS has a slightly loose hinge and I was worried it would break someday.
I wanted to get a back up one so I could keep playing my games and last year I bought a second hand Monster Hunter themed 3DS that cost me €250. But it was in perfect condition and in all the original packaging. May the judge have mercy on me.
Yes, that was from, that was Saku from Finland. So some interesting stuff. I don't know much about the whole Mario vs Donkey Kong thing.
That's not an area of games I'm really familiar with. It's like this whole third tier of Nintendo stuff I don't know much about and that's very much in that bracket.
It's a weird one because I think it's made by like Nintendo of America. I think it's a team over there. It's like the one thing they do.
I might be wrong on that but there's something about the studio behind it anyways. Actually, I'm going to look that up because I don't want to feed everyone a crock of shit.
It's getting like more out of tune the longer I do it.
He bought the DS one.
Okay.
Yeah, these are all DS games. Yeah, Nintendo Software Technologies, an American video game developer.
Interesting.
They've peaked as like eight out of tens. They make a lot of them. The weird thing about it is like lots of people think it's fine.
I've never met anyone who's been like, my big thing is Mario and Donkey Kong, March of the Minis. You know, it's a bit like a sort of Lemmings-y, Krusty's Fun House style, kind of program the little creatures to achieve a goal kind of mechanic. They've always been fine.
What's weird is that there's so many of them, given like the more cherished stuff that they won't make more of. I don't know if these games are just very cheap to make, but like, you know, they've been there on every platform in quite a prominent way where stuff you want a lot more, you know, okay, it's unfair to go, there's loads of these, but there's no Metro Prime 4 has taken fucking 15 years to make or whatever. Because I know that the production of those games looks going to be very different.
But there is like a little bit of that. You're like, why this thing? Is it just because you have people who can do it and it makes, you know, you may as well.
Which maybe isn't like the basis to, to like make a series on, but someone must be buying it and playing it. Yeah.
What about Aliens Infestation? Because that's like a pricey one.
I mean, so that's, that's a really interesting one. You know, kind of WayForward actually really capturing the kind of vibe and look of aliens in their very nice sprite arts.
You've spoken out against WayForward on this podcast before though.
Yeah, often. Yeah, but this is, this is what, yeah, I'm not, yeah, I'm not particularly into them more, they did like that very hand drawn boy in his blob, which I thought was, was, was a pretty bad hang. I'm not like super into their like Shantae games or anything like that, but that's not quite for me.
This does have nice art and nice music though.
Yeah, this has, it has the infamous, terrible end credits music, which I think Andy Kelly maybe retweets every so often.
Yeah, yeah, it's a regular retweet for him.
It has the, when you die, you become like another marine. I think it's got some kind of interesting sort of permadeath. You're pulled from a pool of soldiers.
The original Helldivers, you might say Matthew. A bit of commentary there on the military industrial complex.
Has it got that alien impregnation cycle in it, maybe?
It's definitely got a space jockey in it. I think it has like a boss fight or something.
But I do wonder if you can get like a face hugger and then you can still play it, but eventually an alien will hatch from you.
Oh, interesting.
Well, it's been a long time since I played it. But like I say, it's an interesting one. So the tune of what, 60 euros though?
Yeah, 65, yeah.
I mean, that's a lot. It's interesting, but I would say like, I'm surprised that was 65 and Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword was eight.
Yeah, I got Dragon Sword. It was quite cheap. I think it was published by Ubisoft here.
So quite widely available. And that's a pretty interesting game. Turn your DS sideways and it's got like 3D visuals.
It's like quite an interesting thing. It's not like amazing, but it's pretty cool.
Yeah, I thought it was like an intelligent attempt to capture like the core values of Ninja Gaiden. Like the pre-rendered backgrounds and quite a nice animated character and interesting combat. Yeah, I like that game a lot.
Eight euros sounds great for that. 65 Ray of Infestation is too high, but the last window of all this and it being sealed, very precious, quite hard to find. I would say this is not guilty.
Yeah, so it's interesting because the last window is one of those ones you can get for about 25 quid, you know, like it's sort of used, but you know, you can end up spending much, much more than that to get hold of a new copy. Yeah. Closer to 140 quid these days going to eBay.
So, yep, okay, fair enough. There it is. All right, so good.
And we, I don't think we're just in general, I think you're a bit more leaning on DS and 3DS collecting, I think, as a judge.
Well, I had, like, you know, I've played a lot more of those games and I know the good ones and the bad ones in my head. The other ones, like, it's like, it's real luck of the draw. Is Neo Geo Color Pocket good or bad?
I have no idea.
On that note, Exhibit U, Martin Smith, Dear Judges, Samuel Roberts and Matthew Castle, I've slowly been making my way through The Back Page back catalogue. Usually when walking my dog and I'm still about two years behind, I thought I'd submit myself to judgment from whoever-
That makes it sound like he's two years behind his dog.
From whoever is holding court next time with some of my recent issues. Game purchasers, feel free to gloss over my defences as you see fit. Metroid Other M, four pounds from CX.
He blames this on you, Matthew. He bought this in part because Matthew talked it up on the podcast and it's better than the reputation of his story. Though his response was, oh boy, you're about to lose a lot of respect for me.
So that doesn't fill me with confidence. Yep, that sounds like Matthew on Twitter. I've been morbidly curious for ages anyway, due to all the character trophies and Smash Bros.
Brawl.
Haven't played it yet, largely because hooking my Wii U back up to my TV fills me with utter dread. But I will get to it.
Who's got that many plugs?
It's definitely one of the last games is now on Wii at this point. Peter Jackson's King Kong, the official game of the movie GBA, £4 loose from a local games...
That isn't like the one...
No, no. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Battle Nexus, £10 loose on eBay. I was expecting it to be a sci-fi fighting game like Shredder's Revenge or Turtles in Time.
Instead, it's a boring stealth platformer thing that's surprisingly hard. Game Boy Printer, £8 loose with cable and aged paper on eBay. These usually go for £20 to £40, but this is listed as being in poor condition due to some corrosion on the battery terminals, but that cleaned off easily and it works.
It came with a link cable, which is usually about £8 on its own. I know it's a bit of a silly peripheral, but I've got a few GBC games it works with. Super Mario Bros.
Deluxe, Perfect Dark and a Japanese Beast Wars Transformers game. So I'll get some entertainment from it once I saw some new paper and it's a classic oddball Nintendo. I must admit, I did always want the Game Boy Printer and camera as a young man.
That's like the idea that somewhere there's a dormant paper mill for just the Game Boy, like a tiny paper mill for making the very specific paper stock for the Game Boy Printer. They're like, we got an order boys, fire her up.
Yeah, they're making like a 300,000 pound loss a year just running that place. PlayStation console with FIFA 2000, Jimmy White's 2. Is that ever a name that gets you excited hearing Jimmy White?
Like in a game, you know what I mean, that's sort of like-
You're about to say that the Jimmy White Snooker games were good once upon a time, right?
Yeah, but like, does it ever, it just makes me think of like those sort of middle-aged guy on a box art in the mid-naughties kind of vibes, you know what I mean? Like just, no.
I swear there was, well, in Snooker, that was good. On the media.
Yeah, fair enough. I'm just, you know, not really a big Snooker.
But that's how far back you've got to go probably.
Yeah, fair enough. Bugs Life, Tony Hawk's skateboarding, Crash Bandicoot, Loose Console, Box Games, One Controller, Avian Power Cable, £36 on eBay. There's an explanation there, but I'm not reading that, it's too long.
Spider-Man, the Neversoft Activision PS1-1, £12 box off eBay. Now that's a bit of a classic, I like that. I don't know if you play it with the existence of the Insomniac games though.
Spider-Man 2, Enter Electro, £12 boxed off eBay. Yeah, so this was, I think that actually was not, this was not very well reviewed, the second one, because I don't think it was never soft, that one. I look forward to finding out my fate when I catch up to this point in the back catalogue, probably in 12 to 18 months.
Real fucking random stuff there, Matthew. I don't think there's anything there that I think, oh, that's exciting. Like even the Spider-Man games, which are probably the highlight, I'm just a bit like, I sort of appreciate the curio factor of the Game Boy printer, but where do you land with this one?
Yeah, that one's interesting. I like the fact that it has things that work with it, that's okay. Like that would be like instant death otherwise.
If you just buy it because you're like, I want to own a Game Boy printer. I'm not into that. Oh, there were so many games there.
It's all kind of blurred into a big old mulch for me.
How about you just do the whole thing based on King Kong on GBA?
I mean, that's like nothing, you know? If that game's interesting at all, it's the weird, you know, 3D, 360, that generation one. Oh, God, what do we do?
The printer is like an interesting thing. The fact that I can't remember half these entries, I think, sort of says it all.
Yeah, I think that's guilty, and let's get on with it.
Yeah.
Cool. Da da da da, brr brr brr brr brr. Ah, no, Blartro.
Okay. Just trying to be my own soundboard now.
Yeah, but when you do catch up with this, like, we hope you're still enjoying the podcast.
Yeah, I hope so. Maybe they've already dropped it by now. They're like, you know what, this burnt out.
And this is a victimless crime.
Exhibit V, Stefan Valentin. Hi, lads, here's some stuff I bought last year. As always, thanks for making the show.
Okay, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, GBA cartridge only. $44.32, Summon Knight Swordcraft Story, GBA, $212.49. I've got to look that up in a second.
Super Monkey Ball, GameCube, $33.56. Super Monkey Ball 2, GameCube, $43.18. Summon Knight Swordcraft Story 2, GBA, $271.17.
The Darkness, $360, $14.82. Cheers from Boston, yes, that's Stephens, who's at slowest, bro, on social media. Okay, a bunch of, like, Nintendo kind of stuff.
And then The Darkness on $360, which is a game I very much like, a first-person shooter from 2007 based on a comic book that's not very good. But what do you think of this entry overall, Matthew?
I mean, the key one is the Summon Knight things, which is not a series I have played. Wasn't released in the UK, that's why. $200-something.
Looks, I'll be honest, looks a bit cursed to me.
Yeah, and it's got like, it's got like sevens, some eights. IGN liked it to the tune of 8 out of 10.
Yeah, it's sort of like, I just, I sort of don't love the visual style of it. It's quite, sort of, it's very, very bright. To me, it's not like, it doesn't seem to be a kind of classic.
I kind of wish I had a slightly more rationale here for why you bought them.
Yeah, I'd love to know the story. I mean, I like...
They are like truly obscure things to own, you know? Like on that level.
Yeah, for that much money, they must have some, like, meaning. That's purchasing with, like, real intent. I don't know, I'd almost like to kind of, I'd almost like to sort of bank this one and almost invite him back to explain it because I kind of do want to know the story.
Can we do that?
Yeah, I think so. So, Stefan, if you're listening to this, just email batchpagegames.gmail.com, give us some further rationale and we'll re-litigate this in another Games Court.
Yeah, we'll keep him in, like, a cell for now.
Yeah, that's it. Because I just read a thing on Reddit where someone said the story isn't up to much in this game, but because it's like a side-scrolling combat RPG, it does make it a bit interesting and they seem to really rate the combat. So, yep, Stefan, get in touch and let us know.
But The Darkness is a banger, of course. So, yes, I've just put some question marks next to that.
Yeah, I like the idea that other people whose games we weren't familiar with are like, well, we didn't get to do this. But the thing is, you didn't spend so much that it became interesting to me, you know?
Yeah, that's fair enough.
220 is a lot.
Yeah, yeah. So, this is... We've got five entries left, Matthew, so we'll just fire through them so you can have your dinner.
That's very important to me. Exhibit W, Stephen Marks. Stephen Marks, sorry.
Hello, guys. Love the pod. Recently, I've started buying up the Sun Hill Games to scratch and itch.
Eh? I don't really get that. It was one of my...
Oh, wait, is that... No, it's not, is it? That's Resident Evil.
Anyway, it was one of my favorite series as a teen. Sun Hill 2, probably one of my favorite games. I know the series went downhill in the PS3 era, so I only want to buy up the PS1 and PS2 games.
This year, I spent £50 on the special edition PS2 Sun Hill 2 with the postcards and making of DVD, £35 on Sun Hill 3, £28 on Sun Hill 4 The Room and not only the original Sun Hill on PS1 and Sun Hill Origin sell for around £100, but I feel I've just one bottle of wine on my next payday away from buying these. I should say that I've owned all these games fairly recently, but traded them in a few years ago to save space. It's something I regret getting rid of.
The man at CX's eyes lit up when he saw my Sun Hill 1 and Origin, so they've only gone up in value since then. What a bummer. I don't even think I got anything meaningful or memorable in return.
With the exception of my Switch games, there's a small library of games for Xbox or PlayStation that I know I'll play again. I'm not a massive collector. I mainly stick to digital slash game pass.
Also, and this probably condemns me to death, I no longer own a PS2, so have no way of playing these ornaments of remorse. Thanks for the hours of entertainment. Best wishes, Stephen.
Well, those best wishes may not save you, Stephen, because if you don't have a PS2 to play these games, I don't think Judge Castle will...
Oh, that's a rollercoaster ride, the ups and downs. What is it with people buying all the Silent Hill games? We've had a few things like that.
It's because fucking horror YouTubers have mythologized these games way past the point of like sense, so everyone's been buying them up. I bought that Silent Hill 2 Special Edition in about 2007 or 8 for about five quid, and it just... and it's only shut up since then, because people are like, ooh, this mythical PS2 game.
And it's like, it's really good, but it's not like... it's not going to change your life or anything. I don't know, I just...
Anyway, yeah.
Yeah, the things that give me pause are like, you had them, you gave them away to save space. I mean, I'm not going to judge. I don't know how much space he had, but like...
that's a tiny amount of space, those five game boxes. Yeah.
Yeah.
And now you can't play them, and they're going to be more expensive. Like...
I think they had a PS2, would be okay.
You're trapped in a Silent Hill-esque cycle of something. I don't know what it is, but it feels kind of cursed. I think Silent Hill fans are just a bit screwy.
That's my read on this.
Well, I think they're all kind of... All the PS1 and PS2 ones are interesting. They're interesting games, for sure.
Very atmospheric. But yeah, it's a bit of diminishing returns as it goes. Even Silent Hill 4 wasn't universally beloved.
It's like one, two and three, and then outside of that it's a bit dicey. Okay, so is that execution, Matthew?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Oh, I spent a little while since we had one.
That would be a cursed tune to hear in Silent Hill.
Yeah, like the Yamaoka version, that would be good. Okay, thanks Stephen anyway, you seem like a nice guy. Exhibit X, Marstale.
Your Honor, I recently attended a gaming market, and here are some of my purchases. Batman the Brave and the Bold for Wii, 10 pounds. Skylanders Donkey Kong Amiibo, 5 pounds.
Uh-oh. Now, before the good judge decrees judgment, I have three points to make. Oh, these are really long, man.
You know what, I'm not going to read these out, actually. It's just too long. Oh, actually, though, there are interesting details in here I have to share.
I just saw the name Ash Day, and I'm like, okay, fine. The Amiibo is a curiosity. I always coveted it.
It's an Amiibo and a Skylanders figure, though not at the same time. The fact that Nintendo and Activision have Donkey Kong for the game. And to make this as cool, even if Skylanders is a bit grotty as a franchise, the statue is interesting.
I've even used the Amiibo functionality already. Number two, the seller of these was none other than the original Black Hazard Donut himself, Ashley Day. He was there shifting some of his many games.
I always wanted to give the Batman game a go. Ash was a big fan of the game and said I would enjoy it. The excess Saturn games and various press copies of PS2, PS3 and PS4 games didn't intrigue me.
Three, when I got home, I opened the game and inside the box was a flyer for CX Windsor, two temporary tattoos, the CX logo. Note how that means the game wasn't there. Ash had accidentally sold me an empty case.
Oh my God, well, there's so much about Ash. Luckily, I also know Ash so I could reach out to him and let him know about the mistake. It turned out the disc was still in his Wii U.
As he had played it the last time, the Wii U was in use. I've just yesterday managed to get the game disc off of him. I understand the good judgment.
I like that I bought the game and haven't played it yet, but I think it should be fair to say my circumstances are extraneous and I should have played it by the time the trial takes place. Okay, so yeah, Batman Brave in the Bowl, 10 pounds. Skylanders Amiibo, five pounds.
So much explanation for those two little things.
Yeah, I played Batman Brave in the Bowl. It's like not an amazing 2D brawler. I mean, if you're really into Brave in the Bowl, maybe, maybe, but I thought it was pretty average.
I think it might be a way forward game.
I want to believe there's a YouTube thumbnail out there that says better than Arkham Knight, you know what I mean?
And like the Skylanders Donkey Kong. I used to hate that shit, because that's the kind of stuff like Nintendo would waste 10 minutes of an E3 on. Like we've never had a stronger relationship with Activision.
And here's this Skylanders Donkey Kong thing. And you're like, that is some cursed dust collecting shit for my house. Two weird purchases.
I love the story. I love that Ash sent you two temporary tattoos. I think that's weird.
Yeah, I feel like this has got to go out the window.
Yeah, so that's fair enough. So yeah, guilty. Ah, no, bilateral.
Okay, we move on. Exhibit Y, James Courtley. That's got to be like a pseudonym, right?
Right, now hear me out, your honor. I need to earn some redemption here. This is where that picture I sent you earlier comes in useful, Matthew.
Though I fear it's a long shot. So I'll go with Live and Let Die on the Spectrum 48K of fucking eBay, eight pounds. Please see attached picture.
I mean, the picture of queen sassy pants, JW. Pepper, Matthew's favorite fictional character of all time. It's worth the asking price alone, IMO.
Yes, I've played it. Yes, it's tremendous. No, JW is nowhere to be seen.
And no, it has nothing much to do with a film. Come on, Judge Castle. Throw me a lifeline or kill me for a third time.
Keep up the wonderful work, Wombles, Jim C. So Matthew, I sent you, I think the box art for This Is The Best Thing About It appears to be some kind of boat chase game, which is only really a small part of Live and Let Die.
I wrote down the plot of Live and Let Die to be just a speedboat, which really gives a lot of the problematic elements of BOSS.
It does a little bit. So you don't get any Dr. Kananga in here or the even more problematic- Yeah, exactly.
So yes, it's very funny though. It's funny to see this little Spectrum cassette box. It did make me laugh.
AQUID doesn't seem too bad for a curio, but what do you think?
I like the, on the back of the box, it's got Pepper on there with a big speech bubble, sort of doing a little bit in character. And it says, God damn it, boy. That darn Mr. Bond been at it again.
He done a wreck 12 of my brand new police cars, broke all the speed laws of the country, and now he's causing me him in that boat of his. If I catch any of your boys or girls, I follow in his example now. You better be watching your arse.
It's clearly arse and not arse.
Yeah, that's very funny.
You better be watching your arse. That's like a Christian Bale style switch from American to English.
And you better be watching your arse. And I wish Sheriff JW. Pepper well as Trump's running mate in the election this year.
I think that's like a great choice for him. So look forward to that. What do you think Live and Let Die?
Eight quid, Matthew. I kind of, it's quite funny alone for that box art and the JW.
Pepper monologue. Yeah, I like looking at the picture. I liked reading out some JW.
Pepper voice. I like that they took Live and Let Die and only made it about the speed boat. Yeah, a lot to enjoy there.
This is not guilty.
Okay, excellent. Innocent then. Okay, just two entries left there for the people who want to go home listening to this, including me.
Exhibit Z, we've never got this far before. Richard Brady. Hi chaps, won't bother with any preamble as others will do that better than me.
They sure did, my friend. Went to a few dozen car boot sales over the past year or so in the hope of striking gold. I found finding a used copy of X and making X pounds profit after watching many YouTube videos doing exactly that.
I felt an absolute, absolute failure until this week. I found a copy of Conker's Bad Fur Day on N64 for 10 pounds unboxed. Looking at eBay, CX, car only sells for 95 pounds, trade in of 60 poundish.
I do intend to sell, but after spending 60 to 70 pounds on entry fees to the boot sales over the past year, I recognize I'm not really in profit, but an actual potential loss and feeling a little hollow after my success. Does the feeling of pride? Brackets queues elder chest opening music in finding a holy grail cart, but realizing it's probably not going to make a net profit, save me from dunking, slash pulping, slash new method of torture, et cetera.
Sorry, sometimes I just read these out literally and I haven't got time to rewrite them, so you have to bear with me. Keep up the hard work, always look forward to a new pod dropping. PS always been a big fan of Matthew's work in particular, end-gamer era, smiley face.
I'm so sorry that you have to see me like this.
Yeah, reduced to this. Okay Matthew, so we have Conker's Bad Fur Day, a game that you like. It's definitely like a, is the definition of a cool N64 Curio, right?
Despite its problems. The entry fees, think aside, that's still a bit of a steal. I think that's a good purchase.
What do you think?
I think it is. I still don't like the, I'm gonna sell it, I'm buying to sell. I'm gonna let this one go, but I will say, in future, that's just like an instant kill, you know?
Like, just tell a different story. Make one up if you have to. But I don't wanna hear about people making loads of money, because it just makes me think, well, should I be doing this?
And that's not a thought I wanna be having. I don't wanna be going around car boot sales, trying to turn a profit.
Buy games for the games. That's why we will do this. Buy games for the games.
Exactly. That's what it says above the door in Games Court, but in Latin. Last one then.
This is exhibit A1. This is from Coig. Urban Chaos, PS2, two pounds.
Earth Offense Force 2017, Xbox 360, five pounds. Splinter Cell Conviction, X360, one pound 50. Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition, PS3, two pound 50.
Mafia 2, PS3, three pounds. Two notes I'll add. Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition was erroneously priced as a standard edition, two pound 50 versus 18 pounds.
So on that basis, this was something of a steal. I already own Mafia 2 and it's one of my fave PS3 slash 360 era seven out of tens, but this has a nice slip case cover. I can't speak for Urban Chaos, which I know is the first Rocksteady game, isn't it?
Yeah.
But the rest are all pretty strong. I never really like buying PS3 versions of multi-format games. I always think, why do it?
Just because if you have an Xbox, you can just play it on a platform you will use for other things. Whereas a PS3 is just doomed to stay on there. So I don't really look kindly on those.
Mafia 2, Fallout New Vegas, those are backwards compatible on Xbox and you can just buy them on PC as well. So what do you think, Judge Castle?
Yeah. I think my favorite of these is probably Splinter Cell Conviction, which for £1.50 is pretty good fun.
Good game.
Yes. I haven't replayed for a while, but I have the desire to go back and smash some people through toilet urinals and pianos and things. It had some good brutalizing in this game.
We should totally do a Splinter Cell episode when that remake they're doing breaks cover. That'd be a fun thing to do.
But the price is just too low to really take any offense. I do take your point about PS3 and as much as I'd like to chuck Courty Garvey window for some questionable film takes on the Discord, that isn't what we're here to do this again. Nothing is not fair as we've seen from the preceding two hours.
So, yeah, I'm willing to end this trial on a very undramatic note and just have a simple not guilty. I was trying to work out how I could mimic the end of Anatomy of a Fall, but it doesn't really work like that. It's hard to create that kind of ambiguity with Splinter Cell for £1.50.
I think we actually have slightly more guilty verdicts than innocent verdicts. Totten them up, Matthew. I think I count 12 innocent and I think 15 guilty.
So, bloodthirsty times for Judge Castle. I once again get killed, so I get pushed out the window, don't I? So I'll harm it myself when I get pushed to my death.
Ah, no. And that's me dead. And that's Games Court.
Ends on the flattest note we can possibly get.
Happy now?
Yeah. I should have reordered this so the wipeout one was last. That would have been a good one to end on.
But nonetheless, Matthew, I think that's pretty good. It didn't go on for too long. That's the important thing.
And I had quite a good time. What did you think?
Yeah, when we started this, the sun was out, so I didn't turn on the light and I'm now sitting in the dark.
Same, brother, same.
I'm sitting in the dark with my head inside a coffee table with some pillows.
The unholy glow of a monitor and no other light.
If anyone looked through my window, they would see my head in this box and my body occasionally dancing to five seconds of what only I can hear to be the tune from Anatomy of a Fool.
Amazing. So yeah, I hope you enjoyed that. Look forward to my spoken word cover versions of 50 Cent's classics coming soon on Ireland Records so you can look forward to that.
And the podcast is over. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I am at MrBasil UnderscorePesto on Twitter and I'm MrBasilPestoNo Underscore on Blue Sky.
Been waiting for some more of that exclusive content to no avail so far, but I still want to believe in Blue Sky. The podcast is Back Page Pod on both. I'm Samuel W Roberts on both as well.
If you'd like to follow us, keep up with the podcast, that sort of thing. And importantly, of course, if you'd like to support us financially, if you think this is good, and that's like what a question to ask, patreon.com/backpagepod, two additional podcasts a month and support the overall work that we're doing. Very grateful to everyone who backs us there.
There's a Discord you can drop sort of questions into as well. And you can email questions to BackPageGames at gmail.com. I will say actually, this is an open call for the next set of Games Court entries because we're not completely dry on them, but we are we are now quite low again.
So if you want to start sending them in, secondhand game purchases, have them rated by Judge Castle or possibly Judge Samuel Roberts, then we can do that. Matthew, let's get out of here.
