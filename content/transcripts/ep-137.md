Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
What have you been playing lately? Because I always get the sense you're like two steps ahead of me on games, and I thought you graduated from FF16 onto Diablo and maybe some other stuff. What's going on?
I'm still finishing FF16, but I've reached so many side quests. I've basically got side quests and the last mission, and I can't get over the side quest hump. So that's kind of a bit of a tough hang at the moment.
And I am trying to get into Diablo 4 just before it runs away from me completely, and they're talking about the sixth season of content or whatever, and I just go, fuck it. This is never for me. So that's kind of what I'm doing.
I'm actually going through a big reading phase at the moment. I'm reading every spare minute I have. I kind of went through an intense game phase, then a really intense film phase, specifically around Mission Impossible.
And now I'm in this intense book phase. So, but I'm really looking forward to doing the Mission Impossible episode. And I've been picking up little clues here and there of your opinions on the series from your, every once in a while, your tweets just sort of out of nowhere, weirdly like in the middle of the day, here's an opinion on Rogue Nation.
Well, that's only because I'm off for three days this week.
Oh, right, that explains it.
For the podcast listeners benefit or the XL tier listeners benefit, that's me dedicating my days off to making sure I've done my research for a podcast, basically playing old-ass PS3 games for this episode, a deeply cursed exercise, and then also watching Mission Impossible movies. I had previously seen one to four, and I hadn't seen five and six, and I'm going to see seven tomorrow during the day, so I'll have them all ticked off. But yeah, getting into it.
Rogue Nation seems to be one that divides people a little bit. Obviously, we'll talk about this on the episode, but I thought it was a step down from the imaginative set piece design from horny mega-brain Brad Bird, only saying horny because there is a Lea Seydoux-Paula Patton fight in that, which is, I would say, slightly horny for Mission Impossible. So there are clothes ripping.
You never see Tom Cruise's clothes rip when he has a fight in those films, you know what I mean? But yeah, anyway.
That's because he's just so covered in bruises and scars, like his body's just a horror show. That's the price of all those stunts. His face is fine, but his body is just like gnarly as fuck.
Yeah, OK, like a grim note to begin on there. So yes, we've talked about that fucking Mission Impossible like eight times now on this podcast.
That's because I'm excited about it.
I am too, actually. I'm slowly building the plan. And I'm excited to litigate Simon Pegg's role in those films with you, for example.
It's going to be a fun one.
I can't wait to talk about the Chinese actress who's like fifth in the credits in Rogue Nation, has one line in the film. What's it all about?
Oh, that's got big, we secured funding from Energy. Yeah, that's good. That is like such a 2015 thing to have in a movie.
So yeah, good times. Okay then, this episode, just to pull Matthew back down to earth with a thud, we're talking about The PlayStation 3. So we did the Xbox 360 draft.
I thought we should probably do the kind of reverse of that, the PS3 draft while we're in this subject area. I think, what is interesting about this episode, Matthew, and I don't know if you will agree with this. So obviously in these episodes, we try and pick the games that summarize the consoles.
In the 360s case, that meant all of the games that Microsoft Studios were responsible for, or Xbox Studios, whatever they were called back then. Microsoft Game Studios, I think that's what they were called. Then also the massive suite of multi-platform stuff that represented the 360 in our mind's eye on top of that.
So it was quite an undertaking. In retrospect, I wish we had 50 or 20 categories for that episode because there were just so many games we could have picked. But the PS3 by comparison, I don't know if you've approached your tentative selections this way.
It's a much narrower field and defining the PS3 is not really about that multi-platform experience, because this is simply where I don't think most people were really experiencing multi-platform games. At least, anecdotally, it felt that way to me. Do you think that's fair for this episode?
Yeah, that's absolutely true. There are so many of these games. Actually, looking at them, I was hit with surprise that they are on PS3, because in my head, they are so 360 games.
Even though I know them to be multi-platform games, there's a little bit of like, oh yeah, I guess that was on there. And just like the tech difference between the two and the fact that PS3 versions were often sort of troubled, the thing I didn't get is that, given all that, is how the hell did PS3 sell more than the 360?
Yeah, I think there's one very simple reason for that is my understanding is that Sony has a level of like market dominance in Europe, and I don't mean just the UK, I mean all of Europe, where they are basically impossible to dismount from their place there. My understanding is that during the PS1, PS2 eras, they became so prevalent in Europe in a way that other games companies were not that they just have a massive stranglehold on that market basically. It would take catastrophic failure for them to lose that, and whereas in North America, I think it's a lot more even and Xbox is like, Xbox has the potential to rival them or has the same similar level of brand recognition.
So I think that might be why. But it was a slow burn. I think the 360 was in front for a long time, obviously launched a year earlier in 2005.
PS3 was 2006 in the US and Japan and then 2007 in Europe. But yeah, it did eventually overtake it by a little bit, but that was just a massive obviously turnaround from the PS2 generation where the PS2 sold more than 100 million on Xbox. I think it sold something like 30 to 40 million, somewhere in that range.
So it really was like a shifting tide.
Thank you for filling me in.
No worries. Which games that have interest were the ones that surprised you that they were on PS3 as well as 360?
I guess, can I think of any particular examples?
Oblivion or Bioshock, those kind of games?
Yeah, those kind of things. Yeah, just like the big hitters. They were just so associated with Xbox and whether that was because they were shown off at the Xbox conference or they had exclusive DLC or even like, obviously, I know all the Rockstar games were on PS3, but a lot of those games from that generation for Rockstar, I do think of as 360 games primarily.
Apart from like, maybe there's a couple where I'm like, is LA. Noir more of a PS3 game?
Well, I did have it on PS3 and it ran perfectly fine. But a couple of Rockstar games did miss PS3, like Rockstar Table Tennis, the best Rockstar game of course, Matthew. If you ask about 100 contrarians on the Internet in various message boards.
Also, Bully Scholarship Edition, the very nice and enhanced 360 version they did for that, which is the one you can play on Xbox One and Series X. Now, it wasn't on PS3. So, there's an argument there that they had more presence on 360.
Yeah, it's very hard to pin down, but there's a certain games have the feel of one console or the other. For whatever reason, Mirror's Edge feels more PlayStation.
No, I don't think so.
You don't think so?
No, I think it did have maybe some kind of exclusive DLC map or something like that.
But I just think even the visual style of that game, it's a bit more like arch and unknowable. And that to me is very PS3.
Well, to me it comes, and to me it more comes down to a country of art.
I loved how you just screamed completely.
I won't even engage you on this.
No, no, no, that's fine.
No, no, I mean, that's not what I'm saying. I think that's a perfectly fair argument to make. But I think the games where I thought PS3 profile, Japanese games basically.
Like I think that for the most part, not in all cases because Bayonetta had a famously terrible version on PS3. But I think that when it came to things like RPGs, like Final Fantasy XIII is firmly a PS3 game, even though the 360 version of that is now arguably the best version on Xbox, because of backwards compatibility. But certainly the history of Final Fantasy, like Death May Cry 4, for example, those kind of games in my head slot into PS3 sort of games, but not DMC.
See, it's arbitrary. It's like, it's no, there's no science behind it. It's just gut feel, pure gut feel.
That's what I'm saying. When I look at her from Mirror's Edge, something in my head goes PS3.
Does it go PS3 Slim or PS, fat PS3 with Spider-Man 3 font?
It goes fat PS3 with like the gloss. It has to have that, it like reflects like the skyscrapers in Mirror's Edge.
Yeah, as long as no one's put their fingers on it and smudged it with fingerprints, basically, which is...
Faith is more likely to have a level where she's climbing up a PS3 than a level where she's climbing up a 360.
I mean, that is a really good observation. See, that is the kind of like, not quite science, but like interesting gut feel that I can get on board with. Oh dear.
Absolute bullshit.
Definitely, yeah. So it's going to be a weird one. Trying to justify the few multi-platform games that we do put into our list of 10 games each.
I also do firmly want to resurrect the idea that we're building mini consoles here, Matthew, because I think that's more interesting with the PS3. That stimulates me more as an idea than it did with 360, where it was just too massive for me to even think about there being like 10 consoles that represent what, you know, 10 games that represent what that console is. On PS3, it's pretty doable.
Also, this console feels locked away in ways that the 360 doesn't. So, you know, I would actually like probably buy a PS3 Mini if you released it with the right games.
Yeah, I can't think of an electronic product that's less likely to come out with a PS3 Mini. Like, this feels like something that Sony would not necessarily rather forget because a lot of these games are accessible via cloud streaming or whatever if that's your sort of thing. But there's also like, you know, a lot of the best stuff has been salvaged onto PS4 as well.
That's the interesting thing. So a lot of like them, you know, the best games have shiny versions, but not all of them, like you suggest there, Matthew.
They should release a more expensive PS3 Mini, which has a few PS2 games on it. And then a few months later, release a version which doesn't have the PS2 version games on it.
Yeah, the 40 gigabyte model downgrade edition. Yeah, very good, Matthew. How is you getting on with your old Sega Mega Drive Mini 2, by the way?
Is that treating you well in 2023?
It loves its home inside the box.
I'd be tempted to buy that off you, but I think if you sold that on eBay, you'd get like 200 quid for it.
I will play it eventually. The really shocking one is the... I bought an Amiga Mini, which hasn't got much use either.
Yeah, I keep looking...
They got me on the nostalgia thing. Like, I saw it and I was suddenly whisked back to playing, you know, Monkey Island or whatever in my bedroom as a 12 year old. And then I got the box and then looked at it and thought, do I want to plug it in?
Yeah, flashing back to the boys across the river and the tragic day when one of them drowned. No, Bobby, don't go in that river! This is a very strange expression of yours.
Yeah, is this a running joke of mine that you have repressed the memories of a boy drowning? It'll turn out that you did it or something, like the end of an anthology episode. Oh my God, we're 13 minutes in.
That's where we go true crime.
Yeah, that'd be a good pivot for us, I think, in 2024. Gaming-related crimes, that's what Gamescore is, isn't it? To be honest, so we've kind of already done that.
We should probably give it out of that.
Yeah.
That's what the list is like.
There's no future in that. The list does fucking love Gamescore. It's us who don't like Gamescore.
Everyone else is having a great time. Okay then, so Matthew, to get into our pre-agreed episode plan, finally, 13 minutes in, although I think there was some good, sort of nourishing chat in amidst that to review my own podcast yet again. So, at a moment of big change in our living rooms, the arrival of HDTVs, the moment before internet TV really existed and when physical media was in flux, the PS3 tried to be the centre of our living rooms.
Why was that pitch doomed? And why is it always doomed as a video game's console proposition? Because the Xbox One would follow a similar playbook.
Yeah, it's hard to say. For people more generally, I wonder if people struggle to uncouple the idea of a games console and how frivolous they may be finding a games console from the other uses the machine has that might speak to them. Like, the idea that my parents would ever buy a games console as a Blu-ray player is completely daft.
And at the other end of the scale, I think if you put all that aside, I don't know, I just think if you were really invested, if you really care about this stuff, you probably still buy the individual technologies that give you each of those experiences the best, rather than settle for a thing which is kind of fine in the middle, is my guess.
Yeah, I think that is interesting. Yeah, I think at that time in particular as well, people weren't necessarily, we weren't in the smartphone era, so it was before the era where one device kind of did everything. Obviously now you have streaming services built into your TV and all that and maybe even game streaming in the case of Xbox on some TVs as well.
So certainly it was a different era and you did have more devices for your various stuff, so perhaps it was against the grain there. What really surprised me about the PS3 pitch, right, is I was watching the E3 2005 conference today. I mean, so dry and not very interesting and had much more the tone actually of a GDC talk.
It was about raw technical stuff, but without even the colour that you would get from a GDC talk of someone trying to make it sound interesting.
They didn't even bring out colourful Mark Cerny to talk about.
Well, no, Mark Cerny is like... We are talking about PowerPoint slides with graphs on them and that sort of stuff. But what struck me is, I always thought the pitch of the PS3 was, this is the future of home entertainment and it's games console, it's a Blu-ray player, it's all this other stuff.
And that was part of the pitch of it. But I forgot that the whole thing with the cell processor was that it was like, we're changing the way computing is going to work. And this thing is so powerful, it can do X, Y and Z.
And I'd forgotten about that part of the pitch and I was watching this quite boring E3 conference where Phil Harrison was showing off all of these leaves and how the sound can be individually simulated because of the cell processor or something like that. Then there was a bit where ever so slightly cursed-looking Alfred Molina, recreated from Spider-Man 2, was on screen, again, brought to life by the technology behind the PS3 and this sort of stuff. And I think they really did think that it was like, this thing is going to change the world and games, this is where it starts and then soon this will be kind of everywhere.
I think that was actually a little bit of the mentality behind the PS3.
How was the Melina?
He was not too bad. He didn't even really look as good as he would look in PS3 cutscenes at that time. He was fine.
There's a funny bit where Phil Harrison goes, sadly Alfred's not able to join us on stage today, but we can show you what it would look like if he was here. And then they showed the simulation but in the room they're in with the same lighting and stuff. And I was like, this is so of its time.
Do you remember when they showed off that PS5? They did that showcase during lockdown. It was like the big, this is what PS5 is all about.
And there was all that speculation that all the people were rendered by PS5.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Because they all had a slightly otherworldly air to them.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was odd. But they at least talked about the specs and stuff at GDC, which was the right setting for it.
What's weird about this is that their pitch is like, this is around the era, we talked about this before, where E3 transitions from becoming like a business show to something like resembling entertainment and something public facing. And this is right at the cusp of that, and it is not a public facing presentation. It's so sort of like dry and corporate.
And then the 2006 one, which had the famous giant crabs sort of meme, and also the Metal Gear Solid 4 sort of like trailer with Old Snake and all that stuff. And that was the proper sort of like what you will have in your home's pitch. That was again quite dry and had the big shocker of how expensive it was, 5.99 in North America, which was astronomical at the time.
That is a little bit better, but again, E3 conferences would change so much over the years. And by the time you get to the end of that decade, they've become like, you know, they're trying to be entertaining. They're getting like their fake exec, Kevin Butler, who we've litigated on this podcast before, to try and sell the games and stuff.
And it's funny because I think the entire journey of the PS3 is about pivoting from that initial pitch of it's the everything machine to it's a goddamn games console, please buy it. And I think that's the kind of journey that it goes on. I think it does get there, but it has a lot of growing pains along the way.
Do you think that's a kind of fair assessment, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, and definitely the end destination. You know, basically everyone realizes that just going, we like games gets you so much goodwill that you basically win every time.
Exactly. Yeah. And now no one will ever pitch another games console any other way, because, you know, we've been able to see very publicly how this has failed twice as a pitch.
And so it's not going to happen again. Or if it does happen, it'll be because someone had too good a generation and then thought we can do everything. So this will be the machine.
This will be the metaverse machine or whatever. And it just never rings true.
One funny thing. I did turn on a PS3 today this afternoon. Just to have a look at its menu and stuff.
Because I'd kind of forgotten what it was. Actually, its menu is what I remembered the PS4 menu being. So I was kind of completely a generation out.
But this idea of it being an everything machine and then the fact that you turn it on and it plays like a bit of violins warming up and then shows you like loads of mystical particles and like a weird wave on screen. Like it's a very strange, mysterious machine for something which is meant to be this all encompassing experience. I've forgotten how odd it was.
It's quite beautiful, but it's odd.
It is, yeah. But the thing I try and keep in mind with the PS3 is even though it was like a strange multimedia pitch, and like an extravagant electronic item, Apple has sold like more extravagant nonsense than this. Like having a smartwatch is more nonsensical than the PS3, I think, as a pitch.
And people buy it anyway, because it's all about marketing.
But the year difference, the time difference, like when Apple Watch becomes a thing, people are like ready for bullshit and ready to be rinsed. Like we'd already at that point become the generation that would spend 400 quid every year on a phone, you know?
Right, yeah. And so yeah, it's interesting anyway, just to kind of look back on it and just how it just wasn't the right thing for the moment. As I said on that 360 episode, it felt like the PS3 was a pitch that could not be, it could not be compromised for that moment, that Sony just would not compromise it.
And it's totally engaged with what the consumers wanted until they got deeper into the generation. Whereas the 360 was the exact right console for the moment in terms of its usability, how easy it was to develop for the games they had from the off. Like it was just, you know, it was an absolute clear victory in the first part of that generation for sure.
So Matthew, to get more into our relationship with the PlayStation 3, like what was your sort of journey with this console? Because I know you got one a little bit later. And how do you think the PS3 is remembered now in retrospect?
I mean, a lot of how it's remembered now is coloured by how we talk about it on this podcast, which is this slightly sort of weird disaster machine that somehow like outsold the 360. At the time, I mean, a lot of my experience at the time is coloured by working at Future and 360, but having won, you know, the hearts and minds of that group of people, you know, like the fact that all the, well, not all of them, but most of the PSN3 boys were playing 360 in the evening was just an indication to me of like, well, you know, PS3 is literally just their job. It's not their passion.
I imagine that's the same for everyone. Like I didn't get one just because it didn't have any kind of credit in the office. I only got one when the credit finally broke through, which was Uncharted 2.
You know, I remember just seeing that and going, I just have to have a console to play that. I know I did not own many PS3 games in my time of owning it. I had a, I got a PS3 Slim for Christmas.
It's the last console I got for Christmas, I think, which is always a treat, especially when you're like fucking 27 or whatever older I was, 26, 25. Getting that is like, you're like, this is awesome. But also you're like, I'm like, it's so, it's so dumb that I've asked for this from grownups.
And oh, the mad thing that it didn't come with the right cable. It didn't come with an HDMI cable.
Oh, right. Is that true?
Yeah, that generation didn't. You had to buy it separately. It always came with one of those fucking matte splitter cables.
It's the worst thing about this generation is that I then had to go and buy one from like fucking, you know, Curries or PC World. When it was open on Boxing Day, I had to go in to buy a fucking cable so I could actually see my game in more than 480.
Yeah, this is the days as well when they would rinse you for a HDMI cable.
Like, gold plating.
25 quid. Motherfuckers. That was like everywhere.
Honestly, the best thing that ever happened to games is the next generation when they were like, it comes with an HDMI cable, and you're like, that's better than anything else about this machine. So, yeah, I got it and I loved the few exclusives that I played on it. You know, it was pretty much just a naughty dog machine for me and Metal Gear Solid 4, and I played GTA V on there.
I can't remember why. Did it maybe run slightly better on PS3?
I don't think so. I think it was about the same on both, I think, basically, by that point.
For whatever reason, that happened. Yeah, so, you know, that's why, like, genuinely, you know, it may be anecdotal, but in my world, it wasn't a big thing. That's why I always find that sales figure, like, absolutely baffling.
I'm like, that just does not reflect the reality of definitely, you know, bath in 2010.
No, nor Bournemouth, you know, because obviously that's where I was covering this. And I had just started in Games Media on March 26th. I think that was the week that the...
2007, which was the week the PS3 launched in Europe. So, you know, that very start of the generation, like, I think God of War 2 was in the previous issue to the one I worked on. So that very much seemed like the end of the PS2 generation.
And then the PS3 generation was here. One of those big what-if scenarios in my head is what if they just put God of War 2 on that console as a launch game? Like, what a difference that might have made from day one.
But, you know, I suppose it was probably a lot cheaper and faster to develop it for PS2. So fair enough. And it's a stone cold classic, as we discussed before.
But, yeah, so it was weird because it did actually seem pretty impressive at first because it came with Motor Storm and Resistance Fall of Man, which were two pretty impressive titles. Motor Storm, particularly on the visual side, looked really, really fucking good when you saw the mud trails in Monument Valley left behind by all of these, like, you know, big wheel cars and lorries and jeeps and shit and crashing into each other and all this lovely damage going on. Just a really fun arcade kind of style racer.
And, like, it was the first game I played when I had my first interview on Play Magazine, and I just couldn't believe how nice it looked. And so I was pretty smitten with it. And it did sell well at first because it launched in Europe, and I think at the time it was the best-selling console launch ever.
But then sales died almost immediately, and they struggled to find momentum with it until they started paring down the hardware, stripping bits out of it so they could sell it a bit more cheaply. And it went from this device that was, like, 425 to something you could get, like, 300 quid plus. I think it was, like, maybe 350 for a while, then a little bit cheaper than that.
By the time you got one, probably. So, yeah, maybe it was 299 by the time you got one, Matthew, around that sort of, like, range.
I thought it would be Ghost to ask Father Christmas.
Yeah, fair enough. So, yeah, and it was a weird one, and it had such a, like, such a tough start, because I think one of the big things about PlayStation that people might not agree with, but I personally think it takes until this generation, it happens during this generation, that they actually get really good at internal games development. And, like, you can look back at PS2 and PS1, and you can say that, you know, Santa Monica making God of War, although that was a little bit later in the PS2 generation, or, like, obviously the Gran Turismo series, that these were, like, you know, these were really good first-party games, and they were.
But, generally speaking, it was like, it was like this generation is the time where it became, okay, all of your internal developers have to be making the hottest shit, the most amazing stuff, in order to get ahead, and if you're not, you're going to be behind. And it felt like Microsoft set the pace on that, and then Sony couldn't quite keep up in those early years, and that the stuff that they had was maybe underpowered in a way that would have been fine during the PS2 generation, where there were plenty of games like Primal or Ghost Hunter, or Dropship, which were fine. They were fine, PS2 games, but they didn't need to sell the console, because GTA 3 would sell the console.
So they were just sort of there. You could go and buy them and play them. But here it was like, we need games like Lair and Heavenly Sword and Haze to sell this console in the early part of this cycle.
And it felt like that ball game just changed quite quickly, and then it suddenly seemed like that was actually the beating heart of what was selling these consoles. Do you think that's a fair assessment, Matthew? Do you think this stuff, we just thought less about what Sony and Microsoft were making internally during the PS2 generation, and it just seemed to matter more when it got to this era?
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know, it's tricky, because being a Nintendo guy where first-party game is the only game in town, so it's kind of tricky to unpick. I definitely sort of see where you're coming from.
Like, in my head, the narrative was actually like, they made loads of good first-party games on PS2, but actually maybe that isn't true, and maybe things only find their feet a little bit later on PS3. I still think PS3, like, a lot of their first-party stuff outside of Naughty Dog really doesn't do it for me. It feels a little like old hat or old fashioned, and almost it's where this now current obsession where everyone basically makes Naughty Dog games for Sony kind of comes from.
Like, just a formula that's so successful and so winning that that just becomes the thing that they do now. Like, over-the-shoulder third-person action games. But I don't know, in truth I probably wasn't keeping a close enough eye on, you know, the individual ups and downs to make that call.
Well, I think that it was like they were, you know, the core genres at the time that would sell hardware were like, you know, racing games and first-person shooters, right? And so it made sense that Sony...
And open-world games.
Yeah, exactly. And it's interesting because obviously on Xbox they had Halo, which was the seller of that Xbox generation. Halo got people to buy Xboxes and then you had them, you had like Lionhead and you had Forza spinning up and Project Gotham.
So, you know, they had all this stuff. They had a pretty robust first-party lineup before you got to the 360 era. Yeah, and so Sony were kind of, it felt like Sony were keeping up with that.
They had, you know, they already had Gran Turismo, obviously, but they had like MotorStorm here. Resistance was very much like, we need another alternative to Halo that's not just Killzone, but we're going to have both. We're going to have like, you know, Killzone and Resistance alternating to try and like get us some first-person sort of like credibility.
So there was that sort of happening as well. They didn't have open world games, really. That was like definitely a PS4 era concern.
And indeed, they were completely retooled Guerrilla Games to be able to make open world games. It became a completely different studio with a completely different discipline, basically. So, yeah, it's weird.
It's just, yeah. So I actually, I felt like the PS3 actually is an inverse, I think, to the 360 in some ways, Matthew. I think it gets stronger as it goes, whereas I think the 360 becomes so distracted by Kinect and that whole Don Matric business that they, all of their best games are kind of front-loaded in that generation, with a couple of exceptions.
Whereas here, the PS3 is sort of kicking until the end, and you actually get past 2010 and there's still good stuff coming out. Do you think that's kind of fair as an assessment?
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. You know, there's definitely a kind of cockiness to the late years of 360. It's like when you've nailed the basics so completely, you're like, well, how do we move on?
How do we break into the new casual audience? And then actually in doing so, you lose sight of the people and they don't remain loyal is the tragedy. But, you know, that's happened a million times before.
Absolutely. So, Matthew, was the PS3 good? And what was your overriding impression of the library and planning for this episode?
I think it's got some absolutely amazing peaks, but I would say on the whole, I don't think it was that good. It's far from an all-timer in the way that I think the 360 is. Most of the games it had, the 360 did better.
And of its exclusives, there's only a very small handful that I'm genuinely bothered about, so, no.
OK, there's a man who's never played Bioshock Infinite with the PlayStation Move controllers. What a philistine. No, I think I have more affection for it than that, but that was another question I was going to ask you, though, really, was do you think we have something in our hearts that likes the underdog, Matthew?
Is it hard not to like kind of fail consoles, basically? Like, we did a Wii Hall of Fame, and I don't think any of us... I don't think any of us lied about, like...
I don't think we ever pretended it was an all-timer console, but there's something about it, you know?
But the PS3 doesn't even have the audacity to be a fail console. It is a success. It's more successful than the 360, which is more of a fail console just going on the numbers.
No, like, yeah, it's just such an unearned success in my eyes. And I know you've explained it very well, but I'm just going to keep repeating that I don't get it. Where the Wii U is like, it's just such a fucking car crash, and it's so weird, and it takes so many big swings.
And it happens, it's over so quickly as well.
Yeah, maybe I'd feel differently, like, if I'd been working on, you know, a PlayStation magazine, and had to deal with the idiosyncrasies of that machine a bit more close up, you know, like, I never did Home or anything like that. And, like, maybe there's some, like, some sort of demented energy to that, which puts it in a similar Wii U territory. But I don't know, to my eyes, it was just, it was sort of fine.
Like, I'd hoped for a machine which was a bit more like its interface, you know, a bit more sort of strange and wispy and unknowable, but it's actually, like, quite well behaved. There's nothing too shocking about it. Like, its library, I was kind of, like, outside of the multi-
you know, I basically put aside the multi-format stuff, and I was like, this isn't that interesting a library. You know, a few oddities from, like, Japan Studios aside, which is like, you know, a side which is a side of the company which has been sort of strangled and now kind of removed entirely, which is a shame, but yeah, it's not that zany.
No, I think there's, like, there are some, there are some, like, hidden treats in there for sure, particularly on, like, the PSN side and slightly oddball Japanese side as well. I think that does exist, but I don't necessarily think adds up to that much. I think that when it comes to the big hitters, they are pretty self-evident what they are.
And then a few interesting things happen alongside that. But I don't want you to mistake me for thinking this console is, like, amazing. I think it's, like, flawed and interesting.
That's what it is. It's flawed and interesting. And it's, like, it's not a failure.
It's only a failure in the context of, like, PlayStation, which is such an incredibly successful brand, you know? And so it's just, it's the only blip for them, really, unless you count the, you know, obviously the PS Vita as well. But certainly on the home console front, they smashed it out of the park every single time.
This is the one time they didn't. And so it's just an intro, it's just endlessly interesting to me to dissect why that was and what the successes and failures were, you know?
I think you've thought about this console a lot more than I have. Like, I've got very much a punters relationship with it. And, you know, I hadn't really thought too much about it in any great detail until, like, literally last night where I played a very cursed selection of games streaming through my PS5 because I don't have a PS3 to test out.
So, you know, when you find yourself at 10pm on a Monday night playing five minutes of a streamed version of Trash Panic and you're like, what is going on in my life?
Is this worth it? Do I need to close this whole podcast down?
What is that game about?
I've not played that one, actually.
It's like Tetris, except you just smash a load of shit up in a bin. I just didn't get it. It literally seems that you scored by smashing light bulbs.
So everything was just turning into a mess of particle physics at the bottom of this bin. I was like, I just don't understand this. It's kind of up there with that baffling PlayStation Fireworks game.
It's just puzzlers I will never truly understand.
Oh, well, FantaVision. Oh, fair enough. Yeah, so did that get like a VR version of something?
Yeah, I played that recently on PSVR2 and was like... Because I thought all fireworks, that would be exciting and it is not.
Well, actually, I think that if you look at the PS2 launch lineup, that backs up my point about how internal development was not, you know, the forefront of that generation because that is like a... And kind of an all-timer week lineup. It's interesting games in there, but they are like, you know, there's not a Halo in there.
And, you know, I think Halo being a launch title definitely changes the game on that front a little bit. So they have to have that.
Did it have Kessin?
I think it might have done. It maybe had, like, the first Tekken Tag Tournament and...
There was definitely a Stern general looking out from one of those boxes.
So, yeah, it was maybe original TimeSplitters might have been a launch era anyway. I can't remember the PS2. We're not talking about PS2 anyway.
But I suppose, like, yeah, to me, though, you know, covering it at the time, what I found fascinating about it was how unlovable it was. Because the PS2 to me seemed incredibly easy to love. It just had such a vast array of titles.
It had that lovely relaxing, like, blue light spinning around your screen, you know, the browser screen and all that stuff. And your little memory card icons that would be animated and change when they're deleted. And, you know, it just had, like, a bit of personality, a lot of Sony call to it and that sort of thing.
It didn't think too much of itself. It was also, you know, a great DVD player. It was just, like, a real, like, a great companion over the years with so much amazing stuff.
The PS3, it felt arrogant. Like, the X and B and, like, like you say, what might come across as sort of, like, you know, a bit, sort of, like, odd and strange. It felt like, oh, well, we've made something really special here.
And it's not wrong to have that pride in it, really. It's not that different from the PS5 experience turning that on. It feels like you've got a premium thing when you're using the PS5.
It's the Lydia Tarr of interfaces.
Well, that's the thing. It's just quite cold. There's little, like, ticks that it does.
And it's just... Basically, the PS4 is, like, the warmer version of that PS3 interface. That's what they did.
They just, like, warmed it up a little bit. Made it a bit more personality-led, a bit softer, a bit kinder, I guess. But, Matthew, with that in mind, like, the fact that I didn't think it was that lovable, I wanted to catalogue some of its blunders before I get to the draft.
So, I've got, like, a list of wrongs and rights here. I'll be honest, the wrongs this is longer than the rights one by quite some distance. Just stop me if you want to discuss any of this, Matthew.
The pricing, very expensive, of course. Although, by today's standards, it actually doesn't seem that bad. 425 launched here.
599 in America, though, was where it was, like, a killer price. But this is obviously in the pre-Brexit days before we decided to crash our currency on purpose. But, you know, what can you do?
What about 599 if it launched alongside Uncharted 2?
Yeah, well, that is the question, isn't it? Or, indeed, like God of War 2, does that make a difference?
The right game, would that be enough for you to go, I have to play that?
I think at that time, it just had to be a bit less. So I think now people are more accustomed to paying over the odds for their electronics, you know what I mean? And just having, like you say, fancy phones and that sort of stuff.
So I think we've become more acclimatised. 599, though, that was just too bitter a pill to swallow at the time. The fact it was hard to develop for.
This is more like anecdotal, but a lot of people complained about it. I think Valve even famously complained about the PS3 architecture and like how it was just quite difficult to make games for. And then they did eventually kind of like crack it, Valve.
They obviously supported poor too. You could play that on PS3 with someone playing on PC. That was like a whole thing.
I wonder if anyone actually did that. They launched the console without vibration in the controllers, which was a terrible decision. Yep, they had to, like they added it later.
There was something like they'd lost a patent for it or you had to pay for it or something like that. So you just had these like very light feeling controllers with no rumble in them. What a bummer that was.
So that fell off. Six Axis, which is a motion control where, as the name suggests, it like basically can move in six different ways or something. And it was an obviously like them trying to like keep up with the Wii and have some kind of motion control compatibility.
A really poor decision that was only really used well in about one or two games. I'm sure they'll come up in this episode. So that felt like a disaster.
They even tried to like move on from that and just forget about it by the later part of the generation. The overload of hardware add-ons that no one wanted. PlayStation TV.
Although I quite like that one, actually. I used to record films onto my PS3's hard drive. Pretty decent.
PS Move, their version of the of like the Kinect basically, where you had to have like a camera and two controllers.
That was fucking gross, that thing. I had one of those.
But it did work. It did work. That's the thing.
It did work, but like the faff of like the camera and the fit, like compare. Yeah.
Compared to the all-in-one thing of like the all-in-one pitch of like, you know, of the Kinect. It wasn't, it was pretty weak source for sure. Wonder Book, which was like a book you abused with your camera and then it brought stories to life or something.
I don't know. PlayStation 8 obviously still had a camera, it's funny how cameras aren't really part of the equation with games as much now unless you're like obviously streaming. SingStar, which they forced into the XMB.
You had to look at the fucking SingStar button in your games tab even if you never play SingStar. Terrible decision. That might have been Europe only that, but terrible.
Trophies arriving long after launch because they knew they needed something to compete with achievements, but it was late by the time it arrived, that was dumb. The loss of GTA exclusivity. If they had secured that, they would have won the generation.
There were rumours that they could have done that and then failed to do so on the Japan side. That was a rumour. I don't know if that's true or not, but the early punts on games that did not bear fruit.
So Lair, Haze, Heavenly Sword, although I have some affection for one of those, which will make up later in this episode. Getting rid of HD output PS2 games compatibility just to save production costs. This is an absolute dream machine for playing PS2 games because it would play them at 1080p.
They looked fantastic, and then they got rid of it to make the PS3 cheaper. An absolute tragedy, and there's never been another way to play PS2 games, that many PS2 games in HD. What a shame.
And if you did want to copy save some past generations to the console, you needed some kind of adapter that plugged into your memory card. Absolute nightmare. I borrowed one from Sony, but I don't know if they ever sold them here.
PlayStation Home, their second life thing, just not good. Although some people have been trying to resurrect it, I read recently. I don't want anything to do with that shit.
The poor online experience versus how smooth it is now on PS5. Famously, they didn't charge for online play like Microsoft did, but maybe they should have done because when they did on PS4, it got a lot better. The onslaught of awful updates.
Now you had to boot the games to even download them. These are the days before they just automatically download updates for you and then install them. So PS3 was way worse than the 360 for this.
There were games that needed tens of gigabytes just to run on PS3 when they didn't need jack shit to run on 360 because obviously that console didn't require a hard drive. It was an optional thing.
It did give us the incredible installation screens for Metal Gear Solid though.
That's true. That is the only good result from that, I would say. Just today, actually, when I booted up a couple of games, you had to wait for the game to start and then in the middle of the game there would be an install screen.
And then it would have to update the game from inside the game again with all the stuff they'd added post-launch. And I was like, this is so bad.
Awful.
So those are the blunders, Matthew. It's not on a substantial list. Any more thoughts on those?
Yeah, I mean, it's going to take some real pros to balance that lot out.
What I did right. Naughty Dog are the clear champions of the generation. They are the developers who made these sort of platforming icons that help to sell the PlayStation, whether you consider them icons or not.
That's up to you, Matthew. Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter, people did buy PlayStation consoles to play those games. I think they were pretty competent and technically up there for what PlayStation games were capable of at the time, so they were significant.
But when you get to the PS3 generation, they transition into kind of like adult blockbuster storytelling, basically, out of the more kiddy mascot territory. Certainly building on some of their strengths, but doing these high-end cutscenes and amazing set pieces and extraordinary graphics. It was like a level of...
It was like the studio kind of maturing to something else, I guess, and it just crowned them as champions to me.
Do you think they could ever go back? Or once you've rendered a person stabbing a dog to death, can you not make a Jack and Daxter ever again?
Well, I feel like they just didn't have the appetite for it. And it feels like, superficially, the arc seems to be, we went from making kiddie games to the most grim adult games, and that was maybe a reflection of their sensibilities evolving over time, and maybe they don't have the capacity for something really wacky and fun like that now. Maybe they are the last of a studio and that's it.
I certainly would hope they could go back to making something as light on its feet as Uncharted, you know? Even with Uncharted 4, they were able to scratch that edge incredibly well, and there's still an appetite for the quip-happy third-person shooters and stuff, but the way that they did that in Uncharted was so influential in terms of video game storytelling and how blockbuster games could evolve from this point. So whatever else happens on PS3, they kind of come of age, right Matthew?
They are a significant part of this. So yeah, they did eventually start porting PS2 games to PS3, and they did a really nice job of that. They were better at this than Microsoft, I would say.
They got more of their games on there, and some of them were really, some of them were really, really nice. We will reflect that in the draft, as we'll discuss shortly. It was still the de facto home of Japanese games.
It was still where, you know, like pretty much all of them launched, pretty much. There's some exceptions, like Dead Rising was only on, and Dead Rising was only on 360. There was a very bad Port of Lost Planet on PS3, but generally speaking, you still got Japanese publishers putting their stuff on this console, so it was key in that respect.
It still ran PS1 games, no matter which version of the console you had. I always thought that was a cool little benefit of the PS3. Just put it in your old disc.
It would at least play those, even if it wouldn't play PS2, which is more enticing. If you were in Europe, it was easy to access PS1 treats that never released here. You could get a US PSN account, go buy Parasite Eve or Xenogears or Shin Megami Tensei games or whatever you want, fill your boots.
It was easy enough to do that, which I thought was a cool thing, even if it was not technically supported by Sony. And the PSN games were genuinely distinctive. I discussed this on the 360 episode, but XBLA versus PSN.
That was a battleground for a while. It was about getting cool digital games out there. So there are some definite pros in there, Matthew, but many flaws.
Any thoughts on the pros?
Yeah, I mean, I didn't actually know that about the PS1 games playing. No matter what. So that's news to me.
Okay, yeah, cool.
Sorry, we were hoping I was going to talk for longer so you could have a nice drink.
Yeah, I was having a nice little swig there from my pint of water.
And you thought I would talk for at least 30 seconds. I've given him loads to think about that. But no, he throws it back in my face and just goes, Hmm, PS1 games, that sounds nice.
I was there thinking, I've been talking for six minutes. Matthew might like a chance to talk. And it's like, nope, he's good.
So I'm good dog, let's move on. Yeah, okay, so the difference is Matthew, you've been at work today and I've been off. So I've just been like sat here pondering this shit all day.
So I'm just bursting with energy and you are a husk of a man. So it's... So, okay, last question Matthew before we get to the draft.
So we'll leave plenty of time for it so we can discuss our games in detail. Is there any argument that what happens during the PS3 generation in terms of games sets up Sony for the generation to come on PS4 where they do thrive and Microsoft falls behind?
I mean only in terms of like shame, you know, and wanting to avoid that shame again, you know, failure is a great motivator, I guess. But it's not failure, but an artistic failure. Not really, like, you know, PS4 I think is a great machine, ends up having like an incredibly rich library, probably the best library of that generation.
But I still think it takes a few years for that to find its first party fit. I don't think like there are, if we're just talking specifically about the games here, you know, I don't think the learnings from PS3 are there from the off. I think it takes them quite a long time for that generation to kick in.
Maybe you disagree, I don't know.
No, I think I do agree with that. I think the pain happens here so they can course correct later.
I think the things with PS4, in my mind, I know some people like Infamous and what Sucker Punch did with that, but like Tsushima feels like a big step up and finally feels more like next-gen from them in a way that like Infamous has always felt like a very shiny kind of PS2 game. It's like philosophy. It's not that dissimilar to, you know, Spider-Man 2s on PS2 or your Hulk Ultimate Destructions.
You know, there's a fundamental like crudeness to it, which they finally shake off in PS4. And I think a lot of studios go through that. They kind of get over the kind of hang ups of those earlier genres.
And I think PS3 like is kind of a weird muddle ground. It's got a lot of shiny versions of PS2 ideas.
Yeah, I think, I don't know if I agree about Infamous as such, because you kind of like, you know, really, what is that different between, you know, Infamous connects to modern Spider-Man games as well. They're just open world superhero games basically. That is a genre that definitely kicks off on PS2, but you know, Crackdown is of the same ilk.
I think Crackdown is better than Infamous. But you know, the first Infamous was quite rough. The second one was a lot better.
The one on PS4 looked really nice. But I don't know, I suppose I do agree that there is a seeming maturing of these studios for them to make this. They go from making stuff that feels like quite, I guess slightly rougher blockbusters to mega polished take years blockbusters.
And that happens to everyone. Insomniac's Journey in this generation is really interesting, Matthew, because they go from making Ratchet and Clank and first person shooters to what's the first game they make in the next generation. It's Sunset Overdrive, right?
So they see change coming and they make that. And then Sunset Overdrive is, you know, arguably the jumping off point for the Spider-Man games too, right? So, yeah, I think everyone has that evolution moment and this generation's key in establishing who those big players are, who changes, you know, who changes the stuff they make to sort of like get to progress and who doesn't or who fades away, that sort of thing.
But I just think 360 gets to that evolution a little bit faster or people hit the ground running a bit more on 360. You know, Halo is shinier and more cutting edge in Halo 3 much faster than, you know, whatever its equivalents are on PlayStation.
Yeah, you know, and like I say, it's stood the test of time in a way that these PS3 games haven't necessarily. So, yeah, OK. On that slightly dour note, Matthew, shall we take a quick break and come back with our PS3 draft selections?
Yeah, it will be jollier, I promise.
Ha ha ha!
Welcome back to the podcast. So, this is the Draft Bits, where we pick our 10 games each that represent the PlayStation 3's lifespan. We are building mini consoles, as established, that represent what this console was actually about in its run from 2006 to roughly 2013 time, although the games keep coming out till 2016 and 17, I believe, Matthew.
It was, yeah, it kept going for quite a while there. So, yes, we have like, actually, no, it's not 10 games, it's 11 games, technically, because I've added a bonus category, so I'll establish that shortly. But to explain the draft, me and Matthew will competitively pick the games that represent the PS3 over a series of genres.
Once one game is picked by someone, the other person can't pick it, and then you will vote for the winner at Back Page Pod in the pinned tweet, assuming the owner of Twitter doesn't change those fucking poll rules in the time before this episode goes live. Hopefully not. And then we'll talk about the winner on a future episode.
So it's a competitive draft over 11 categories. Matthew, is there anything you want to say about your selection process before we read these categories out?
I'm gonna be honest and say some of the games that I might pick, I don't know if I'll get to pick them, I haven't played, but I feel like I know why they're important or that they should be on there. This isn't a very lived-in console for me. And I could have picked lots of multi-format stuff that I have played, but I've kind of tried to steer away for that, for the reasons outlined earlier, I don't think they represent the PS3 properly.
So, this may be one of my shakier drafts, kind of up there with the PC 90s draft.
You won that one though. Oh yeah, you didn't play TIE Fighter, but you took it anyway.
Yeah, and you had to basically explain to everyone why Red Alert was good for me.
Well, that's okay, because I think as long as one person has the expertise to explain the games, it's a nourishing podcast for the listener. If neither of us know what the game is, we'll be fucked basically. So, all I'm saying is, if you're gonna pick Trash Panic, Matthew, you better be fucking prepared to talk about it.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm not picking that. I'm not picking Trash Panic.
By the way, did you enjoy the joke categories I put on Twitter, Matthew?
I saw some people were hoping that we're gonna do those rather than the real categories.
Should I read those out, actually, just for the people who might not have seen it because they're no longer on Twitter? Yeah, so I basically, category one, unfortunate six-axis controls, two, resistance or kill zone, three, one of those six out of tens, four, defunct online vehicular combat game, five, runs better on 360, six, cursed peripheral required, seven, PSN game that only Samuel remembers, eight, has a superior PS4 version now, nine, platformer that Matthew hates, 10, Tokyo Jungle or Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots. So, some japes there, but we come to the real draft now, Matthew, so I'll just read out these categories.
Don't worry, listeners, I'll go over them once more before we start the draft. Category one, exclusive. So it's a game that doesn't have to have only come out on PS3, but has to have come out on PS3 before 360, basically.
That's the criteria. Category two, racing. People complained we didn't represent this genre very well in the 360 draft, which I think was actually quite fair.
So here it is. A bit more of... Well, that's true, isn't it, Matthew?
Yeah, well, there's a reason we didn't represent it. It's because I know fuck all about it. So you're not going to get a very nourishing category from me.
Good stuff. Category three, Naughty Dog. So a game made by that studio.
Represent their amazing contributions to PS3's library. Category four, shooter or platformer. This kind of like allows us to pick one thing from a crop of six or seven out of tens here to represent something on the PlayStation.
We'll see what comes out of that. Category five, PSN games. So a download game basically.
Category six, ill-advised six axis inclusion. A game that featured the six axis motion controls in some capacity. And ideally we can talk about what that inclusion is in the podcast, but I'm not going to hold Matthew to that because as established, he may not have played all the games he selected.
Category seven, RPG or action adventure. Category eight, wild card. So something a little bit odd and surprising or strange from the library.
Category nine, free pick. So anything you like. Category 10 has a superior PS4 version now.
This is to represent the fact that many of the PS3's greatest hits have been migrated over to PS4. Category 11, bonus category, HD collection. We wanted to represent something here of the cool ports of PS2 games that came to the PS3 because they definitely were a highlight of the Back Catalog.
Not all of them were great, but some of them were really good. This is where Bluepoint started doing their thing. Bluepoint would become obviously a Sony studio down the line.
So yeah, so significant in the history of PlayStation, I think nonetheless. OK, Matthew, any thoughts on those categories or should we jump into it?
No, I think they all make sense. One quick rule clarification, same as 360 Draft. Where do we stand on the orange box?
Oh, if you pick it for this draft, you are sowing the seeds of your own destruction because the orange box was famously terrible on PlayStation 3. So you can pick it if you want to, but it didn't run very well.
What was it going to? I just wanted to make sure. Because it's a way of getting a load of games at once.
It is, yeah. And I don't actually know if they all run badly, but I know that Half-Life 2 definitely did. So it was, yeah, it was famously not considered so good.
All right, then, so we got to do the select who goes first, Matthew, do you want to do the old coin toss?
Yeah, what would you like, heads or tails?
Heads.
Tails.
So Matthew, for the first time ever gets to decide whether to go first or second and third. Should we explain that, Matthew, that the second pick is, yeah, so whoever goes first, if Matthew wants to go first, he gets to pick one. If he goes second, he gets to pick two games and then it goes back to picking one at a time basically.
That's just to balance it out, keep it fair. So which one are you going to do, Matthew?
Oh my god, it's stressful. I don't want to go first and then pick something like dog shit and everyone's like, oh, he's instantly biffed it.
This is hard because I think there's only really five or six games that will probably swing the voting and then it's like a load of other stuff. So yeah, it's a tough one.
I'm not very good at the mind games because I always think, you know, you're trying to like wound the other player obviously, but you've proven quite unwoundable in the past or at least you play your card so close to your chest like I'd have no idea whether I've actually got under your skin. So it's kind of pointless doing it.
Yeah, I think also you maybe think I think about this more than I do. So you probably think I have like a priority list of picks or something. I don't have that.
I just have a load of games written next to each category and I'll pick one of them basically.
That's pick one of them.
That's how I roll. So but also it's your turn to win a draft. So I think the odds are in your favor, sir.
Two and three feel like they could be super valuable.
But one also gets you if there's one game that may be defined this era of PlayStation 3, you get off the board straight away.
I'm going to go first for exclusive. I'm going to take Metal Gear Solid 4.
Fair enough.
This is a game we joke about a lot on this podcast that it belongs to PS4. I feel like if you've got a PS4 mini console, it has to be on there. While I sort of disagree philosophically with allowing this out of its prison of the original PS3, having it on a PS3 mini is okay.
I can live with that. I don't think the weirdness of it's diminished. It's a game I think is okay.
I think it's quite an interesting stealth game for the first half with quite a rich sandbox and then switches into just the biggest Kojima lore dump fan service in the second half. Those two things will speak differently to different people, but just as a game of its time and a game which is definitively PS3, I think it's the solid first pick.
Yeah, so I would have picked this in my batch of two if it was me. I don't know if I would have picked it first, though. So yeah, it's such an unwieldy game.
If you played it now, I think you'd be surprised by how unpleasant it is in terms of how much it wastes your time with cutscenes and how the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay is not really good enough because the bits of game that are in there in those first two chapters in particular are really good like stealth sandboxes for, you know, for Kojima Productions sort of stealth action gameplay. You have the going through a war zone thing and, you know, there's loads, there's way more NPCs than there ever were in Metal Gear Solid 3 or 2. And so it does feel like you're going through like a war zone at times.
And the camouflage mechanic is amazing, like the technical execution of it.
Yeah, like it looks amazing. I don't know if it works as well as the camouflage did in MGS3 for whatever reason. That might just be because you don't have the jungle environment anymore.
But I do agree that that is definitely like to look at to see Snake take on the properties of the environments around him. That's really, really cool. So that's good.
And then it gets to the it's kind of falls off by the time you get to the third chapter. So there are some like a pretty amazing action sequences along the way to its finale of Snake and Ocelot beating the shit out of each other on top of a big boat or something.
It's got some good shit. Return to Shadow Moses. That's amazing.
It is. But there's just lots of little robots there now. It's like, you know, you get that first whiff of it and then you're like, oh yeah, this is like, it's cool to see the place, but it's a shame it's not filled with like dudes to kill like in the original Metal Gear Solid.
But I don't know, it's just in a desperate attempt to win the draft, I say, well, I actually preferred fighting a lot of balls with hands.
But your point is, you know, you got to summarize what the PlayStation 3 did, what its whole deal was and Metal Gear Solid 4 does that. And there's only, it's not on other platforms yet.
But yeah, I'd say the only downside with this is it maybe means more to this podcast than it does to most people. And, you know, its lack of other version or whatever maybe actually speaks to a slight irrelevance.
It's like, it's just, I mean, you know, it's been said, but MGS5 is the opposite of this, right? It's that it's all gameplay. And that's, and, you know, it's, and it's a more modern game as a result.
This is like the dying days of when people would tolerate ridiculously long cutscenes. And this put that, this stretched that to its limit, arguably, right, you know, right after, like, something like Bioshock came out, where its story was entirely delivered, you know, without cutscenes, basically. So it was like old thinking in games.
And then it just sort of like, there's nothing really like this again, from Kojima after this. It's just, you know, it's a complete one-off and it is a very indulgent bit of fan service. But I think it does sum up, you know, it does sum up the PS3 so well, because even though they did get it running on 360, apparently, behind the scenes at Kojima Productions, it was running fine.
They just didn't want to put the resources into porting it. So oh, no, that was it. There was too many discs to put on 360 because of because they were on DVDs rather than Blu-rays.
Right, right.
So, yeah, I think it's a good pick, Matthew. I think it would have been one of my first picks. So yeah, it's solid.
Well, I'm looking forward to a devastating one and two punch now for two and three.
Yeah. So, OK, so that first category is exclusive, isn't it? And if I've got something that's a bit daft or underpowered next to MGS4, people are just going to vote for you straight away.
So let's just go with exclusive category one, Uncharted 2 Among Thieves. So do I think this is the best Uncharted game on PlayStation 3? Not really, after replaying them several times in recent years.
But do I think it's got the best peaks of Uncharted on PS3? Absolutely. So at the time, there was just no comparison to this.
You had the first Uncharted, which was set in this jungle, this kind of Indiana Jones riff with a wise-cracking, handsome dude and his sidekick with a cigar, older guy, and then the love interest who was like a journalist who had been dragged along for the ride. And it was a really fun riff on a type of sort of adventure storyline that I think is always enjoyable when executed well. And it was executed incredibly well with really nice cutscenes and motion capture, fantastic breakthrough performance from Nolan North, of course, and that whole cast was fantastic.
And it really just set, you know, it just turned the dial up for what you could achieve in games in a cinematic way. But certainly, I think everyone would agree that the game falls off at a certain point or is a little bit more repetitive. But Uncharted 2 was them stepping up big time, like way more environments.
It's a proper sort of like, you know, globetrotting adventure. There are way more characters. You start with this, at the start of the game, you have this kind of like amazing hanging off a cliff in a train on the side of a mountain while Drake is like seriously injured.
What the fuck happened here kind of thing? Then it flashes back and you have this awesome sequence where you're breaking into a museum, essentially. And this much wider universe of characters opens up and then it kind of like...
It's basically just a masterclass in video game action pacing, beat by beat, until you get to the last third of the game, where I think everyone could pretty much agree that it does fall apart a little bit and doesn't have the same momentum when you get to... Is it Shambala, Matthew? Is that right?
Or have I got that wrong? Is that uncharted 3?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah, City of Gold or something.
Terrible boss fight.
Yeah, so a bad end boss fight and lots of blue dudes you have to kill who are kind of a pain in the ass. It's quite an underpowered finale, but obviously the train sequence in this is like the maybe still the peak of that linear action sort of cinematic experience, just absolutely unbelievable, the pacing of it, the build up and how exciting it got. This was a defining PS3 game.
This was the PS3 game that got 360 people to go. I want to fucking play that because we had that in our office as well. That kind of that phenomenon, Matthew.
Thoughts on that pick?
Yeah, I mean, it's a great pick. It's one of my favorite games of this generation. I'm slightly, it's not regretting Metal Gear Solid 4, but Metal Gear Solid 4 next to that.
I know how people's minds work. They look at the two pairings of games and go, which one's more accessible? This is total popcorn and Metal Gear Solid 4 is quite challenging piece of work compared to that.
That makes me feel quite bad already.
Well, I honestly thought you would have picked this first, and I'm surprised you didn't. I get it because MGS, there's only one thing like MGS and there are more than one thing like Uncharted 2, right? That was a draft thinking, I assume.
Okay, next pick then. Category 3, Naughty Dog. I'm going to take the last of us.
Of course, yes.
Let's just secure the two sides of the Naughty Dog triumph on PlayStation 3. You get to him later in the generation, and I think everyone basically just assumed that they were going to keep making Uncharted games and then were surprised that they were making this quite gnarly survival third-person action adventure game with these two characters venturing across America and then dealing with these basically like plants slash mushroom motherfuckers. I remember thinking, okay, it's amazing that they are able to make these things at once because this is when Naughty Dog were obviously so much more prolific than they are now, where they're basically making two games a generation.
Maybe they'll only make one this generation, which if so would be a real bummer. But The Last of Us is not my favorite Naughty Dog game, being honest. I don't think it's the best stealth game.
But I think in terms of what it meant to people as a moment of storytelling and world-building, slightly younger players than us, it was absolutely a foundational, really important game. I definitely said this on that Last of Us episode we did, but to them it was as important as Uncharted 2 was to me and you, Matthew, I think. It was like, oh, games are doing something I've not seen before and this really works for me.
And I do think it's well-written and well-performed, and I do think it's provocative. I think The Last of Us 2 is a masterpiece. I don't think this is quite there.
But most people think this is a masterpiece, Matthew. That's good enough for me to pick for my list. Thoughts on that one?
Play to the cheap seats.
What is MGS4 but playing to the cheap seats?
It's not. MGS4 is a challenging work. It requires a higher brain function to appreciate.
Does it though? It's got a little girl frying eggs in it and a little robot spinning around. I don't know about that.
But anyway, yeah, The Last of Us is just, yeah, it showed what else Naughty Dog can do. And just gameplay wise, just pushed them in a completely different direction to Uncharted, very bold. And again, you got to the end of the generation and they were pushing out something this big and important.
And I think it just, even though it was the dying embers of the PS3, people were so pumped for this and it was such a huge moment. And 360 didn't have anything at that time like it. They just, they weren't, I was not on the ball in the same way.
So yeah, it was significant for sure. And yeah, I wanted something from that very end of the PS3 generation to represent the sort of progress it made, I guess. So The Last of Us sums it up, Matthew.
So what's your next pick?
Definitely a good pick for people who like boring ladder and box puzzles.
Good. The important thing is, no one's taking this personally. Okay, next pick.
Yeah. My next pick for, has a superior PS4 version now. Let's take God of War 3.
Oh, fair enough.
I have to have it. Like again, very much a Back Page heart pick. I don't know what that says about me as a human being that I enjoy this game.
It's kind of disgusting, it's often obscene. It's got some very, very questionable attitudes towards women. That stuff, that's rough.
I'm not endorsing all that. But it is also quite a singular journey of vengeance, which has been done a million times in games. But this one, it really does sell you on this guy basically destroying the entire world as he kills the gods.
And it's something that kind of emerged more on my more recent play through was actually how well it sells that idea of like, you're absolutely wrecking everything. Like you literally leave the world kind of plagued, flooded, drowned, crumbling. And I just thought it was so coherent as a vision.
I just, I have a huge amount of respect for this incredibly nasty childish game.
Yeah, it's what I would have picked next for sure. I love God of War 3. I agree with you.
It's the one of that like block of sort of PS2 era Kratos games. It is the one with where it feels like the people making it knew exactly what they wanted to make with no fat and no nonsense. And it's just gotta be this bloody rush to the finish, this bloody climb up the mountain and then like oblivion and nothing may ever grow again, basically.
That was kind of like the sort of scorched earth approach they took to it. And I really think that holds up well in retrospect, especially when you play something as baggy as God of War Ragnarok by comparison. This is like a completely different, it's a world away, but arguably, I think that in years to come, maybe this type of game will seem more appealing to people than the 20 to 30 hour version of what this kind of game became.
Yes. Yeah, I think that's fair. I'm probably giving it like too much credit.
Well, not too much credit. Like I'm trying to upsell what I fundamentally enjoy is like an incredibly bloody thrill ride with really gory quick time events and like absolute like all time a cast of assholes that you get to take apart. And I definitely miss them in the current iteration of the series.
So that's kind of emphasised it a bit more. But yeah, I don't know if I've actually played the PS3 version of this. I think I may have only ever played the remastered version.
So it was pretty impressive. Like the bit with Poseidon at the start looked incredible on PS3 at the time. It was fine.
But like the PS4 version is so nice because it's just 60 frames and higher resolution. So yeah, no reason to play the PS3 one really.
Because God of War 3 is on my mini console, will of course, for my mini console launch, be repeating the God of War launch party, which got OPM in the shit.
That was the God of War 2 one. Oh, was it? Yeah, so you'll be beheading a goat at your party, is that what you're saying?
Yeah, I've never beheaded a goat, you know. Yeah, it's a God of War adjacent.
Yeah, that's fine. You know, it's not for me to comment on the marketing practices of Matthew Castle Productions. That's for the FTC to deal with, Matthew.
Okay, so my next pick. God, I could really do some damage to you here. There's something I could do that'd be so shitty.
I think I know what it is, and just don't do it. Just be a good man and pick something else.
I don't know, what if I did do it and just shook it up a little bit and then like...
I would actually leave one of the categories empty.
Well, I think that would be a bit petty. It's a competition, isn't it? It should be, surely it's about the spirit of competition.
You could have done this to me.
Don't do it. Don't do it. I know you think it's funny, but genuinely.
But what if I did do it? And then like, what would happen after that? Like, what would, you know, sometimes don't you just want to see the sort of chaos that plays out in the game?
Isn't this the approach that Kratos took when he killed Zeus? Am I not tapping into that one? I kind of want to do it.
It's just that like, I can't, I can't, the thing is you're taking God of War 3. I can't take another thing like that because I've played God of War Ascension and it's not very good. So, and it is another game that I do really like on PlayStation 3.
What about, oh, why not Journey?
I don't really like Journey that much. You love Journey.
Do I?
I don't think so.
You love Journey, it's powerful. Why don't you pick Journey?
As explained previously, my experience with Journey was I played at 5 a.m. UK time and there were no players match made with me, so I just walked by myself to the top of this mountain then the game ended.
That still sounds profound, I'd pick that.
It wasn't that profound, I was just like, aren't there supposed to be people in this? It was a bit strange.
Oh, God, God, is my friendship with Matthew Castle gonna survive this if I do this? That's what I'm weighing up. I'm weighing up the moral implications of doing this.
You're weighing up strong friendship with good podcasting.
It's good podcasting, isn't it? And this isn't like the, I mean, the unspoken rules of the draft thing, this takes us back to the GoldenEye, Perfect Dark Base, doesn't it? I mean, doing that lost me the draft, Matthew, so if I do it this time, people could think, fuck that guy, I'm not having that.
But at the same time, there is one other game that could actually like tip this quite nicely, but I don't know. You could have taken this game instead of God of War 3, Matthew, but you didn't.
I once had God of War 3 on my list.
You could have had this game, you've not picked it. Oh, am I gonna do it? God, I feel that there's such danger, there's so much danger to doing this.
It could be if I do this, I don't hear from you for like two weeks, and then I'm like, is he okay?
It's fine, do whatever you think's best for your mini console.
Okay, fine. Category 10 has a superior PS4 version now, I'm taking Uncharted 3.
Yeah, I'm taking fucking Uncharted 3. Well, jokes on you, I fucking love Uncharted 3.
Okay, I firmly cast myself as the villain of the podcast. If you don't vote for me because you think I'm a bastard, that's completely fine, I don't mind. Okay, this was tough because I really did want God of War 3 and I was worried about being backed into picking something like Heavy Rain for this category and you ripping the piss out of me and that's a danger zone for me.
I may still be in that place in other categories. Uncharted 3, I slightly prefer to Uncharted 2. It has some way more annoying difficulty spikes that in the latter half of the game that don't do it for me, but actually some of the set piece design and the environments in this game and the journey you take, sort of some of the, I think personally, just on a replay, holds up a bit better pacing-wise than Uncharted 2 does.
It has momentum up until the end, whereas I think Uncharted 2 loses that momentum after the invasion of the village, as previously alluded to. So I've picked this. Matthew Castle may never forgive me, but he took God of War 3 and I wanted God of War 3 and now I don't have it and I have nothing like God of War 3 that I can pick.
Well, there you go. So is this, you know what I mean?
Yeah, but you, the nature of the, wait. You shouldn't be painting people into the corner with your fucking third choice.
I have only picked Naughty Dog Games so far. But there are loads of other categories in which you can wound me, Matthew. So, you know, you should, I encourage you to wound me.
I don't, oh my God. That is so weak. Just people who don't listen to the podcast, they only see the list.
They don't know the story behind what they're looking at.
But you, if you'd have picked Uncharted 3, I wouldn't have it, and you didn't pick it. Surely that's like the competition. Exactly, but you decided to pick first and not second.
That was your choice. You could have been in my position. You know what I mean?
Oh, and you have Metal Gear Solid 4. You know, I don't have that, so. It's, oh, so you've got to pick.
There's gotta be something in here that you want. I'm gonna sniff it out. That's become my mission.
I'm just gonna find some, there's something in here you want. I know it. I've just got to think back on everything you've ever said on this podcast.
I think you know one category where I want something, but you won't pick it first. So it depends how we do that and then miss out on something else. It's hard to weigh up and the price of vengeance, but yeah, sorry about this, buddy.
I do still really like you and respect you. And also MGS4 and God of War 3, what is wrong with that as a pairing? That's a fucking great combination of games.
Like that's good drafting, my friend. Anyway, back over to you, Matthew.
Uh, what the hell do I do to like claw back some of this? For me, the biggies are off the table. That's the problem I have.
Are they though? Like the biggies for us, but what about in the lifespan of this console? Is that definitely true?
Lifespan of this console? What am I missing? What am I missing here?
What started on PS3 that has changed the face of modern games?
I genuinely don't know what it is. Let me think. Let me think.
What started on PS3? It's like a fucking riddle.
Tell me this is not good podcasting. It's just not what it's about, Matthew. This is...
There's something here. What's here? What could I possibly pick there?
Think about all the studios. All the studios. What could they...
What did they do? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Fuck, this is a great episode, man. I'm having a great time.
I know you're having a great time. Terrible time. Are you thinking something first party?
Sort of. Published by Sony.
What could that be? Oh, if it's something precious, I've got to get it.
Oh, my God. I don't know what it is.
Yeah. Don't make a wild swing to try and, like, preempt what this is if you don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
Just pick, like, good games. That's all you've got to do is pick some good games.
Oh. I've got some tough categories. So I'll say there's a couple of categories where I'm on very uneven ground.
And one is shooter or platformer.
So I try to keep it open for you that one, because I thought this will make it easier if he's got two categories to pick from.
Racing is also difficult because I don't want to go multi-format, but I have absolutely no connection to MotorStorm or Gran Turismo. It's a thing that's gone on to be massive. I feel like something's staring me right in the face.
Just what could it be? What could it be? I feel like you've thrown me a bone and I hate to deflect that bone.
Yeah, I can't give you any more clues because then it looks like I'm trying to...
No, you shouldn't. I'm not interested in... It's not Killzone.
It's not God of War. It's not... I got it.
Yeah. He's got it.
RPG or action adventure? Demon's Souls.
There he goes. Well done. Well done, buddy.
Yes!
Well.
Done, brain. It's about a knight who arrives at a castle and then can't get into the castle. That's it.
That's what that game is about. I assume something happens in that castle. I got further in the remake.
I fought this slug that was covered in shields. It seemed impressive. People love it.
It's the best RPG or action adventure on PS3. It's Demon's Souls.
Very good, Matthew. Very convincing. If I hadn't have told you that, I wonder what you would have picked for this category.
The thing is, I was definitely going to pick this next because even though, like you, I don't really have a relationship to this game that much, something about slugs aside or whatever you just said, it does start here. It's like the foundation of modern games, the modern third-person games and what people like about hardcore, hardcore action, adventure, slash RPGs. It starts here on PlayStation 3.
That's an amazing string to its bow. These are all the things I would have said, by the way, if I had picked it, so I get to do it for you instead. Thank you.
If you're going to represent the PS3 on a mini-console, it's a good pick. That's it. No more clues for me now, though, because you're on your own path.
That's it. You know, friendship restored, which is something that might be said in Demon's Souls, humanity.
Oh, friendship restored.
Whatever.
Very good.
I'm not going to pretend to be an expert. I actually, I've played a little bit more of Demon's Souls than that in the remake, and one thing I do like about it is that once you're over that initial kind of tutorial stretch, it opens up in quite an interesting way in that it kind of spokes out from the hub, and you can kind of pursue it in lots of different routes. And so it's, it's like, like a little, a little more linear and less connected, it strikes me in that spoke design.
But I also like the idea that, you know, you can kind of chip, you know, take it in these four different directions, it's got a slightly different sort of shape to it than Dark Souls. So it hasn't just been replaced, like it still has its own rhythm. It still has its own kind of worth.
So yeah, there's a bit where you fight like a giant manta ray in the sky.
That's cool.
You can like hit it with a lightning sword.
I keep meaning to play that version of it actually, I do have it, but then Elden Ring came out and now I'm like fucking 19 games behind on the front back catalog, so forget about it.
Yeah, there's something like, there's something about this, it feels more doable, you know, saying that it has this sort of finite space to Elden Ring, like where I'm at now, I'm just like fuck it, I just have no idea where I should go and at least here you're like, well there's only so many places I can go. And that's actually quite a good motivator. So thank you for very kindly throwing me that bone.
I did actually have, do you know why I forgot it? It's because I had that down as one of my three for exclusive and then I deleted it once we both picked.
Ah, right, yeah, yeah.
Without writing it elsewhere. That's a little behind the scenes glimpse into how my document works and why it sometimes kicks me in the ass.
Well, that's good. You know, I hope that the listeners enjoy that little redemption arc. I've restored my status as hero in this narrative.
It wasn't much of a cliffhanger for our friendship.
Not really, no. I mean, it was resolved in 10 minutes in two draft picks, so that's good. In some ways, I think like the draft begins now because I've already picked my three Naughty Dog games, obviously.
So...
I can't wait to pick mine.
I wonder what it will be. Imagine I took for... Fucking shit.
I'm so cross.
Imagine for free pick, I took on...
Like, I actually hate it. I think it's shit.
No, it's not shit.
They're so lucky they got a second shot at that.
No, that is not true. You've got to remember what it was like at the time. I just spent my afternoon playing Resistance 2 and trust me, that does a lot of the same Call of Duty style, you know, beat, beat, beat, action, scripted beats going on and stuff.
And then it just... It's nowhere near as successful. Uncharted was a really good version of this at the time.
They just made it better. It's like overblown the idea that this game was bad. Just definitely was.
Oh, I... When I replayed it, when they did the collection on PS4, I thought it was... I thought it was quite a tough hang.
Yeah.
It's like, oh, and it had motion-controlled grenade arcs. That's such a fuck you. I can't believe a game with motion-controlled grenade arcs makes it onto my list.
So you're saying pick it for ill-advised six-axis inclusion, Matthew?
No, because then I've got nothing for naughty dogs that didn't make any other fucking games. Unless I put their... I can't put The Last of Us DLC in there, can I?
That would be so funny if you picked that.
Oh. Well, that's better. Anyway, I won't do that.
So I haven't got the base game for people to enjoy.
Yeah, it wouldn't even be compatible, would it? So they couldn't play it on your mini console, it would just be there. Oh, dear.
Okay. That's cracked me up. Right.
Yeah, so from here, I can't pick Demon's Souls. That was the last thing I really thought was like a draft decider, but it does need lots of cool categories. Tell you what, though, bonus category, HD, actually, should I leave that?
Because there's definitely at least three things I want for that one. To me, that's a low stakes category, actually. Tell you what, I am going to take category five PSN game and I am going to take Journey.
It's not my favorite of the games that that game company made for PlayStation 3. In fact, it's my third favorite, but yeah, it is. But I do think that it was kind of the peak of what people liked about PSN games aesthetically and in terms of game design.
It was something a bit unusual, a journey about you basically growing this scarf while exploring these environments and sharing that journey with other people. It was from a time where I think we were a bit more open to this game's whole deal is to make you feel something with its environmental design and sound design and that kind of thing. We were more open to that and less cynical about it.
I think it's probably other than maybe what remains of media finch, which is a distant relative to this really, that kind of passive game experiences. It's maybe the most evocative of its type in its era. I think that it represents the best of what they were able to achieve with those digital download PlayStation games.
You can't get anything like this on 360 or Wii. It's something you can only experience on PlayStation. I think it was hugely significant in the latter part of that generation.
There's a bunch of other stuff I thought about for this category. Flower is my favorite of their games on PS3 for sure. I'm not going to rule that out for ill-advised six-axis inclusion because it's a pure six-axis game that is the only game that really did it well.
But I think that Journey is probably the one people think of the most when they think of PSN games. So it's a right pick, I think.
I would say crucially, there are loads of wimps out there who like this game.
As opposed to real men who like MGS4 and God of War 3.
If you like games like God of War 3 and Demon's Souls and Metal Gear Solid 4, tough games, manly games, get my Metal Gear Solid 3, if you want to dance all nimbly-bimbly-like in the sand, by all means buy The Naughty Dog Machine.
I like Uncharted 2, The Last of Us, Journey and Uncharted 3, that's...
It's very one-note.
Is it?
It's just... It's very Naughty Dog.
How is Journey like The Last of Us?
No, but it's like Journey and a load of Naughty Dog games.
Well, if you like a PlayStation 3 mini that objectifies women, buy Matthew Castle's, that's my advice to you, the listener. What's your next pick, Matthew?
Bonus category, HD collection, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus.
Did you just slam Ico on a podcast we made?
Listen, it's wartime. These are different in wartime.
This is such a good episode. Fucking hell. You're like, oh, you're...
This is how it works. Listen, do I think Ico is a little la-di-da? Yeah, I do.
But Shadow of the Colossus lets you kill giant, majestic beasts with a big stab to head. One of the most tactile feeling games ever as you climb them up. One of the most cinematic games ever.
I think it's got crazy scale, crazy style. I'm sure some people also enjoy Ico, but you know, you don't have to. You've got Shadow of the Colossus.
You can enjoy them both. Are these good HD games, Sam?
Yes, they're very good. I think they're also Blue Point Jobs.
Oh, well, there we go.
Yeah, 1080p, the works and preserve the original art of them.
That's good. That's something a little more delicate and artful to go along with all my macho bludgeonings and preposterous Kojima nonsense.
Yeah, there's actually like quite a few for this one. So that was my second pick actually. I've got another one.
I want it more, but yeah, I mean, I'm enjoying this. What's that movie when the broadcaster completely loses his shit? And like, and then he goes-
A network.
Yeah, a network. This is like your network moment in this podcast, I think.
Actually, I've kind of like, I've gone from despair to feeling quite good again.
You're like, yeah, buy my masculine console, but also Icos on it. A game that I don't like.
Yeah, but like, I don't have to like it. You don't have to like Journey.
No, it's a good point. This is wartime. I'm just, I'm just joshing.
I'm just messing with you. Okay, good. Yeah, those are good picks.
You've got some good picks so far.
Yeah. I've got, this machine's currently got a strong Metacritic, which is all I currently, Metacritic average, which is what I care about.
Well, so is mine, because it's dragged up by all the Uncharted and the last of the schemes.
Oh yeah, I mean, I'm not saying yours, but I'm just saying, like, I've yet to like, red faction this motherfucker.
Yeah, fair enough. This is, yeah, I'm not sure where to kind of go from here, actually, because there's not really an obvious, I don't have anything I'm dying to get out my system here now. Let's go with category two racing.
I'm gonna take Motorstorm Pacific Rift.
Interesting.
Motorstorm was the original, like I say, was a proper system set at the time, just really beautiful looking game. It was like reasonably slight though, I would say that after a couple of weeks, you kind of got your sort of value from it. The whole thing with it was you could pick a variety of like vehicles that could move in the dirt, and then, you know, you kind of go through this festival sort of like list of events and getting the best scores you can and you could play online as well.
And it was cool. The second one though was way better, had like a massive amount of like environmental variety. It took you to this, I think it was like a volcanic island.
And so you went from driving like across actual volcanoes, like beaches and when you're on the beaches and you drove through water, it would cool down your engines and stuff like that. And it just had this really sort of like beefy fun racing style, but like a lot of variation between the different vehicles. And I'm so hard to please the racing games.
They're so not my sort of genre. But this had the like the sort of drama and excitement. And it was like, it's almost like a kind of Mario Kart level of accessibility.
These are not sim games really. But then there would be things like, you know, if you went through the tracks of the races who went in front of you, that would affect your sort of momentum and stuff like that. So the, you know, the track would change as you were playing essentially.
And just memories of like driving a, like a fucking lorry sized vehicle across like the top of a volcano and having a great time. I think I gave this 93% for plays. So a really, a real favorite of mine and definitely the best one of this series.
I don't think Apocalypse is considered as good. And that kind of goes away after that. But yeah, I'm guessing you would have picked this Matthew because you've struggled to justify it, but still it's what I like.
So any thoughts on that?
No, it's HD Excite Trucks, isn't it?
Oh, enough of your shit talking. What's your next pick?
No, I mean, as a compliment, it's like Excite Trucks, but with, you know, Excite Trucks whole thing was, it was quite a sort of superficial racing game, throwing these trucks around this like morphing landscape. But this game sort of by being slightly kind of prettier and having all the kind of cool, you know, mud physics and the like and everything you mentioned there feels like it kind of sort of did it, but could do it at a more polished level. And it's a kind of racing game where spectacle is kind of a big part of the appeal.
So actually having a more attractive version of that does make it better.
Yeah, I think it was, yeah, it was just very appealing. Again, at a time as well where 2008 era is like, you know, you don't have the, the PS3 doesn't have anything like Fable 2, you know what I mean? Like it was, it felt like the 360 was firmly ahead.
Well, I guess the 360 version of this was banjo because there were nuts and bolts, so I don't know. Your mileage on that may vary. But yeah, this is a series that I don't think is forgotten.
And this is the one I think people do talk about when they remember it fondly. And it's certainly the one I enjoyed the most. What's your next pick Matthew?
For shooter or platformer, I'm afraid I've got to take a game I haven't played. I'm gonna take Resistance 3. Which, like I say, I haven't played it, but I've heard good things.
I've heard people say that it is, it's slightly underrated and gets kind of lost in the conversation a bit. It's infamously a very brown game, but it's also of the, and you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong here. I believe it to be of the school of shooters, more of the half-life lineage, where it's kind of like storytelling and set pieces and kind of variety within that.
It's not, you know, necessarily like a very twitchy shooter. It's not a big open-world thing. It's more like a, I guess, like a proto-metro, maybe.
It's, maybe. Is that overselling it? That was always my read from reading about these games.
Well, that's kind of where they fit in. Maybe that's wrong.
That's sort of what I think they tried to go for with one and three. Two is a bit more like a riff on Call of Duty with that kind of set piece design. Three is like, I think it's, I couldn't remember a single bit of three.
And when I was looking over it, I was watching videos back, this is a game I've completed. None of it really tweaked for me. I wasn't like, oh yeah, it's this amazing level when X happens.
There's nothing like that in this game. And that's why I didn't pick it. I was like, I revisited Resistance.
And I think they're, of their time and everything they do, other games did better, like Call of Duty did better. And so I just think, yeah.
That may be true, but I also feel, I feel okay about having, you know, a series which had three entries on PS3, being on my mini PS3 and representing that particular period. Also, I honestly couldn't think of a shooter I would rather have on there, or a platforming game that I would rather have on there.
I would say of all the categories, this is the one where I was like, oh, yikes. I mean, short of like putting a load of multi-format stuff in there, which you can do.
Yeah, I think it's, yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Like it's, yeah, they're just like, they're just not, weirdly I think it's just because of the moment we're in. They're not, it's not that exciting.
They're just like, yeah, they just don't, they don't quite do it for me now the way they did then. They're just, they're very off their time, but yeah.
It looked quite exciting when I was watching the original IGN review on double speed. But that might also be because it was all moving very fast. You were like, wow, this thing's got some legs on it.
But then you forget that the man's also going, welcome to Resistance 3.
The second one just had the big monster fights, which I thought were really, really cool. And this one didn't really. This one was like a lot more sort of somber.
I think that they lost the war against the aliens and humanity's on the ropes or something.
That feeds into like the masculine vibes of my console. You know, like this is the console for like lovers of war, for the melancholic war boys.
Yeah, I just think if you wanted a shooter from this era to sum up the era, you just play the modern warfare 1, 2, and 3, like that's the trilogy that sums this entire genre up. So, I don't know. I know there are some people who like this series, but if they remaster them now, I think it would be weird.
I think people would be like, why these games now? I think that would be the sort of response to them. But Resistance was certainly an important part of the PS3 journey.
I just couldn't quite bring myself to pick one, Matthew. So I wish you well in all your ventures.
Thank you.
Yeah, no worries.
What have you got next?
Right, okay, for my RPG or action adventure, I'm going to take Nino Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch.
I thought you might.
So the only PlayStation 3 game that has Studio Ghibli's name on them, they provided a bunch of animation for this game, which was developed by Level 5. It is a very trad Japanese RPG, but at the time when it launched, we kind of needed a few of those. There weren't many around.
Certainly not that had some graphical heft behind them. This was like a long awaited, I think it was a DS version and a PS3 version of the same game. We never got the DS one, which sucks.
Why didn't they bring that here? That's really annoying, isn't it?
Because they had to localize a huge spell book that you needed to play in.
Oh, yeah, that's right. With this, they did a great job with the localization, lots of local British voices and stuff. I think that even though the setting is not actually that Ghibli in its execution, certainly the audio-visual side of it is very convincing in that respect, I think.
And if you're going to pick an RPG to sum up the PS3 era, I think this is, on the exclusive side, this is kind of it, really. But it's, I think, more fondly recalled than the second game, which I don't think people liked as much, and I don't think did have the Ghibli involvement. This one feels like a solid pick for cool, interesting stuff that was still coming out of Japan on PlayStation 3.
Matthew, thoughts?
Yeah, I, from afar, really wanted to play this. We were following the Ni no Kuni story on DS. The DS one is a really interesting game and has a lot of its own quirks and sort of shape to it.
Very, very polished for a DS game, but you know, there was no denying that the kind of pitch of these two studios working together and bringing that art style to life and having that incredible Joe Hisaishi soundtrack, like, you know, yeah, of course, this is, this is good. This is still good now. People still like it.
So yes, good pick.
Yeah, now available on everything else as well. So yeah, play on Steam Deck, play on Switch. It's up to you.
What's your next pick, Matthew?
For ill-advised six axis inclusion, I'm going to take Ratchet and Clank tools of destruction.
Okay. Ratchet and Clank list and picking your list. I never would have thought I'd hear it, but yeah.
Yeah, I mean, listen, they're more action heroes than platforming heroes. So what if they're jumps not brilliant? You know, fundamentally, the excitement of this delightful comic universe is unleashing the wild arsenal of Insomniac guns, which includes a tornado launcher, which is controlled with six axis tilting, according to GameFAQs.
Very convincing.
And also there are some free falling sections where you control with the tilts. I couldn't think of many good games where tilt was like at the heart of everything. Maybe such a thing doesn't exist.
Maybe you're gonna surprise us all with something. I don't know. But like, where does this sit in the grand scheme of ratchet and clank?
I don't know.
I don't think it's considered as good as A Crack in Time, which is on PlayStation as well.
No, but it's still like a Metacritic in the 80s.
Well, you know, this is interesting because I gave it 68 at the time. I thought it was very conventional platformer and didn't really push forward the form.
Well, I am quite happy at having the illustrious ratchet and clank represented on my list. If you love PlayStation, you probably like ratchet and clank.
Oh my gosh.
And we'll look forward to revisiting this very strong entry in the series.
This podcast is like the end of Akira. Matthew's turning into that big fucking flesh monster thing. This is just, yeah, truly an arc.
All your favorites are here.
All your favorites are here.
Resistance 3, fucking hell. That is, I don't think that's quite red factioning it.
Well, no, I don't think it's possible. I think we've got too many strong picks each to red faction it. Like it's, also, we're getting into the dicier categories here where things are not quite as rigid.
So, yeah, okay, I think I've got a good pick for category eight wild card, Matthew, which is a game published by From Software in Japan. 3D Dot Game Heroes, do you know this game?
Oh, I do know its name. It's the thing where you make a character out of beads.
Well, yeah, like, you know, sort of like pixels, basically like squares. So you create a character and then basically play like a throwback to 2D Zelda that is presented in like with 3D visuals. So it's kind of like it has a 2D style, but you're on a 3D plane.
And it looked incredibly striking for the time. And it's quite rare and hard to get hold of now. So it's my turn to pick a game I've not played, but this is something I always had my eye on and something I've like followed on eBay over the years to try and like track a copy down and got really good reviews at the time, got an 8.5 from IGN, pretty strong on Metacritic.
And people were really ready, I think, for a Zelda-alike at a time when no one was really making stuff like that, other than Nintendo, of course. So yeah, it's quite interesting, specific PS3 exclusive game to have in my list, Matthew, thoughts?
Yeah, I wonder if at From Software, you've got like all the Souls-born people and then you've got the guy who really wanted to carry on down the beads path.
Yeah, you know, maybe, yeah. The beads thing is slightly overblown. It's just like basically a character creation tool.
It's not...
Oh, I thought they were made from those beads that you ironed. They look like though, you know the things I'm talking about?
Yeah, I kind of do. But yeah, I think it is just about like, you just make your little do and then get on with it. But I don't know how, I don't know if beads was that a big deal.
I'm just trying to make people associate this pick with beads, so it seems less impressive.
Thanks, I appreciate that, good.
When you come to vote, remember beads.
Great, curious to see what horror show, six out of 10 horror show you pick for that category, Matthew. So what's your next pick?
My next pick, for wild card, oh no.
Do I do that? I don't think you're gonna take this, so I can probably leave it. For wild card, I'm gonna take puppeteer.
Oh yeah, I played this today, I didn't think it was very good.
Oh, I played it yesterday and thought it was okay.
It feels like a PS Move 3D game that just doesn't quite make sense out of divorce from that to me. Sorry, why don't you talk about what it is first?
Puppeteer, it's like a 2D platformer that is, you play as like a sort of, little like marionette thing that loses its head. It can swap on different heads, which makes you think it's gonna be like, dynamite heady or something. It kind of has that like, you think, oh, is this gonna be like a cool 2D treasure style action game?
Actually, the head stuff didn't really seem to factor into it. What the actual, the more interesting mechanic is, you have a big pair of scissors and you can kind of cut through threads and material. I actually think the scissors mechanic is quite nice feeling.
It's why I included it in the list. I was like, I could see this working in like a paper Mario or something. It had quite a nice sense of like, chopping through all these very tactile materials as they kind of tear and shred.
I thought, you know, this feels like classic wild card territory. I don't know if it's a massively long game or a particularly beloved game, but the fact that it's presented as this sort of stage show with like shifting bits of scenery, it's quite artfully done. Maybe it has a little bit of that like, sort of like little big planet, like look to it in terms of stuff, sort of shifting around in and out, coming down on ropes.
It's a bit like homemade and arts and crafty. Yeah, I did play this and I thought it was genuinely okay. Okay enough to be my wild card.
Yeah, I just, yeah, it looks really nice, definitely. And like looks and sounds, presentation wise is fantastic. But like I say, I think the gameplay really feels like it's made for PS Move, the way it kind of gets you to move a little character across the screen grabbing stuff, feels like it needs a pointer more than a controller.
Yeah, you do control the other character as a pointer, which is a bit of a pain in the ass.
Does your cursed console come with a PS Move, Matthew? Does that come with it as well?
It comes with whatever it needs for these games to be enjoyed at their seven out of 10 percent.
Yeah, the only game I've ever played with PS Move was Child of Eden actually. And it worked really well with that as you might expect. So yeah.
But I'm not too worried. I think you see Puppeteer next to 3D.Heroes. I don't think either of those terms means a huge amount to anyone.
Nah.
So it's just about picking something.
They cancel each other out.
Yeah. I sort of like, yeah. I did really weigh up Puppeteer.
It was on my list until I played it. And now it's just like a bit underwhelmed by it. But you know, fair enough, Matthew.
Next pick then. Matthew's gonna shit talk this, but I think it's the absolute right pick. Category four, Shooter of Platform.
I'm gonna take LittleBigPlanet 2. So, a big part of the PS3 experience for me was...
Didn't even cross my mind that it was a platformer. That's how little I think of its platforming.
Jesus.
No, that's bullshit.
That's ridiculous. Whereas Ratchet and Clank, I mean, come on.
I genuinely forgot LittleBigPlanet until I just said it when I was talking about Puppeteer. And then I was like, why didn't I pick up the platform?
I gotta say, you know, however, people always fucking complain about the platforming LittleBigPlanet, right? Because there's like these three different planes of the foreground and background you're moving between and it's not super slick. What I will say is that the campaigns that made the most out of that were an absolute delight in both one and two with the Stephen Fry narration and all these inventive level ideas that were built using the tools they didn't give you to create levels with as a player.
Now, those tools were very in depth, but I was not, I didn't really have the time at the time to like get properly into them. But I got so much joy out of people's creations in this. I had lots of like nice sort of wholesome, cause I moved out of my house when I was 18 and my brother was like eight or like seven.
And so it was, I think he was like quite devastated when I left. So one thing we did actually do to keep in touch was PS3 obviously had free multiplayer. So we would, I would jump into Little Good Planet and then go between a bunch of different levels just randomly like firing through them.
And I remember we went through this whole sequence of, because you could do chains of levels. There's like a whole sequence of Star Wars levels we went through where they like recreated the entire story right down to like the Death Star Trench Run and stuff like that. And obviously the levels, I think I've talked before about the level where you climb inside a guy's mouth, hold onto a big poo that fires out of him while he's going, making noises like that.
You dunk the poo into a toilet and then loads of little baubles come down as your reward for doing that. Lots of kind of like memorable sort of player created nightmares that people built. And then you could, with two, they imported all the levels from one and added a bunch of new tools as well.
So people can make like puzzle games and things like that. Really, really impressive. And I think because it was the first taste of that player created content, I think it was slightly more appetite for it than maybe there would be now if you've integrated this into a game, because now I think people are more keen to just like learn how to, how Unreal Engine works or whatever.
And it's a bit of a different landscape. But then I think because they made such a big deal about this play, create, share thing, people were well up for it. But I just found these games really delightful.
And they are emblematic of what the PlayStation 3 did really well. So I think they deserve a place on my list, Matthew. And I knew you wouldn't pick it.
So I've left it until this point in the list to select it. Thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, very different philosophies there. If you're looking at LittleBigPlanet 2 versus Resistance 3. One is literally a boundless celebration of invention and creativity.
And the other is a lot of very Brown houses.
Yeah, the other is LittleBigPlanet 2.
Tough break. Yeah, I like, to bring up the cliche there, I just don't like the, I genuinely do think the feel of this game undermines everything, but that's just me.
I think you have to be quite joyless to fight.
I played LittleBigPlanet 1 for like three hours and then that was it.
I think you have to be quite joyless to fight the fun of this. It's pretty breezy, breezy action. I don't think it's like, it's not like playing Celeste or something.
It's not challenging. It's just fun and nice to, a nice world to be in.
I'm just, yeah, I'm just not a big build your own stuff. And when other people build cool stuff, it just makes me feel jealous of them.
That old one, yeah.
Yeah, no, but it's true. Like I'm just too petty to enjoy LittleBigPlanet.
Okay, that's fine. But yes, I think, you know, as a significant moment in PS3's lifespan, it belongs on my list, so it's all good. What's your next pick, Matthew?
Wouldn't it be good if I picked LittleBigPlanet 1 as my free pick?
If you selected it for Naughty Dog and like just saw what would happen, that would be, yeah.
We're into some sort of, some real dreg. There's a like a twisted part of my brain that's saying, let's pick a Quantic Dream game for free pick.
I'm surprised you haven't picked a Yakuza, actually.
I've been thinking about that all day, but the problem with particularly Yakuza on PlayStation 3 is I feel like they're all like the middle parts of something. I don't think there's one that was particularly, as satisfying like standalone.
No, but you have like Five, which is like the monster Yakuza game, right? It's like 50 hours long, has loads of characters and stuff, but yeah.
Yeah, I don't know. Something weird about it in isolation. That would look weird to me, if it was a mini console in a shop, I'd be like, Yakuza, wow, eh?
I'd say exactly like that.
Fair enough.
Do I put, I don't really like Heavy Rain, but I think it is interesting.
Yeah, I've got a category it was second in, and I may still pick it for something, I don't know.
Yeah.
But you have like thoroughly slammed it. You are with the masses on this one. You are just out on this game.
Yeah. Yeah. But I don't know.
I've done, well, listen, my list has taken me to some pretty dark places.
It has. I'm worried that you're just selling your soul to win the vote, and I don't want to see that happen to you, man, you know?
This seems even spicier in the light of like what we now know about Quantic Dream as a studio, but I don't think you can tell the story of PS3 without Quantic Dream on there. I've got a little bit of like everything on here, so continuing that theme, I am going to take Heavy Rain, a game I'm not wild about, but does have individual scenes that I quite like. My big problem with this game, he said, while trying to make a case for it, is that I just find it wildly inconsistent, and everyone always talks about the very like human moments, making tea for your kid, or being like a sad dad or whatever, and then they forget like all the incredibly dumbest shit scenes that follow immediately after those, or the fact that it ends in a fight above a trash compactor, the most cliched bullshit you could possibly put in.
Like, if it is like a film, it's one of the worst films ever made. But that's, listen, we're not talking about that. We are talking about its successes, its individual moments that do resonate with people, the fact that it tries to go outside of the traditional kind of action beats of normal games and show like a wider range of scenarios.
It looks quite rough now, but at the time it was considered quite cutting edge. Maybe it's good as a time capsule for that reason. Yeah, Heavy Rain is my free pick.
Yeah, I actually did want to pick this, so I was trying to talk you out of it.
Oh, right.
Yeah, I think this is, I don't know, I think that I would vote for a list that had this on it. I think you're, it's very short sighted to slam it for those cliched scenes. I mean, what you think the first like proper cinematic looking interactive adventure is gonna be like fucking Fincher five star film out of the gate.
You have a bit of like couple of it slack, you know what I mean? Like it's.
It's very like the chase where the guy keeps tripping up on all the boxes and all that. Maybe I've just been warped by the means.
Yeah, well, that's the thing is that I just think that the people were so up for this in the moment and then the consensus completely overrode it. And I just think the fundamentals of it was so strong. There's a interactive branching game where there were actual consequences to those branches.
Like it's, yeah, it was, I think it was a really significant PS3 game and it looked fucking amazing as well. So.
Ah, sweet. Well, I'm glad it's on my machine.
Well, I liked it and no one else likes it, but I like it. So, it is what it is. Yeah.
OPM liked it because they all gathered around me when I was sitting in a games cage going, think you're better than heavy rain, do you? Do you? Think you're better than heavy rain, do you?
That's a great.
Started pushing me lightly.
Should have asked Tim. Definitely. Should have asked Tim about that, should we?
Tim on one side, Ben Wilson on the other, just pushing me back and forth.
Oh yeah. You must have felt very beta in that scenario, Matthew.
And I was like, one day I'll come back and make the most macho PS3 mini console you've ever seen, motherfuckers.
Goats being beheaded, the works. Yeah. I've got a slightly shitty pick for free pick, Matthew.
But I think it's okay because this caps off the very end of like the PS3's lifespan. Category nine free pick, I'm gonna take Persona 5.
Because this kind of is a PS3 ass looking game. Persona 3 and 4 came out in PS2. Then they almost skip a generation, taking so long to kind of get this onto modern platforms.
It does launch on PS3 and PS4 here. You can buy this on PS3. A lot of people experience this on PS4, but I think it's got a bit of a whiff of the old PS3 spirit about it.
So I think for a free pick, this adds a little bit of colour to my list and is an absolute stone cold classic. So what do you think of that?
Yeah, I kind of forgot it was a PS3 game, even though what you say makes sense. Yeah, man, that machine had a tail on it. I mean, it's a great game.
I'm not gonna say anything bad about Persona 5. I absolutely fucking love it.
And kind of identical on PS3 and PS4 as well. It doesn't, it's not like it's any different, really.
Who played, it definitely released in the UK on PS3.
Yeah, it did. Yeah, US you can buy this for about 30 quid on PS3, basically. It's not, yeah, it's not like.
That's mad.
Yeah, it's a bit like, I guess like Breath of the Wild being on Wii U or whatever. Yeah, so.
Yeah.
Yeah, but yeah, so Persona 5, yeah, obviously like one of the, you know, probably the signature modern Japanese RPG with lots of like character relationship stuff that you do during the day. Then at night you go into these dungeons and fight monsters and then infiltrate the mind palaces of absolute bastards. But the real fantasy is living the lives of these cool teenagers in Tokyo.
And yeah, seeing those relationships blossom and getting invested in their various journeys. And now I think that there are many other games scrambling around this to replicate some of those same elements. And I think it's gonna have a profound effect on the games that follow probably from some of their genre stablemates, Matthew.
So Persona 5, yes. You probably did play us on PS4, but this did come to PS3. So for a free pick, we had a bit of color.
I think it was just a bit stronger than Infamous 2, which I just don't think I could convincingly tell people this is an exciting reason to buy a mini console. Much as I enjoyed it at the time, I think it probably was like a seven, eight borderline. So yeah, it's tough.
I didn't want to sell out, so there you go. What's your final pick now?
No, I've got a couple more. A question of whether this is acceptable. And I'll take your answer to be final.
I'm not going to argue against it. For category three, Naughty Dog, could I take the Jack and Daxter collection?
Well, we have a HD collection bracket is the thing. And I guess I didn't want it to become overburdened with like compilations of stuff. But I'm feeling generous and you seem to be a bit down in the dumps about some of your picks.
I'm going to allow it, Matthew.
You're going to allow it?
Yeah, why not? I don't mind.
Thank you so much. I didn't want Uncharted Drake's Fortune. I really do not like that game.
And I think it's bad, very bad. Even compared to two and three, obviously compared to two and three, but I'm glad it's not on there. I mean, do I like Jack and Daxter collection?
Uh, I mean, you know, people loved them on PS2, classic platforming heroes. Uh, I've only played the first one in any substantial way. And actually, I had an okay time collecting all those precursor orbs in quite an impressive sort of open world sort of sprawl.
Like it's all kind of interconnected, the kind of structure thing. My brother played the subsequent ones where it all went a little bit sort of sci-fi and cities and flying cars and that wasn't really my bag. But, you know, having I'm not I'm not trying to pitch this as like, you get three games if you get this.
Like, I don't really care about two or three. Let's just let's just imagine we're only really going to play one. And yeah, I would much rather play this than uncharted one.
So that's why we're doing that.
OK, fair enough. Yeah, so I love the original Jack and Dexter and I did play the version again that they did on PS3 and I thought it's pretty good. And I don't like the second one because it adds guns and not very good open world gameplay, though it did look amazing.
That's good for my macho console.
Yeah. And the third one set in the desert. I don't know much about it.
But yeah, fair enough, Matthew. Yeah, just very odd to hear you picking like PS2 platforming icons across the board on your console. But these are we are through the through the looking glass here, people.
Listen, once once I yeah, Ico, Ratchet Clank, Jack and Daxter. I'm taking a swing at what I think a PlayStation person would like to hear.
Fair enough. So I okay. So my next pick is going to be category six ill-advised six axis inclusion.
I was very close to picking Heavenly Sword, a game I quite like. Like it was like a seven from the time. It was kind of an interesting seven because it allowed you to fire like arrows and control them with the six axis.
But I thought that was actually like maybe a little bit too underpowered compared to some of your picks. So I did think I'm going to instead go for Wipeout HD, which was a really fucking great version of Wipeout that was actually like a genuine PS3 download highlight. And I think it maybe did HD'd up some of the Wipeout PSP games.
And that was like what the game was. But it also so they added this mode called Zone, I think, in Wipeout Fusion. But when I brought it to the HD version, basically like you were going through these tracks and they are completely changing color when you enter a new zone.
So it's just this like amazing audio visual experience, especially like a survival mode. Your vehicle gets faster and faster. You have to keep going for as long as possible.
And then I think there were leaderboards to kind of sum that up at the end. And I really I just really loved that. I just that was the mode I kind of played the most of this.
I wasn't as into like the basic racing. But that is a kind of like look how fucking nice you can make this look at your HDTV thing with these stark visuals, almost like you're looking like a visualizer and an old ass like Windows media player or something. Just the extraordinary looking thing.
Really love that. I think the six access controls were you could control the pitch of the ship a little bit left and right. But like obviously you could turn that off as well.
So this yeah, I think this also sums up something really nice that was going on on the racing side on PlayStation. I think it'll be a favorite with some of our listeners. So that makes more sense than Heavenly Sword, which I do still respect as like a high-end attempt to do a cinematic story.
It was just a little bit too short for people and yeah, and I played that on streaming for about 10 minutes and was like, I don't know if streaming does adjust this necessarily. It looked quite smeary to my eye.
Yeah, and you know, it didn't at the time. That's the thing. Although a lot of these games do look like they played through Vaseline.
I did play a bit of Haze for this podcast, Matthew, when it got a second version because my first version had no disc in it. So I paid £2 for two copies of Haze, only one of which had the disc in it. Very cursed weekend for Samuel Roberts.
That game is not very good and it is very very blurry. But the biggest problem with it apart from the bad shooting is it's like it's actually like quite an undercooked run at what Spec Ops the Line would do well. It's kind of meant to be about like, you know, it's about a corporation sending soldiers into battle and and all drugged up so they don't they repress, they repress how they feel on the battlefield and stuff.
But Spec Ops has a much better version of that sort of thing, obviously. So yeah, anyway, discuss that in the old 360 draft. So yeah, Wipeout HD, that's my category six pick.
Matthew, I have one more pick after this. I'm guessing this is your last pick.
I've got two more.
OK, yeah, because we did have two picks. So what's your next pick?
My next pick for PSN game, which I really struggled with because I don't think I played any PSN games. I played a bit this last night and it seemed fine. So I'm going to pick Rain for this.
OK, sure.
Kind of slightly sort of artsy, sort of fartsy, sort of sad, sad, invisible boy in Rainy City. The central mechanic being that when it rains on him, you can obviously see him when he steps out the rain, he's invisible and you can sort of see where he is by his footprints or knocking over objects. There are kind of like ghost dogs who are trying to kind of track him down.
And again, the kind of where they can and can't be seen is part of the mechanic. It seems like the kind of thing I would probably call wiffly piffly. But listen, I needed a PSN game.
I tried this. I tried Trash Panic. Trash Panic was fucking garbage, literally.
So Rain it is.
You could have done so much better in this category.
Name one game that's better than Rain.
Pixeljunk Monsters, Pixeljunk Eden.
I just didn't have any relationship with those.
Savage Moon, that rules, Tower Defense game.
I've got a ten minute relationship with Rain now.
The Unfinished Swan, which was like what the Eda Finch devs did before this. You would have called that Wiffly Piffly too though. Flower, Flow, these are all better games than that to me.
But you know, I've only played a little bit, fair enough.
Yeah, it's called Rain. Chris Donlon gave it six in your game.
Really backing up your case here. How did you end up picking all these games you don't like in the second half of your list? It's a real all-timer for you, I've got to say.
It's really bizarre.
I don't think anyone's deciding this based on what PSN game we pick.
Well, no, but it does. I think Journey is quite a lot stronger than Rain.
I mean, yeah, but I would have picked Journey if you hadn't picked it for us.
But I think Flower is as strong as Journey. Also, you could have picked Dead Nation, Super Stardust HD, there are loads of good PSN games you could have picked for this. How smart were you?
I just think you had to be a bit more embedded in the console for those things to become known to you.
Fair enough. All right. Well, you know, it's your list.
I'm not saying they're not good. I'm just saying I just didn't have the experience.
Your advertising is like, oh, yeah, Kratos, Snake, and also Little Boy in the Rain.
Little Boy can only be seen in the rain. Another classic.
Okay, good stuff. We stumble to the last two picks of this list then. Okay, so my last pick then, bonus category HD collection.
Why don't I just take the MGS HD collection for this?
Oh, shit, I forgot about that.
Yeah, so you've got Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty, and Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater with the subsistence controls. A lovely HD done by the very talented people at Bluepoint. Absolutely amazing update in these games.
We just did a pod on how good MGS3 still is. I think that's a good pick here. I did consider God of War 1 and 2, and I'm surprised you didn't pick those, Matthew, because that would have complimented 3 quite nicely, I think.
Yeah.
A very PlayStation-y kind of line-up. But if I have to fight back against Ico and Shadow Colossus, I'll just pick two of, you know, one of my favourite games of all time and one very contentious, interesting game that's still very fun on a replay. So MGS HD is Matthew.
We've discussed those games plenty on this podcast, though. So let's get to your final pick.
My final pick for racing.
I have no relationship with racing games on PS3. I'm going to take MotorStorm Apocalypse.
OK, fair enough.
Which is the follow up to MotorStorm Pacific Rift. Appears to be set in San Francisco as it goes through the apocalypse. Actually looks a little bit split second in like lots of shit collapsing around you.
It's kind of going for that sort of spectacular blockbuster vibes. Apparently that is a little bit annoying because like the collapsing tracks, it's a little bit like Lumbai Road. It's less of a, like even less of a technical racer, I guess.
But, you know, it's an exclusive. It looks kind of flashy. I'm betting big on people seeing two MotorStorm games next to each other and maybe not knowing the difference.
But listen, you got to do what you got to do to win the fucking draft.
Don't you like, haven't you played like Gran Turismo before? Is that not a thing you sort of, you've tuned into a little bit?
No, I find Gran Turismo very boring.
Fair enough.
That and Forza Motorsport, I'm just not into simier things or things which are about like, don't you love cars so much? Don't you love looking at cars? It's like, nope, I do not.
I'm not interested in cars in the slightest, unless Mario is driving.
Of course, or Donkey Kong. See, I thought for some of these categories, we didn't know them so well. You might fight back with something a bit different, like a Burnout Paradise or that sort of thing.
Yeah, but I just didn't feel in the spirit of the thing.
I see what you mean, yeah.
Multi-format game. There's no multi-format game that I would have picked that I don't associate more with 360. And I had to be honest, I had to be true to that.
So that's taken me to some pretty fucking dark places.
It has.
I'm not gonna lie.
The darkest journey you've been on in one of these drafts yet. But you may yet triumph with...
I don't know. Resistance and LittleBigPlanet's really upsetting me.
You haven't got LittleBigPlanet. I've got Resistance. Oh, sorry.
That's what I mean. The pairing of those.
But you are right. Resistance 3 is the one people like the most. I was doing a bit of research.
Yeah, but no one likes it.
Well, none of them.
It's like the one Resistance fan. Does he listen to this podcast?
I'll tell you what, actually. Some Resistance fan site faffed the fake categories on Twitter, which made me think they were up there.
They're so desperate.
They're out there somewhere, Matthew. They'll take anything they can get.
Desperate.
Okay, well, that's...
I'll count on them signal boosting this podcast.
Fair enough. Yeah, they may get hold of it and yeah, it may take off in your favor. So you can vote for the winner at Back Page Pod on Twitter.
So yes, we'll talk about the results at a later time. And I will add to the episode description who won further down the line so you can see in retrospect, in case you just listened to this by itself, this deranged podcast and thought, what happened there? So I'll put that in there.
But for now, Matthew, let's summarize what we picked for each of these categories, as people figure out who they're voting for. So for category one exclusive, I picked Uncharted 2 Among Thieves.
I got Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.
Category two, racing. I picked MotorStorm Pacific Rift.
I got MotorStorm Apocalypse.
Category three, Naughty Dog. I got The Last of Us.
I got the Jack and Daxter Collection.
Category four, Shooter or Platformer. I got Little Bit Planet 2.
Tough, I got Resistance 3.
Category five, PSN game. I got Journey.
I got Rain.
Category six, ill-advised six axis inclusion. I got Wipeout HD.
Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction.
Category seven, RPG or Action Adventure. I got Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch.
I got my favorite game ever, Demon's Souls.
That's a great pick. Category eight, wild card. I got 3D.GameHeroes.
I got Puppeteer.
Category nine, free pick. I got Persona 5.
I got Heavy Rain.
Category 10, has a superior PS4 version. Now I picked Uncharted 3, Drake's Deception.
I got God of War 3.
Category 11, bonus category. I got for HD collection, I got Metal Gear Solid HD collection.
I got Ico and Shadow of the Colossus HD collection.
Nice, you can vote for the winner at Back Page Pod. Thank you for listening. Thank you to Matthew for suffering through this.
I think it's been a fun podcast, Matthew. Yeah, it was fun. I look forward to, at some point you will allow us to do the Game Boy Draft.
That's the one I'm sort of pulling for. But you know, whenever you feel ready, pal. I know you want to be on-
It's a big mental block in my head now.
Yeah, and this one you were like, oh, whatever, I could just fly through this one. But Nintendo you don't fuck about, do you? So I get it.
This one was even more traumatic.
Okay, that was a lot of fun. We'll post this on BackpagePod, like I say, the pinned tweet for the next week, you can vote for the winner. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzill underscore pesto.
I'm Samuel Derby Roberts.
