Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how many Easter eggs did you eat this past weekend? Have you been racking up the casualties like I have?
I've literally eaten zero Easter eggs.
Damn. Is that because of your-
I've not had an Easter egg this year.
Is that because of your grievances with Jesus Christ? I can't remember what the deal is with you and Christianity, but-
No, I've been given some over the weekend, and I look forward to eating them, but I don't go out and buy Easter eggs while they're on the shelves and enjoy them early.
Right, yeah, that's fair enough. I've been eating them since January. Actually, if I would say it's like one per weekend.
It's like, I would say, just to stress, one pound 50 smaller ones. I haven't been buying the sort of like-
Sure, sure, sure.
10 pound mini egg infusions ones. Have you seen those where they basically, it's like an egg, but they've baked mini eggs into the crust of it, and it's like-
Oh, that's the thing now, isn't it, is the egg is, it used to just be a generic egg plus a chocolate product, and now it's the egg itself has to be a bit more interesting. So you get like a Terry's chocolate orange egg where the egg is chocolate orange, or one of my Easter eggs that I'm looking forward to eating is the extra chunky Cadbury's egg. So the egg itself is like thicker chocolate.
Damn, I don't think I knew that you could buy that one, and now it's too late, which is unthought. Yeah. The thing about how all Easter eggs are discounted after Easter, I think is a myth.
I've literally never seen that in Bath, discount Easter eggs.
No, I think they're all given to the staff and they take them home.
Exactly, yeah. Yeah, it's bollocks.
There was one year where I got loads of cheap tins of chocolates after Christmas.
Right.
And I've never seen it happen again. I think it must just be a perk of those jobs that you now get to first dips on the cheap Easter eggs and they're all gone.
I think that's fair enough. To have to put up with the people of Bath. That Sainsbury's has become particularly atrocious lately.
And if you notice that Matthew, the one in Bath, like the self-service checkouts, horrible, horrible. They've never got stuff on the actual tills. It's just a fucking disaster.
There was that time a few weeks ago that cards stopped working and they didn't even put a sign outside. So inside it was fucking pandemonium. I hate how much of my life I've spent on that.
The least they could do is sell you a Yorkie Easter egg for 50p after all that.
No, I want the staff to have first dips, but the only discount Easter thing I've got was Hotel Chocolat, just getting some assorted chocolate chickens or something like that for half price. And even then, I'm exaggerating, but 80 quid probably for three of those.
That's not exaggerating.
Yeah, definitely exaggeration there. You done anything fun over your Easter weekend? I went and saw Late Night with the Devil, that film that has some bad AI art in it.
So that was a thing I did. It was a bit of a three-star joint. That one, basically like fake 70s talk show horror.
I think it's become a bit of a viral hit in the US.
Why is that? What's special about it?
I think it's because the, I guess, like Holdover style, it sort of has that commitment to the aesthetic. It's sort of, well, even more so, I would say, because it's meant to be looked like a TV show.
Different energy.
Yeah, very much so, yeah. So it just, the sets and stuff like that, the characters, they look like they're in the 70s. And it's a talk show that's haunted, basically.
It's very much like, you ever seen Ghostwatch, the UK horror thing?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty good apart from, it has a lot of screaming cat sound effects, and I think we discussed that in the pod before. But it's got a bit of that, with a bit of whiff of Garth Morangy about it as well. It's a bit sort of like unintentionally goofy, or maybe intentionally goofy, I can't really tell.
But yeah, so, saw that, ate a big Magoo burger, and that really is it for the four days, to be honest.
That's all right.
Yes, it's been quite relaxed. But how about you? What have you been up to?
Yeah, I kind of did a circuit of different parents' houses to catch up with everyone before Easter and before my birthday. And had what happened that was of note, had some nice fish and chips. We had the obligatory, let's watch a film at my mum's house, which is always a bit of a tense situation, because all eyes are on me to kind of pick a good film, which is somehow going to appease both my mum's stepdad, little brother and his girlfriend.
And me and Catherine are on a similar kind of wavelength with these things, so I'm not too concerned about that. But trying to find a film which ticks all those boxes that everyone hasn't seen, that I wouldn't mind rewatching or watching for the first time is always tricky.
As hell as it is, Matthew.
Well, slightly controversial choice this time. We decided to watch Drive.
Oh, right. Well, you know, Drive is...
Well, I thought my little brother's into cars. My stepdad's got this whole thing where he's like, I don't want to watch anything American, but actually, as long as it's good, he'll, you know, he'll just sort of pipe down and enjoy it.
That's such a like man of his age thing to say.
Right, exactly.
It says, wary of things from America, the newer countries.
And yeah, my mom's quite into film. You know, she's pretty over-minded when it comes to film. So I thought, oh, I like this.
And I said to them beforehand, it's quite violent in places. And it's obviously not violent for quite a while, that film, like the first half, it's quite sweet-natured. You know, they were all sort of scoffing, like, oh, you think this is violent?
I was like, all right, well, you know, I've warned you. Like, there's some pretty extreme violence in this film. So I was quite pleased when it finally happened and it did seem to sort of disturb some of them.
It was like, good, you see, I was right. I was right to put that trigger warning on this film. As like the nth head gets stamped into mush.
And Christina Hendricks head literally explodes all over that bathroom wall. Spoiler alert for drive.
She has a tough time, that character, for sure.
Yeah, she's a rough old time. I don't think I've actually seen it since seeing it in the cinema.
Oh, it's so good. It's such an enjoyable rewatch.
The opening to it, the whole car, the heist thing, and then going into those credits with the Kavinsky, it's so fucking good. That's absolute endorphin overload, that opening, for me. I don't know if you find that.
I just think that's, yeah.
Yeah, I remember it being great. I only slightly lessened watching it in your parents' chintzy living room. So if I can see a floor print sofa at the same time, you know, you're not quite there in the underbelly of LA.
That's fine. Yeah, that soundtrack slightly tainted for me because when I was working at Future London is when Drive came out and either CVG or Total Film played that soundtrack on a loop in the office. Yeah.
I just associate it with like being quite stressed on a Vision and Dendo magazine rather than like coolly and calmly pulling off heists in LA. I associate it with me going, please send us another five screenshots of Sonic Boom, which has got a very different energy to Ryan Gosling in this film.
I hear it's like Uncharted meets Sonic, Matthew. So, you know, that's kind of where I read that.
So I was looking at Drive's Wikipedia page and something had completely passed me by. Radio 1 Rescored Drive, did you ever hear about this?
Yeah, it's a very cringe picture of Zane Lowe.
Why would they have done, why would you take a film which has got such an iconic and perfectly judged soundtrack and think, oh, I think I can do better than this with a load of British bands? And like the posing of it, oh my God. I felt mortified for him like 10 years after the fact.
Yeah.
That someone would do that.
There's mad hubris to that for sure. That's just like, it makes no sense. Why would you rescore something else like Zane Lowe rescores Cocktail with Tom Cruise?
You know what I mean? Like it's sort of, have a go at that or something.
I just, to like a film so much because of its music choices and go, the only way I can like truly pay homage to this is to remove everything I like about this film.
Yeah.
That's, oh, oof.
I think the funny thing is with Drive, I think someone on a Discord pointed this out, but there's, I think it had an original score that it was meant to be like really, really good. And then they took it out. It was like quite a, I can't remember who composed it, but it was sort of like, I think like the choice to use music was a bit of a late decision.
I think some of it remains, cause there's a couple of tracks on the soundtracks, which is it's someone jewel is the composer.
Right, right.
I think two of the original tracks remain in it.
Yeah. You just can't argue with those choices. I mean, so many of those tracks you would hear in fucking adverts and everywhere for like the next like five to 10 years, right?
It was just such a influential bunch of music. I think it's sort of like, I think it's sort of that synth wavy stuff. It's sort of, I think it's sort of forced it into the mainstream a little bit as well.
Just hit right is 80s nostalgia, I think was kind of cresting. And now we're sort of in more of a, I don't know, like 90s nostalgia phase, maybe even noughties a little bit. Although no Sun 41 Renaissance as of yet, Matthew.
So yeah, Drive, that's a good pick. I re-watched it last year as well. It's just, it's just really tight.
The thing is with-
So I just got, I just got draft flashbacks when you said good pick. That's what you usually say to me when I've just shit the bed in a draft.
Oh, do we ever talk about that?
So now I don't really know where I stand in this episode.
We never talked about me losing the PS1 draft, did we? Well, something we're gonna do next time, actually, is we're gonna try doing the poll inside the Discord in the announcements channel. So it will theoretically be a little bit less subject to Twitter's massive technical issues, where it would just seem to stop working for days at a time and then kind of like crawl up and down.
Yeah, but it will be all the Twitter weirdos trying to appease you because you're maybe a bit more present on the Discord.
I don't know, I think whenever you turn up, people act like it's a big event, you know what I mean? It's sort of, you get a lot of emoji reacts. I think you enjoy that as well.
You're like, I don't turn up often, but when I do, I get like rapturous applause. I think that's the sort of vibe of you being in the Discord. But yeah, so my last point on Nicholas Winding Refn.
It's a shame that like, I can't enjoy his films as easily as I can enjoy Drive. It's like Drive is his most mainstream thing still. And he has made some other good films, but his films just so, there's so many caveats to watching a lot of his stuff.
They're such challenging watches. Do you like any of his other stuff, Matthew?
I kind of maybe admire it more than like it. I like, I say I like again, watched the, was it a trilogy of films he made? Was it the-
Pusha?
Yeah, they're kind of impressively uncompromising. They're not good hangs. I don't know, has he really made another good hang outside of Drive?
I don't know if it's a good hang, but The Neon Demon's a really nice compliment to Drive, I think. It's actually, I think it's definitely the most sort of like, I don't know, consistent of his, I guess other than Bronson, consistent of his other films I've seen. But yeah, it's sort of like his most recent stuff, like that Copenhagen Cowboy show on Netflix, no one watched that.
He did that Amazon Prime show, Too Old to Die Young. That was a bit of a flop as well. He's just sort of like-
He did BBC's famous Five adaptation at Christmas.
Was that good?
I don't know, I didn't watch it.
Well, anyway, yeah, so yeah, Drive, it just seems to be, yeah, there's just something about it that's just, it goes down smooth, doesn't it, after all these years?
But yes, I enjoyed his work in Death Stranding as fucking giant heart man or whatever his name was.
Yeah, of course, he's one of the Kojima regulars. So that's it now, we'll just be encountering him in his games till the rest of the end of time. Okay, so what we've been playing episode, decided to throw you some mailbag questions into this one too, because you haven't answered some for a while.
And I was wary of the giant backlog of questions building up from the listeners. So a couple of big games to talk about, a few brief discussions to have around some other games too. And then, yeah, we'll get into some questions.
So we definitely wanted to give a chunk of time to Capcom's Dragon's Dogma 2, a long awaited sequel to basically open world sort of action RPG series where you go around fighting big monsters with AI companions, one of which is yours, and several of which you summon in from either your friends list or you hire them. They're called pawns. You hire them from basically like big lists either from PlayStation slash Xbox, kind of like players at large, or you can basically just like get your friends to join in.
So I'm explaining it badly there, but for example-
No, I thought that was quite a succinct description of a game which lots of people talk about as if it's incredibly hard to pin down when it really is not.
I keep calling it, and I mean this, in the nicest possible way, Dumbass Elden Ring. I think it's maybe because obviously in the years since the original Dragon's Dogma came out, From Software games have been such a huge deal that I think in some ways this game gives you the scale and thrill of taking on a boss, but the vibes are just so different. It's so much more playful and experienced.
For one, you can climb up most of the gigantic enemies. You could do this in the original Dragon's Dogma 2. That's got an incredible novelty to it.
It's the fact that the pawns, your AI companions are a mix of your friends' creations and your creation all bantering together. It creates this very odd feeling of this hacked together RPG party getting into misadventures. This game is determined to help you create fun stories with those characters as well.
Whether it's from those interactions or it's from battles where crazy stuff happens, like something exploding at a certain time, or a dam bursting and water coming down and flooding an enemy to finish off the battle. Sometimes these moments feel a little bit scripted, sometimes they are player prompted. But in any case, it has the combat chops of a From game.
It's maybe a little bit looser than that, but combined with the fact this very silly tone that makes it unlike anything else. It's very unpredictable narrative generating RPG. And by narrative, I mean just silly things happening, like I say, just comically ridiculous things.
Matthew, you've played much more of this than I have. I've played about 12 hours of it. I do really, really like it so far.
It's definitely shaping up to be a Game of the Year contender. How do you feel about it so far?
It's interesting when you sort of say like dumbass Elden Ring. I'd say it's like Elden Ring, but I actually like it.
Yeah, yeah.
The basic bitch-takers. It's a lot easier. I think it throws all this quite spectacular stuff at you and you last a bit longer in this game.
If you know what you're doing, you can last a bit longer. And so I anticipate every big encounter rather than dread as in Elden Ring. It's less open than Elden Ring.
I'd say it's less true open world. The structure of the map is quite a weird thing. It's sort of like a network of roads and countryside, either side of those roads.
But there's a lot of sort of impassable mountain walls. And once you've opened up most of the map, which I now have, there are great big patches of blackness, which are just nothing. There's just like, oh, there's just no level design there because you can't get to those places, which isn't something that happens in a Red Dead or a Skyrim.
There isn't just an impassable void in that is like two thirds of the map. So I think once you see that, you know, you sort of see that road pattern, the world begins to sort of shrink in your head. But I think what I like about it is that even though it's not there in terms of like acreage, I think there's a real density to this world.
There's a real level designer's touch to it, like none of it feels like a particularly organic or real place to me. It feels feels very, very authored, very, very intentional. And with that comes the kind of density that you might expect.
I mean, it isn't a Metroidvania, this game, but there is almost a dedication to sort of secrets and, oh, can I get up to these places with some of these strange porn abilities, so mainly the fact that you can have soldiers who can kind of like springboard people off the back of their shields, and you have mages and sorcerers who can levitate a little bit, and just with those tiny navigational skills, they can get you into some quite weird places, but wherever you go in this game, you will inevitably find a treasure chest. There's always that sense of Capcom saying, oh yes, we thought you would come here, and that's why there's a treasure here, or that's why there's something interesting here, or there's a cave here. I am constantly impressed with how often I've gone over the same old ground and uncovered new things with it, and that feels to me like quite artificial but pleasingly so.
The game might actually liken it to Fable more than anything else, in terms of its world design, because Fable isn't a true open world either. It's a series of town hubs and roads that join them. This is properly open in that there's no loading screens between anything, and there are moments of magic where it suddenly does feel much bigger.
I don't know if you've ever managed to ride a griffin, for example. There is big winged griffins that you fight, and it's sort of programmed into them. After they take a bit of a drubbing, they'll escape and then come back later to kind of pick on you.
But if you're on the griffin, because you can climb the enemies, as Samuel said, when it takes off, you can go for like a ride in the skies and see the open world from above. That is the magic of suddenly going to the Sky Kingdom in Tears of the Kingdom. Except here, that really is the only, there's only one way of doing it, which is, which is pulling off this quite dangerous trick with these griffins.
And I, I kind of like that it's a bit stingier with its open world magic. When it happens, it feels really like earned and sort of more impressive for it, or more exciting for it. Because you're like, holy shit, I'm up in the clouds, I've found the way to get into the clouds.
And that's what I mean about like, it's quite, it feels quite design. There's something quite old fashioned about it. Feels like everything, 95% of the cool things that can happen are, are kind of very much like designed to happen or baked in to happen.
There's some like weird physics around the edges, and there's the natural comedy of the pawns which allow those things to feel maybe a bit more emergent than they are. But I feel like it's a game the way, whatever I've played it, 70, 80 hours now, I think. I feel like I'm just constantly discovering the things Capcom have kind of placed there for me.
It's almost something kind of slightly Kojima-esque about it, you know, in terms of the, if someone thinks to do this interaction, let's make sure it actually does something. That's what I mean by baked in or kind of like pre-made or designed as opposed to, well, let's just hope something interesting happens in this place. I think that that's just the kind of game making that really speaks to me.
Yeah, I think, yeah, like you say, it's not true open world, it is essentially a series of winding interlocking corridors and towns. But like, like you say, I think that is designed to push you into these, you know, well, actually there are occasional like diversions from that, right, like caves off to the side and things like that, secrets to find. But it does feel like each of those cave areas when you go into them is designed in a certain way to give you a certain feeling to for the stakes to be high enough there to be this feeling of adventure with your pawns while they're nattering away.
And the other interesting wrinkle of exploring this world is that the pawns also have memories from their previous adventures with your friends or with whoever you've hired them from. And they will find secrets in the environment for you. They'll just they'll they'll they'll gesture that a chest is over here.
So follow me. Yes. So the pawn side of things, Matthew, let's talk about that because that is such a huge part of this game's appeal.
Every time people post videos of this, I keep feeling like I'm missing out on some kind of like big co-op experience. I have to remind myself, there are no other players in the game. It's just your AI companion who gets to join in on the fun in those games.
But I'm always like, oh, look at them having a big multiplayer kind of experience time. So no, no, no, Dragon's Dogma is not that game. It is the game where you spend it alone, but the pawns are created by your friends and therefore a certain amount of their personality may or may not come through.
And it's about how you're building this little kind of like ramshackle RPG party essentially. So how do you find the pawn side of things in this game? Because it really is the game's USP above anything else, right?
You know, I obviously knew quite a lot about them going in and knew that they're important. I think one of the key things I would say to anyone starting this game is to like give put thought into into their main pawn. Think of it as like, this is going to be my main sidekick for the game.
And don't just rush it off because, you know, what you inner effect ask to do is two rounds of character creation in a very deep complicated character creator. In terms of physicality, in terms of like classes and whatnot, it's a very simple game. And I think a lot of people spend ages on their avatar and then they're asked to make a main pawn about like half an hour later.
And then they be like, oh, fuck it, I'll just make it whoever. And I honestly think the more time and the more thought you put into that main pawn, the more interesting that relationship is going to be. So mine is is Randy Newman, the popular singer songwriter, doesn't really look like him.
I'm not very good at character creators, but he looks enough like him that I think the intention is clear.
The name, the name, Randy Newman helps.
The name, Randy Newman definitely helps in the fact that it's there in its full name with the space that that that really makes me laugh every time I see it. Like instantly I'm a little bit invested in this guy because if anything bad happens to him, I think, oh no, it's happening to Randy Newman. And we can talk about some of the some of the weirdest stuff that's happened there.
But so there's there's that. So I was already quite invested. And I think you can sense when you're in the void, other people who are like equally invested in their pawns because they've either made them into someone or they've done something interesting with them or they're, you know, there are a lot of generic just like that, like loads of people have just made themselves like a babe to be their sidekick.
And you're like, OK, like, I get that, you know, you know, creepy dudes give me creepy dudes and all that. But every once in a while, you'll find like an amazing Kratos or an absolutely like one for one likeness of Angelina Jolie. The idea of going on adventures with them is very, very appealing.
And that's what I think that you just project a lot more stuff onto them when there's some some stuff you recognize. But even like outside of the celeb likenesses, they've just got a huge amount of kind of character to them. Like the fact that they're all different, like heights and sizes, you know, the character creators creates like a huge number of variables to it.
A lot of interesting kind of things come out of it. I've had this pretty kind of generic porn called Mouse, who's a beastron, who's like a cat person in this world. And they're quite small.
But the person who made the porn, every time I rehired them, they've stuck with this like very thin rapier kind of sword. It just has a real visual identity to it. This little like nimble footed cat person with this quite quick blade.
I guess it's like a person in boots thing, I guess is sort of what they're going for. Even in that, like there's so much character in it, like I kind of, I do think of them as fondly as I thought of some like properly like written characters, even though they're just pulling from the same NPC barks as all the other pawns. You sort of see them doing their thing and the way they kind of express themselves in action and really convincingly so.
I think like the AI behaviour in this game, it kind of lives and dies by it and it's pretty amazing. Like they're so competent and they do cool stuff and they help each other out and that is part of the magic trick is you're constantly kind of going wow they really worked in tandem on that and it felt like they worked together to take that thing down and you know some of the classes are a bit more passive so you can feasibly end up in a party where the pawns are having to do a lot of the heavy lifting in like big fights and when they do it's that realism of behaviour combined with the oddity of either it being a celebrity look alike or quite an unusually crafted or curated character. I think it's such a good trick.
Yeah I really love it. It kind of saddens me when people are like oh these fucking losers just saying the same things over and over again. It's like oh I'm sorry the magic hasn't really worked for you because it really really has worked for me.
Like 80 hours in I love these guys and I curate my party quite carefully. You know it's always me and Randy Newman obviously. Ash Millman who I used to work with at Reach.
She's been playing it loads so she just had a really high powered mage and I wanted Randy Newman to be a sorcerer not a mage. So I wanted a mage in my party because they're better for healing. So she's been there.
Just this amazing mage kind of carrying my whole party for the last 20 hours and then I have a couple of warriors that I've liked that I kind of cycle in and out because the whole thing with the pawns you bring into the world is that they don't level up the lone pawns so you're encouraged to constantly replace them and you really should because part of the magic is seeing new pawns and hearing different voices. I think when people say, oh, I just keep hearing this thing over and over again, you know, I kind of want to say, have you actually changed the pawns though? Have you had the same pawn for 30 hours?
Because that's why that's happening, you know, that they say certain things because that is who they are. You know, if you change it for another pawn, you'll soon hear a diversity of voices.
I will say that no matter what you do, the NPC conversations are slightly deranged. But that's part of the game's magic. They're just a bit like, sometimes they're a bit like, it's been a while since we had a thief in our party.
Yes, it has. We should have a thief in our party kind of conversations. And you're like, no one would ever talk like this.
It has to build conversations out of basically a bunch of canned lines that it's got. And so it just results in these very odd exchanges sometimes.
So I've noticed when we went for pizza the other day, you did this dorky kind of porn voice impression. Oh, yeah. I think you've had a bad porn voice experience and it's shaped because I've not experienced this dopey voice yet.
I think I'm exaggerating it slightly. So basically, yeah, I suppose I should talk about my porn based experience. So my first question, Matthew, is why did you design Jeremy Peel as your main porn and call him Randy Newman?
Because he does look very similar to Jeremy Peel.
He's too young looking. That's the problem.
It is a problem. He does look like it's his first day of Hogwarts. Just sort of like a slightly smug wizard lad.
He absolutely overpowers the dynamic of all of my other pawns to the point where... So I did design a pawn like half-arsedly, right? I designed a beaster and called Douglas, right?
And he's a nice guy, but he's not like... I don't love him. I don't think he's amazing.
And I don't think he'd be any more... Having seen what people have been designing, I realize he's not even vaguely appealing compared to some of the other pawns that people have created. So that's tough.
But I don't mind Douglas regardless. He is my lion friend. I will stick by him.
Do you think that's how parents feel when they see other people's children and realize that other people's children are more interesting than their own children?
Definitely. Or they're like, I think that's my dad watching kids on sports day thrive ahead of me. You know what I mean?
Just sort of like, I wish those were my pawns slash children. So basically, yeah, I've designed this guy called Douglas. And I think just every now and then he just sounds a bit like a Wally.
He's just got quite a posh voice, but every now and then just sounds a bit daft. And again, I'm exaggerating slightly there. It's not quite that sort of comedic event to it.
But it just means that sometimes the conversations they have, they'll be like, so Douglas died, right? I abandoned him in a cave to get killed by goblins because I was going to die. And it was like, for the goblins, Douglas was an acceptable sacrifice while the rest of us escaped.
So off we go. When I brought him back to life, he sort of like, sometimes before they start talking, the pawns will say something like, I've been having this thought, they'll say something like that. And Douglas is like, I've been having this thought.
I didn't like it when I died. It wasn't those exact words. And then like fucking Randy Newman, who is like smug sort of posh private schoolboy energy, this is not the literal words that are being used, but those are the kinds of conversations they have.
It's just a bit like being in a long car journey with like just people where you're like, pipe it down lads.
Yeah, that is, I was gonna say like the energy of the pawns chatting, because you don't speak to them yourself. So the Risen, who you play as, doesn't speak. So it does have the energy of like a dad driving the car and three people just talking, like three children talking bullshit to each other in the back the whole time.
And occasionally you tune out, and occasionally you catch a bit of it and you think, oh, what are these idiots talking about? Like, oh, it's so weird, they're so weird. At the point I'm in the game now, because the pawns have, I'm at such a level that the pawns have probably multi-classed at some point, or been different things.
They talk a lot about what they once were, like they're nostalgic for the early stages of the adventure, where they're kind of like, oh, I used to be a mage and I was really good at it. And the other one will be like, oh, really? I used to be an archer.
And little conversations like that. And I just like that the accelerated kind of nostalgia cycle, you know, that's what people are like, but they've done it in like 50 hours, they're already they're already looking back on how good things used to be at level 10. I find that incredibly charming.
It makes me laugh every time. How do you feel about the whole, A Pawn Comes Into Your World with their experience? Because obviously, Randy Newman comes from a far more completed save file than yours.
And I'm interested if you find that overbearing or if it's robbing you of experiences or if you like what he brings to the mix.
Yeah, so it's a double edged sword, I would say. So the other thing that's worth noting here is you have the separate currency for hiring pawns, right? And if you hire a pawn who's not on your friends list, you will end up spending this currency.
But if they are on your friends list, you basically get free access to them. Yeah, so I hired Matthew's Randy Newman pal straight away, and he was pretty good. He would set fire to things.
He was a mage at that point, so he would heal other units, sorry, other units, other pawns and me. So he was useful for sure. And I actually think the game is calibrated around you needing a bit of a leg up in the early stages.
I think you just, your lack of sort of stamina and strength just means that you're struggling to get things killed. And so when you bring in these characters, I think they are actually an essential part of calibrating the difficulty because you can sort of like pick the setup that works for you. So on my friends list, I've got two friends who have got really good pawns.
I've got you and I've got Ian Dixon, who works for Capcom. And he's built, he's created one of the Chuckle Brothers, I think Barry Chuckle. And so I've got, at the moment, my party is Douglas the Beastron Wally.
I've got Randy Newman and I've got Barry Chuckle. And I would say Randy Newman absolutely overpowers the dynamic there. So he is always running off to get chess.
He's like, I've been here before, I know where this chest is. And then he just kind of runs off and you have to follow him for about 18 minutes. And it's just this little curly hair and it's sort of like how short he is, this schoolboy vibes and just like, man, this guy is like such a tough hang.
And like, I had these grievances with you over pizza. But he is incredibly useful. And you told me over pizza, you were like, oh, if you just miss him and rehire him, I've leveled him up loads since then, he properly fucks things up now.
And it's true, he is like, he's now so powerful. It's like, I was thinking of that Omen-esque kid from Looper, who does all this crazy gravity powers. Randy Newman is like the Rainmaker.
Randy Newman is like the Rainmaker now. He will properly fuck things up. I kind of love this because I'm over a barrel where I don't think he's a good hang, but he's too good knocks to have.
Yeah, depending on him.
Yeah, exactly. So I think I could play the game with a lower set of pawns if I wanted to. But truthfully, I don't mind having a slightly more comfortable experience with the pawns.
I think that's actually like a privilege to enjoy as a player and you don't have to do it. But it's not like I don't find the game challenging even with those pawns.
It has a great power curve to it because at the point I'm at now, like I'm quite powerful, all my pawns are quite powerful. And like monsters we used to dread, we absolutely fucked them up. And that is part of the pleasure is seeing how differently those fights play out.
You know, it's no longer 10 minutes of nervously dealing with a cyclops. It's we see a cyclops and that thing is gone in 90 seconds. And that's completely intentional.
It's also the defence I would make of the game's enemy range, which I know some people are down on there. Like this is a game where you walk along the same roads and the same like five enemy types come and get you. But while that is true, those situations don't change dramatically as the game goes on.
What does change is you and your pawns. And I think the game encourages you to be quite throw away with pawns. Like you chuck old pawns out, get new pawns in, they're going to bring new classes.
Within the classes, you can only equip four skills at any time. So every pawn you get, that's a mage. They're going to be a slightly different mage to the other mages.
And so you get to see slightly different spells, slightly different behaviors every time. You can max out a class pretty quickly in this game. This isn't a game where you start off as a warrior and you'll be a warrior for 100 hours.
Like you're meant to max out a class, move on to the next class, max it out, move on. You're meant to mix it up as you see fit. You know, I'm about, like I say, about 70, 80 hours in.
I've maxed out four classes and I'm about halfway through another three classes. Like I've changed it up. So actually, when I do encounter the same enemies, it's not like, oh, it's these guys again, because I'm a completely different person.
Playing against enemies as an archer is very, very different. Playing as a mage, a soldier, a warrior, a trickster. Have you encountered the trickster yet?
It's fucking weird. No. It has no offensive abilities.
It has no attack power at all. But all it can do is bamboozle people with incense to make them fight each other. So it's like a complete support passive class.
Really powerful if you can make it work. I think it's a bit of a miss for me, because everyone else is having an amazing fight and climbing all over a fucking griffin or a dragon or whatever. And you're running around the outside wafting one of those little church incense burners.
And you can't help but feel like lame as shit. The whole thing hinges on you make this smoky effigy, this incense effigy of yourself. And then when you throw incense in people's faces, it makes them want to attack the smoke effigy.
So you can use it to distract people, but later on you get the ability to tag the... You can make this smoke effigy ride monsters, so you can make monsters attack each other, because they're trying to attack, if that makes sense. So if you get two ogres, you can make the ogres fight each other by basically possessing one with the effigy.
So that stuff's quite cool, but it's a bit of a tough hang because the other powers are so dynamic and fun. The classes generally in this game are pretty excellent in terms of physicality and arcade feel. It's made by the Devil May Cry team.
It's got those kind of action chops behind it. So the idea of just sort of being a slightly weird, smelly incense man from a distance is like a pretty hard sell.
I bet it's cool that it's in there, right?
You can unlock some quite good classes early on that I missed. You know, like I was about 50 hours in going, when the fuck am I gonna get the Mystic Spear hand? And it's like one of the opening villages.
It was just there from the start and I just missed it. Because it's that kind of get, it doesn't have any fear in hiding that stuff away. It doesn't need to drip feed everything to you, which is quite cool.
I wanted to ask, have you encountered anything to do with Dragon's Plague?
No, I haven't. But I have, the pawns are talking about it constantly.
Yeah. They are.
So I feel like it's going to happen at some point. And then I read some story on PC Gamer about how it can sort of like take out a whole village or something like that. So this is some kind of disease where your pawn goes evil, right?
Is that basically what it is?
It's a mechanic that is sort of deliberately vague. I think it's vague by design in that you're not really meant to know like how you catch it or what it does. Reading those stories about, oh, this is what it is.
It sounds like people would kind of understand it like 90%. It still feels as if there's a bit of mystery to like exactly where it comes from and how it spreads and how you get rid of it. It's kind of got the feel of like an in-game urban legend because there is an element of like, if your porn has it, a cure for it, so people say, is to infect another porn and pass it on like the ring.
So there might be that. No one really knows. All I know is that I had a very upset text message from Ian at Capcom saying, your Randy Newman porn is infected.
And I just thought I'd let you know that he's in my game being all infected and, you know, it had a slightly cross undertone to it. I'm not going to lie. So it was kind of like, why didn't you take better care of this?
And like, you've allowed your infected porn to go roaming. And the whole thing is, it's not obvious. One of the indicators is that their eyes will occasionally glow red.
Right, right.
I've been using photo mode to pause and look at Randy Newman's eyes. Like that's the best I can check. I can't get close enough to him at any other way to see.
But then they only glow red some of the time, apparently.
How recently did he contract this, Matthew? Because I did dismiss him and rehire him. Like, will he have it now?
This is part of it. I don't know how long it's been dormant if he's got it. I'm pretty sure he does have it.
And he kept saying like how strong he felt. And I thought that was just because I'd leveled him up so much. I was like, oh, that's cool.
Every time he said it, I was sort of filmed with a warm glow of fatherly pride. But now I associate it with, oh no, he's going to kill everyone. Like I've made this like psycho guy and I don't really know what to do about that.
And so I was looking online. I've been trying not to read around the game. So I want to kind of discover everything for myself.
Cause I was like, well, I, at the same time, if Ronin is going to kill all the NPCs in a village, which I think is something that can happen, like that will kill all those quests line. I don't want that to happen. So I was just trying to find out like, what do you do if you're porn, if you think your porn has Dragon's Plague, like there's no cure for it.
People suggest they're like, if you kill it, and like, if you kill your main porn once, that doesn't really mean much because you just bring them straight back. I've now had this quite awful routine where every time Ren Newman does anything that suggests he's a bit plague-y, I drown him. I throw him into the six.
No one in this world can go in water. It's like instant death. And so I pick him up and I throw him into the sea and he drowns and then I bring him back to life and his eyes aren't red and he seems normal.
But then he inevitably starts talking again about how powerful he feels. So I drown him again. And I don't know if this is now just like my life in this game, but it's quite traumatic having to like throw one of your favorite musicians of all time into a river every few hours because you're scared.
Slash Jeremy Peele, yeah.
Because you're scared that he's gonna like kill everyone one day because you're making people change him. I can't get rid of him. You know, like if you've got a visiting pawn who's got Dragon's Blade, you just dismiss him and never bring him back.
But him, like I'm stuck with him. And I don't know if like Chuck Eamon, I don't know if this drowning routine is actually helping him. It's very prestigey to me because I feel like I've drowned this guy like 10 times and brought him back to life.
And I feel like something's going to have changed deep down in our relationship.
Yeah.
So I kind of, yeah, I've seen some people go like, this is fucked, it's fucking, how could Capcom put in something so stupid, so vague, so dangerous? You know, like it's kind of thrilling to have this relationship, which is so rock solid. And then you begin questioning it to the point where you're like, I think I have to drown this guy over and over again, because I'm scared of what he might become.
But I'm also scared of what he might become if I keep drowning him, because I don't know if that will change the nature of our friendship, or if he'll be less inclined to help me or whatever. I would say that's a good mechanic, because it makes me think that he's quite weird things.
Yeah, I guess that you don't really know, though, if the drowning's helping, right?
No.
No, so it could just be that it has no bearing whatsoever, and instead you're just traumatizing yourself in order to give yourself some kind of mental comfort, basically.
Yeah, my really dark thought for a while was that when I learned about the whole, they can pass it on to someone else, and that's valid. When you go into the, when you summon pawns, there's a leaderboard of most popular pawns, and because I'm a jealous sort and I'm looking at how popular some of these pawns are, I'm like, shall I just hire one of these popular pawns and actively try and infect them with this dragon's play to spread it to everyone else? Like, just to like, I want to curse their pawn with this dreadful disease, but that's just so dark.
That's a dark thought.
That makes me think, shall I just get rid of Randy then? Like, is he just gonna make Douglas? I mean, I don't like Douglas that much, but you know what I mean, like, yeah.
There is a question of etiquette of like, when Ian informed me he thought Randy Newman was ill, that was kind of him, because I hadn't even thought that that was a thing that could happen to him yet.
It's like telling a sexual party you've got chlamydia, you know?
It is exactly that. Do I now have to tell you and Rob and other people I'm friends with on PlayStation that Randy Newman, this incredibly powerful sorcerer, is likely to fuck up their game in some way? I likened it on Twitter to Michael Scott going around telling everyone he had herpes in the US office.
It just kind of has that vibe.
My guess is there will be some cure for it, but it will be really hard to get or difficult to sort out. There will be some cure for it because it would be too annoying to... Because in theory every single porn ever will get it at some point and then no one will be cured and it will just be the dominant state of the game.
So it must have a cure.
I think the thing that triggers the true disaster is if you stay in an inn. So I think you have got a basic out of like, well, I'll just never camp in an inn, it's staying in an inn again.
Right, yeah, okay.
But that is sad because I do like a good night's sleep in an inn.
Yeah, same. The other thing is that I actually think that you're Randy Newman becoming sort of infected with this. It's perfect for his sort of like cursed overbearing vibes.
To me, that's like the perfect conclusion to his character arc as a guy who talks over everyone else and going, well, I know where this is and we're going over here now. I've been here before, I did this. And I've always found that so irritating.
So the idea he's now become, I'm incredibly powerful, kind of completes his sort of like Damien from the Omen arc. You know what I mean? Like it's sort of spot on really for the child of the devil.
I hope you dismiss him and then Douglas starts saying, I'm feeling so powerful all of a sudden.
I'm like, no, you're not Douglas. You are my fail son, Beastron. You don't know shit, my friend.
The other funny thing is though, Randy Newman is so overbearing that Barry Chuckle is completely pushed out of the conversation. Like I feel like he never really weighs in. He's never really the center of the dynamic because Randy Newman's always going, well, I've been here before and I know where this is.
And so he just doesn't really get a look in. This is obviously soft-spoken kind of Northerner. And I've basically got like a guy who sounds like the son from the sitcom, My Family on BBC One, just sort of like taking us everywhere.
And then my Wally Douglas just sort of like with his sort of buffoon voice. It's kind of like, yeah. It's like that thing where they're bad hanks, but they're my bad hanks, you know?
And so, and therefore I think it's okay that they are bad hanks. Really good game, isn't it? The other thing actually I think that's worth discussing from what you pulled out there is, I think the lack of clarity in the objective sometimes, or where to go, or what to do, and how certain systems work is intentional, and is very, I think, very enjoyable.
But you can see it hurting the brains of people who are used to being told where to go for every side quest, having markers for every side quest, and every secret of every world shown to them. But I think this actually is in line with where things are going, which is a little bit more towards discovery. I think Elden Ring's massive success has proved that people want to have more that feeling of discovering things themselves and not always understanding how things work.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's the direction of travel with this genre.
Yeah, I think that's right. And so yeah, so I find that quite appealing. That said, I haven't gotten so deep into it yet that I've been truly bamboozled by some things.
I know people have talked about how they sold a sword and you needed that for a certain class and that sort of thing. And yeah, so I think some of its systems are just obtuse and maybe that's caused some frustration. But the overall experience of playing it is quite unlike anything else.
I think it's, I've got a really good feeling it's gonna be on that game of the year list. How about you?
Yeah, 100%. I absolutely love this game. I'm gonna play more of it today.
Feel like I'm getting quite far through it. Feels like it could actually be, it feels like you could rinse the main storyline in probably like 20 hours. But there's just so much like side shit you wanna do and like leveling up all the classes and just discovering stuff because it isn't a game which lays anything out.
There's no indicator of like, you're 57% of the way through the story or you've collected 10 of the 50 shrines. There's like none of that. The only system it has, which is close to that is there are these little like seeker tokens and there's like 220 of those in the world.
And I have like 20 of them. That's like an indicate, you know, if there's any indicator of like how you are somehow progressing in this game. Yeah, very, very, very refreshing.
Though I also appreciate that. Most of what it does, Dragon's Dogma 1 also did. And so there's a little bit of like late to the party on this, but I just think the tech's here now to do it better.
And it just, you know, it feels better, it looks better. It makes more sense. I played a decent chunk of Dragon's Dogma 1 and I'm finding this just a much more enjoyable game.
So Capcom cooking it again. So yeah, I think it's that thing as well where there is some big end game component to this, right? Because there was something in the review restrictions about don't discuss the end game of this.
So there is, because I remember when Joe came on the podcast, I think he described what happens at the end of Dark Arisen to us. And we were a bit like, wow, I can't remember what it was now, but do you remember that happening? I remember that happening.
Yeah, there's some stuff about like ascending to some kind of godhood in the original game, I think.
Right, right. And so there is something else waiting at the end of this, but yeah, haven't necessarily reached it yet. I think there's other stuff that has happened with Capcom games in the years since the original Dragon's Dogma that like benefit this one.
For example, the quality of voice acting, that's just been so high since. It feels like Capcom's been working with like maybe this one company that does localization and cut scenes and stuff. And that's why you've had like loads of these really good English language voice actors and things and good motion capture and stuff like that.
And so I think it just helps that the voice acting is so good, even with sort of basic NPCs you encounter out in the world. So yeah, like it's presentation wise, I think it's definitely come a long way since that first game. Okay, I'll keep playing it Matthew.
And because I don't think loads else is gonna come out now before the end of the year. So there's plenty of time now to catch up with all of the many, many games that have dropped in the first few months of this year. Another of which Matthew is Rise of the Ronin on PS5, which you have been playing.
And wasn't really on my radar, but then you said to me, it's like slightly easier Sekiro and it's quite silly. And therefore that makes it quite appealing. So this is an open world game from Koitecmo who are very prolific.
They've made a bunch of games that I would say are in this vein that kind of like from games, but with way more loot systems and otherwise have like a lot of big monsters in them. And people seem pretty fond of them. They all seem to sell all right or do okay with reviewers.
So they've sort of like been tracking along with those. This is a PS5 exclusive, it's come along. And yeah, you seem to be having more fun with it than I think you were expecting.
Yeah, absolutely. Like I've bounced off their Souls likes in the past, their Neos and Wulong. This has a lot of the same vibe, a lot of the same systems in it.
You know, it has all the mad loot drops from Neo. It has the quite fierce difficulty of a Souls like. Two things that I think really help.
One, it's based in quote unquote real life, you know, historical period. When Japan is sort of debating, sort of opening up, it's sort of borders to Americans turn up. There's a lot of turmoil and the country's kind of deciding, you know, what its future is gonna be and you know, does it deal with the West and what does that mean for itself?
And because of that, it doesn't have like the fantastical elements. It's not a grim dark fantasy game. It's not full of demons and unpleasant monsters.
You know, you're fighting other swordsmen and that is a fantasy that just naturally speaks to me a lot more. You know, there are some slightly more, you know, there is like some giant people who are quite unrealistic, but it's within the realms of realism. And the other thing is, I think because it is a Sony first party game and like financed by Sony, they've been a bit more aware of difficulty in it.
You know, it isn't absolutely uncompromising. There are multiple difficulty options within those, there are lots of user accessibility functions. So you can kind of tweak it to be your difficulty.
So I don't know if within it, there is a Sekiro difficult game, but there is a game which feels close enough to Sekiro, but I can actually do, which obviously gives it big bonus points. Has a slightly more generous stealth component than Sekiro. Once it all kicks off and people are fighting you, it becomes a very delicate game of parrying and breaking people's stances to then absolutely devastate them, which is why I liken it to Sekiro.
But around that, there is a bit more, you can approach things from multiple angles, because it's an open world game. You have this glider, so you can float into villages, land on a rooftop and then start hooking people off the ground with a rope. It's never as clean as an Assassin's Creed.
You know, this isn't that mass mainstream stealth, it's still a little janky and it feels like it's designed to be stealth up to a point and then it kind of wants you to actually engage with its quite deep combat systems. So, you know, I don't think you can just sort of go from bush to bush whistling and doing instant kills. There's nothing like that.
But that just puts it as this quite interesting, sweet spot of like historical period I'm interested in. Open world game, but with this absolutely lethal team ninja combat system that when you're getting those parries right, just feels really good. You know, that has always been a skill of that team.
Yes, it's got all this loot stuff. I'm not particularly into that. And the fourth kind of pillar of it is it has a, as all games do now, has a big social component to it.
So you are befriending lots of characters on both sides of this debate of like Japan's future, the kind of pro-Western forces and the anti-Western forces, basically. And you're making all these allies, you do these side missions with them where you get to know them a bit better. They're all quite good hangs, those missions.
They're almost a little bit like the Red Dead friendship loyalty missions. You get to spend a lot of time with these historic figures and go on little adventures with them. And I quite enjoy that.
But you also get to like hang out with them at your house and like, you know, give them presents and take them to places. So it's got a bit of that persona relationship making. And that should be a little like hokey and out of place.
But the idea of trying to become best buds with all these, you know, semi-famous figures from the time, I think that's what gives it a bit of that like goofiness I was talking about. Cause it's just like, oh, I'm giving these, you know, it's Commander Matthew Perry who led the American forces and you're giving him like boxes of chocolates so that he'll be best friends with you and let you wear his like special coat or whatever. And whether it's intentionally silly or not, I don't know.
So shouldn't work. And it maybe takes a little while to emerge. Like it maybe feels like it's just gonna be quite a difficult Team Ninja Neo-esque game for the first five hours.
But I think once the open world starts opening up and you can start leveling up beyond the difficulty curve by doing side activities, it becomes like a pretty good hang. Dismissed by Alox, it looks a bit ropey. It's not cutting edge graphics.
It looks like a decent third party PS4 game, probably, is where I'd place it.
Well, that's a lot of games this generation to be fair.
Yeah, but there's something quite plasticky enough about it. But what other of those Ubisoft map icon games have combat as good as any Team Ninja game? They just don't.
And that really makes the difference. When you are clashing samurai swords, katanas with people and you parry five shots in a row and then in one slice take off their head, you're like, that's fucking rad. That just feels better than any Assassin's Creed combat system ever has.
I think a lot of people would actually have a good time with this, but you know, maybe pick it up when it's like 40 or 50 quid in like eight years time or something.
Is it one of those sevens, Matthew?
When it's at its very best, it's just a legitimately great action game. When the combat clicks and you're kicking off, you're like, yeah, this holds its own with any good Team Ninja action game. But I just think it has a slight jankiness and like naffness to it.
And it's slightly sort of stayed in a way which is a little bit seven out of 10. Yeah, for sure.
What's it have kind of going on open world-wise then? So how does it sort of like get around, fill your time, that sort of stuff?
Yeah, well, it's pretty standard. The map is split into regions and every region has landmarks you can discover. There are cats to collect.
She's stupid. You collect cats for this lady in Yokohama. So yeah, you're always finding these cats hidden in caves and shit, which is a bit naff.
There's like photography tasks, the old classic. I'm gonna describe something. You have to go and take a picture of it.
So like, you know, your classic Riddler Trophy stuff, I guess. And the main thing is there are towns which are kind of under siege by bandits. So you're outposts basically, and you have to go and clear those out.
But again, I just say the variety of those towns are designed to be quite interesting self-contained combat challenges. You don't just get to them and go like, oh, it's templated town number four. It's, oh, this one, there's a load of guys on the rooftops.
So I've got to think about that more carefully. This one's better catered to stealth. This one is just, let's just go in and chop up a load of weaklings with a sword.
And it does a good death, this game. So, you know, you see a town full of bandits and you think, oh, great. I'm just gonna go and chop a load of arms off.
That's fun. You know, that's the thing I'm here to do fundamentally. So it's just more of what the game does well.
It's easy to just go, oh, it's another Ubisoft map, isn't it? And it's all very reductive conversation around that genre these days, but there are subtleties to it.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I like the idea of any combat system that's even vaguely intricate. I think that just always gives these things more life.
So yeah, I will keep it on my radar. It did, I think you showed me some of the character greater stuff, Matthew, and you were like, oh, this is a bit sillier than I realized it would be.
Yeah, so it has something of Dragon's Dogma in it in that at the start you play like a pair of assassins. Sometimes when you're with allies, you can switch between them in combat. So you can kind of jump around your party, but that only really comes into play in certain story missions.
You can also do those story missions in co-op online, incidentally. Yeah, but when you create these characters, one of the characters ends up being, you end up playing as one, and one is sort of your antagonist for the game. And obviously, if you create one of them looking like a complete clown, then that antagonist will look like a complete clown.
And every time they turn up, you're like, oh, why the fuck did I make this guy look like such an asshole? So I kept the, it's like a brother, I don't know if they're brother or sister, it's a man and a woman anyway. And I kept the woman as the generic in-game model.
The guy, I just put a load of face paint on him. I literally like gave him a big white face and big red lips. And now whenever he turns up, I'm like, oh, this fucking goof.
It really undermines the drama of the situation because it's like, remember me? And it's like, yeah, how can I fucking forget you, you fucking joker cosplaying motherfucker? Like, this is just ridiculous.
Amazing. Yeah, that's very much like the sort of like inverse of me with Douglas, where he's so unremarkable that I just look at him and I'm like, oh, please just, I'm sick of you, Douglas. But instead, you've got to be like slightly appalled by the consequences of your actions every single time.
Okay. Good stuff, Matthew. So Rise of the Ronin.
Yeah, I think I'll keep that on my radar for when it's a little bit cheaper. I'll probably pick that up. So I thought I'd talk a bit about Helldivers 2, because this is the big game of the year, isn't it?
This is still selling on Steam. It's apparently sold something ridiculous at 8 million copies. It's just a massive, massive hit, a crossover hit.
There are people who I know that have bought this who never play multiplayer games. I think it's really just extended beyond the usual crowd for this stuff.
I heard two blokes, random blokes, talking about it in a pub the other day. Well, I just overheard this thing. I thought, oh, man, it sounds like they could be talking about Helldivers.
And then one of them said, like, a particular piece of equipment. I was like, oh, my God, how big is Helldivers that these randos are talking about it? That never happens.
Yeah, that's it. And I think at first I was a little bit like, well, I want to play this, but also people were being really overzealous about it. And I think just people just like, oh, my God, I've never played anything like this before.
And then there was obviously those server queues. So there's a little bit of FOMO going on with actually just getting into a game. And so I waited a little while until that died off and things became a little bit more reasonable.
And I'm glad I did, actually, because it is really, really good, but its magic is quite unusual in the sense that I think the way you interact with your friends is more key to the game's personality than the way you interact with the enemies or the environment or the objectives. It's kind of all about how your personality manifests, I think, in the form of how your character behaves and the situations you can get into, because obviously it has a sort of friendly fire at all times element to it. So if you have a flamethrower and you downslose these bugs that are swarming on you and you set fire to a friend, they are also on fire.
And so there's this very much-
And speaking from experience here, it sounds like.
Oh, definitely, yeah. Like I think that I would say the groups of people I've been playing with, it's all about how do I fuck with my friends? And that's, it goes all the way back, I think, to Halo multiplayer, where you club a fellow master chief on the back of the head.
And it's just ridiculous, but that is how we used to play Halo, just like attach little grenades to people, blow each other up. Like the way me and my friend Andrew, protagonist of Final Fantasy VII, would play Halo, very much in that vein. So it's actually been quite, it's quite rare to encounter other games that really do that, that really give you systems that support that.
And I think as a result, Helldivers 2 is just brilliant at creating these kind of narratives. You see people posting clips where they're like, oh yeah, I landed on my mate's head when I respawned and that sort of thing. And like the other day, I just, there's a situation that we created that was kind of like, I guess, ad hoc sort of role play.
So basically we were right at the end of a mission and we had one respawn left and three of us wiped at the same time and I couldn't come back from the dead, neither could another friend but my one friend, but former colleague of mine, Alex, could come back. And I heard him let out this, hey, hey, hey, because he was, he knew he was going to get off the planet and get the bonus for completing the mission. And I wasn't.
But my friend, my other friend, Will, was still alive and I ordered Will to execute Alex so he couldn't get onto the plane to escape and he did. And I felt, I felt such an endorphin rush from having caused that. And I realized, and like I said to Alex, that your only mistake was letting out the hey, hey, hey, otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered.
But I was like, he knew he was the only one who was going to respawn out of the three of us and get the bonus. And I was like, he has to die. Like I said now, his life is forfeit.
He has to die.
I'd love to see the court case in Courage Under Fire, except it's for this, this, this military trojan.
Yeah. But like, wait, he laughed.
You're like, yeah, he laughed. So I ordered someone else to kill him.
It was just so good. It was just this, like he was just trying to sort of die roll away. And then my friend, we were stood in front of like the on ramp for the, for the evacuation craft and then just like, yeah, just got him and I was like, yeah, this is the best thing that's ever happened.
And I think that's, that's it. It's like a whole game of how you used to fuck with your friends in Halo 3 co-op. And like at the same time, I mean, obviously like the, I think the shooting and is, is, is pretty decent.
Like fighting the bugs is better than fighting the robots. I think most people kind of agreed on that. The robots are, look amazing actually.
There are some, sometimes this, this game looks like the opening of The Terminator 2. I think you made that analogy Matthew.
No, it's a good analogy.
It just has that very specific aesthetic of like red lights and when it's dark and like misty it just looks like you've always wanted like another film or game to have that aesthetic but nothing's ever really got close to it. It's just such a precise sort of like visual palette and this game gets pretty close to the robots but fighting the bugs it feels like the essence of the game in a lot of ways. I've reached a point now where I've got the flamethrower which is where I think the game really opens up.
So much of the game's progression is tied up in the FOMO of what other people have that you don't have yet because it's level gated so you know you're building up to a certain weapon or whatever.
The thrill also though of occasionally scavenging something that's way beyond you, you know like someone dies and then they drop their special little laser backpack or whatever and you're like fucking yes this is it I'm gonna have a little try before you buy.
That is exactly it. The really funny one and I sort of like I was playing with a friend of a friend who was like level 50 or whatever I think it's I think level 50 is as high as you can go or 30 or something like that and he had the mech right which they let people play around with for free when they first added it to the game and it's like the only vehicle in the game and so I would say that he was using the mech as a sort of status symbol. He brought it to every single battle and got in it and it's like yeah I've put in the work look at my mech.
He had that kind of vibe to it which I thought was quite funny but it did also mean I was maybe intentionally calling in airstrikes to try and get the mech blown up because I thought it would be funny and so I just don't think I've played another game in recent times that lets you manifest your sort of like psychotic tendencies like this one does. How much do you think the appeal of the game is that versus oh it's a really cool co-op shooter thing?
I mean that's playing with your friends. If you were playing like that with strangers I think people would hate that. I've mostly played it with strangers, I don't have lots of PlayStation friends, you know, queue world's tiniest violin.
I think what that taps into and basically how I feel about it is it's there's something quite low stakes and throw away about it. Like it doesn't really feel like any of it really like matters too much but in a good way you know if you win you're like great if you lose you're like oh we all got blown up or bugs ate us or whatever and you can't win anything you can't really be better at it you can't really have this like leaderboard there's no like status symbols apart from maybe having like a shinier cloak or you know the ability to constantly rub a mech in someone's face and because of that every game I play with strangers I go in and just see oh what's gonna happen in here I just go with the flow sometimes it's chaotic sometimes there's an asshole and we kill them and that feels quite good sometimes someone who kills me I'm like the art of the accidental kill which is just such a dark bleak thought in this age of like you know all these terrible war crimes you hear about the idea of like how can I how can I kill someone make it look like an accident using all this very advanced military tech like that is a sinister headspace to be in but you are like well I could have feasibly thrown a grenade that direction or if I throw this here do I think the spread of this will This will catch that guy on the end who I've been trying to get rid of because he keeps accidentally killing me. And that's quite fun.
You know, you've blown it when, because I tend to play, like, not a lot of people on the mics, but if you get really cross, people will get back on mics. And then they're like, what the fuck, dude? What the fuck did you just do to me?
And you're like, oh shit. I obviously didn't disguise it well enough.
I don't want to play it with strangers if that's the experience. Like, anytime I see that little fucking mic symbol come up in the bottom left corner, I'm like, oh, fuck off. I don't want to hear you talking.
That's how I feel about any time that I'm playing a game in there.
Weirdly, it feeds into the fantasy of a little bit. Like playing the game and hearing just like a load of like, often sort of quite dumb, you know, just shrieking Americans actually feels like this is the pool of people this fictional army would enlist from. So here are these people like, no bro, there are so many bugs.
And you're like, yep, this is right. This is what Starship Troopers is like. So yeah, I think it's like unintentional satire.
Yeah, that's so good. I've got a couple of other funny situations that have happened in this game, Matthew. I thought I'd raise it.
First of all, we should just play together if you fancy it, because I am game for that. I've got a PS Plus membership. I'm down for this game while it's kind of like, you know, while it's hot.
And I think it's got some real legs on it. It's at the core of this is quite a precious thing, I think it's just a great, like you say, relaxed core, a top experience in a really like fun template with a lot of great possibilities to it. So I do hope it sort of like keeps sticking along.
I'd like to come back to it in just a few months and see what we sort of keep adding to it because I think it's got a lot of potential. So another funny thing that happened, I won't name the friend, right? But I was playing this with a friend one morning and we're right near the end of the mission.
And like, he sort of like, I could hear his wife in the background go, are you done? We've got to go out and he called it.
Very unsympathetic impression of someone's wife.
Sorry, the voice wasn't meant to be his like dismissive.
What is it like when you're dumb porn voices?
That's the only voice I do.
This is how you perceive people.
And so he got in, because what happens, another interesting wrinkle of this game is you call in these evacuation craft, right?
Yeah.
You know, you get in and once you get in, there's actually like a very tight countdown timer for the rest of your team to get in. So it's like it will hang around for a while, but if one of you gets on, then the rest have to get on straight away basically. And I was quite far away from this evacuation craft.
This unnamed friend got in and I think intentionally left me on the planet because his wife said, we've got to go out. And it created this weird thing where he pretended that wasn't why it happened. And I was like, well, that is why it happened.
And there's now a little bit of tension that he's unpicky around it, which is ridiculous.
Oh my god, that's so you.
Did you abandon me on that planet because your wife said we've got to go out now?
This is like, you need to take this on the shittest episode of Judge Judy ever. He left me to die on that planet because I think his wife wanted to go shopping.
But that's the sort of thing I think it does create. It's sort of like, it's just going to create those moments. But he was a bit like, oh, I didn't realize you were far away.
That's what he said. I was like, oh, well, come on, man. We know what's happened.
You just have to cop to it, then we can move on. But we haven't played games together for a few weeks now. And it's like, oh, I don't know.
Is there now something that needs to be resolved here? This is ridiculous.
What a classic Samuel Roberts move.
The other thing is that my friend Will, who I play with from Frontier, he is a fucking monster with dropping mines. So he will lay down loads of mines right near us and go, I was BB trapping the other way. So if people come that way, they'll get them.
But it's clearly to watch us all die. But he'll do this over and over again, irresponsible mine usage.
Mines are shit in that game. No one in their right mind uses those.
No. So every now and then there's a little bit of like, okay, we stepped on a mine. It felt intentional.
We've got to shoot Will in the head basically. So I just think it's so good at creating that. It's like a whole game of, yeah, like how I used to fuck around with other players in Halo 3.
And I think a lot of people who have played with Halo 3 with their friends will recognize that experience in it.
Do you just do it or do you make him come and like take his punishment? Because that's more sinister.
I just do it really. I'm not just like kneeled out. He hasn't got a crouch or whatever and I'm like, boom.
But yeah, so this game is so good at manifesting personalities within it. I think that's definitely part of its magic. Although I do like your experience of like IRL starship troopers, just sort of like...
I mean, they have personalities. They're just very abrasive, unpleasant personalities. And, you know, I can hear like their families in the room with them and stuff.
And it's a little bit like...
Yeah, OK. All right. So yeah, that's Helldivers 2, Matthew.
And a couple of things I want to discuss briefly as well. I meant to have played more Dragon's Dogma 2 this weekend, but I instead played Command and Conquer Remastered.
I saw what was happening on Twitter. I was like, shall I send him a sniffy message about this, reminding him of his duties to Dragon's Dogma? I thought, no, it's a long weekend.
Just let the man rest.
Yeah, I just needed to empty my brain, basically. But I was playing this... I got locked into this day-long Edge of Tomorrow-style situation where there's this mission, this one mission in Command and Conquer Red Alert Counter-Strike where essentially the Allies have created a MiG, one of the Soviets' aircraft, and it can drop nukes at will.
So every single bombing run it does, it can drop a nuclear weapon. And you know it's going to happen when you start on this map. You have a base.
But once you push outside of the boundaries of the base and its surrounding areas, it activates the MiG and it starts nuking the map just unceremoniously. And you can't work out which areas it's focused on or why it's doing what it's doing. So there's basically like three different bases, one of which does house where the MiG is, but part of it's figuring out where the base is.
And I would say for about two hours, my base was just getting absolutely rinsed by this MiG. And then it basically became this sort of frantic thing to go to one of these bases, steal an allied barracks, build their rocket soldiers, which are like some of the only units in the game that can shoot down aircraft, and then basically get the MiG stuck in this cycle where it would try and nuke the base I had stolen, but it couldn't because I had these rocket lads there. And that was happening on a constant cycle.
I had like 40 dudes with rocket launchers shooting down these frequently respawning MiGs. And then yeah, while I was attacking the other bases. But then sometimes it would randomly nuke its own base while I was invading, just to try and stop me.
Like the AI is absolute chaos. But I had such a good time doing this. And then coincidentally, my friend Andrew had started playing Red Alert.
And he got to this mission over the weekend and he was like sending me pictures from all of the different attempts he had to finish this one mission. And I was just having such a good time really. Red Alert is such a good time after all these years.
I think it's a slightly prompted Matthew by the fact that they put all of these, the older games onto Steam. And I think they've done it in a way where you can actually play them on Steam without it being like a massive faff. It's had some compatibility issues over the years, some of the better games in that series.
So this is back on my radar now, but this is very much alike. On Saturday, I had Chateau Briand. I had a rum and coke while playing Command and Conquer Remastered.
And I watched Late Night with the Devil. It was like one of the best Saturdays ever. It was so, so good.
So yeah, I had a good time there. Command and Conquer, not really on your radar. It feels like something you maybe played with your kid a little bit.
I think I pretended to like it to try and, you know, be cool with my friends who are really into it. But I came to an early understanding that I didn't have the brain for any kind of strategic games.
But yeah, I've been having a good time with that. I still hope they do like a second remaster at some point. That would be spot on.
But yeah, some of the missions in the expansion packs, Red Alert, just so, so good. So played a bit of that. Also wanted to mention Stellar Blade, a game that was not on my radar because the character designs are very cheesecakey.
It's a weird one in the sense that I think they've basically made, tried to make another version of Nier Automata, this developer called Shift Up, who I think are maybe composed of some people who made that MMO, Blade and Soul, which is sort of like Dynasty Warriors as an MMO. It's a bit like go around and clobber loads of guys basically. I think that's essentially what the vibe of that is.
I think this is like an A PS5. I couldn't tell if this is like a Sony endorsed PS5 exclusive or like just...
Yeah, yeah. It's published by Sony.
Yeah, okay. So that's why the character designs kind of surprised me a bit because it's, you know, they're not exactly Aloy, the character designs I would say. It's a bit like...
Sony can do both.
These are kind of like designs you would find without revealing too much about myself in the dark corners of the internet, I would say. The kind of like style of design, just very shiny. You see it, it's sort of like someone looked at the character designs in Nier Automata, didn't realize why those character designs were good or appealing and then made something sort of male gaze-y that lacks a bit of taste, I would say.
So I think that took the game off my radar. I was just like, well, I don't really... I'm not really bothered.
Then I started seeing notices saying that it was actually a pretty great action game. Like some positive write-ups of it. Down in the demo, it is very Nier Automata in a bunch of ways.
So it starts with all of these basically soldiers who are attractive women with swords dropping from the sky onto this planet. While this quite sad music with a woman wailing lyrics over the top of it plays, that's pure Nier Automata. That's basically the start of Nier Automata.
So you can see that that was a clear inspiration. I read a Game Informer piece on the game where one of the devs talked about how Nier was a big inspiration. They were completely open about that.
The action, though, is really good. And I think it works because it hasn't just ripped off one thing. It's got the sort of parrying of Sekiro.
It's got that, which is very popular these days, isn't it, as a mechanic. It's got, I would say, a little bit of the speed of a Devil May Cry or a Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. And it's got a little bit of a soulsy Zedlock and enemy positioning element to it.
Just how you behave and how you move is quite soulsy. And I think what it's found is something in the middle of all those. It is challenging, but it is fun.
I think it's actually going to be slightly better than I realized it would be. And now it's a bit more on my radar. I think it's as well.
Maybe it's because I've seen... Maybe it's because Bayonetta 3, for example, or Nier Automata are not quite that sort of mega hardcore version of that sort of genre. Bayonetta 3 is sometimes...
Bayonetta 3 has a lot of other weird stuff going on. You know, sort of mini games and asides and, you know.
Yeah, it's a weird one because when you look at the trailers and the character design, you think, oh, this is going to be a straight up Bayonetta or Devil May Cry style character action game. And the fact that it is more difficult and has that slightly soulsy lock on and the parrying and there's a bit more kind of precision to it. I wouldn't say what I played of it, it never, I didn't really sense any of that Devil May Cry or Bayonetta kind of attitude.
I felt like I had to be a bit more careful playing it. It has like some quick time finishes and stuff. It has a bit of the style of those games.
But the actual pace of it, I found, I was genuinely surprised. I was like, oh, okay. I really thought this was going to be a linear action game and it's, it is a, yeah, like Nier or Sekiro type thing.
That's my single observation. But the character design looks like the game should be a bit more fun and throw away than it, a bit more like, not fun is the wrong word, a bit more daft and frantic than it maybe is.
Empty calorie kind of game. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's what I thought too.
But it's actually got some real chops about it. I think they thought quite carefully about how the parry window is, is clearly like not as tight as Sekiro. But it's also not playing itself for you by any means.
It's like it's challenging enough. And then like completing the Nier thing, it has like lots of bad things happening to these women when they drop on the planet. I think actually all they would have to do is tweak the character designs and then I think this would be on the radars of people who are, I guess like, you know, I think it would just have that maybe slightly broader appeal if they'd have gone less down that route with the designs.
I'm sort of like slightly wary of it as well, those character designs becoming a bit of a battleground for certain types of people.
They already have. But the thing is because people, they grasp onto it and they're like, everyone's got a huge problem with this. And it's like, well, they might do, but they haven't really voiced it.
Like you're voicing this problem yourselves so that you can be outraged about it because you just want to remind everyone what a fucking nasty motherfucker you actually are. You know, like that's what these people are like. I've seen lots of eye rolls at it.
It's just...
I think people are quite willing to meet this game halfway on its actions, my take. And fair enough. I think they've made something that's not exactly like everything else.
It's quite a generous demo. So I definitely recommend downloading it. Give me a try.
I probably won't buy it at full price, but I'll definitely come back to it later in the year when it's a little bit, maybe it's like, I don't know, 30 quid, something like that. That would be sort of spot on. But just surprised because, yeah, wasn't expecting this to have the chops it does.
Obviously as well with this genre, you have certain people or developers who you associate with being like the kings of this genre, right? And so I don't really know. Shift up, they're a Korean developer.
Didn't know if they could necessarily, you know, get their first attempt. But I don't know, it feels, it makes a convincing case, I would say, this demo.
Yeah, it feels quite current, Jen, in a positive way. It feels quite shiny and expensive as well.
Yeah, it does. Like it's 60 FPS and just loads going on. And yeah, it's a very visually impressive thing.
But the character designs, it's sort of like on the visual side, it's where it just doesn't get to that platinum level of consistency and imagination, you know? But for a first attempt, not bad at all. And yeah, I'll definitely check it out.
It doesn't quite have the knowingness of Bayonetta, which is how Bayonetta gets away with some of its success.
Yeah, exactly. It's also that thing of like, it's quite hard to explain why the character designs in like near-autometer are good versus the character designs here. Like, you kind of know it when you see it.
You know there's a certain...
You're right.
The references they're using, because near-autometer designs are absolutely like, those are horny, horny-ass character designs for sure. But there's also, I guess, like the palette they're drawing from, the set of inspirations. There's like an art to it that there isn't to these character designs, and I think that really is the difference, you know?
And also, yeah, it gets in the way of what the game does well, arguably. And yeah, I don't know, it's got some real action cred about it. So, yeah.
Okay, Matthew, those are our games, so some meaty games chat there. Shall we take a quick break and come back with a brief selection of listener questions?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So we've got about seven or eight listener questions here we're gonna go through, and we haven't done a mailbag for a little while, so they've really built up. So some of these are a month behind.
Sorry about that, but I guess we've been busy on the podcast, question mark? Seems like we've got a penny going on. Okay, so Matthew, this is a really good one to kick off, I think, and it took a little bit of research, but I wanted to add it, because we got tweeted this, and I thought, well, that's a great question.
What are the three best months of PS Plus ever? That's from Matt Zier. I left a little Wiki link in our document, Matthew, so you could scour this without being a massive pain in the arse.
So do you want to go first with yours?
I kind of went down until I had three, which I thought were good.
Yeah, fair enough. I kind of did similar, to be honest.
May 2013 had Demon's Souls, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, that double bill, and Kingdoms of Amala, Kingdoms of Amala, less so. But the Demon's Souls, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus has got nice like drab visuals trio.
Yeah, that was one of my three as well. I had that for second. That was the second best of them all.
I'm just doing these in chronological order. July 2015, Rocket League.
That's my number one. Yeah.
There we go. We're on the same page. Rocket League, just because of the phenomenon of a PS Plus, kind of made that game by giving it that instant user base.
And it was a phenomenon game and continues to be a thing. So it's just, it is one of the success stories of PS Plus and you can't detach those things. The other games that month were like Rain and Geometry Wars 3, which are like fine.
The last one, and this, I don't know if this is right, but I quite liked the look of August 2015, which gave you Limbo, God of War Ascension, Sound Shapes and Stealth Inc. 2. God of War Ascension is a classic PS Plus game and it's the God of War you definitely wouldn't have bought.
So the idea of getting that and being able to just play it, that for me is where these services shine. You want the seven out of 10 first-party games on them. But there has to be something better than that.
I'm interested to hear your top three.
Yeah, I think that's some good choices there. Sound Shapes is a really good underrated game. Jessica Mack, one of the, I think actually quite underrated, indie developers and the course of the development of music-themed games, did Everyday Shooter and Sound Shapes.
Those are both rad games. So yeah, you actually got to mind there. I think there was like a point in 2011, or maybe it's 2012 actually, where I think Sony went weapons-free on getting people to sign up to PS Plus.
They had loads of games. I think they had LittleBigPlanet 2 and Infamous 2 and loads of stuff they added in a round E3 time to kind of goose it. But those felt like an anomaly months to me.
The months that have three to four games are kind of the normal ones. So yeah, number one, I had Rocket League as well. It was Rocket League, Rain and Sticks, Master of Shadows, which is definitely one of those sevens from what I've heard about it.
Sticks, the famous game that Isabel Hubert made in... What was that film?
L, was it? Yeah, yeah, so random.
The weirdest subplot of that game is that that film is secretly about how someone made Sticks.
So funny that. Yeah, so second I had, I'll let you say, I think Demon's Souls and Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. I mean, even if it's late in the PS3 generation, that's a mighty gift right there.
A third one I had, I had March 2016, which is Broforce, again, like a game that's perfect for PS Plus. I think it was a PS Plus launch game. Galaxy the Dimensional, which is this little space game thing, Super Stardust HD and The Last Guy, the latter of which are kind of like PS3, PSN game Hall of Famers.
The Last Guy could be the game that uses Google Maps to build levels.
Oh, you fucking love that. You're the only person in the world who remembers this game.
That's because Play Magazine in 2007-2008, man, it was bleak. It was bleak out there. We took whatever we could get.
That's your version of Let's Tap. It's the thing which people are like, what? You're like, yeah, or Let's Catch even better.
Yeah, exactly. It just, yeah, sort of like Weed Wreck that only you remember kind of vibes. Yeah.
Super Stardust HD was legit though. And Broforce is just perfect. I think as well, I just can't, you can't deny that Rocket League on PS Plus was just one of those moments in games.
It was just suddenly everywhere. And it was such a fun thing to be a part of as well. You know, it just, yeah.
I guess by that logic, like Fall Guys has got similar energy. That's a game, you know, anointed by PS Plus.
It does. Yeah. I like Fall Guys, but I think Rocket League was just, I think it just had a bit more meat on the bones, I guess.
And it's kind of perfect for the, it was a pandemic, wasn't it, when that dropped. And it was, and so I think it was a game that everyone just uses as distraction. I kind of get that, but I only played it probably two to three times.
I played it non-stop, so yeah, so that reigns supreme. Next question. This is a really quick one.
Is Samuel ever going to get around to Redhead Redemption 2? I don't think it will generate material for the pod, I just think he might like it.
I like that the listeners are thinking of whether or not something is good for the pod. As if that is the only thought that goes through our heads. I mean, maybe it is.
Yeah, the danger is it might be. So that's from GreyMS. So the answer is I do want to play this, but I have been, I think me and Matthew have become fiercely focused on that Game of the Year episode at the end of the year and making sure it's good.
And also feeding the what we've been playing episodes because that's become a more sustainable way to make the podcast. And also it allows us to just keep up with things. And it's just fun to talk about contemporary games, isn't it?
Because I think we are always conscious that the podcast is not just like a retro thing. It's very much like, you know, we are still interested and engaged by games. So, yeah, and so Red Dead falls into that bracket where it's massive and it's from a few years ago.
So I don't necessarily know where I would talk about it on the podcast.
So unless we did like a deep dive anniversary, like when did it come out?
I promise we've missed the fifth anniversary. That was last year. So it's actually six years this year.
The thing is, though, we are approaching a new Rockstar game in theory, probably a year plus from now, but it is coming. So, you know, there will be a chance to talk about this stuff again, I think. But, yeah, I want to get to it, but I don't see it happening at least before I've cleared FF7 Rebirth and Dragon's Dogma 2, and maybe even caught up with the Like A Dragon series.
So that's like a long way away. But I want to get back to it at some point. Matthew, do you want to read this next question?
Do you think there's life in the Matrix IP yet? I had this thought whilst gliding at breakneck speed through Spider-Man 2's New York City with the realisation that we now have the technology to do a Matrix game justice. And it doesn't have to be the terminally dour green tinted version we saw in the Epic Engine Matrix demo.
The Matrix has endless possibilities and I believe done right could become one of gaming's flagship franchises. That's from Melma.
I don't think there are enough good Matrix films for it to justify further expansion in the modern age, honestly.
Yeah, my appetite for the Matrix died with resurrections.
Yeah, that's the thing, I think it died already with revolutions and then resurrections kind of killed it again. Sort of like the moment to prove that Matrix was basically a really good action franchise with these 90s, noughties tech kind of aesthetic to it or whatever. That sort of was what it should have been and instead it was quite bad.
The reaction in it was quite bad and then the story in it was really bad and it looked very green screen-y, very poor. I don't really have the appetite for it now, but I did really like that epic engine demo. It did look incredibly next gen when the agents were jumping between the different cars.
That bit in particular looked incredible, but yeah, I don't think I have the appetite for this and neither do you, Matthew, so I think it's kind of done. It's not as evergreen as Star Wars or the like, you know?
It's done.
Yeah, it's done. Okay, has any game done something you hate so well you love it? Has a PlayStation Prestige game ever patted an ox so damn well Matthew has to enjoy it?
That's some Serrano. I struggled a bit with this one, Matthew, but I eventually went with the ladder in MGS3 because ladders are not good in games. Climbing them is always this case of, oh, I've got to wait ages now for this guy to get up this ladder, but the MGS3 one is a hall of fame ladder, so you've got to give it to it, but otherwise did struggle with this.
How about you?
Speaking to the ox patting, I quite liked the interactive story beats in Spider-Man 2. I quite enjoyed them. Going to the fairground and doing all the little fairground games, that was quite a good hang as ox patting goes.
It's a broad one. I don't want to say I hate all crafting or foraging games, but I've never been more into mining rocks than the rock shattering animation in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. When you hit those rocks and the kind of chink of the hammer on the rock and the little sparks and the little rolling bits of flint, that's again that made collecting a lot of raw things very, very satisfying to me.
So that probably counts.
That's a good one. Yeah, I think crafting systems in general, just when you like look at the ingredients you need to build like a table or something and it's like 300 wood and you have like 10 wood and just the way my heart sinks when I look at that kind of menu in a crafting game, I'm like, how is it that, you know, this is a system about infinite possibilities of what you can do and it's so like, oh, and we're not going to respect your time. So you have to go and do this thing for hours to do it.
I know how tables work. Tables have five bits of wood, they have a big wood on top and then four bits of wood, which are the legs. They do not need 300.
300, that is 294 pieces of wood too much.
Well, I may have been exaggerating to prove a point, Matthew. But nonetheless. Yeah, I just sort of like, I'm just like, we can build anything, but it's so restricted by, oh, but if you want to have anything, it'll take you ages and you have to like go and do all this and this and this.
I know that you're meant to feel like at the end, oh, this is really precious because they artificially inflated the weight for it, right?
Yeah, but then it was so arduous, was it even worth it? Because the mechanics involved in getting it were not fun. It was like, I was watching basically a bardic down while a man was like chopping some wood off of a tree.
I just, yeah, I don't know, that's so far from what I think is good. So far.
That's why you need Dragon's Dogma Pawns, picking all that shit for you. I've just seen a bush, I'll go and get that master and you're like, fucking yes, you do that right away.
Randy Newman's like, I know where there's some wood and then just runs off because he's already done it in your game.
I've worked some horrible drive-bys on a man I've had to drown ten times, Alec U. Jattman in The Prestige.
Who looks like Jeremy Peele for reasons unknown.
I've had to drown Jeremy Peele at least ten times.
What I liked about that was Jeremy was the one who identified it looked like him, he was sort of, he just said, and then when we were at pizza you were like, he does look like Jeremy, that's the thing and yeah, it's pretty funny. Okay, this one's from Drew 4 Phantoms. In this era, why are certain games, I am one of those forlorn Saturn people, well there's no helping you, sorry about that, still out of print.
Specifically ones that are considered key techs, I'd love to hear a deep dive with one of your emulation slash industry pals on the decision making process for resurrecting retro games. How abandoned licences factor into it, etc. Your Sega episode really brought this into view, specifically about Shining Force 3, lovely episode for Americans like me who are weird Sega kids.
So I think a lot of this comes down to can they make some money from it. When it comes to Saturn games specifically, I think my understanding is that these games are hard to emulate, and therefore that's why you didn't see a deluge of them on Xbox Live Arcade or whatever. So I think a lot of those things just haven't been touched since the Saturn era.
And I think they maybe noodled the idea of doing a Saturn mini or something like that. But yeah, there's definitely some games from the 90s that are kind of gone a little bit, because they're either tied up in licences or like we mentioned, or it's just not profitable enough to bring some of these back. Yeah, so I don't know.
I feel like at some point Sega is pretty good at getting its stuff onto modern platforms. So I feel like at some point they'll probably get some of these Saturn games more widely available somehow. That feels like it's quite likely to me.
But yeah, I think a lot of it is just about can we make some money from this? Hence why Nightdive is able to bring Blade Runner back, for example, because there is still a latent interest in Blade Runner. People will still buy it.
It's why the Sonic games are perpetually available, because people will always buy Sonic on new platforms. What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I'd agree with all that. When I read this, I read it far more literally as like, do you really expect them to still be printing physical copies of Saturn games? That's insane.
But that's obviously not what's being asked. So yes, that makes a lot more sense. You hope to one day see it folded into more stuff like your Switch Online gaming subscription or things like that seems to be the place for it.
It's weird. It's not something I lose sleep about particularly, because I'm just not that minded, like retro-minded. And I think so much of my time is spent trying to keep up with contemporary games.
But hopefully the thoughts of the retro-minded are more sympathetically represented by Samuel on this podcast.
That will do. That will do. That's a very diplomatic way of putting it, Matthew.
I think the other thing is you just can't underestimate how complicated it is when paperwork was signed in the 90s, not stored electronically, and then no one knows exactly what was said. So look at No One Lives Forever and the struggles to bring that back, or Discworld. I think Rhianna Pratchett was talking about that more recently, right, about how those games are, there's some kind of limbo situation with those that hasn't been unpicked.
I keep thinking about how it surely makes sense to just put the Dune games that were made, all the Dune games that exist on PC onto GOG, but you can't get those. And it's just, this stuff is just harder to unpick than you think, because, you know, just again, like the stuff was signed in the 90s, so...
Trying to get Eric Idle's people to sign off on being able to have Rincewind saying, that doesn't work. It's tough. It's tough.
How are you getting to do it?
It is tough out there. Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
Is there any game series or a genre you've been saying to yourself you wanted to try for a long time but still haven't?
If you could put yourself into any movie or game, what would it be? The only rule is it has to be you unchanged. That's from ImagerDrawer64.
Okay. Well, unfortunately, I didn't see this second question because I didn't read it properly, so I have no answer to that one. Let's just say Pride and Prejudice.
I'm cracking Ys in the background. That's all I've got off the top of my head. So game or series, though, I think Grand Strategy is a big one.
I feel like there's part of my brain that would probably quite like the idea of playing Hearts of Iron IV and trying to liberate Europe as the French or something. I think I've got that in me, but I just haven't had the time to put into that. I think a similar note as well.
Turtle War, I gave a go over the pandemic. I played Turtle War, Warhammer 2, honestly to apply for a job at Creative Assembly at the time. That was why I played it.
I quite enjoyed it, but I also thought it wasn't exactly my pace of game. It's such its own specific thing. It's not quite an RTS.
It's not quite.
I used to dread having to preview that shit. Not that shit. I used to dread having to preview that stuff for RPS because people would expect the person from the RPS to have some grounding in ground strategy or Total War games and instead they got me.
Yeah, it's always been the same as it is now as well. It's never changed that much in terms of the relationship between the two layers of the game. I think I'm resigned to the fact I'm more of an RTS guy or more of a straight up turn-based guy but not the in-between thing.
It's quite handy being in that position when the PR around these new games are like, it's the most accessible one yet. We finally built a 4X game that anyone can play and it's like, well, here I am to prove you wrong, my friend. So you have not succeeded.
I thought humanity might be the one, not humanity, humankind. They were like, oh, it's going to be ultra-accessible and Reader, it was not.
I think Civ is quite accessible though, don't you?
Even that is beyond, that's the level of buffoonery we're talking about.
I think the problem with Civ is, if they've layered on more systems over the years, it's become more complicated. I think if you'd have played it when Civ 2 came out, like I did, it would actually, you would have a grounding in how that works, to be able to play it and not be completely confused by it. But now I think when you come to it, it's just this, yeah, just basically like a absolute payload of menu options to choose from, very confusing.
So yeah, I think visual novels probably count here too. Phoenix Wright is still the only major one I've really played and it's a genre Matthew talks about a lot, but I've just not really put the time in. How about you, Matthew?
I'm quite content with the genres I like, to be honest. There are things which I'm kind of happy having other people pick out the best moments of them, like Steven with Eve last week and tell me about them. I don't, when I read that stuff, I'm not like, oh, I wanna be playing this and only this.
Maybe there are moments where there are game types, which I know that I fundamentally get on well with, you know, first person shooters, third person shooters, and I don't play any of these ongoing service games, you know, like all the mad shit that happens in Fortnite. Occasionally have pangs of, oh, I wish I could pass that better, or you talking about Apex Legends. I'm like, oh, I wish I had gotten into that and had an experience of that kind I could talk about, just because it's such a dominant form and I am a bit of an outsider to it, so I can only offer observations from afar.
It's none of it's particularly lived in, but there are so many fucking games and I feel like I'm on top of enough stuff that I don't feel too bad about it.
Yeah, I can keep on top of Apex precisely because it doesn't change that quickly, to be honest. It's sort of like they just add a new map every now and then or they'll remix an existing map and they'll add a baffling New York's Australian character with some ridiculous quips that I need to get my head around. But Fortnite is like, they've just transformed what the game is and oh, there's a neon city now, you can drop there and that changes so much and then you're fighting like, I'm using my free Alan Wake 2 skin and I'm being killed by Goku or whatever and I'm like, I don't understand any of this.
Yeah, you're in a party and there's like John Wick, Optimus Prime and Ian Beale from EastEnders and you're like, what the fuck is going on?
And on that note, we move on. Who would be your dream listener? In other words, if you could look at a list of everyone who listens to the pod, what name would make you the most excited?
That's a raspberry brain. What have you got Matthew? I imagine someone from the world of literature or something.
Higashino, do you wish you listened to a podcast?
No, because you'd probably be like, you don't understand my work at all. You'd feel a bit like that guy in Annie Hall. It would have to be someone who was a master of their craft and a craft that I respected.
So like, if I looked on the list and saw that like Steven Spielberg was getting all his game news from us, I'd be thrilled.
Like a real kind of a tastemaker sort of person.
I'd be like, well not a tastemaker, just that we were the tastemaker, Steven, that he was giving us like two hours of his week. Like the idea that the guy made Indiana Jones and Close Encounters also knew about Jeremy Peel law.
Yeah, so similar lines, I guess, but more, I guess a bit more modern. Alex Garland would be mine because, you know, he's someone who you know understands games, worked a little bit on DMC, I think, a tiny bit, and then worked loads on Enslaved, which actually kind of makes sense, I think, with the tallies, with the themes of his films a little bit. The sort of way tech is, tech as horror is kind of used in his films quite a lot.
So Alex Garland would be up there because he's just a super interesting guy. Everything he makes, I think people are quite engaged with, they're intrigued by, you know, I think he's just that kind of filmmaker, even when he misses. His misses are really interesting, definitely memorable.
So yeah, Alex Garland would be the one, I think.
That is a good one. I'm gonna tweak Spielberg and say, Ryan Johnson.
Oh, that's a good one, yeah.
Because he's a bit more hip. Also like the murder mystery stuff, he might sort of see that we vibe on that level as well. And we, you know, I feel like there's greater probability of me becoming friends with Ryan Johnson than there is Steven Spielberg.
Yeah, I don't think Alex Garland would like me. I think he'd find me quite irritating.
I think he'd find me a bit basey. He's quite smart.
Yeah, he is. And I sort of, I don't really have deep thoughts on things that aren't like good. Men 2022, yeah.
I sort of, yeah, I think like, I can sort of articulate myself about Godhand, but not many other things, you know? That's the thing with me. So yeah, okay, some good answers there.
Or at least acceptable answers. And yes. Which game has the worst name slash title?
Which game has the best name slash title? That's from Bob Bob. Got a few ones here, Matthew.
I struggle with this one.
I did like end up looking at VG247's list for this. And the only thing I've taken from that.
Just a list of good and bad names.
Well, it's just a list of bad names. And I don't think there's a worse one than Remothered Colon Tormented Fathers. That's like, that's incredible.
So one that Steve Burns alerted me two years ago is Violence Fight on PS1. That's just so dumb, a violence fight. And then the classic mobile suit Gundam, Gundam versus Gundam.
I mean, even if you account for the cultural differences there, you don't need Gundam three times in that name, bro. You can just dial that down a little bit. So there's the worst.
Best, I think most games have reasonable titles, I guess. I think that The Last of Us is a really good title for a game. Halo is a great title for a game.
Doom is a great title for a game. These all jump out, they're simple.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I think Simplicity that also tells you what the game is is good. What about you?
I guess one that isn't amazing is Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. Because I think you read that and go, you either think, there was that film called Paranormal, like a kids' film, and you think, oh, is it something to do with that? I probably wouldn't be interested in that.
Seven Mysteries of Honjo is kind of confusing. There's nothing there to say, this is going to be like a really kick-ass visual novel that you're really going to dig. So that's up there.
Maybe explain to me. I've seen on the Back Page Discord, there's a Back Page game club. Every month, they pick a game to play like a book club, and they'll play it and then chat about it.
Seems to be a lot of like psychodrama about what does and doesn't get picked. Lots of people volunteering a game and then clearly feeling a bit hurt when no one wants it to be the game. And I've seen Paranormal Sight.
It's definitely like once or twice people have tried to get that in there because they just want an excuse to kind of play it. And it never happens. It's never going to happen for Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, because of its name, I think.
I think the very specific way you pronounce it, the way you say Honjo, that just, I laugh every time because it's such a you game. And then you just have to read out this long ass name every time you talk about it. That combination of things is quite funny to me.
So that's not a great name for quite a good game. I think Hotel Dusk is a cool name. Like, it's quite evocative.
I'm like, oh, mysterious. I want to know what that is.
Yeah. You also, I guess, like on the worst front, we can't, Kingdom Hearts is the one that people always bring up, right? 358 over two days on DS.
That's like, that is ridiculous. Some of them are right. I think Chain of Memories is a good name for a Kingdom Hearts game, but that's pretty, says what it is.
Birth by Sleep, a little bit abstract there. I'm not sure that one works quite as well. I think Breath of the Wild is a great name.
Actually, Zelda subtitles are like all-timer good names. I think they all tell you about what they are, like Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, the combination of A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, just perfect, I think. And yeah, they always feel very evocative, very well chosen.
Anymore, Matthew?
No.
Okay, then we move on. Do you want to read this next one?
Yes. Dear lads of limited time and overwhelming benevolence, as the founding member of the Helldivers 2 Literature Club, I was wondering if there are any games that have gotten so under your skin you've done any daft things like read a book during a 30 minute server loading queue. Are you free from the curse of needing to play the latest Hotness, because there is so much great stuff out now, or has age simply cooled your ardour?
As an aside, remember someone on RPS years ago, Alec Meir maybe, saying he kept a book on his desk at all times to read during downtime and loading screens, even as our foremost literary enthusiast, I find that a bit much. Cheers for the pods, tongue firmly in cheek, Luke, aka Dynamic Calories from the Discord.
Okay, so for context, I got into it with Luke a little bit because he made a point of saying, I don't want to miscommunicate this, but made the point that this is the only game I'm interested in Helldivers 2, and therefore, I would rather wait for the service to work with a book than play something else. I think that's a fair representation of the point, mate.
Yeah, that's how I remember it going down.
Yeah, and I was a bit like, and it was quite a lengthy paragraph about this, and I think it was the grandstanding element of saying that that got under my skin, and so I got into it and being like, I think that's ridiculous, and I was always a bit wary of the new hotness with multiplayer things, because this happened on PC Gamer where someone would be like, I've got this new thing, I'm playing this new thing right now, it's the new thing, I've been playing it all weekend, and the next week it'll be something else. And I'm a bit like, well, if these things are super good, they will stick around. Helldivers 2 has stuck around, as mentioned, I waited until the server stuff had sort of dissipated before I played it.
But I have done this before. I had a book, I was watching, I watched all of Iron Fist, season one, which is terrible, by the way, in between loading screens for GTA Online when I was writing about that for PC Gamer, and I watched genuinely that entire season while I was waiting for the basically GTA Online version of Monkey Target to load. That was sort of what I would do, I would watch that.
But now, loading screens have pretty much disappeared, haven't they, Matthew? And it's actually wonderful. Like, you put on your Xbox Series X or PS5, and then you're taking into your game in seconds.
And I don't miss loading screens at all. Not one bit. What about you, how do you feel about this?
Likewise, it's just been so long since I've had to do anything like this. I've never had a book, that's what phones were for. If I'm doing more tweeting, it means I'm either on a train or I was playing a game with lots of loading screens.
The last thing that got under my skin that I was doing daft things was playing like Vampire Survivor on PC during a period where I was working from home. The fact that you could have it in like a window on your PC desktop so you could sort of feasibly be in meetings or be doing work, but also be playing Vampire Survivor because it was so low effort in terms of controls. I guess that's a thing where an obsession led me to somehow dual wield Vampire Survivors and work, which was probably appropriate.
It probably is, but that kind of makes sense. Side note to that, Matthew, something really funny happened recently because I'm about halfway through. I've been quietly playing Castlevania's Symphony of the Night in the background.
Yeah. While we're recording this podcast?
No, no, no, no. I mean like of my life basically. And it's really funny to reverse engineer Symphony of the Night when you've played Vampire Survivors first.
Right.
It's like you're seeing so much of that iconography, but in its proper context. And here it's like the kind of like fan art. It's like by, it's by artists who worked on Destiny eventually, wasn't it?
I think like the tech, the pack this was taken from. It's just so funny to see like, oh, it's the very similar kind of sprites, all these power ups and stuff like that to what I'm used to from Vampire Survivors. So I'm playing in this masterpiece PS1 game.
Pretty, pretty funny, but I think that makes sense. It's like you only need to move one, one stick to play that game, so I think that's appropriate, Matthew. Okay, good.
I'd be furious if anyone in one of my meetings was secretly playing games, but you know.
Yeah, exactly. I have known it to happen, though, I will say, without telling on anyone. Okay, so this next one then is from Reg McFly.
Dear large men, a hypothetical for you. You are going to become solvent for life. You will never have to work another day ever again.
The price, you must spend 24 hours with Chadley from FF7 Remake and Rebirth. How do you manage this? Do you take shifts?
Where do you take him for lunch? Please assume Chadley is on it, capital letters, for all 24 hours. Okay, so Matthew, I don't think we talked about Chadley on the FF7 episode.
Where are you at with Chadley?
I think this person greatly overestimates how irritating I find Chadley. He's just an NPC. Like, if you're gonna, I'm gonna be solvent for life.
I can think of a thousand people I'd rather spend that time with than Chadley.
Oh yeah. Do you know how good this podcast would be if I was solvent for life? I'd be like, every two weeks there'd be like a ranking of a different series because I've just been playing that non-stop.
Oh my god, that'd be a drip. Just because I'd spend 24 hours with a guy who just talks a bit about material. It is really overstated how annoying Chadley is.
He's just a weird bloke. Like he's naff in that he's not an original Final Fantasy 7 character.
Yeah, he's a floppy appendage.
It's not like he's that present in your life, is he?
He looks like Hope from FF13. That's what I found distracting. He reminds me of that guy.
I just think also if you are a fan of Final Fantasy, you've had to put up with so many die-cats. You're not necessarily a fan of a thing which doesn't make this mistake a lot. This is not the first character like this or the first huge miss in Final Fantasy.
That said, it is interesting that with the folio system, they decided not to put that in the form of a character like they did with Chadley. Instead, it's just like a machine you interact with at save points. So, Chadley could have just been a machine.
You know what I mean? Like a non-
Yeah, but then every time you get to a rest bench, there'd be a bench, a potions machine, a folio machine and a Chadley machine.
It's like going to a swimming pool.
There's just too many machines. Because the funny thing in that game is when you're in locations where they shouldn't be machines, they sometimes reskin them. So when you're in an ancient temple, there'll be an old stone bench and like stone vending machines.
And they haven't quite sort of squared that.
Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, so I think I could put up with Chadley for 24 hours.
Yeah, I mean.
I've spent 24 hours with way more annoying people. Do you know what I mean? Like it's my family, do you know what I mean?
To be solvent, I don't think I'll understand. To be solvent for life, there's not much I wouldn't do.
You'd spend a year with Chadley if you had to.
I would honestly, if someone was like a year of your life doing anything, like we'll just put you in an isolation cell for a year, but you'll be solvent for us. You'll be like, yeah, absolutely fine. That's a worthwhile price to pay.
The podcast would suffer. You'd have to like monologue it for 52 weeks. And when I came back, I think there'd be some tension because you had to carry the podcast for a whole year.
And I think you'd be annoyed that I was solvent.
Yeah, I'd insist that I get more of the Patreon funds, I think, if that did happen.
And I'd be like, well, I'm still doing half the work, half the podcast. And you'd be like, yeah, but you don't really need it. And it would become a whole thing.
Yeah, and I had to like basically just put on pause while I played like Gears of War or something for a year, just to rack up some more takes, the Dragon Age series, you know, so I can build up to that episode. Yeah, it would create some tension, but I think that's a good sort of good depiction of how that scenario will play out, Matthew. So we come to our final question.
Do you want to read this one out?
Hi both, just read a Dominic Diamond article where he pitches an alternative universe game sequel to The Last of Us when, spoiler I guess, Joel lets Ellie die instead of him saving her in the original. Which game would you like an alternative universe sequel to when you play what happens after the first game, but that game had a different outcome to the original? That was hard to explain.
Cheers for all you do, Bob Bob. I'm going to say in advance, I wish I'd prepped a good answer for this.
Yeah, I sort of struggle with this one a little bit. It's a very precise ask. So what I came up with was what if like Mass Effect 4 was set in a universe where the Reapers just destroyed all life, but you were like the last remnants of like one pocket of humanity.
You were like, we're going to build back up and then fuck the Reapers up. And that was the whole premise of the game. That was kind of like, that was the one that sort of came to mind is like, what if it started with you on earth, watching earth just on fire, being completely ravaged by the Reapers?
Like would that be a good sort of in point to it? And it was like this sort of like, unlikely revenge story, this sort of dirty dozen thing where it's like there's not, it's kind of like the suicide mission, I guess, but the stakes are, you know, but it's basically about revenge more than about saving humanity. So that kind of came to mind.
I don't know. I'm not sort of, I'm not sort of much of a what if guy really. I sort of, I didn't watch that Marvel show, What If, for example.
I'm so not into what if scenarios. I didn't even watch the show that was called What If, out of principle.
Yeah, I don't know. Oh, here's a good one though. What if, I think like if, if like they did Jedi Survivor, but Cal turned to the dark side, that might be fun, you know?
That's sort of like, that's sort of like whole, that's Jedi games tend to be where you find like the, them experimenting with the dark side stuff, like what happens in Jedi Knight if he turned to the dark side or the other, the other Jedi Knight games. So it might be quite cool. I actually thought they might have done the second Jedi game as a Sith game, because I think that would have been really appealing if it was like, you know, the Sith survivor, that sounds silly, but you know what I mean?
Like something like that where Cal is a little bit, he is darker and is basically killing Rebel Alliance people. I think that could be quite, quite cool. Quite bleak, but quite cool.
Any, anything come to mind for you Matthew?
No, but I feel like, I feel like you've done this question more justice and, you know, sorry Bob Bob, I apologize. The Last of Us is such a, like, unique case. You know, the whole kind of, you know, the what if, or the decision at the end just dominated the conversation so much because it probably is one of the more interesting examples of that kind of thing.
Like I'm genuinely struggling to think of games which, where there has been that kind of big possible branch at the end, but games are quite good at wrapping themselves up. The Master Fate one is good, that is.
Yeah, I was just trying to think of like games where there is that sort of like ambiguity. I was trying to think of like, could you deal with the Bioshock games? But again, they're like, you know, the original Bioshock has those two outcomes essentially from whether you harvest the little sisters or free them.
But Bioshock Infinite is all about all the different possibilities that could play out based on the actions of the characters and the fact that the characters are doomed somewhat by their nature. That's kind of what Bioshock Infinite is about in some ways. I think we got some good answers there.
I also don't think that The Last of Us 2 would be better if Ellie died at the end of the first one. Like it would be, you know, like, I guess it would be, would Joel go after like the surgeon, therefore Abby's dad? I don't really know.
I think like The Last of Us 2's pitch is actually one of the all-time great what-ifs in a way, because it's like, we're going to, spoiler alert, kill our main character, and you are essentially getting revenge for that character in some way. It is like a what-if pitch, isn't it, as the sequel to a game. So yeah, yeah, I think that kind of answers that one.
And now I'm just waffling on. The podcast is done, Matthew.
Yeah, that's good. That was a good last question. Good batch of questions, that.
Yeah, I was quite selective. I skipped the one that was about what was your best school dinner from Angry Curt. Sorry about that, Curt.
I didn't really have it. Pizza and chips? I don't know.
I wish I'd spent more time prepping answers instead. I watched that three hour Steve Martin documentary last night.
Three hours? What the fuck happens across that?
It's in two parts. It's two separate films. One's about his stand-up career and it's called Then.
And then there's one called Now, which follows him as he is now looking back on it.
I just don't think that a Steve Martin documentary should be longer than Seven Days in Mariapol. Do you know what I mean? I know that quite works, but...
Yeah, but there was a lot of banter with Martin Short, which Seven Days in Mariapol I don't think has that.
No, it's definitely not the same sort of vibe. And it's also Twenty Days in Mariapol. That would be a short to film Seven Days.
Apologies to them.
Yeah. So, okay, interesting. I kind of want to see that.
I think as well, have you seen that people have been re-litigating Dennis Penis asking Steve Martin why he's not funny anymore? Is that part of the documentary, Matthew? Do they go into that?
They show the clip. I actually read there was an interview with Steve Martin in The Guardian where they asked him about that. And the interviewer said in the year since, Paul Kay, who plays Dennis Penis, has said he kind of regrets it.
Like, knowing what he knows about fame and the ups and downs of it. It was a shitty question and he wished he hadn't asked it. And Steve Martin kind of just laughed it off in the interview.
And he thought it was funny that it kind of plagued him a little bit in the way that he had plagued him when he was asked it.
Yeah, okay, that's fair enough. Okay, good. Well, on that Steve Martin related note, the podcast ends.
So, podcast is Back Page Pod, if you'd like to, you know, tweet us, I guess. I don't know why brain just completely fell out of the bottom there. That's a long weekend of rum, cheeseburgers and command and conquer.
You've got too much Chateaubriand in you.
Yeah, exactly. Actually, what I can do, Matthew, while we're at the start of the month is tell people what's coming up this month, because I don't think I even did that last month, tell people what's going on. So that's good work by me, isn't it?
But yeah, so you are listening to obviously to what we've been playing. We have next week, the best games of 2003. We have for the Excel episode this month, all game of the year lists revisited.
We're going to talk about our picks from some of the best games of 2006, kind of like pods we did about three years ago to talk about those lists, inspired a bit by Matthew reevaluating Hitman Blood Money a tiny bit on that episode. And so we thought it would be fun to talk about that, some of our picks, see if we were right, see if we were wrong. Maybe that will be a bust for an episode, I don't know.
Gamescourt, which was delayed from last month, April 19th, you've got that to look forward to if you enjoy our bullshit lore, etc. We have a guest from IGN, a kind of a friend of the pod sort of person coming on for April 27th. April 29th, our XXL episode is Two Giant Men Watch Shogun, the show that's on Disney Plus slash Hulu, one of the TV highlights of the year so far.
We thought that might be fun. Last month we talked about Dune, so patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to get the XXL and XXL episodes. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I'm MrBazzill underscore pesto on Twitter and MrBazzillpesto no underscore on Bluesky.
I'm Samuel Gubbie Roberts on all those things and we'll be back next week. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
